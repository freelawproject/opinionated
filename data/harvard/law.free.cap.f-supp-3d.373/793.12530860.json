It is against this standard the Court reviews the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff, Richard Escalera (\"Escalera\"), filed a race and national origin discrimination action pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Kentucky Civil Rights Act against Bard Medical. Escalera was employed by Bard Medical from December 1, 2008 until November 2, 2015. Escalera is Hispanic, of Mexican descent, and dark-skinned. Bard Medical terminated Escalera on November 2, 2015, for alleged poor sales performance after issuance of a performance improvement plan (\"PIP\"). At the time of his termination, Escalera was employed as a Senior Specialist in the Interventional Urology Division (\"IVU\") and was the only member of the team who was not white.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Escalera began working for Bard Medical's Statlock Division in December 2008 as a territory manager. In January 2010, he was awarded \"Rookie of the Year\" for his 2009 performance. In 2010, Escalera was identified as a candidate for promotion to field sales trainer and finished 13th out of 49 territory managers in his division. His 2010 performance evaluation reflected that he exhibited a \"strong desire to succeed and can be relied upon to get the job done no matter the situation.\" (DN 62, Exhibit 10.) In 2011, Escalera finished 10th in sales out of 49 territory managers. His 2011 performance review indicated that he had been \"successful in bringing new life in a territory that had not seen this activity in many years.\" (Smith Dep. Ex. 24.) In both his 2010 and 2011 performance evaluations, his manager rated him \"Meets/Exceeds\" expectations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December 2011, Bard Medical sold the Statlock Division, and Escalera accepted a job with the Interventional Urology Division (\"IVU\") of Bard Medical which\n   required him to work a new territory and sell completely different products in 2012. The record reflects that Escalera's new territory had been vacant for six months and had \"hemorrhaged\" market share. (Smith Dep. Ex. 25; DN 63-6 at 14-15.) At the end of 2012, Brad Smith became Escalera's district manager. In the 2012 sales year, Escalera was ranked 24 out of 25 territory managers in his division and rated himself overall \"Needs Improvement\" on his 2012 Self-Assessment. While Escalera received an overall \"Meets/Exceeds Expectations\" in his performance evaluation, Smith identified several areas that \"needs improvement\" including the categories of Results Orientation, Innovation, Internal Collaboration, Perseverance, and Persuasiveness and Sales Ability. Additionally, Smith provided feedback regarding Escalera's performance noting that his \"results in 2012 came up short\" and the \"strategy executed during that time frame did not yield results and this will have to change.\" (Escalera Dep. Ex. 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Escalera testified that during his first meeting with Smith in 2013, Smith was combative with Escalera and attempted to convince Escalera to quit his position. In March of 2013, Smith sent a field visit letter to Escalera, copying Escalera's supervisors, reporting on Smith's visit with him and allegedly including inaccurate information that placed Escalera in a bad light. (Escalera Dep. Ex. 22.) Additionally, Escalera testified that while at a district sales meeting in Houston, Texas, Escalera asked Smith whether Smith lived in Houston. Smith responded that he did not because it was being taken over by Mexicans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In October 2013, Smith prepared a personal review of his territory managers. Escalera maintains that despite having better numbers than a white territory manager Austin Ewing, who was rated by Smith as having \"upside potential,\" and despite Escalera being ranked seventh overall in sales at that time, Smith rated Escalera as having \"very limited potential upside.\" (DN 63-14 and DN 63-15, Escalera Dep. Exs. 15 and 16.) At the end of 2013, Escalera ranked fifth out of a total of 26 sales representatives and first in his district. In his performance review, Smith stated that Escalera had a \"tremendous year in 2013, exceeding quota in stents and EndoBeam.\" Smith further stated that he did not \"know if there is a person in the region that worked as hard as Richard did in 2013\" and classified his overall performance rating as \"Meet/Exceeds Expectations.\" (DN 59, Escalera Dep. Exhibit 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2014, Escalera finished the year $ 112,804 below quota in stone disease and $ 70,100 below quota in the emphasis categories. (Escalera Dep. Ex. 29.) He ranked 11th out of a total of 23 sales representatives. Escalera's 2014 performance review assessed him overall \"Meets/Exceeds Expectations\" and stated that Escalera \"works well with all members of the team.\" (Escalera Dep. Ex. 29). However, the performance review indicated that he needed improvement in two of his three \"Annual Individual Goals\" of Quota Performance and Territory Growth, as well as Innovation, Technical/Professional Competence, and Problem Solving. Smith provided the following feedback:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Coming off of a Top Performance in 2013, Richard will be the first to tell you he is not happy with his results in 2014. Significant drops in stent/balloon business from his top 3 accounts hindered him from the start in 2015 [sic]. Richard was also set back with two stent losses but he refused to throw in the towel. Richard was able to maintain his laser fiber number coming within $ 7500 from quota in spite of the massive loss of business from the Lifeline Medical situation. Richard was able to put together\n   several wins in the last half of the year which will propel him forward in 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Richard's sales funnel has the tendency to run thin at times. I believe this is the byproduct of the laser focus he puts on accounts to push them through to closure. The issue this causes is problems with his cadence as he has gone months between conversions. Richard is talented enough now to run multiple initiatives in different phases of the sales cycle and push them all forward so when one closes the next is in queue to close. I would like to see him close an account every 30 days as I believe he has the talent and market to allow this to happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the performance review, Smith also noted that \"[d]emonstrating [his ability to navigate through and drive complicated sales processes] and delivering quota will be keys to Richard returning to the stage in 2015. I have full confidence in him and his ability to accomplish both of these.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In explaining his 2014 performance, Escalera represents that while he was 107% to quota in sales in the first quarter of the year, he began to lose significant business from his largest customer, Maury Regional Medical Center, as a result of issues it was having with Bard Medical's laser fibers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Between October 2014 and January of 2015, Bard Medical released two new wires, the Solo Plus and Solo Flex, and a new basket, the Skylite basket, onto the market. However, due to production and design issues, the Solo Plus and Solo Flex wires were temporarily placed on a production hold in April 2015 and were not available to the territory managers to use or sale to their customers. At that time, Bard Medical made the decision to permit clients that were previously using the Skylite basket without incident prior to the production hold to continue to use and purchase the basket during the production hold. However, clients that were not existing users of the Skylite basket before the production hold or had had issues with the product were not permitted to use or purchase the Skylite basket during the production hold and were required to wait until a new model of the basket came out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the end of May 2015, Escalera was $ 124,446 below base in Core IVU and ranked 22nd out of 23 territory managers - ahead of a single territory manager who had been with the company for less than two months. (Escalera Dep. Ex. 35.) Escalera was also the subject of a customer complaint in March 2015 for improperly placing a Bard Medical product on a King's Daughters' Hospital operating room shelf in violation of the customer's acquisition procedures which resulted in the ban of Escalera from that operating room for six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In explaining his 2015 performance, Escalera contends that his sales performance was impacted significantly because Maury Regional Medical Center, Escalera's largest customer, decided to evaluate products produced by Bard Medical's competitor, Boston Scientific. Records reflect that the trial and the related loss of business was driven by either price or a supply chain agreement between Boston Scientific and Maury. (Smith Dep. Ex. 64, 68.) Escalera suggests that nothing in the record reflects that the loss of business was Escalera's fault. In early 2015, Escalera ranked seventh in the sale of one of Bard Medical's new products, the Skylite baskets. However, because of the product issues, two evaluations with Pikeville Medical Center and Owensboro Health did not occur in March of 2015 as planned. Instead, Pikeville Medical Center evaluated the products in July of 2015 and Owensboro Health did not evaluate the products at all. Additionally, Escalera represents that he lost significant business from Lifeline due\n   to the failure of Bard Medical corporate and Lifeline to reach an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 21, 2015, Smith's boss, Sandy Thompson, the Director of Sales for the entire IVU Division, emailed Smith about Escalera noting that his numbers were significantly below quota for the quarter. Within three weeks of receiving Thompson's email, Smith drafted a performance improvement plan (\"PIP\") for review by Bard Medical's human resource department. On June 30, 2015, Bard Medical placed Escalera on the PIP. The PIP showed Escalera below base through the end of May 2015 by approximately $ 79,000. (Escalera Dep. at Exs. 10, 15.) Escalera contends that the PIP is based on Escalera's 2015 performance alone; Bard Medical represents that the 2015 sales were just one factor in its issuance of a PIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The 60-day PIP required Escalera to achieve three sales-focused requirements: (1) achieve 100% year to date territory base IVU sales within 60 days; (2) \"within 30 days you will have\" completed a successful CORE IVU paid evaluation with all clinicians and material managers for a conversion of at least $ 85,000 in business; and (3) have no further losses to core business. (Smith Dep. Ex. 70.) The PIP indicated that Escalera's failure to demonstrate significant improvement could lead to immediate termination of his employment. The PIP was signed by Brad Smith and copies sent to Vice President of Sales Rob Hanson, Director of IVU Sales Sandy Thompson, and Human Resource Senior Manager Cindy Wilder. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) From January through August 2015, the results reflected that Escalera was still at the bottom of the rankings with a total average loss in Core IVU sales of $ 156,766. (Ottley Dep. Ex. E at 46-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 16, 2015, Bard Medical placed Escalera on a PIP extension requiring him to achieve 100% year to date quota in territory core IVU sales within the next 30 days or risk being immediately terminated. Escalera testified that at the PIP extension meeting, Smith told Escalera to look for a new job. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smith Dep. Ex. 76.) At his deposition, Escalera acknowledged that he could not attain the result requested and communicated to Smith that he would start looking for another job. (Escalera Dep. at 228-229.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bard Medical terminated Escalera on November 2, 2015, for poor sales performance. During the period beginning January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2015, Escalera was the only Hispanic/Latino employee to work in the IVU Division. Within a few months, Bard Medical replaced Escalera with Jason Miller, a white employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Escalera claims that he was terminated due to discrimination on the basis of race and national origin. Specifically, Escalera alleges that he was replaced by a white male and that Bard Medical treated him differently from similarly situated white employees because of his national origin and race. Furthermore, Plaintiff contends that Defendant used Escalera's PIP performance as a pretext for firing him when the decisionmakers knew that his sales numbers were a direct result of the company's withdrawn products and medical devices. Bard Medical now moves for summary judgment on all of Escalera's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Bard Medical argues that summary judgment on Escalera's claim of race discrimination under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), and the Kentucky Civil Rights Act (\"KCRA\"), KRS \u00a7 344.010, should be granted because Escalera failed to state a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case and failed to show that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his termination was a pretext for unlawful discrimination. Courts interpret\n   Title VII and the KCRA using the same standards.\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Leggett Wire Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11207610\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/752/#p758\">\n    220 F.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758 (6th Cir. 2000) (\"Because Ky. Rev. St. Chapter 344 mirrors Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), we use the federal standards for evaluating race discrimination claims.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Prima Facie\n    </em>\n    Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Bard Medical first argues that Escalera failed to make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination under Title VII. Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer \"to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to ... compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). Where, as here, a plaintiff offers only indirect evidence of discrimination, he may establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case under Title VII by showing: \"1) he is a member of a protected class; 2) was qualified for the job; 3) he suffered an adverse employment decision; and 4) was replaced by a person outside the protected class or treated differently than similarly situated non-protected employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Newman v.

This means that in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must show that there is a triable issue of fact upon which a jury could reasonably find that more likely than not the employer's reason is a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Manzer v.

However, Bard Medical argues that Escalera cannot prove the first element of his\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case - that he is a member of a protected group. Bard Medical maintains that Escalera testified that he considered himself to be white and that he identifies himself as such on government documents. (Escalera Dep. at 28-29.) Additionally, Bard Medical asserts that Escalera's sole claim in his EEOC charge is that between June 30 and November 2, 2015, he was discriminated against based on his race. As such, Bard Medical argues that he cannot now proceed on any other basis, including national origin or color discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Ang v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542259\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/932/540/#p546\">\n    932 F.2d 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 546 (6th Cir. 1991), overruled on other grounds,\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/\">\n    546 U.S. 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Bard Medical contends that Escalera could not be discriminated against based on his \"Mexican descent\" because \"Mexican\" is not a race. Finally, Bard Medical maintains that to the extent Escalera intends to salvage his claims by relying on his Mexican national origin or his skin color, such attempt fails because he did not exhaust his administrative remedies by filing such charges with the EEOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, despite Bard Medical's argument to the contrary, Escalera is a member of a protected class, being Hispanic, Mexican-American, and dark-skinned. Bard Medical misrepresents Escalera's testimony regarding whether he considered himself white.

Escalera puts forth four potential comparators that he asserts had similar base losses in core endourology: Eric Kunzinger,\n   Dan Santoro, Trevor Peters, and Eric Martin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Escalera acknowledges that for six months between January 1 to June 30, 2015 he was $ 124,425.95 below base in core endourology and placed on a PIP. Escalera represents that from April 1 to September 30, 2015, Eric Kunzinger was $ 151,851.89 below base; from August 1 to December 31, 2015, Dan Santoro was $ 126,557.17 below base; from June 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, Trevor Peters was $ 122,866.29 below base; and from July 1 to December 31, 2015, Eric Martin was $ 199,904.97 below base. (Plaintiff's Response at \u00b6 28.) McGregor Ottley, Bard Medical corporate representative, also confirmed that these team managers from the IVU Division were not placed on a PIP in 2015, notwithstanding the fact their sales were below base sales at various times during the year. (Ottley Dep. 37, 50, 60, 64, 65.) Ottley testified that both Kunzinger and Santoro were promoted in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Escalera contends that despite deficiencies in these team managers' sales performances, Bard Medical attributed their losses to Solo/Skylite production problems. For example, Ottley testified that Santoro's 2015 performance review indicated that the \"Solo wire and Skylite basket sales halt limited his ability [to] fend off\" competitors in his base accounts. (Ottley Dep. at 61, Ex. 15.) Similarly, Kunzinger's 2015 performance review noted that his numbers \"certainly were not a reflection of his activities, efforts and/or strategies, and were more clearly a function of the negative impact associated with the performance and ultimately supply issues with SOLO and SKYLITE.\" (Ottley Dep Ex. 2.) Peters' 2015 performance review states that he \"like many in the sales force, was swept into the malaise of the Solo/Skylite sales halt early in 2015.\" (Ottley Dep. Ex. 13.) Ottley testified that this was a \"time frame where [the TMs] weren't able to sell certain products\" and that it \"did have an impact on the sales force during that time frame.\" (Ottley Dep. at 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   However, a review of the \"over base level\" numbers of the four comparators and Escalera in core endourology reflects significant differences in the severity of losses between the comparators and Escalera during the January through June 2015 time period. Escalera's utilization of different time periods for each comparator within 2015 is not appropriate when examining the team managers' performances given Bard Medical's Solo/Skylite production products. Using the same time frame for each comparator, the record reflects that between January through June of 2015, Kunzinger was $ 55,626.89 below base, Santoro was $ 160,651.77\n   <em>\n    above\n   </em>\n   base, Peters was $ 20,070.56\n   <em>\n    above\n   </em>\n   base, and Martin was $ 79,932.38\n   <em>\n    above\n   </em>\n   base. (Ottley Dep. Exs. 3, 12, 14, 16.) These numbers demonstrate that the \"losses\" experienced by the comparators during the same time period as Escalera are not substantially identical. Escalera's loss of base was $ 68,799.06 more than the closest comparator he identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Additionally, comparing the \"over base level\" numbers of the comparators and Escalera between January through October 2015 reflects that at the time Escalera was terminated he had suffered significantly more loss over base than his identified comparators: Escalera was\n   $ 174,792.44 below base, Kunzinger was $ 101,132.60 below base,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Santoro was $ 110,078.73\n   <em>\n    above\n   </em>\n   base, Peters was $ 31,876.80 below base, and Martin was $ 1,611.79 below base. Because of these significant differences in losses, no reasonable jury could find that these four comparators and Escalera are similarly situated in all relevant respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The record further reflects that both Trevor Peters and Eric Martin began to experience monthly losses toward the end of 2015. Ottley testified that given their end of the year sales performances, both Peters and Martin were warned by their district managers that they would be placed on a PIP if their sales numbers did not improve in 2016. (Ottley Dep. at 83.) Both Peters and Martin resigned in 2016 prior to be placed on a PIP. Just as with Escalera, these team members' sales performances were identified by management as \"needs improvement\" and were counseled that if their numbers did not improve a performance improvement plan would be implemented. The differences in these team managers and Escalera are the timing of their losses in 2015 and the fact that these employees resigned in 2016 before being placed on a PIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, Escalera complains that despite Kunzinger's poor sales performance for 2015, he was promoted to district manager, while Escalera was terminated. The Court previously determined that Kunzinger is not a proper comparator based on his 2015 performance record. Notwithstanding, when examining Bard Medical's promotion of Kunzinger, the Court must examine Kunzinger's work and performance history with the company. Ottley testified that Kunzinger was promoted based on the entirety of his career with Bard, notwithstanding his 2015 performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) As the record reflects, during Kunzinger's six years as a territory manager, Kunzinger achieved net aggregate sales exceeding quota of approximately $ 1,000,000. He finished first, third, and fifth in sales in 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively and won 2012 Territory Manager of the Year, joined Bard Leadership Development Program as a National Field Sales Trainer, and became a President's Club Award Winner. Kunzinger's performance history with Bard Medical is not comparable to that of Escalera for purposes of promotion to district manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that the four comparators and Escalera, as evidenced by their respective performances, can be differentiated clearly. Consequently, these team managers are not similarly-situated to Escalera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Bard Medical Aware that Majority of Losses Beyond Escalera's control.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Escalera argues that even assuming that a review of Escalera's 2015 sales numbers were a reason to discipline him, Bard Medical was well aware that a super-majority of Escalera's sales losses in 2015 were beyond his control. Escalera maintains that the documents produced by Bard Medical show that he was approximately $ 124,000 below base at the time he was put on his PIP. Of that amount, Escalera claims $ 36,000 is attributable to a loss of business with Lifeline as a \"result of Lifeline's business model.\" (Response at 28.) Escalera maintains that approximately $ 58,500 was a result of Escalera's largest customer, Maury, switching to a competitor based on price or a supply chain agreement. Escalera maintains that, at most, he was responsible for a loss of base of only $ 30,000. Escalera argues that because Bard Medical knew that issues with the\n   new products precluded sales of other products that would permit Escalera to regain his loss of base, Bard Medical's discipline of Escalera, including termination, was not reasonably informed or considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Escalera cannot avoid summary judgment merely by disagreeing with Bard Medical's business decision to terminate him for poor performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seeger v.

(Escalera Dep. at 80.) Further, Escalera argues that Bard Medical fails to present Escalera's pre-2015 performance in a fair light given the applicable summary judgment standard.
