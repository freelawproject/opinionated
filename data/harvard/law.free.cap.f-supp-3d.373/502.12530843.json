Demopoulos. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 47.) Dr. Demopoulos was a medical researcher who was exploring glutathione, an antioxidant used to treat diabetes and other serious diseases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Dr. Demopoulos operated various businesses devoted to the research of glutathione and to the development of glutathione into pharmaceutical commerce. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of those businesses, founded on July 28, 1981, was Antioxidant Pharmaceuticals Corporation (\"APC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) APC was formed to research and develop antioxidant Nutrient supplements for the over-the-counter consumer healthcare market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   From 1985 to 1996, Eastwood made large monetary loans, both to Dr. Demopoulos and to APC, to support Dr. Demopoulos's\n   cause. In 1985, Eastwood loaned APC $ 300,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) In 1994, Eastwood gave APC $ 43,440. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)And in1996, Eastwood loaned Dr. Demopoulos $ 150,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Dr. Demopoulos used the money from Eastwood \"in pursuit of glutathione.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Demopoulos's work proved fruitful, and from 1997 to 2002 Dr. Demopoulos filed applications for six United States patents relating to glutathione (the \"U.S. APC Patents\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 8, 1999, Dr. Demopoulos executed an assignment to APC of all rights, title, and interest in the U.S. APC Patents, which were still applications at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Between December 12, 2000, and May 24, 2005, the U.S. APC Patents issued from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\").(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1997, Dr. Demopoulos, who had not yet repaid Eastwood for his investments, agreed with Eastwood to convert the debt he owed Eastwood into stock in APC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.) On September 24, 1997, APC issued 351,650 company shares to the Eastwood Trust as repayment for the initial $ 300,000 loan Eastwood provided in 1985. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 26, 2001, the New York State Department of State issued a dissolution by proclamation against APC, which rendered the company \"inactive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) The Eastwood Trust owned over 300,000 shares of APC, but the plaintiffs allege they were unaware that APC was rendered inactive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite being defunct, business operations of APC continued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66). Indeed, APC was still filing applications for patents after it was dissolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November 2003, the technically defunct APC issued another stock certificate to the Eastwood Trust for 648,350 company shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) Around the same time, another of Dr. Demopoulos's companies -- ThyoGen Pharmaceuticals -- gave 400,000 shares to the Eastwood trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) ThyoGen, like APC, had been dissolved by the New York State Department of State on December 26, 2001, without the plaintiffs' knowledge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 9, 2006, the Eastwood Trust loaned$ 125,000 to Dr. Demopoulos \"to support Dr. Dempoulos'[s] glutathione pursuits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition to APC, Dr. Demopoulos had a number of businesses that operated in the medical products space. In December 2011, two of Dr. Demopoulos's businesses, The Glutathione Corporation and the Redox &amp;Signaling Pharmaceutical Holdings Corporation, issued over a million shares in their respective companies to the Eastwood Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In late 2014, defendant Kevin Davis began working with Dr. Demopoulos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) The plaintiffs allege that Davis was brought on to consolidate Dr. Demopoulos's businesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.) Davis sought to create a \"more efficient corporate structure\" by organizing Dr. Demopoulos's businesses under one corporate umbrella. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) MDC New York was created around that time to help facilitate that goal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 81-82.) The plaintiffs claim that this was when the defendants began to assert \"control and authority over Dr. Demopoulos'[s] glutathione business and\n   tangible and intangible property, such as the U.S. APC Patents and International APC Patents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 9, 2016, Dr. Demopoulos suffered a \"massive stroke.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The U.S. APC Patents remained in the name of APC -- despite the company's being defunct -- until 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 94.) In late February 2016, defendant MDHwas formed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) In February or March 2016, MDH and APC entered into a subscription agreement whereby APC transferred all right, title, and interest in the U.S. APC Patents to MDH in exchange for ten membership units in MDH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.) Dr. Demopoulos, as CEO of APC, signed the subscription agreement on behalf of APC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   An unidentified manager signed on behalf of MDH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) APC did not hold a shareholder vote to consent to or ratify the assignment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) The plaintiffs also allege that APC did not actually receive membership units from MDH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 20, 2016, Dr. Demopoulos and Davis filed a nonprovisional patent application with the USPTO for patent number 9,901,611 (\"the '611 patent\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125-26.) Dr. Demopoulos had previously filed a provisional application for this patent on June 19, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.) Dr. Demopoulos was listed as the sole inventor on the provisional application.(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.) However, the nonprovisional application listed two inventors, Dr. Demopoulos and Davis, and \"include[d] additional technical explanations and examples of glutathione treatment, formulations, and methods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 126, 158.) The complaint does not state whether the provisional application was assigned to any person or company, but the nonprovisional application was assigned to MDC Nevada or MDC New York by Davis.(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130.) The plaintiffs assert that Dr. Demopoulos never assigned away his interest in the '611 patent. (Pls.' Opp'n at 3.) However, the '611 patent lists MDC New York as the assignee of the patent. (Defs.' Ex. 1.) And the Inventor Substitute Statement for Dr. Demopoulos confirms that Dr. Demopoulos was obligated to assign the '611 patent to MDC. (Defs.' Reply Ex. E.)The plaintiffs do not allege that either the provisional application or the nonprovisional application of the '611 patent were assigned to APC or the Eastwood Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Between June 20, 2016, and November 23, 2016, Dr. Demopoulos and Davis filed applications for two international patents\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that are currently pending examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132.) Both Dr. Demopoulos and Davis were listed as inventors on these applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The plaintiffs claim that both of the international applications are related to the technology set forth in the APC Patents and that one of the international applications-- number PCT/US/2016/038381 (\"the '381 application\") --derived from the provisional application for the '611 patent, which listed Dr. Demopoulos as the sole inventor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 133-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 14, 2017, the defendants' lawyers filed with the USPTO the assignment papers by which Dr. Demopoulos and his co-inventor transferred the U.S. APC Patents to APC in 1999. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) That same day, the attorneys filed with the USPTO the subscription agreement between\n   APC and MDH, that transferred the right, title, and interest in the U.S. APC Patents from APC to MDH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )The '611 patent and the '381 application were not a part of this transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiffs assert eight claims, four federal patent claims and four state law claims. All of the plaintiffs' federal patent claims center on a single contention: that the defendants nefariously included Davis's name as an inventor on the '611 patent and the '381 application in order to swindle the patents from Dr. Demopoulos and APC's shareholders. The plaintiffs argue that Davis was able to transfer ownership of the '611 patent and the '381 application to MDC Nevada or MDC New York only because he was wrongfully listed as an inventor. The plaintiffs claim that if Davis had not been included as an inventor and, thus, unable to transfer the '611 patent and the '381 application to MDC Nevada or MDC New York, the '611 patent and the '381 application would belong to Dr. Demopoulos and, although unclear how, the APC shareholders. The plaintiffs seek correction of inventorship to strike Davis's name from the '611 patent and the '381 application as well as a declaration that the '611 patent and the '381 application derive from Dr. Demopoulos's provisional application for the '611 patent, which did not include Davis's name as an inventor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiffs' state law claims are for a declaration of ownership of the '681 patent, the '381 application, and the U.S. and International APC Patents,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as for conversion, unjust enrichment, and constructive trust. In essence, the plaintiffs claim that the defendants have wrongfully deprived them of their rights to that intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendants assert that the plaintiffs' federal patent claims should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) because the plaintiffs do not have standing to bring those claims and that the state law claims should be dismissed because there is no supplemental jurisdiction absent the federal claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Once a patent issues ...\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20256\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provides a private right of action to challenge inventorship, and such a challenge arises under [ 28 U.S.C.]\u00a7 1338(a).\"\n   <em>\n    HIF Bio, Inc. v.

Cir. 2015). The plaintiffs argue that they have standing to assert\n   their federal priority and inventorship claims because the Eastwood Trust has an ownership or financial interest in the '611 patent and the '381 application and because the Eastwood Trust is a creditor of Dr. Demopoulos. None of the plaintiffs' arguments are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that standing is satisfied because the Eastwood Trust owns the '611 patent and the '381 application. Their argument is not supported by the pleadings. It is plain that none of the plaintiffs -- including the Eastwood Trust -- own the '611 patent or the '381 application. The plaintiffs do not allege in the complaint that the Eastwood Trust was ever assigned the rights to the '611 patent or the '381 application. Rather, according to the complaint, Davis assigned the rights of the '611 patent to MDC Nevada (or, alternatively, MDC New York),(Compl. \u00b6 130), and MDC Nevada (and/or its alter egos) asserts ownership of the '381 application, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135). Thus, the plaintiffs have not alleged ownership of the '611 patent or the '381 application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiffs alternatively argue that standing is satisfied because the Eastwood Trust has a financial interest in the '611 patent and the '381 application as a shareholder of various of Dr. Demopoulos's companies. The plaintiffs do not allege that they own shares in MDC Nevada (or MDC New York) -- the entity the plaintiffs claim own the '611 patent and the '381 application. Rather, the plaintiffs assert that the Eastwood Trust owns shares in companies, such as APC, that own an interest in MDH, and that MDH has an interest in MDC Nevada and MDC New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that this connection to the '611 patent and the '381 application as shareholders twice removed is sufficient to assert standing under\n   <em>\n    Chou v.

None of the plaintiffs allege that they were inventors of the '611 patent or the '381 application. The only financial interest in the '611 patent and the '381 application the plaintiffs allege is that the Eastwood Trust\n   is a shareholder of companies that have an ownership interest in MDH, which has an ownership interest in the MDC entity that owns the '611 patent and the '381 application. That is not a \"concrete financial interest\" sufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See Hall v. Cargill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 02cv156, at 5 (S.D. Ga. May 24, 2005) (holding that a shareholder of a company that owned the patents at issue lacked standing to sue under \u00a7 256 because \"[t]he rise and fall of the value of ... stock is simply too attenuated to establish a concrete financial interest in the ... patents to confer standing\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The plaintiffs also summarily argue that they have standing because the Eastwood Trust has an interest in the '611 patent and the '381 application as a creditor of Dr. Demopoulos. The plaintiffs do not provide any reason why they should be allowed to assert claims for the '611 patent and the '381 application merely because the Eastwood Trust is a creditor of Dr. Demopoulos. The plaintiffs do not allege that they hold a security interest or that they can claim any right in the '611 patent or the '381 international application based on loans to Dr. Demopoulos. In short, the plaintiffs have failed to allege a chain of title that would entitle them to any ownership or financial interest in the '611 patent or the '381 application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    * * *\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At bottom, the plaintiffs fail to allege that the Eastwood Trust, or any of the other plaintiffs, have or ever had any interest in the '611 patent or the '381 application. Rather, the plaintiffs allege that Davis wrongfully caused the conversion of the '611 patent and the '381 application. But that claim requires them to succeed on state law claims before bringing federal inventorship or priority claims. When a patent claimant depends on a state law remedy to achieve a sufficient claim to the patent, the claimant lacks standing to assert the patent claim.\n   <em>\n    First Data Corp. v.
