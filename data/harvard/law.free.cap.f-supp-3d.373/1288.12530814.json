(\"Simpson\") and Oz-Post International LLC dba OZCO Building Products (\"OZCO\"), both of which design and manufacture connectors and anchors for the construction industry. The parties have asked me to construe terms from one of the two OZCO patents Simpson's products allegedly infringe. Based on the parties' briefing and the March 13, 2019 hearing, I will construe the terms as set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued United States Design Patent Number D798,701 (\"the '701 Patent\") on October 3, 2017 and United States Patent Number 9,957,998 (\"the '998 Patent\") on May 1, 2018. The patents protect the design and the utility of OZCO's washer and screw. Answer to Second Amended Complaint [Dkt. No. 53] \u00b6 49. The parties do not request construction of the '701 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The '998 Patent aims to simulate antique architectural hardware (like rivet, nail, and pin or nut, bolt, and washer connectors) with mounting hardware that is both easier to install and more cost effective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '998 Patent, Storm Decl. Ex. A [Dkt. No. 74-2]1:30-31, 53-56.

Simpson counters that it asks me to \"interpret the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of the claims,\" which is an appropriate task for claim construction. Simpson Response 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties clearly disagree on the scope of these terms, which makes this a question of law that is appropriately resolved during claim construction. It is not the meaning of the words that determines whether a term needs to be construed; rather, it is whether there is an actual dispute over the scope of the term. \"A determination that a claim term 'needs no construction' or has the 'plain and ordinary meaning' may be inadequate when a term has more than one 'ordinary' meaning or when reliance on a term's 'ordinary' meaning does not resolve the parties' dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro Int'l Ltd. v.

Simpson counters that the claims list the elements separately and that \"[t]he patent specification repeatedly, consistently, and exclusively discusses these elements as separate structures that perform different functions.\" Simpson Response 15. At the claim construction hearing, Simpson clarified that it does not seek a construction that \"cap,\" \"screw,\" and \"washer/nut member\" are necessarily physically distinct but that the claims recite them as separate\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   , each of which must be found in any allegedly infringing device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Where a claim lists elements separately, the clear implication of the claim language is that those elements are distinct components of the patented invention.\"\n   <em>\n    Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. v.

Claims 1 and 3 mention a screw, which is not claimed, and explain the relationship between the washer/nut member, cap, and screw.

First, Simpson proposes construing \" flange portion\" as \"a projecting edge\" whereas OZCO asserts that no construction is necessary and that Simpson's proposal injects uncertainty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OZCO Opening 18-19; Simpson response 29-30. In its reply, OZCO seems to concede the accuracy of Simpson's proposed construction, writing, \"OZCO agrees that a flange portion may be a projecting edge, but believes a better wording is 'projecting portion.' \" Reply 14. Because the parties generally agree on the term's accuracy and because I believe it will aid the jury, I will adopt Simpson's proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, OZCO asserts that it would be inappropriate to construe the flange portion as not necessarily being integral to the washer/nut member. According to OZCO, the washer/nut member has an appearance of a combined washer and nut because the flange portion is in fact integral. OZCO Opening 18-19; Reply 14-15. At the hearing, OZCO raised a further concern that the term \"integral\" is ambiguous and has required construction when used as a term in other patents. Simpson counters that no language in the claims mandates that the flange portion necessarily be integral, combined, or attached to the washer/nut member. Simpson Response 29-30. In fact, the flange portion is absent from the elements following washer/nut member in claim 1 and instead only arises in claim 2.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2083582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Claim 2 reads, \"The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the washer/nut member further comprises a flange portion disposed radially external to the plurality of outer surfaces.\" As Simpson points out, the claim language itself \"do[es] not specify anywhere that the flange is integral, or even that the 'flange' is fixed or attached to a six-sided component.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Simpson Response\n   29.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But OZCO calls attention to Figures 2, 3, 6, 8, and 11, which all show the flange portion connected to the washer/nut member. The specification further notes, \"The hex nut may be welded to the washer with a concentric configuration.\" '998 Patent, 4:59-61. Only Figure 7 shows the flange separated from the nut, and the specification clarifies that it represents an \"exploded view.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4:44-46; Simpson Response 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   OZCO has not persuaded me that the claim language mandates that the flange portion be integral to, combined with, or attached to the washer/nut member.
