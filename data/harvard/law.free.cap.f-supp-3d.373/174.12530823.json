INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Karen Klotzbach-Piper brought this suit against Defendant the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (\"Amtrak\") on July 20, 2018, claiming that she was discriminated against on the basis of her gender, age, and disability while working at Amtrak between 2014 and 2018. Amtrak now moves to dismiss five of the ten claims Klotzbach-Piper brings in her complaint. Amtrak argues that Klotzbach-Piper's claims of hostile work environment based on gender and age are time-barred, that Klotzbach-Piper failed to exhaust her administrative remedies on any claims for retaliation occurring after August 2016, and that her claim of discrimination on the basis of disability should be dismissed both as time-barred and for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The Court grants the motion to dismiss as to retaliation occurring after August 2016 because it finds that Klotzbach-Piper did not properly exhaust her administrative remedies as to any such claim. However, because Defendants have failed to meet their burden on both their timeliness and exhaustion arguments, the Court denies the motion to dismiss the hostile work environment and disability discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Klotzbach-Piper's Work at Amtrak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Karen Klotzbach-Piper is a 56-year-old female employee of Amtrak. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10, ECF No. 1. Klotzbach-Piper first joined Amtrak in 1986.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Between 1998 and 1999, Klotzbach-Piper was employed as a locomotive engineer for the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. From 1999 to March 2014, she worked in a management position with Amtrak in Delaware.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. In March 2014, Klotzbach-Piper resigned her management position in order to return to her previous work as a locomotive engineer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Klotzbach-Piper asked for a transfer to Jacksonville, Florida,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14, and was warned prior to the transfer that \"she would not be welcome the[re] due to her age and gender.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In order to obtain an up-to-date engineer's license, Klotzbach-Piper completed locomotive engineer training school on May 19, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. She then reported to the Jacksonville Amtrak crew base on May 26, 2014 for orientation and to continue the process of obtaining her full engineer certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. As part of that process, Klotzbach-Piper would \"receive[ ] daily evaluations by a peer engineer that was specially trained to handle student engineers[,]\" and would ultimately complete qualifying trials on specific track segments to obtain the certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From the very start, Klotzbach-Piper alleges that she was subjected to various and repeated acts of discrimination by other Amtrak employees.\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   Klotzbach-Piper alleges that an employee she worked alongside between June and July 2014 called her a \"carpet bagger\" and said she should \"rent a house instead of\n   buying because she wouldn't be staying that long.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. After changing routes in August 2014, Klotzbach-Piper worked alongside two other employees who, she alleges, proceeded to subject her to \"a constant barrage of degrading and mean treatment because she was a woman and older than they were.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. That treatment included creating distractions to break her concentration while she was operating the train,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , repeated sexist and ageist comments,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33, 36, unwanted touching,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33, and sometimes kicking,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Between June and December 2014, Klotzbach-Piper reported the behavior to both her union representative,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32, a road foreman, Richard Nunziato,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34, and an assistant superintendent,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36, to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2015, Klotzbach-Piper lodged a formal complaint with her union representative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. She alleges that the employees she complained about retaliated against her as a result.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. The same month, she was placed on a new schedule with a different locomotive engineer, Sharif Ahmed, who \"did not allow talking in the locomotive,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45, did not answer her questions,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 47, and did not allow her to operate with any notes,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. She alleges that Ahmed treated her differently because of her sex,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46, and that she complained about \"the 'silent' treatment\" to both her union representative and the assistant superintendent,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 1, 2015, Klotzbach-Piper rode with and was evaluated by road foreman Matt Reinert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Reinert told Klotzbach-Piper she was \"right on target to qualify,\" but that she \"needed to humble herself when operating with Ahmed because he didn't appreciate her attitude.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Around that time, Klotzbach-Piper came to learn that Reinert was a registered sex offender.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. She brought the matter to the attention of the general chairman of her union, who confirmed Reinert's status but told her that Reinert was \"allowed to be only in the locomotive\" and did not have any contact with passengers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. At some point between May and July 2015, Klotzbach-Piper reported to Nunziato that she had seen Reinert on a platform \"with a young man about the age of 14-15 years old.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Nunziato \"told her it was best if she just kept her mouth shut because Reinert would be the road forem[a]n to qualify her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 12 and July 14, 2015, Reinert rode with Klotzbach-Piper again to evaluate her for certification on her assigned route.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. On July 12, Reinert was \"agitated ... for no apparent reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. And after the July 14 ride, Reinert told Klotzbach-Piper that she would need another few trips before receiving her certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. Klotzbach-Piper discussed the two rides with her union representative, who told her he would talk to Reinert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. On July 23, 2015, Klotzbach-Piper attended a meeting with Reinert and Nunziato, where she received a letter letting her know that she had failed her qualification trip on July 12, 2015, that she had exceeded the number of qualifying attempts to be certified on her route, and that she would be given 30 days to qualify, without pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68. Nunziato told her at the meeting that he and Reinert would be willing and able to assist her in getting qualified, as well as to \"rein[ ] in some of the 'nonsense' that the crews had been inflicting upon her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. However, Klotzbach-Piper was also told that \"these types of incidents were to be expected and in no way should have 'affected' her the way she felt they had.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Klotzbach-Piper was told to report back on July 25, 2015 to set up a schedule for her qualification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the meeting ended, Reinert walked past Klotzbach-Piper and told her \"[y]ou should have just kept your mouth shut.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. Klotzbach-Piper\n   talked again with the general chairman of her union, who told her the issue \"would be straightened out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Over the next month and a half, Klotzbach-Piper was unable to find a manager able to assist her in setting a schedule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. She was told Reinert and Nunziato were unavailable to ride with her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, she worked without pay or reimbursement for hotels for several weeks while the union and Amtrak worked on resolving the issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. On August 26, 2015, Klotzbach-Piper rode with Nunziato for an evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. Nunziato told her that \"the union did not run the base, he did,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and to \"enjoy departing Jacksonville On-time because it would be her last,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. During the ride, Klotzbach-Piper alleges that Nunziato used a pretext to \"take her out of the seat and to allow Ahmed to operate the rest of the trip\" after she allegedly made a mistake in a speed-restricted zone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. After the ride, Nunziato told Klotzbach-Piper he would \"contact her when he figured out what he wanted to do with her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 28, 2015, Klotzbach-Piper was diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety and took a medical leave of absence from Amtrak pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    \u00b6 83-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And in reply, Amtrak appears to make two arguments for why the EEOC questionnaire should not be considered in determining whether Klotzbach-Piper exhausted her administrative remedies: first, Amtrak appears to argue that an EEOC questionnaire can never be relied on for exhaustion purposes, and second, it argues that the EEOC questionnaire cannot be used to expand the scope of litigation to claims absent from the formal charge. Def.'s Reply 2-4. While the Court recognizes that there is a divergence of opinions amongst courts on the issue, it does not find Amtrak's arguments persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As an initial matter, Supreme Court precedent suggests that plaintiffs may be able to rely on an EEOC questionnaire to exhaust their administrative remedies when no EEOC charge is subsequently filed. While not squarely addressing the issue, the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Holowecki\n   </em>\n   that an EEOC questionnaire could qualify as a charge for timeliness purposes opened the door for courts to find that EEOC questionnaires qualify as charges for exhaustion purposes more generally.

Notice of the allegations in the questionnaire may have ultimately not been provided because the EEOC may have only forwarded the charge to Amtrak, but this does not affect whether the questionnaire could qualify as a charge when it was filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holowecki\n   </em>\n   , 552 U.S. at 404,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675573\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/389/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It would be illogical and impractical to make the definition of a charge dependent upon a condition subsequent over which the parties have no control.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With the EEOC questionnaire explicitly requesting the agency to act on Klotzbach-Piper's claims, the only remaining issue is whether the ADA claim could reasonably be expected to ensue from the EEOC's investigation. While Klotzbach-Piper indicated that she did not have a disability, EEOC Intake Questionnaire 2, and did not check the box for discrimination on the basis of disability,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, she filled out the portion of the questionnaire specifically addressing discrimination on the basis of disability,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Klotzbach-Piper indicated that she did not have a disability but that Amtrak treated her as though she had one, noted that she had developed an anxiety disorder for which she had been prescribed medication, and alleged that her illness was held against her and Amtrak had denied her a work accommodation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court finds these allegations sufficient for the EEOC to investigate potential discrimination on the basis of disability, and for Klotzbach-Piper's ADA claims to \"arise from 'the administrative investigation that c[ould] reasonably be expected to follow the charge.' \"\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689271,7415415\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/904/\">\n    71 F.3d at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chisholm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"472464\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/665/482/#p491\">\n    665 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   491 ). To be sure, Klotzbach-Piper's allegations in the EEOC intake questionnaire were somewhat confusing, at the same time indicating that she was not bringing a disability claim and that she was discriminated against because her employer treated her as though she was disabled (a situation that can give rise to a \"regarded as\" claim under the ADA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(C) ). But there is no indication that Klotzbach-Piper was represented by a lawyer at the time she filled out the questionnaire or filed the charge, and her confusion regarding what claims she could bring could be expected in a \"remedial scheme in which laypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the process.\"\n   <em>\n    Commercial Office Products Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211220\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/107/#p124\">\n    486 U.S. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211220\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/107/#p124\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because of this evident confusion, the Court cannot conclude that Klotzbach-Piper's omission of the disability claim in the subsequently submitted charge was a knowing abandonment of that disability claim. A more knowledgeable EEO investigator looking at both the questionnaire and the charge would have reasonably inquired about Klotzbach-Piper's allegations of a potential 'regarded as' accommodation claim, and, after ascertaining her intent, would have investigated those allegations as such. The Court therefore finds that Klotzbach-Piper properly exhausted her administrative remedies as to the ADA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, the Court briefly addresses the ADA claim's timeliness. Amtrak asserts that the claim is time-barred. Def.'s Mem. Supp. 7. The Court disagrees. The complaint makes clear that Klotzbach-Piper's ADA claim is premised on Amtrak's alleged refusal to certify her as an engineer after she was diagnosed with, and treated for, PTSD and anxiety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 143-47. This alleged discrimination began at the earliest in December 2015, when Klotzbach-Piper returned to work after taking medical leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145. And December 2015 is within 300 days of the filing of both Klotzbach-Piper's EEOC questionnaire in June 2016 and EEOC charge in September 2016. The Court thus finds that Klotzbach-Piper's ADA claim is not time-barred and denies the motion to dismiss Count IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Since\n    <em>\n     Holowecki\n    </em>\n    was decided however, courts have routinely applied the case in the Title VII and ADA context.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Minter v.

In response to an order of this Court,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Order (Feb. 22, 2019), ECF No. 9, Klotzbach-Piper clarified that the EEOC questionnaire was the document referred to in her opposition.

Most of the alleged discriminatory acts occurred between September 2014 and April 2015 and were undertaken by Klotzbach-Piper's co-workers rather than by her supervisors.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-50. Klotzbach-Piper does allege that Ahmed tolerated her treatment by others and discriminated against her on the basis of gender, Compl. \u00b6 46, as well as took part in the August 26, 2015 ride, Compl. \u00b6 80. It might also be inferred from the Complaint that Nunziato, who was also aware of the harassment and refused to act on it,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 71, discriminated against Klotzbach-Piper on the basis of gender or age in denying her the opportunity to qualify and potentially sabotaging her qualification on August 26, 2015. But it is unclear to the Court that the alleged wrongful acts at the July 23, 2015 meeting, August 25, 2016 qualification, and following Klotzbach-Piper's medical leave were motivated by gender or age-based discrimination rather than in retaliation for Klotzbach-Piper's reporting of Reinert (which may not be covered by the anti-discrimination statutes). Because Amtrak does not present any argument on the issue, the Court does not consider it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
