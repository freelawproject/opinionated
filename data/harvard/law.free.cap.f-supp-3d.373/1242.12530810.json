Logan, United States District Judge\n   On May 8, 2017, Plaintiffs, individual criminal-defense lawyers, investigators, and non-profit organization Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice, initiated this action (the \"Original Complaint\") challenging the constitutionality of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-4433\">\n    Ariz.

(Doc. 1) On June 26, 2017, the Attorney General of the State of Arizona (the \"Attorney General\") moved to dismiss the Original Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the lawsuit. (Doc. 31) On March 30, 2018, the Court granted the Attorney General's motion to dismiss in part (the \"Dismissal Order\"). (Doc. 119) In granting the Attorney General's first motion to dismiss, the Court found that the Plaintiffs failed to \"offer plausible allegations from which the Court can conclude that their injury is traceable to the actions of the Attorney General or the ambit of his enforcement authority\" or show that the relief requested under the Original Complaint would redress the Plaintiffs' alleged injury. (Doc. 119 at 6-9) Based on the allegations in the Original Complaint, the Court found that the Plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue their claims, but the Court provided the Plaintiffs with leave to amend the Original Complaint by a later deadline. (Doc. 119 at 9-11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On May 4, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint (the \"First Amended Complaint\") seeking identical declaratory and injunctive relief that would prevent the Attorney General from enforcing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-4433\">\n    Ariz.

(Doc. 123) On May 25, 2018, the Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint (the \"Motion\"), arguing that the amended pleading still fails to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that the Plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims. (Doc. 126) The Motion was fully briefed on July 19, 2018. (Docs. 136, 140) For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiffs' claim that other criminal-defense attorneys and investigators have been the subject of professional discipline for violating \u00a7 13-4433(B) is sufficient to allege that their decision to refrain from engaging in similar conduct is based on a reasonable fear of enforcement of the statute.

The Court notes that the bulk of the revisions to the First Amended Complaint are found in Paragraphs 38-62 of the pleading. (Doc. 123 at 9-13) Through these amendments, the Plaintiffs describe the Attorney General's role as the chief legal officer of the state of Arizona, his role in prosecuting criminal matters throughout the state, and his role in administering the victims' rights program. (Doc. 123 at 9-11) The First Amended Complaint explains how the Attorney General stands between victims and defense counsel and describes how the Attorney General responds to the Plaintiffs' requests for contact with victims, by providing the victims with a \"standard form letter\" that does not discuss the content of the defense counsel's communication. (Doc. 123 at 10)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Notably, however, the First Amended Complaint does not contain any new or revised allegations showing that the Attorney General can enforce or prosecute the consequences for a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-4433\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-4433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B).

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-4433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B). The First Amended Complaint continues to fail to demonstrate how the Attorney General is tied to the disciplinary process that is the cause of the Plaintiffs' injury. The Plaintiffs' allegation that \"the Attorney General's Office of Victims Services has a compliance administrator that investigates allegations of victims' rights violations\" is insufficient to connect the Attorney General to the Plaintiffs' injury because, at the end of any such investigation, the disciplinary process resulting from any such investigation is carried out by the State Bar of Arizona.

(Doc. 123 at 12) The First Amended Complaint fails to set forth allegations which (i) show that the Attorney General directs the criminal prosecution of \u00a7 13-4433(B) violations or (ii) point the Court to any authority which suggests the Attorney General could prosecute such matters. As provided in the Court's earlier analysis, the threat that the Attorney General could \"initiate disciplinary proceedings, seek court sanctions or pursue potential criminal prosecution\" is insufficient to hold the Attorney General liable for a disciplinary process that his office does not implement. (Doc. 123 at 12) As set forth in the Dismissal Order, the statute itself contains no criminal penalties, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2041-191.06\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 41-191.06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provides no such authority. It states only that \"[t]he attorney general may employ administrative and other personnel that the attorney general deems necessary to administer the victims' rights program.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2041-191.06\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 41-191.06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the First Amended Complaint continues to fail to allege that the Attorney General has nonetheless threatened to criminally prosecute violations of \u00a7 13-4433(B). Thus the fact that the Attorney General may handle any criminal prosecution in Arizona and has \"the authority to influence all criminal prosecutions in the state\" does not draw even an attenuated line of causation between his conduct and the source of Plaintiffs' alleged injury. (Doc. 123 at 9-10) The First Amended Complaint fails to allege that the Attorney General has the necessary causal connection with and is fairly traceable to the conduct from which the alleged injuries arise. Therefore, the Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims against the Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Redressability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The requested declaratory and injunctive relief against the Attorney General would not redress the Plaintiffs' alleged injury because the Plaintiffs fail to plead sufficient facts to demonstrate that they have suffered an injury as a result of some conduct of the Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Cantrell v.

As stated, the Attorney General has no direct involvement in or coercive effect over the prosecution of disciplinary proceedings for violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-4433\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-4433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B). Thus, any injunction against the Attorney General would not require him to act in any way that would redress Plaintiffs' injuries; the threat of discipline that has a chilling effect on Plaintiffs' speech would continue with full force at the hands of third parties that are not before the Court. The Plaintiffs therefore lack standing to pursue\n   their claims against the Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v.

Courts generally consider four factors when addressing a request for leave to amend, which are bad faith, undue delay, prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment.\n   <em>\n    DCD Programs, Ltd. v.

The record before the Court discloses no facts indicating bad faith, undue delay, or prejudice to the Attorney General. As set forth in the Dismissal Order, the Court does not conclude that Plaintiffs would be unable to make a sufficient showing of Article III standing to seek redress against an appropriate defendant. An injunction against a defendant who has the power to prosecute or discipline violations of \u00a7 13-4433(B) would redress at least some of Plaintiffs' alleged injuries, as the Plaintiffs would not be compelled to self-censor their speech under fear of the discipline alleged in the First Amended Complaint and would be free to initiate contact with victims. Therefore, the First Amended Complaint will be dismissed with leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836770\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1060/#p1068\">\n    658 F.3d at 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating dismissal without leave for lack of standing is improper unless it is clear that the complaint cannot be saved by any amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
