The SEC's allegations are set against the backdrop of a program commonly called the EB-5 program. EB-5 visas may be issued to \"qualified immigrants seeking to enter the United States for the purpose of engaging in a new commercial enterprise\" provided that (i) the immigrant invests a set amount of capital in the enterprise, and (ii) the enterprise benefits the U.S. economy by \"creat[ing] full-time employment for not fewer than 10 [qualified employees].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).

The SEC also moves to strike one of the motions to dismiss.

The court concludes that the FAC fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 9(b) and dismisses it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The fund would then, investors were told, loan money to a particular project. FAC \u00b6 6. Each fund issued similar Private Placement Memorandums (\"PPMs\") to prospective investors some of which were supplemented in 2013, 2014, and 2015. FAC \u00b6 67. The offering documents included brochures, a subscription agreement, and a business plan containing information about the ways in which the project would spend the money borrowed from the fund. The business plans also provided an estimate of the time necessary for the project's completion. The PPMs stated that the projects would begin repaying the loan once the senior living facility had become operational. CFIG and AEP were to be compensated for their management services by a portion of the interest paid by the projects on these loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To invest, individuals executed subscription agreements and returned them to defendants along with $ 500,000. In addition, investors were charged an administrative fee of between $ 35,000 and $ 75,000. Investors' funds were held in escrow until their I-526 petitions were adjudicated. Once the petition was granted, the investor's money was deposited into the specific fund for which the investor had applied. If the petition was denied, the money was returned to the investor. Eventually, each investor would hopefully earn back his or her principal plus interest. More importantly, each project was to create enough jobs to support investors' I-829 petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kameli created two companies to manage the funds. Formed in 2008 or 2009, FAC \u00b6 50, Chicagoland Foreign Investment Group, LLC (\"CFIG\"), owned by Kameli, managed the four Illinois funds. In 2013, Kameli began offering similar investments for projects in Florida. Defendant American Enterprise Pioneers, Inc. (\"AEP\"), a subsidiary of CFIG, manages the Florida funds. As detailed more fully below, in addition to managing the Illinois funds, CFIG provided development services for the various projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2013, Kameli also created Bright Oaks Group, Inc. and Bright Oaks Development, Inc. (together, \"Bright Oaks\") to provide business and development services to the projects. The projects, which Kameli controlled, paid Bright Oaks $ 7.5 million in fees.

Even if that were so, what about the other defendants?

Nor does saying that Kameli contributed to certain written statements because it leaves open the natural next question: How much did Kameli contribute to the allegedly fraudulent statements and how much did other defendants and third parties contribute?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The FAC does not adequately delineate the defendants' roles in making the allegedly fraudulent statements. Take paragraph 127, which alleges that \"Kameli and CFIG or EA made materially false or misleading statements\" without differentiating among defendants.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113, 114, 126. Elsewhere the FAC identifies other persons, not named as defendants, involved in the management of CFIG, EAP, and Bright Oaks. An associate at Kameli's law firm wrote emails to potential investors, for instance, carbon copying Kameli. FAC \u00b6 49;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 59. Kameli's brother and sister may have been involved in project administration. Despite this, the FAC leaves to speculation the amount to which the SEC alleges Kameli and the other defendants contributed to the offering documents discussed in the Commission's response brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 124-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Commission's focus on the projects' offering documents in its response underscores another deficiency in the FAC. Rule 9(b) requires the complaint to specify \"the time, place, and content of the misrepresentation, and the method by which the misrepresentation was communicated....\"\n   <em>\n    Uni*Quality\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517695\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/918/#p924\">\n    974 F.2d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FAC describes statements made by Kameli in YouTube videos but does not specify whether any specific statements made in them constituted fraud. FAC \u00b6 4. The FAC further alleges that defendants \"solicited investors in a variety of ways - through public websites, internet videos, intermediaries who have promoted the investments, immigration attorneys with interested clients, and overseas meetings and seminars with prospective investors. Kameli has routinely attended events where he has spoken and met with prospective investors and investor representatives, including events in the United States.\" FAC \u00b6 64. The FAC sometimes quotes PPMs,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6\u00b6 74, 75, and sometimes alleges what PPMs \"generally stated\" even as it acknowledges that the PPMs contained different language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 86-87, 91. These generalities by themselves may not be fatal for the PPMs can be readily found in this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Nevertheless, as a whole, the FAC does not give notice of which of the many communications it mentions were allegedly fraudulent and which defendant is allegedly responsible for those communications. By focusing on the offering documents in its response to the motions to dismiss the FAC, does the SEC mean to disclaim reliance on the other communications described or mentioned in the FAC? The FAC discusses quarterly updates, for example, that \"Kameli issued\" that might or might not contain allegedly misleading statements. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 99-102. Neither the court nor defendants can discern on exactly which communications the SEC's claims are based, and Rule 9(b) is properly invoked to dispel that sort of uncertainty. The SEC suggests that Kameli can glean any details he needs in discovery. Combined Resp. 12. If the SEC means to narrow the statements on which its claims are based to the specific communications discussed in its response, the SEC cannot do so in a response. Rule 9(b) requires the complaint to do the winnowing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webb v.

Without knowing to whom these statements were allegedly communicated, when, and how the SEC alleges they are fraudulent, deciding whether they are actionable proves nearly impossible. So does determining whether any relief defendant has ill-gotten funds, which after all depends on identifying the nature of the alleged securities law violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants also discuss a series of transactions described in the FAC involving the Silver Fund. They point out some of the alleged diversions of those funds that occurred while investor funds were in escrow pending the USCIS' approval of the investors' I-526 petitions. The funds did not become \"securities\" as the Securities Act and the Exchange Act define the term until they passed out of escrow, according to defendants. This presupposes that the alleged securities violations occurred sometime before the escrowed funds were released, but the SEC has not specified when it believes the fraud occurred. If the SEC plausibly pegs the alleged violation after the release of escrowed funds, this issue would become academic, further underscoring the need\n   for Rule 9(b) compliance. Deciding the issue now would run afoul of the prohibition on \"giv[ing] [judicial] 'opinion[s]' advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Chafin v.
