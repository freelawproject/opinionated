Those identified above sufficiently controvert the legality of Defendants' conduct and cast shade on information available to the officers involved, the investigation carried out before any arrests were made, and the existence of probable cause not only to conduct the warrantless arrests, but also to institute the criminal process. Viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movants, the court further concludes that the record indeed supports reasonable inferences regarding the alleged conspiratorial agreement between the remaining Defendants to violate Plaintiffs' rights under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

However, the facts in controversy in the present case preclude a determination that probable cause was even arguable. The facts summarized in Section III-B pertaining to the people and considerations involved in deciding to arrest, charge and prosecute Plaintiffs (i.e. the instructions that may have been given\n   by ADA Ramos and Prosecutor Brignoni or Olga Martinez's alleged assertion that the bounty hunters were not acting on an outstanding or extraditable warrant), cast much doubt on any reasonable determination of probable cause that could have been made by Officer Morales or any law enforcement officer at the time of the arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is undisputed that Plaintiffs were both charged with illegal possession of a firearm. Officer Morales concedes that, as a former law enforcement officer, Plaintiff Dominguez could legally carry a firearm at the time of the events in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 136-3 at 60-61; 99-4 at 4-5.

The record nonetheless suggests that Officer Morales neglected to even inquire whether Fernandez had followed the procedures that would allow him to legally carry a firearm in Puerto Rico or consider the fact that he was led to believe so by an on-duty PRPD Officer at the Aguadilla airport.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 136-3 at 72-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Taking the foregoing into account and viewing the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the court finds that Officer Morales lacked probable cause (or even reasonable suspicion) to arrest Plaintiffs on the firearm charges. The absence of probable cause for this specific charge is enough for Plaintiffs to survive summary judgment, as their claims against Officer Morales subsist even if probable cause was absent for a charge, but present for another.\n   <em>\n    Mendonca v.

The First Circuit second step is itself divisible in two subparts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   First, the plaintiff must identify either \"controlling authority\" or a \"consensus of cases of persuasive authority\" sufficient to signal to a reasonable officer that particular conduct would violate a constitutional right. This inquiry \"must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.\" The aim is to ensure that the state of the law is sufficiently specific to give fair and clear warning to government officials. The second sub-part asks whether a reasonable officer in the defendant's position would have known that his conduct violated the established rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Morse v.

The court thus turns to the second step of the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Officer Morales' main argument in support of his claim for qualified immunity is that no constitutional violation took place because Plaintiffs' warrantless arrests were supported by probable cause. Plaintiffs counter that there is a dispute of relevant facts regarding the determination or existence of probable cause, which also precludes the court from concluding that Defendant's actions were objective reasonable. To wit, Plaintiffs point out that there are material inconsistencies in the version of the facts provided by the individuals interviewed by Officer Morales after he took over the investigation. They also stress Officer Morales knew that Plaintiffs had reported their firearms with a PRPD Officer and given him their names, contact information and purpose of their visit, yet eschewed this lead from his investigation. Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that Officer Morales exhibited an obstinate conduct throughout his dealings with Plaintiffs and told them that he was following the instructions of ADA Ramos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court notes that none of the parties have mentioned the different reasonableness\n   standards that underlie the probable cause and qualified immunity analyses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III-D,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (discussing probable cause).
