(Dkt. 1). Presently before the Court are two motions to dismiss: one brought by Kelvin Lockhart, James Ogle, Joshua Lafferty, and John Maskovac pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), 12(b)(5), and 12(b)(6) on August 29, 2018 (Dkt. 12); and one brought by Norfolk Southern pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on September 19, 2018 (Dkt. 18). For the reasons that follow, the Court grants the September 19, 2018, motion (Dkt. 18), and denies the August 29, 2018, motion (Dkt. 12) as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are taken from Petitioner's Amended Petition (Dkt. 30), the operative pleading in this matter, and the documents referenced therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As is required at this stage of the proceedings, the Court treats Petitioner's allegations as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner was employed by Respondent as a locomotive engineer for 18 years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13). On February 3, 2016, Petitioner was working as the engineer on a train travelling between Binghamton and Buffalo, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). He noticed that the locomotive had a problem with its\n   sanders,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he attempted to report the problem to the dispatcher on the company-provided radio which was not working properly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He then used his personal cellphone to call the dispatcher instead and was told to proceed with his assignment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Petitioner placed his cellphone in his jacket pocket and hung the jacket on the back of his seat, but forgot to turn it off. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner's train approached an unannounced banner test, which is when railroad officials drop an \"obstruction banner\" in front of moving trains to test the engineer's ability to stop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Petitioner properly stopped his locomotive, and three of Respondent's officials boarded the train to conduct a job briefing. (Dkt. 1-1 at 3). When the railroad officials asked whether Petitioner's cellphone was turned off, he said that he did not know and then removed the phone from his jacket pocket. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It was determined that the cellphone was still on, and Petitioner was later removed from service and underwent a formal investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). At the conclusion of the investigation, Respondent summarily fired Petitioner. (Dkt. 30 at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner appealed Respondent's decision to Public Law Board No. 7717 (the \"Board\"). (Dkt. 1-1 at 2). On May 2, 2017, the Board sustained the decision to dismiss Petitioner from employment. (Dkt. 30 at \u00b6 1). It found Petitioner was in violation of Respondent's Operating Rule 5, which requires, pursuant to federal regulations, that \"all personal electronic devices, including earpieces, must be turned off and stored out of sight and not on the employee's person when on a moving train or engine[.]\" (Dkt. 1-1 at 4);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20220.302\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 220.302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220.305, 220.315. The decision stated: \"It is not an acceptable excuse that [Petitioner]'s failure to turn off his phone might have been inadvertent,\" and also discussed Petitioner's previous disciplinary record. (Dkt. 1-1 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petitioner filed the instant lawsuit on June 7, 2018, naming as respondents W.L. Sturgis, K. Lockhart, J.P. Ogle, Josh Lafferty, John J. Maskovac, and the Board. (Dkt. 1). On August 29, 2018, respondents Kelvin Lockhart, James Ogle, Joshua Lafferty, and John Maskovac filed a motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 12). Petitioner filed an amended petition on September 5, 2018, wherein Norfolk Southern was named as the only respondent. (Dkt. 15). Norfolk Southern filed a motion to dismiss on September 19, 2018. (Dkt. 18). On November 13, 2018, Petitioner filed a response to Respondent's motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 27). Petitioner also filed a motion for leave to file a corrected amended petition to fix a scanning error causing a missing page, to which Respondent consented. (Dkt. 28). The Court granted Petitioner leave to file the corrected amended petition (Dkt. 29), and the complete Amended Petition was then filed on November 15, 2018 (Dkt. 30). Respondent filed its reply to Petitioner's response on November 20, 2018. (Dkt. 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a preliminary matter, while the original petition did name Kelvin Lockhart, James Ogle, Joshua Lafferty, and John Muskovac as respondents (Dkt. 1), the Amended Petition (Dkt. 30) only names Norfolk Southern. Accordingly, the Court denies as moot the August 29, 2018, motion to dismiss (Dkt. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n   Rule 12(b)(6), a district court may consider the facts alleged in the [petition], documents attached to the [petition] as exhibits, and documents incorporated by reference in the [petition].\"\n   <em>\n    DiFolco v.

(Dkt. 1-1 at 5). Such a decision falls squarely within the jurisdiction of the Board. Additionally, the Court has reviewed the arbitration decision attached as Exhibit A to the Petition (Dkt. 1-1), and on its face, the Board's award was a reasoned application of the relevant cellphone usage rules to the facts of the February 3, 2016 incident. The Board details the undisputed facts, including that Petitioner reported the sander problem on his cellphone and then subsequently forgot to turn the phone off, then discusses Respondent's cellphone use rules, and then finds that Petitioner violated the rule and dismissal was warranted.

The Court finds that the Board here plainly satisfied that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Petitioner contends that the Board went outside its jurisdiction by \"ignoring the discipline clause\" in the CBA and by considering matters outside of the \"facts before the Board,\" namely a 2008 train collision that occurred in Chatsworth, an individual's propensity to answer a ringing cellphone, and the prior disciplinary record of Petitioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 27-3 at 12, 14; Dkt. 30 at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Petitioner's arguments. As discussed previously, the Court cannot analyze whether the Board correctly construed or applied the CBA; it may only determine if the Board did so at all. Additionally, none of the topics raised by Petitioner that were referenced by the Board fall outside the scope of the Board's jurisdiction. The Board discussed\n   the Chatsworth collision and the tendency for an individual to answer a ringing phone to provide context for why Respondent implemented and enforced the no cellphone usage rule.

The Court finds neither of these opinions persuasive in this context. Both\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Grimes\n    </em>\n    discussed claims pursuant to the Federal Rail Safety Act (\"FRSA\"), not the RLA. The\n    <em>\n     Grimes\n    </em>\n    court addressed how much weight should be given to arbitration board decisions in suits brought pursuant to the FRSA, and states in the decision: \"The RLA makes the arbitral findings conclusive on the parties\n    <em>\n     in the dispute governed by the RLA.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239786\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/184/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239786\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/184/\">\n     at 187-88\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As the claim brought in the instant lawsuit is governed by the RLA, the\n    <em>\n     Grimes\n    </em>\n    decision does not support Petitioner's position, but refutes it. Additionally,\n    <em>\n     Thompson\n    </em>\n    applied the\n    <em>\n     Grimes\n    </em>\n    decision to a retaliation claim pursuant to the FRSA, and therefore also has no bearing on the instant matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Petitioner cites a case from the District of Arizona in support of his argument that arbitration awards should be set aside if not drawn exclusively from the contract.
