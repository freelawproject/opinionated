Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is a motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 8) filed by the Penns Manor Area School District (\"the school district\"). For reasons that follow, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case presents a constitutional issue in the context of a middle school student's right to free speech at school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   J.R. (also referred to herein as plaintiff) was a 12-year-old student at Penns Manor Area Junior High School up until his expulsion on April 5, 2018. Compl., Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 5. On or about February 28, 2018, at approximately 7:30 AM, J.R. was in the school lunchroom with fellow classmates discussing \"who they would shoot if they were to do a school shooting.\" Doc. No. 1-2. According to the complaint, another student had started the conversation. Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During this discussion, yet another student, who was not part of the conversation, overheard J.R. discussing how he would shoot one of his teachers, Ms. Jamie Cortazzo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. That student reported the conversation to the administration. Sometime between 10 AM and 11 AM, guidance counselor Lisa Donatelli questioned J.R. and other students about the conversation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13. J.R. admitted that he told fellow classmates he would shoot his teacher, and he told the guidance counselor he would \"carry out the activity\" using a pistol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. When Ms. Donatelli asked\n   J.R. why he would shoot Ms. Cortazzo, he responded by stating that \"she makes him do school work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the interview with the guidance counselor, J.R. returned to class to finish the school day. J.R. attended a class taught by Ms. Cortazzo. J.R. did not behave inappropriately during her class. Nevertheless, as explained in the complaint, J.R. \"continued the conversation throughout the day, with other fellow students, repeating he would shoot Ms. Cortazzo, if there was a school shooting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   School officials contacted J.R.'s parents at approximately 2:30 PM. Ms. Cortazzo was notified of the incident later that evening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The school principal also wrote a disciplinary report that same day, charging J.R. with committing a terroristic threat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. J.R. was suspended, pending an expulsion hearing before the school board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The expulsion hearing took place on or about March 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. At the hearing, the school principal stated that he did not believe J.R. posed an immediate threat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although J.R. is \"familiar\" with guns because he hunts with his father, testimony showed that no one in J.R.'s household owns a pistol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Ms. Cortazzo testified at the hearing that she was \"upset\" and \"sad\" that someone would want to kill her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the hearing, J.R. requested that, if he was expelled from school, he should be permitted to attend a cyber school, as opposed to the school district's recommended placement, Adelphoi Village. The hearing officer at the expulsion hearing ultimately recommended expulsion and placement at Adelphoi. The school board agreed with the hearing officer's recommendation, expelling J.R. for one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 1, 2018, J.R., by and through his parents, filed the above-captioned suit. He alleges a violation of his First Amendment right to free speech (Count I).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further challenges his expulsion, arguing that the school district's decision amounted to \"error of law\" (Count II) because there was \"insufficient evidence\" (Count III). The school district filed a motion to dismiss on May 31, 2018. Doc. No. 8. The Court held oral argument on July 25, 2018. Doc. No. 17. The motion has been fully briefed (see Doc. Nos. 9, 11, 15, 20, 21) and is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Additional Third Circuit guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Third Circuit has yet to fully address threats of school violence in the First Amendment context, particularly in a junior or high school setting. Nevertheless, this Court is guided by two relevant factors in other student free-speech cases, including (1) the age of the student at issue and (2) whether the speech occurred at school or out of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, with respect to student age,\n   <em>\n    S.G. ex rel. A.G. v. Sayreville Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110316\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/417/#p422\">\n    333 F.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (3d Cir. 2003), is instructive. There, the court upheld a school board's decision to discipline a 5-year-old elementary school student who told a fellow student, \"I'm going to shoot you,\" during a game at recess of cops and robbers. In\n   finding that the student's First Amendment rights were not violated, the court emphasized the student's young age and the impressionability of young children:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   We need not decide in this case whether or if, under what circumstances, a school may violate an elementary school student's right to freedom of speech. For our purposes, it is enough to recognize that a school's authority to control student speech in an elementary school setting is undoubtedly greater than in a high school setting ... Although S.G. argues that the boys were only playing a game, the determination of what manner of speech is inappropriate properly rests with the school officials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110316\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/417/#p422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110316\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/417/#p422\">\n    at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Student age is thus a factor that should be considered in a free-speech analysis. In addition, the Third Circuit affords substantial deference to school officials when determining whether speech is appropriate in the school environment, particularly when it comes to younger students.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110316\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/417/#p422\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, Third Circuit precedent establishes that the First Amendment often prohibits school officials from reaching beyond the schoolyard to \"impose what\n   <em>\n    otherwise\n   </em>\n   might be appropriate discipline.\"\n   <em>\n    Layshock ex rel.

In\n   <em>\n    Layshock\n   </em>\n   , a high school student created a parody \"MySpace\" profile of his principal that contained lewd and offensive language. The student created the profile at home, though news of it \"spread like wildfire\" at school.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750206\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/205/#p207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750206\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/205/#p207\">\n    at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting that the school district had conceded the profile did not cause a substantial disruption at school, the Court found that disciplining the student violated the First Amendment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   It would be an unseemly and dangerous precedent to allow the state, in the guise of school authorities, to reach into a child's home and control his/her actions there to the same extent that it can control that child when he/she participates in school sponsored activities.

J.R. has pled the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 At the time of the incident, J.R. was a 12-year-old student in middle school (Compl., Doc.

In doing so, it has little difficulty in finding that school officials have met their burden under\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   and that J.R. has failed to state an actionable constitutional claim. School authorities could reasonably forecast substantial disruption\n   or material interference with school activities because J.R. engaged in conversations with fellow classmates about who he would shoot if he were involved in a school shooting. J.R. not only discussed participating in a school shooting, he explicitly identified his teacher as a potential victim. J.R. told his guidance counselor how he would carry out the shooting (i.e., with a pistol), and he even explained why he would target his teacher (i.e., she makes him do schoolwork). J.R. made these troubling comments to his peers and to his guidance counselor, and he spoke loudly enough so that at least one other student overheard the conversation and reported it to school staff. J.R. even repeated his conversation about school shootings on more than one occasion that day. Without doubt, a middle school student who engages in conversations about school shootings with classmates might cause a substantial disruption in school activities and discipline.

The school guidance counselor became involved quickly and interviewed J.R. and fellow students. The police were ultimately called later that afternoon, along with J.R.'s parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 19 at 18. The school principal wrote a disciplinary report that day, charging him with committing a terroristic threat. Doc. No. 1-2 \u00b6 21. School officials also notified Ms. Cortazzo later that evening. J.R. was immediately suspended, and he was ultimately expelled from school for one year. Certainly, these allegations, taken as true, show that the school district took the comments seriously and reasonably perceived them as threatening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Next, J.R. claims that he made his comments \"jovially\" with friends. Even if J.R. intended for his comments to be a joke or some \"hypothetical scenario,\" the fact remains that he made statements school officials reasonably perceived as amounting to threats of school violence; those statements were made publicly, at school, in front of his fellow classmates, and he admitted to his guidance counselor that he made them.

J.R. was a 12-year-old student in junior high school, and he made his threatening comments publicly, on school grounds, during the school day, and in front of his peers.

Regardless of any amendments to his complaint, or any future discovery, that will not change the fact that J.R. made statements about shooting his teacher, and he made these comments to his peers and to his guidance counselor. The Court recognizes the Third Circuit's guidance of liberal amendment, particularly in civil rights cases. The Court is also mindful, as plaintiff suggests, that First Amendment cases are often fact-intensive inquiries that require well-developed records. Doc. No. 20 at 9-10. Nevertheless, the relevant facts are not in dispute, and J.R. has had the benefit of an extensive disciplinary hearing that has already led to a well-developed record. Although J.R. requests the need to \"develop an adequate evidentiary record\" that is fundamental to his constitutional challenge, see Doc. No. 20 at 9, he provides no explanation about how discovery would change the Court's analysis. Put simply, there are no other facts that would otherwise render plaintiff's claim plausible.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
