PECHMAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">This matter comes before the Court on five motions to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended consolidated class action complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d). (Dkt. No. 293.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motions to dismiss have been filed by: (1) Defendants Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d), Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (\u201cCredit Suisse\u201d), Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (\u201cDeutsche Bank\u201d), UBS Securities LLC (\u201cUBS\u201d), Banc of America Securities LLC (\u201cBanc of America\u201d), J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (\u201cJ.P.Morgan\u201d), Barclays Capital Inc. (\u201cBarclays\u201d), Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, Inc. (\u201cKeefe Bruyette\u201d), Cabrera Capital Markets LLC (\u201cCabrera Capital\u201d), The Williams Capital Group, L.P. (\u201cWilliams Capital\u201d), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\u201cCitigroup\u201d), Greenwich Markets, Inc. (\u201cGreenwich\u201d), BNY Capital Markets, Inc. (\u201cBNY\u201d), and Samuel A. Ramirez &amp; Company Inc. (\u201cRamirez &amp; Co.\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cUnderwriter Defendants\u201d) (Dkt. No. 310); (2) Defendant Deloitte and Touche LLP (\u201cDeloitte\u201d) (Dkt. No. 313); (3) Defendants Thomas Casey, Stephen Rotella, Ronald Cathcart, David Schneider, John Woods, and Melissa Ballenger (Dkt. No. 316); (4) Defendants Anne Farrell, Stephen Frank, Thomas Leppert, Charles Lillis, Phillip Matthews, Regina Montoya, Michael Murphy, Margaret Osmer McQuade, Mary Pugh, William Reed, Jr., Orin Smith, James Stever, and Willis Wood, Jr. (collectively, the \u201cOutside Director Defendants\u201d) (Dkt. No. 317); and (5) Defendant Kerry Killinger (Dkt. No. 321) (the court refers to Killinger, Casey, Rotella, Cathcart, Schneider, Woods, and Ballenger collectively as the \u201cOfficer Defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">Having reviewed the motions, Plaintiffs\u2019 responses (Dkt. Nos. 332, 333, 334, 335, 336), Defendants\u2019 reply briefs in support of their motions (Dkt. Nos. 338, 340, 341, 342, 343), and all papers in support thereof, and having heard oral argument from the parties on Tuesday, October 6, 2009 <em>(see </em>Dkt. No. 364), the Court makes the following rulings: (1) the Court DENIES in part and GRANTS in part Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Counts One, Two, and Three; and (2) the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Counts Four, Five, and Six. The Court\u2019s reasoning is set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">On May 7, 2008, the Court consolidated three related securities class actions as part of a Multi-District Litigation proceeding against Defendants. (Dkt. No. 24.) Defendants filed their first round of motions to dismiss on December 8, 2008, and the Court heard argument on these motions on May 1, 2009. The Court dismissed Counts One, Two, and Three, and granted in part and denied in part Counts Four, Five, and Six. (Dkt. No. 277.) On June 15, 2009, Plaintiffs filed their second amended consolidated class action complaint. (Dkt. No. 293.) Defendants filed five separate motions to dismiss on July 17, 2009 and the Court heard oral argument on October 6, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">Legal Standard and Judicial Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">The standards guiding this court\u2019s review of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) are set forth in the previous Order. (Dkt. No. 277 at 3.) After the Court issued its Order, the Supreme Court decided <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), which discusses Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\u201cRule\u201d) 8(a)(2). <em>Iqbal </em>reaffirms the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) and does not alter the standard the Court previously employed to test those claims in the Complaint subject to Rule 8. As before, \u201cto survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">Deloitte requests the Court judicially recognize excerpts of Washington Mutual, Ine.\u2019s (\u201cWaMu\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) amended 2005 Annual Report (Form 10-K/A) and WaMu\u2019s 2006 Annual Report (Form 10-K), to which Plaintiffs pose no objection. (Dkt. No. 313.) The Court will take notice of these documents and draw no inferences in favor of Defendants from judicially noticed facts. See <em>McGuire v. Dendreon Corp., </em>No. C07-800MJP, 2008 WL 1791381, at *4 (W.D.Wash. Apr. 18, 2008). To the extent that Deloitte requests the Court judicially notice the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\u2019s (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Release No. 2007-005, the request is denied. This document is not necessary to decide the issues presented in Deloitte\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">The Officer Defendants request the Court take judicial notice of a number of documents, which largely include SEC filings and conference call transcripts. (Dkt. No. 316.) Plaintiffs object to only one document, a \u201cquasi-editorial <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article criticizing certain accounting rules.\u201d (Dkt. No. 333 at 9.) The Court will take no notice of this article (Dkt. No. 319-4 at 43-46), as it is not necessary to decide the issues presented. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 277 at 4.) The Court will take notice of the other items submitted by the Officer Defendants to which Plaintiffs do not object, and draw no inferences in Defendants\u2019 favor. (Dkt. Nos. 319-2, 319-3, 319-4 at 1-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">The Outside Directors ask the Court to take notice of the audit charters of three companies, DTS, Inc., VirnetX Holding Corp., and Morgan Stanley. (Dkt. No. 317 at 13.) Plaintiffs object and argue that these documents are not relevant to deciding the Outside Directors\u2019 motion. (Dkt. No. 335 at 7.) These documents are not necessary to decide the issues presented in the motion and the Court declines to afford them judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">Killinger requests the Court take judicial notice of 44 documents, including earnings call transcripts, conference call transcripts, and SEC filings, to which Plaintiffs object. (Dkt. No. 323; Dkt. No. 334 at 3.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court takes notice of these documents, except Exhibits DD <em>(The New Yorker </em>article), GG (OTS release), HH (FFIEC press release), KK (FDIC quarterly), and MM (abstract related to FASB) of the Davis Declaration, which are not necessary to decide the issues presented in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-14\">Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased securities issued by WaMu or its subsidiaries from October 19, 2005 to July 23, 2008 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Plaintiffs have substantially edited their initial Complaint, which lacked \u201cproper structural organization and coherent pleading.\u201d (Dkt. No. 277 at 19.) Plaintiffs\u2019 amended Complaint is now 267 pages and 877 paragraphs, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>which Plaintiffs present cogent and concise allegations against Defendants. As before, the Complaint asserts claims under \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated under \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act (Counts One, Two, and Three), and Claims under \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the 1933 Securities Act (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) (Counts Four, Five, and Six).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations focus on WaMu\u2019s residential lending practice, which was WaMu\u2019s major \u201cbusiness driver and the source of 70% of WaMu\u2019s net interest income.\u201d (\u00b6 19.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an effort to increase net income, WaMu allegedly commenced a drive to originate more loans, which were either sold to third parties or kept in WaMu\u2019s held-for-investment portfolios. (\u00b6\u00b6 17, 44.) To meet the demand for more loans, WaMu allegedly engaged in a host of improper activities that it hid from investors, and which caused WaMu\u2019s stock and securities to be artificially inflated. <em>(Id.) </em>Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that WaMu and Defendants: (1) deliberately and secretly decreased the efficacy of WaMu\u2019s risk management policies; (2) corrupted WaMu\u2019s appraisal process; (3) abandoned appropriate underwriting standards; and (4) misrepresented both WaMu\u2019s financial results and internal controls. (\u00b6 1.) The following paragraphs provide a brief summary of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Plaintiffs allege that WaMu relegated its risk management group to a \u201ccustomer service\u201d role to encourage loan volume at the expense of sound credit risk management. (\u00b6 3.) The Officer Defendants are alleged to have led this drive. <em>(Id.) </em>WaMu also allegedly pressured and hand-picked appraisers willing to abide by WaMu\u2019s dictates to inflate appraisal values for homes on which WaMu sold loans. (\u00b64.) This artificially lowered the loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratio and created \u201cthe illusion of lower credit risk.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Confidential witnesses (\u201cCWs\u201d) from various levels and geographic locations within the Company corroborate WaMu\u2019s lax underwriting guidelines, its practice of selling loans to borrowers with extremely low Fair Isaac Credit Organization (\u201cFICO\u201d) credit scores, its failure to request documentation or verification of a borrower\u2019s stated income, and its habitual underwriting of Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (\u201cARMs\u201d) to the introductory or \u201cteaser\u201d rate instead of the fully-indexed rate. (\u00b6 5.) WaMu also allegedly increased sales of Option ARM loans, which, though classified as \u201cprime,\u201d led to high rates of default and negative amortization because they were improperly underwritten. <em>(Id.) </em>WaMu is also alleged to have increased its credit risk by causing the subprime underwriting guidelines to become \u201cnearly nonexistent as underwriters were encouraged to allow exceptions to increasingly permissive standards.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>These actions collectively increased WaMu\u2019s credit risk, which was not disclosed to the investing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">Plaintiffs allege that WaMu misstated its financial condition and misled investors as to the condition of its internal controls. (\u00b6 6.) Generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and SEC regulations required WaMu to \u201cincrease the Company\u2019s provision for its Allowance in a manner commensurate with the decreasing quality of its home mortgage products.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs allege that WaMu under-reserved for the increased credit risk it created as described above. <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs allege further that WaMu\u2019s Loan Performance Risk Model (\u201cLPRM\u201d), used to determine the Allowance, did not take into account important credit risks, such as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>potential for negative amortization from Option ARM loans and the increased credit risk from WaMu\u2019s permissive underwriting standards and distorted LTV ratios. <em>(Id.) </em>By under-provisioning its Allowance, WaMu misstated and artificially inflated its net income and earnings per share in each quarter of the Class Period. <em>(Id.) </em>Additionally, WaMu allegedly misrepresented the state of its internal controls, which were weakened in order to facilitate WaMu\u2019s reckless lending practice. (\u00b6\u00b6 331-36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">I. PLAINTIFFS\u2019 EXCHANGE ACT CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">A. <em>Count One: Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">Section 10(b) provides, in part, that it is unlawful \u201c[t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). Rule 10b-5 makes it unlawful for any person to use interstate commerce:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-8\">(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-9\">(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-10\">(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (2009). Plaintiffs bring their \u00a7 10(b) claims for securities fraud against Defendants Killinger, Casey, Rotella, Catheart, and Schneider. To state a claim, Plaintiffs must plead six elements as to each defendant: (1) a strong inference of scienter, (2) a material misrepresentation or omission, (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security, (4) reliance, (5) economic loss, and (6) loss causation. <em>Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 </em>U.S. 336, 341-42, 345, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-13\">Defendants argue that the \u00a7 10(b) claims should be dismissed because the Complaint fails to allege the falsity of certain statements and particularized facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter. (Dkt. Nos. 316, 321.) Because a \u00a7 10(b) claim alleges fraud, Plaintiffs must plead with particularity \u201cthe circumstances constituting the fraud.... \u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). Additionally, under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), a plaintiff alleging securities fraud must \u201cplead with particularity both falsity and scienter.\u201d <em>In re Vantive Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>283 F.3d 1079, 1084 (9th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Ronconi v. Larkin, </em>253 F.3d 423, 429 (9th Cir.2001)). The PSLRA provides that \u201cthe complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading\u201d and must \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b). The required state of mind is scienter, defined as \u201cdeliberate[ ] reckless[ness] or conscious misconduct.\u201d <em>In re Silicon Graphics Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>183 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">The facts alleged in a complaint will give rise to a strong inference of scienter when the inference is \u201cmore than merely plausible or reasonable \u2014 it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.\u201d <em>Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues and Rights, Ltd., </em>551 U.S. 308, 314, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007). In evaluating scienter, the Court must consider the Complaint\u2019s allegations holistically, and take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>note that \u201c[v]ague or ambiguous allegations are now properly considered as a part of a holistic review....\u201d <em>South Ferry LP, No. 2 v. Killinger, </em>542 F.3d 776, 784 (9th Cir.2008). It is not sufficient to allege that corporate management was generally aware of the day-to-day operations without adding \u201csome additional allegation of specific information conveyed to management and related to the fraud.\u201d <em>Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 1049, 1068 (9th Cir.2008). However, scienter may be inferred where Plaintiffs \u201coffer details that would bridge the gap between the existence of ... reports [containing information contrary to public statements made by defendants] and actual knowledge on the part of the defendants.\u201d <em>South Ferry, </em>542 F.3d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">The Court\u2019s scienter analysis necessarily accompanies a review of the alleged false or misleading statements, because Plaintiffs must \u201cadequately plead scienter in connection with those statements.\u201d <em>N.Y. State Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. v. Fremont Gen. Corp., </em>No. 2:07-cv05756-FMC-FFMx, 2008 WL 4812021, at *5 (C.D.Cal. Oct. 28, 2008). The Ninth Circuit has observed that because falsity and scienter \u201care generally strongly inferred from the same set of facts, ... the two requirements may be combined into a unitary inquiry under the PSLRA.\u201d <em>In re Daou Sys., Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1006, 1016 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">Below, the Court addresses the statements of each Officer Defendant individually and examines whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged falsity and scienter. Plaintiffs group the allegedly false statements in four categories: (1) risk management, (2) appraisals, (3) underwriting, and (4) financial statements and internal controls. The Court\u2019s analysis tracks this division.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">1. <em>Ken\"y Killinger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">Kerry Killinger was the CEO and Chairman of the Board of WaMu during the Class Period. (\u00b6 21.) Killinger joined WaMu in 1982 and in 2005 he hired and promoted Defendants Rotella, Cathcart, and Schneider to assist him in his effort to move WaMu into a \u201cleading national position.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>WaMu fired Killinger on September 8, <em>2008.(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">a. <em>Risk management</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-12\">Plaintiffs accuse Killinger of making thirteen false and misleading statements throughout the Class Period that are allegedly actionable under \u00a7 10(b). (\u00b6\u00b6 47-48, 50-60.) In late 2005, Killinger stated that the Company maintained \u201cappropriate policies, standards and limits designed to maintain risk exposures within the Company\u2019s risk tolerance,\u201d and provided \u201cobjective oversight of risk elements inherent in the Company\u2019s business activities and practices.... \u201d (\u00b6 47.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In January 18, 2006, Killinger stated that \u201cour risk management efforts are on track.\u201d (\u00b6 49.) On May 18, 2006, Killinger stated that \u201ccredit for us is [in] excellent shape, and I feel very comfortable with where we are from management of that credit as well as the reserving.\u201d (\u00b6 51.) Killinger then stated on September 6 or 7, 2006 that WaMu \u201cbegan planning for [a slowdown in housing] quite some time ago [and] took a number of defensive actions.\u201d (\u00b6 53.) This, Ballinger claimed, made WaMu \u201cvery well positioned, regardless of what happens in the housing market.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Killinger made nearly identical comments on October 18, 2006 and December 13, 2006. (\u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) On January 17, 2007, Killinger stressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>that WaMu had taken \u201cdecisive actions [that] ... positioned [it] well to deliver stronger operating performance in 2007.\u201d (\u00b6 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Plaintiffs allege these statements are false and misleading because WaMu \u201chad in fact weakened its risk management practices in order to increase loan volume.\u201d (\u00b6 62.) Plaintiffs support these allegations with internal memoranda and testimony from CWs spanning the Class Period. Plaintiffs allege that starting in \u201clate 2005, WaMu\u2019s risk management operations were purposefully rolled back to such a degree that WaMu\u2019s risk management systems and personnel could no longer effectively protect the Company\u2019s investors from the increased risks that WaMu and the Officer Defendants\u201d had created. (\u00b6 64.) This allegation is corroborated by CW 17, a Senior Vice President in WaMu\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) from August 2001 to September 2006, who states that Cathcart, with Senior Management\u2019s blessing, undertook to reduce ERM to an \u201cadvisory\u201d only role. (\u00b6 65.) CW 18, Vice President in WaMu\u2019s Commercial Risk Department from April 2003 to June 2006, also testifies that in the Fourth Quarter 2005, WaMu\u2019s chief Enterprise -Risk Officer, James Vanasek, \u201cinformed the Company\u2019s credit risk managers that WaMu\u2019s senior management ... had concluded that the Company planned to be more \u2018aggressive\u2019 in its lending and provisioning practices.\u201d (\u00b6 66.) An internal memo dated October 31, 2005 corroborates these CWs\u2019 statements, and details how \u201cWaMu\u2019s risk management functions were being guided through a \u2018cultural change\u2019 and a \u2018behavioral change internally.\u2019 \u201d (\u00b6 68.) WaMu\u2019s risk management was relegated to a \u201ccustomer service\u201d position that would not impose a \u201cregulatory burden\u201d on the Company. <em>(Id.) </em>Taken together, these allegations sufficiently show that Killinger\u2019s statements made throughout the Class Period were false. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">Defendants urge the Court to examine the \u201ccontext\u201d of each of the statements Killinger made to find that they were not misleading or false. (Dkt. No. 321 at 9-24; Dkt. No. 316 at 18-24.) Having reviewed the context, the Court does not find that it undermines Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of falsity. The Court does agree with Defendants that Killinger\u2019s statement on September 10, 2007, that WaMu took \u201cproactive steps\u201d to prepare for the housing decline, is not sufficiently definitive to constitute an actionable, material misstatement. (\u00b6 60.) Defendants\u2019 motion is granted as to this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">Plaintiffs successfully raise a strong inference of scienter against Killinger. Plaintiffs allege that WaMu\u2019s Senior Vice Chairman of ERM complained to WaMu\u2019s Board, Killinger included, that the Company was taking on too much risk. (\u00b6 76.) Plaintiffs allege that monthly risk reports were distributed quarterly to WaMu\u2019s Board, including Killinger, which \u201cspecifically quantified the fact that the Company was exceeding certain risk parameters.... \u201d (\u00b6 78.) Killinger is also alleged to have received monthly risk reports from the Risk Analytics Group, detailing the Company\u2019s risk management processes. (\u00b6 88; <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 90-94.) According to CW 79, who worked closely with Killinger as of July 2006, Killinger was highly involved with analyzing WaMu\u2019s risk management processes. (\u00b6 80.) CW 79 alleges that Killinger attended monthly Enterprise Risk Committee meetings where \u201call aspects of risk across the bank were discussed, including credit, market and operational risk.\u201d (\u00b6 82.) Plaintiffs also allege that the risk parameters for the Company\u2019s lending practice could not have been changed without Killinger\u2019s consent. (\u00b6 87 (CW 79 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>testimony).) In addition, Killinger\u2019s own statements about risk management show his detailed knowledge about the processes. These allegations show his actual knowledge of the risk management problems of which Plaintiffs complain. Defendants\u2019 efforts to show alternative inferences of innocence do not weigh against the strong inference scienter. <em>See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 323, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (\u201cthe court must take into account plausible opposing inferences\u201d of innocence); (Dkt. No. 321 at 24-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">b. <em>Appraisals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">Plaintiffs allege that Killinger knowingly made eight false statements regarding WaMu\u2019s appraisal process that deceived investors. (\u00b6\u00b6 96-103.) Plaintiffs focus on comments that WaMu\u2019s LTV ratio was a \u201ckey determinant of future performance\u201d and that the LTV ratio had been kept low to \u201coffset[ ] the credit risk associated with negative amortization.... \u201d (\u00b6 96.) Killinger is also alleged to have misled investors by downplaying the concerns about negative amortization and stating that \u201cthere\u2019s a very strong governance process over those external appraisers.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 97-98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">These statements are alleged to be false because the LTV ratios of which Killinger spoke resulted from a \u201ccorrupt appraisal process.\u201d (\u00b6 105.) As a result, the LTV overstated the value of the homes for which WaMu sold loans and permitted WaMu to claim a lower credit risk than was accurate. Plaintiffs detail an \u201cundisclosed appraisal inflation practice\u201d within WaMu in which the Company (1) exerted undue pressure on appraisers to hit target home values, (2) refused to use appraisers who would not capitulate to WaMu\u2019s demands to increase appraisal values, and (3) misused the reconsideration on value (\u201cROVs\u201d) method when appraisals did not hit the values WaMu desired. (\u00b6 105; \u00b6\u00b6 106-61.) Plaintiffs provide substantial detail as to this secret effort, relying on CW testimony from various branch level loan officers and underwriters up to regional managers in WaMu\u2019s Appraisal Department. <em>(Id.) </em>The breadth and depth of these allegations emphasize the pervasive nature of this purported corruption. <em>See In re Countrywide Fin. Corp. Derivative Litig., </em>554 F.Supp.2d 1044, 1058-59 (C.D.Cal.2008) (finding a strong inference of scienter based on CW testimony from Countrywide\u2019s workforce that detailed \u201ca rampant disregard for underwriting standards\u201d). Plaintiffs have also provided expert data analysis reinforcing their claim that WaMu\u2019s appraisal process was corrupt. (\u00b6 161.) Based on these allegations, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded the falsity of Killing-er\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appraisal allegations raise a strong inference of scienter. Plaintiffs allege that Killinger, as part of senior management, was aware of demands from eAppraiselT, an external appraiser that frequently performed work for WaMu, to stop receiving pressure from WaMu to increase appraisal values. (\u00b6 164.) Plaintiffs rely on the allegations of the New York Attorney General\u2019s (\u201cNYAG\u201d) complaint and internal WaMu and eAppraiselT documents to show that Killinger \u201cknew or recklessly disregarded WaMu\u2019s widespread and blatant appraisal manipulation.\u201d (\u00b6 164.) Plaintiffs also highlight the importance of accurate LTV ratios and appraisals to WaMu\u2019s credibility as a source of scienter. Lastly, they point to Killinger\u2019s role in overseeing the appraisal process and his statements that show his knowledge of the appraisal process. (\u00b6\u00b6 167-68.) These allegations raise a strong inference of scienter, bridging the gap between information available to Killinger to his actual knowledge. <em>See South Ferry, </em>542 F.3d at 783. Defendants have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>not raised a more compelling inference of innocence. (Dkt. No. 321 at 24-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">c. <em>Underwriting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Killinger made twenty false and misleading statements about WaMu\u2019s underwriting standards that misled investors throughout the Class Period. (\u00b6\u00b6 169-89.) Plaintiffs highlight Killinger\u2019s statements that WaMu was \u201cdisciplined and vigilant in [its] underwriting standards,\u201d (\u00b6 170), had \u201cexcellent processes, policies, underwritings, standards,\u201d (\u00b6 171), and that WaMu \u201cseeks to mitigate the credit risk in this portfolio by ensuring compliance with underwriting standards on loans originated to subprime borrowers and by re-underwriting all purchased sub-prime loans\u201d (\u00b6 174). Plaintiffs allege as false Killinger\u2019s statement in October 2006 that \u201c[w]e have more than 20 years experience underwriting and originating option ARM loans through many market cycles [and] the quality of our option ARM portfolio remains strong.\u201d (\u00b6 178; <em>see </em>\u00b6 180 (same).) Plaintiffs also allege as false Killinger\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he Company actively manages the credit risk inherent in its Option ARM portfolio primarily by ensuring compliance with its underwriting standards .... \u201d (\u00b6 184; <em>see </em>\u00b6 185.) Similarly, Plaintiffs allege that Killinger falsely stated that \u201c[i]n our underwriting on option ARMs we underwrite to the fully indexed rate, we never underwrite to the teaser rate.\u201d (\u00b6 179.) Killinger is also alleged to have made a false statement that WaMu had anticipated a downturn in the housing market and \u201ctightened underwriting.\u201d (\u00b6 181; <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 186-88.) Lastly, Plaintiffs allege that Killinger falsely stated that WaMu had maintained a \u201crigorous[ ] adher[ence] to [its] minimum FICO threshold\u201d in its subprime portfolio. (\u00b6 183 (alterations in original).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Plaintiffs establish with particularity that WaMu lowered its underwriting standards and pressured underwriters to approve loans outside of the guidelines. (\u00b6\u00b6 192-223.) CWs from nearly every level of the Company throughout the country verify that WaMu lowered its underwriting standards and systematically granted exceptions to the guidelines that became virtually nonexistent. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 195, 197, 200, 202-06, 210, 213-14, 216, 225-26, 228-29); <em>In re Countrywide, </em>554 F.Supp.2d at 1059 (finding a similar practice rendered underwriting standards superfluous). Plaintiffs also rely on expert analysis to allege that WaMu had a much higher loan-to-income ratio than its peers, which \u201cconfirms that the deterioration in the underwriting standards at WaMu was nationwide in scope and material in its effects.\u201d (\u00b6 238.) Additionally, Plaintiffs allege, with support from CWs, that until late 2007, WaMu underwrote Option ARMs to the teaser-rate, rather than the fully indexed rate. (\u00b6\u00b6 225-26.) These allegations, taken together, show with particularity, that Killinger\u2019s statements and omissions alleged above are false and misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-9\">However, Plaintiffs may not proceed as Killinger\u2019s statement in paragraph 182. Plaintiffs allege as false Killinger\u2019s statement that WaMu acted in \u201cprudent manner\u201d with regard to higher-margin mortgage products. (\u00b6 182.) This allegation is simply too vague to be considered a material misstatement. Defendants\u2019 motion is granted as to this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations raise a strong inference of scienter. Killinger\u2019s own statements show the extent to which he was deeply familiar with WaMu\u2019s underwriting guidelines and had actual knowledge of the falsity of his statements. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that Killinger had access to regular and special reports on underwriting. (\u00b6 241.) Citing to CW 65, Plaintiffs also allege that Killinger issued internal email and pre-recorded statements once a quarter detailing the struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>ture of the guidelines and explaining that the company was changing the guidelines in an attempt to increase volume. (\u00b6 242.) This allegation is substantial, especially when considered, in light of CW statements that WaMu senior management, including Killinger, reviewed and approved all changes to the underwriting guidelines and reviewed reports tracking exceptions to the underwriting guidelines. (\u00b6\u00b6 244-49.) Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations show Killinger\u2019s knowledge of and access to information contradicting his statements. <em>See South Ferry, </em>542 F.3d at 783. Plaintiffs also point to the allegations of scienter regarding WaMu\u2019s risk management as additional support. (\u00b6\u00b6 76-94, 241.) Defendants have not raised a competing inference of innocence that outweighs the strong inference of scienter. (Dkt. No. 321 at 24-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Killinger argues that the Complaint is inconsistent as a matter of logic because WaMu could not have had lax underwriting standards and also allowed major exceptions to them. (Dkt. No. 321 at 16.) This argument is unavailing. The court in <em>In re Countrywide </em>addressed this same point and found that Plaintiffs \u201cpaint[ed] a compelling portrait of a dramatic loosening of underwriting standards\u201d where \u201csignificant deviations in underwriting were permitted ____\u201d 554 F.Supp.2d at 1058. Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that WaMu both loosened the guidelines and allowed exceptions to them. The two are not logically dissonant; they operate in tandem,</p>\n<p id=\"AKQ\">d. <em>Financial statements and internal controls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Killinger made false statements and omissions about WaMu\u2019s financial statements and internal controls, and certified SEC filings containing similar false statements throughout the Class Period. (\u00b6\u00b6 267-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">Plaintiffs allege that on October 19, 2009, the start of the Class Period, WaMu issued a press release containing purportedly false statements as to the Company\u2019s net income, Allowance, and earnings per share that Killinger failed to correct. (\u00b6 267.) Killinger is alleged to have made related omissions in similar press releases throughout the Class Period. <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 271, 274,177, 280, 283, 286, 288.) Plaintiffs also allege that Killinger did not correct false statements about WaMu\u2019s financial statements and internal controls when he certified Quarterly and Annual Reports. (\u00b6\u00b6 268-69, 272-73, 275, 278, 281, 284-85, 287, 289.) Additionally, Plaintiffs point to affirmative statements Killinger made to investors at various conferences representing that WaMu had sound reserving methodologies. (\u00b6\u00b6 270, 276, 279, 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">The falsity of these statements and omission is alleged in forty-eight paragraphs that detail the applicable accounting guidelines and WaMu\u2019s failure to provision the Allowance accurately and in acknowledgement of the risks it created by emphasizing loan volume over quality. (\u00b6\u00b6 292-324.) Plaintiffs allege that as of September 2005, the LPRM, which helped calculate the Allowance, was untested on negative amortizing loans and that it lacked of calibration during most of the Class Period. (\u00b6\u00b6 309-22.) By not accounting for negative amortizing loans, which constituted over 50% of WaMu\u2019s residential loan portfolio throughout the Class Period, the LPRM could not have calculated the Allowance properly. (\u00b6\u00b6 192, 310-19.) These allegations add to falsity of Killinger\u2019s statements. Plaintiffs also provide expert analysis quantifying, where possible, the amount by which WaMu failed to provision its Allowance. (\u00b6\u00b6 325-30.) These allegations support Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">Plaintiffs allege that the remarks regarding WaMu\u2019s internal controls were also false because the Company did not have proper management oversight of and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>reporting for the Allowance and credit reserves. (\u00b6\u00b6 332-35.) Plaintiffs rely primarily on the Corporate Risk Oversight (\u201cCRO\u201d) Report, an internal WaMu document from September 2005, that highlighted gaps in WaMu\u2019s internal controls related to its drive to increase loan volume. (\u00b6\u00b6 331-33.) According to Plaintiffs, the problems identified were slowly addressed, never fully remediated, and never disclosed to the public. (\u00b6\u00b6 323, 325.) As a result, Killinger\u2019s statements in SEC filings that internal controls were effective were not, as alleged, true. The Court finds these allegations sufficiently establish the falsity of Killinger\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of motive and opportunity are only marginally probative of scienter. In considering (1) the amount and percentage of shares sold, (2) the timing of the sales, and (3) the consistency with prior trading, the Court is not convinced a strong inference can be drawn from Killinger\u2019s sales. <em>See Nursing Home Pension Fund, Local 144 v. Oracle Corp., </em>380 F.3d 1226, 1232 (9th Cir.2004). Plaintiffs point out that Killinger\u2019s sales during the control period (January 13, 2003 to October 17, 2005) compared to the Class Period show a 226% increase in stock sales (from $4 million up to $13.1 million). <em>(Id.) </em>However, Killinger points out that this is merely 5% of his overall WaMu stock holdings. (Dkt. No. 321 at 25.) While Killing-er\u2019s sales are not particularly consistent, the percentage of shares sold is not disproportionately high \u2014 -just over 2 times higher than in the control period. This falls below what the Ninth Circuit has considered \u201cunusual.\u201d <em>See Provenz v. Miller, </em>102 F.3d 1478, 1491 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that the sale of shares during the class period of almost six times more stock than in the 12 months prior to the class period was probative of scienter). Similarly, the $13.1 million cannot said to be so high as create an inference of scienter given that Killinger\u2019s sales were only 5% of his total holdings. <em>See Nursing Home, </em>380 F.3d at 1232 (where defendant sold $900 million worth of stock that amounted to just 2.1% of his total holdings, a finding of motive existed despite the low percentage). As to timing, Plaintiffs have not pointed to any particularly critical periods that raise an inference of scienter. However, that Plaintiffs\u2019 motive allegations do not raise a strong inference of scienter is not fatal to their claim. <em>See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 325, 127 S.Ct. 2499; <em>Fouad v. Isilon Sys., Inc., </em>No. C07-1764-MJP, 2008 WL 5412397, at *11 (W.D.Wash. Dec. 29, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding financial statements and internal controls raise a strong inference of scienter. Plaintiffs allege that Killinger attended monthly Risk Management Committee meetings and received financial forecasts or projections from WaMu\u2019s different business units. (\u00b6 338.) Plaintiffs allege that Killinger spoke of the importance of the Allowance to WaMu\u2019s earnings and that there were ample red flags throughout the Class Period that the Allowance was under-provisioned. (\u00b6\u00b6 340-43.) Killinger was also required to ensure that the process for calculating the Allowance was proper, and that the allowance would \u201crepresent a prudent, conservative estimate of losses that allows a reasonable margin for imprecision.\u201d (\u00b6 341.) Killing-er is also alleged to have received the CRO Report, which gave him actual knowledge of the deficiencies in WaMu\u2019s internal controls. (\u00b6 339); <em>see South Ferry, </em>542 F.3d at 783. The scienter allegations against Killinger as to risk management, appraisals, and underwriting also support Plaintiffs\u2019 claim. (\u00b6\u00b6 75-94, 162-68, 240-65.) Defendants have failed to present any persuasive, competing inferences of innocence. (Dkt. No. 321 at 24-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>2. <em>Thomas Casey</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Defendant Thomas Casey was the Executive Vice President and CFO of WaMu from October 2002 through October 11, 2008. (\u00b6 22.) He also served on the Executive Committee, overseeing the Company\u2019s corporate finance, strategic planning, and investor relations. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">a. <em>Risk management</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Casey made four false and misleading statements and signed two SEC filings that contained misstatements about WaMu\u2019s risk management. (\u00b6\u00b6 357-64.) Casey stated on October 19, 2005 that \u201c[w]e continue to proactively manage our credit risk, and are taking steps now to reduce potential future exposure.\u201d (\u00b6 358.) Casey made nearly identical statements on January 18, 2006, April 18, 2006, and April 17, 2007. (\u00b6\u00b6 360-61, 363.) Casey also signed a Quarterly Report on November 7, 2005, that, as discussed above, is alleged to have contained false statements regarding the efficacy of WaMu\u2019s ERM. <em>(Compare </em>\u00b6 359 <em>to </em>\u00b6 47.) Plaintiffs present no new allegations of falsity, relying instead on the allegations addresses above as to Killinger. The Court\u2019s decision as to those allegations applies to Casey\u2019s statements regarding risk management.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations raise a strong inference of scienter. First, Casey is alleged to have made public claims as to his knowledge of the risk management function of the Company and his close oversight thereof. (\u00b6 372.) Second, Plaintiffs allege that throughout the Class Period Casey received weekly Risk Reports that \u201cspecifically quantified the fact that he Company was exceeding certain risk parameters as dictated by [WaMu\u2019s] risk guidelines.\u201d (\u00b6 367.) Similarly, Plaintiffs allege Casey attended monthly Risk Management Meetings where \u201call aspects of risk across the bank were discussed, including credit, market, and operational risk.\u201d (\u00b6 371.) Third, Plaintiffs allege that CW 80, a Senior Vice President for Accounting Policy from June 2006 until November 2007 told Casey directly that WaMu\u2019s \u201crisk management and accounting standards had dangerously deteriorated, with material effects on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 368-70.) Plaintiffs also point to CW 80\u2019s statement that \u201cCasey appeared to exert greater influence over the loan loss process as opposed to it being independently managed.\u201d (\u00b6 370.) Defendants\u2019 have not offered a persuasive basis on which to infer an innocent intent. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">b. <em>Appraisals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">Plaintiffs allege that Casey made two false statements and certified two Annual Reports filed with the SEC that contained false statements about the Company\u2019s appraisal inflation. (\u00b6\u00b6 375-80.) On October 19, 2005, Casey told investors that only 8% of the Option ARM portfolio had an LTV ratio in excess of 80% and that only 2% had an LTV above 90% at origination. (\u00b6 376.) Casey also stated on July 18, 2007 that despite forecasting higher nonperforming assets in home loans, \u201cwe expect losses to be much lower due to the lower LTVs and high FICO profile of our prime portfolio.\u201d (\u00b6 379.) These statements, Plaintiffs allege, were false because the appraisal process had been secretly corrupted and that the LTV ratios were inaccurate and understated. (\u00b6\u00b6 105-61.) These allegations plead with particularity the falsity of Casey\u2019s statements. Similarly, the financial statements Casey signed are sufficiently alleged to be false, for the reasons set out above in Section I.A. l.b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations raise a strong inference of scienter. Casey, as part of senior management, is alleged to have known or \u201crecklessly disregarded WaMu\u2019s blatant appraisal interference.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>(\u00b6 384.) Given the importance of the LTV and appraisal valuation and Casey\u2019s position within the Company, he is alleged to have known of the secret appraisal manipulation. Casey is also alleged to have been aware of the complaints from eAppraiselT, giving him actual knowledge of the appraisal manipulation. (\u00b6 384.) Similarly, Casey is alleged to have known of the appraisal inflation given the federal regulations requiring him to ensure a proper appraisal process and access to information to satisfy this duty. <em>See South Ferry, </em>542 F.3d at 785 (holding that when combined with allegations that the defendant was exposed to specific factual information, allegations of \u201cmanagement\u2019s role in the corporate structure and the importance of the corporate information about which management made false or misleading statements may also create a strong inference of scienter\u201d). These allegations are sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter, and Defendants fail to provide a persuasive basis on which to infer an innocent intent. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">c. <em>Underwriting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Casey made four false statements and signed one Annual Report containing misstatements about the Company\u2019s underwriting. (\u00b6\u00b6 389-95.) On April 18, 2006, Casey stated that \u201c[c]redit quality continues to surpass our expectations ... [and that] [g]iven the good credit quality and provision level of this quarter, we are revising our credit provision outlook downward to $650 to $750 million.\u201d (\u00b6 390.) On that same day, Casey stated at the annual shareholders meeting that \u201c[o]ur credit provision was below our original expectation, reflecting our disciplined credit underwriting and a favorable credit environment.\u201d (\u00b6 391.) On July 19, 2006 Casey praised the \u201cstrong ongoing stability and strength of the [loan] portfolio\u201d and stated that the \u201c[c]redit quality continues to be strong.\u201d (\u00b6 393). Casey also stated on April 17, 2007 that WaMu was \u201cbeing selective with [its] underwriting\u201d with regard to subprime loans and that the Company had \u201csignificantly increased [its] pricing and decreased [its] risk profile that [it was] willing to underwrite to----\u201d (\u00b6 394.) The falsity of these statements is explained above in Section I.A.1.C, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">Plaintiffs again raise a strong inference of scienter. Given Casey\u2019s position within the Company and the statements Casey made with apparent knowledge of WaMu\u2019s underwriting guidelines, he appears to have had knowledge of the true state of WaMu\u2019s underwriting process. (\u00b6 397.) Plaintiffs add further detail, alleging that Defendant Schneider could not have adjusted the underwriting guidelines without Casey\u2019s knowledge. (\u00b6398 (relying on CW 79\u2019s statements).) Plaintiffs also allege that Casey was aware of WaMu\u2019s underwriting given its critical importance to WaMu\u2019s financial health and given the regimented process that governed the guidelines. (\u00b6\u00b6 399-400.) <em>See In re Countrywide, </em>554 F.Supp.2d at 1063-64 (a defendant\u2019s Oversight duty, combined with the magnitude of the lending practice may add to an inference of scienter). Defendants fail to raise a negative inference of innocence sufficient to overcome these substantial allegations. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">d. <em>Financial statements and internal controls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">Plaintiffs allege that Casey made five false and misleading statements about WaMu\u2019s financial condition and signed both certifications and SEC filings containing misstatements regarding WaMu\u2019s financial condition and internal controls. (\u00b6\u00b6 402-15.) For example, Casey stated on October 18, 2006 that \u201c[w]e do reviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>of our provision throughout the year and our [Allowance] every single quarter and this quarter was no different from any other quarter.\u201d (\u00b6 408.) Casey continued, stating that \u201c[w]e continue to look at all of our loss factors and the performance of [the] underlying portfolio and continually make adjustments.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Casey made even more detailed comments about WaMu\u2019s methods of provisioning for loan losses and assured investors WaMu was being \u201cvery disciplined.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6411, 413-13.) The falsity of these statements is explained above in Section I.A. l.d, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Again, Plaintiffs raise a strong inference of scienter. Plaintiffs allege that as CFO, Casey was responsible for the Company\u2019s financial reporting and that his statements show his detailed knowledge of WaMu\u2019s financial condition. (\u00b6 419.) Plaintiffs cite testimony from CW 79 and CW 80 that Casey was directly informed of problems with risk management and that Casey attended monthly Risk Management Committee meetings where financial forecasts were discussed. (\u00b6\u00b6 420-21.) Plaintiffs also allege that the CRO Report was circulated to Casey, which gave him actual knowledge of WaMu\u2019s internal control deficiencies. (\u00b6 422.) These allegations alone sufficiently raise a strong inference of scienter. Plaintiffs also rely on the materiality of the accurate financial reporting to sustain their claim. Plaintiffs\u2019 allege that Casey had motive and opportunity to make false statements given that his bonuses were tied to the Company\u2019s performance. <em>See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 325, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (noting that personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of an inference of scienter). These allegations are probative of scienter. Defendants\u2019 arguments as to motive, while persuasive, are not sufficient to outweigh the many other allegations supporting the strong inference. (Dkt. No. 316 at 10-11.) Moreover, the Court is not persuaded by Defendants\u2019 attack on Plaintiffs\u2019 CWs, whose allegations are broad, detailed, and probative of scienter. <em>(Id. </em>at 13-16); <em>see In re Countrywide, </em>554 F.Supp.2d at 1058-59 (finding a similar use of CWs from throughout the Company probative of scienter).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">3. <em>Stephen Rotella</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">Stephen Rotella served as WaMu\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer from January of 2005 until he resigned on October 3, 2008. (\u00b6 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-8\">a. <em>Risk management</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">Plaintiffs allege that Rotella made five misleading and false statements about WaMu\u2019s risk management. On January 31, 2006, Rotella stated that the Company felt \u201cpretty good\u201d as to \u201ccredit\u201d generally and that he felt \u201cpretty good about the credit risk\u201d in the balance sheet of Option ARM products. (\u00b6 429.) Rotella then stated on May 9, 2006 that although the Company had seen a slowing in the housing market there was \u201clittle evidence of any real deterioration in the consumer,\u201d and that WaMu\u2019s ERM was monitoring this closely. (\u00b6 430.) At the Investor Day conference in September 2006, Rotella stated that he and the Officer Defendants felt \u201cgood about the fact that we\u2019ve been aggressive in controlling what we can control. Frankly we\u2019ve been ahead of the market in my perspective.\u201d (\u00b6 431.) On the investor call of April 17, 2007, Rotella stated that \u201c... since the beginning of last year [we have] been tightening credit in that part of the business,\u201d referring to subprime lending. (\u00b6431.) On that same day, at the annual shareholders meeting, Rotella stated that the Company was \u201ctightening] credit\u201d in the subprime sector. (\u00b6 433.) The falsity of these statements is laid out in paragraphs 62-74 of the Complaint, which shows that Rotella\u2019s statements were false and misleading. <em>See </em>Section I.A. l.a, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations raise a strong inference of scienter. Rotella is alleged to be the person who spearheaded the restructuring of credit risk reporting and that \u201cRotella was charged with managing both loan production and risk management in his role as WaMu\u2019 President and COO.\u201d (\u00b6 70.) As reported by the Seattle Times, Rotella was responsible for halting efforts to tighten lending standards within the credit risk department. (\u00b6 440.) These allegations raise a strong inference of scienter. <em>See Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1023 (allegations of direct involvement in the allegedly improper activities may create a strong inference of scienter). Plaintiffs allege further that Rotella received weekly \u201cRisk Reports\u201d that quantified the ways in which the Company was exceeding risk parameters that WaMu itself dictated. (\u00b6 441.) These allegations support the claim that Rotella knew he was making false and misleading statements to the investing public. Defendants have not articulated sufficient reasons that an inference of innocence outweighs these allegations. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">b. <em>Appraisals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">Rotella is alleged to have made only one false statement regarding appraisals. On May 9, 2006, Rotella stated that the Company\u2019s low LTV ratios were a \u201cprotection against losses going forward.\u201d (\u00b6 445.) Plaintiffs also allege that Rotella failed to correct false statements made in his presence. (\u00b6 446.) The falsity of Rotella\u2019s statement is explained above, in that WaMu\u2019s LTV ratios were inaccurately understated and therefore not a source of protection against losses. The strong inference of scienter comes from Rotella\u2019s position as COO (\u00b6 23), the importance of LTV and appraisals to the Company (\u00b6 449), his duty to enforce an independent appraisal system (\u00b6 385), his alleged awareness of the complaints about a corrupt appraisal process from eAppraiselT (\u00b6 384), and the statements he made detailing particulars of the LTV and appraisal process <em>(see, e.g., </em>Dkt. No. 316 at 20). Taken together, these allegations raise a strong inference of scienter. <em>See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 323, 127 S.Ct. 2499. Competing inferences of an innocent intent are not convincingly made and do not weigh against the strong inference of scienter. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">c. <em>Underwriting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">Plaintiffs charge Rotella with making four false statements regarding WaMu\u2019s underwriting standards. On January 18, 2006, Rotella stated that as to Option ARMs, \u201can important fact is that we underwrite every loan at the fully indexed rate. And so that\u2019s an important thing to note from a credit perspective.\u201d (\u00b6 451.) Plaintiffs allege as false Rotella\u2019s statement on January 31, 2006 that the Company had mitigated exposure to exotic loans by doing a \u201cgood job of trying to fit the right customer to that mortgage\u201d and that \u201c[t]he credit quality on those products has been quite good.\u201d (\u00b6 452.) Plaintiffs also allege as false Rotella\u2019s statement on May, 2006 that non-performing assets were at a \u201cterrific\u201d level and the Company was \u201cprudent in [its] credit extension.... \u201d (\u00b6 453.) Again on July 19, 2006, Rotella downplayed the degradation of the sub-prime portfolio, stating that \u201cwe\u2019re being quite careful and making any changes we need to make in our credit policies as we move forward, but our sense of things are \u2014 things are in pretty good shape.\u201d (\u00b6454.) These statements, Plaintiffs allege, hid from investors the truth of regarding several of WaMu\u2019s underwriting practices. Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts that show that WaMu did not underwrite Option ARMs to the fully-indexed rate or maintain adequate underwriting guidelines. <em>See </em>Section I.A.1.C, <em>supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>The falsity of Rotella\u2019s statements is adequately alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations raise a strong inference of scienter. Plaintiffs allege that changes in underwriting could not have been made without Rotella\u2019s knowledge. (\u00b6 458.) Moreover, Rotella is alleged to have issued internal emails and pre-recorded statements once per quarter detailing the structure and changes of WaMu\u2019s guidelines. (\u00b6 460.) Rotella\u2019s position and statements also show his knowledge of WaMu\u2019s underwriting standards, which add to an inference scienter. (\u00b6 458.) Defendants\u2019 arguments in favor of an innocent intent are not persuasive when considered against Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">d. <em>Financial results</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Rotella failed to correct statements of Killinger, Casey, and Schneider as to WaMu\u2019s financial state, despite his knowledge to the contrary. (\u00b6 463.) The falsity of these allegations is sufficiently pleaded, as discussed above. <em>See </em>Sections I.A. l.d. Plaintiffs have raised a strong inference of Rotella\u2019s scienter. They point to his attendance of monthly Risk Management Committee meetings, access to the CRO Report which was circulated to him, and the materiality of the Allowance to the Company\u2019s overall reputation and stability. (\u00b6\u00b6 466-69.) Plaintiffs allege further that Rotella had motive and opportunity not to correct these statements because he was given bonuses based on the Company\u2019s overall performance. (\u00b6 470.) While this alone is insufficient to show scienter, it adds to the totality of the allegations which are sufficient to survive dismissal, notwithstanding Defendants\u2019 arguments to the contrary. <em>See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 323, 127 S.Ct. 2499; (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">4. <em>Ronald Cathcart</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">Ronald Cathcart served as Executive Vice President and Chief Enterprise Risk Officer at WaMu from December 2005 to April 2008. (\u00b6 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">a. <em>Risk management</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">Plaintiffs allege that Cathcart made one false statement regarding WaMu\u2019s risk management. On September 6 or 7, 2006, he stated that \u201cwe have been watching our credit profile diligently for the last two years, and we\u2019ve been making strategic choices to prepare for the environment we currently find ourselves in.\u201d (\u00b6 473.) The falsity is explained above and applies with equal force here. <em>See </em>Section I.A. l.a, <em>supra. </em>Plaintiffs raise a strong inference of scienter based on Catheart\u2019s role as head of Enterprise Risk, where his chief responsibility was overseeing risk management. (\u00b6476.) He is alleged to have attended monthly meetings with the other Officer Defendants where he discussed WaMu\u2019s risk exposure in detail. (\u00b6 477.) These allegations, considered against the backdrop of inferences of innocence, raise a strong inference of scienter. <em>See South Ferry, </em>542 F.3d at 783; (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">b. <em>Appraisals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">Plaintiffs allege only that Cathcart failed to correct Killinger\u2019s statement on September 6 or 7, 2006 that there was a \u201cvery strong governance process over those external appraisers.\u201d (\u00b6 98, 488.) The falsity of this allegation is explained above. As to scienter, Plaintiffs point to the same allegations made as to Casey. (\u00b6\u00b6 383-86, 490.) These raise a strong inference of scienter as to Cathcart. Defendants have not persuaded the Court that an innocent intent outweighs Catheart\u2019s scienter. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>c. <em>Underwriting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Plaintiffs allege that on September 6 or 7, 2006, Cathcart falsely stated that \u201c[a]t origination, WaMu focuses on an effective underwriting process and borrower disclosures,\u201d that \u201cWaMu controls the underwriting so we have the opportunity to evaluate the borrower at the time of origination\u201d and that \u201coverall we are comfortable with this portfolio.\u201d (\u00b6492.) As discussed above, this statement is false in light of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that WaMu\u2019s underwriting guidelines were secretly lowered and largely disregarded. Scienter is alleged based on Catheart\u2019s position in the Company, his role in auditing the Company\u2019s underwriting guidelines as to risk, and the importance of residential lending to the Company. (\u00b6\u00b6 495-98.) Plaintiffs also allege that he had motive to perpetrate this fraud given the substantial bonuses he received for WaMu\u2019s continued high performance. (\u00b6 499.) These allegations raise a strong inference of scienter, despite Defendants\u2019 efforts to show a negative inference of innocence. <em>See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 323, 127 S.Ct. 2499; (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">5. <em>David Schneider</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">David Schneider served as the Executive Vice President and President of Home Loans from August 2005 until late 2008. (\u00b6 25.) He was responsible for overseeing all aspects of the home lending operations. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-8\">a. <em>Risk management</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-9\">Plaintiffs allege that Schneider falsely stated on November 15, 2005, that \u201cwe\u2019ve maintained effective risk management processes. This is clearly a top priority for us. We\u2019ve invested a significant amount in terms of talent and technology in building risk management.\u201d (\u00b6 502.) The falsity of this statement is supported by the allegations that risk management became superfluous and substantially undermined throughout the Class Period. <em>See </em>Section I.A. l.a, <em>supra. </em>Plaintiffs allege scienter based on the allegations from CW 19 that Schneider held weekly meetings where he received reports on all compliance and credit risk deficiencies. (\u00b6 507.) CW 78 also states that Schneider received the monthly \u201cCredit Risk Review\u201d which detailed WaMu\u2019s risk exposure. (\u00b6 508.) These allegations raise strong inference of scienter, outweighing competing innocent inferences. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-11\">b. <em>Underwriting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-12\">Plaintiffs allege that Schneider\u2019s statement on November 15, 2005 that \u201c[w]e\u2019ve done a few things to improve our margins [for Option ARM loans]\u201d and that \u201c[t]hose [changes,] combined with some tightening of underwriting guidelines primarily around the investor property will ensure that we can generate higher margins and receive the required returns on the product.\u201d (\u00b6 513.) This is allegedly false because the underwriting guidelines were instead loosened and disregarded, as explained <em>supra. </em>These allegations sufficiently show the falsity of Schneider\u2019s statements. Plaintiffs allege Schneider was aware of the lax guidelines because he was head of Long Beach Mortgage (\u201cLBM\u201d), the major subprime lending arm of WaMu, where he oversaw the underwriting process in detail. (\u00b6 519.) During the Class Period, Schneider is alleged to have known details of LBM and therefore WaMu\u2019s true underwriting standards. (\u00b6 519 (citing CW testimony).) Plaintiffs also point to CW 79, who states that Schneider was responsible for adjusting WaMu\u2019s lending practices \u201cas they related to risk,\u201d including underwriting. (\u00b6518.) These allegations raise a strong inference of scienter that competing inferences of innocence do not outweigh. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>c. <em>Financial results and internal controls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">Plaintiffs allege that Schneider made a false statement to investors on November 15, 2005 that \u201c[o]n subprime, we have seen, as other have seen, some early payment default and repurchase activity. We saw most of that occur for us in late '05 Q4 '05 and first quarter of '06. We reserved for it appropriately.\u201d (\u00b6 524.) This statement is sufficiently alleged to be false given that the WaMu allegedly did not properly reserve for such losses in late 2005, as discussed <em>supra. </em>Plaintiffs allege Schneider\u2019s scienter based on his access to the CRO Report, the monthly Risk Management Committee meetings where he gained actual knowledge of the Allowance, the materiality of the Allowance, and his motive and opportunity. (\u00b6\u00b6 527-32.); <em>see South Ferry, </em>542 F.3d at 783. Under the holistic analysis of <em>Tellabs, </em>the Court finds that Plaintiffs create a strong inference of scienter, notwithstanding Defendants\u2019 contrary arguments. (Dkt. No. 316 at 9-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">B. <em>Counts Two and Three: Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">In Count Two, Plaintiffs assert claims against the Officer Defendants and Defendants Woods and Ballenger for violations of \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act.

(Dkt. No. 277 at 30-32.) Because the control person analysis does not differ between \u00a7 15 of the Securities Act and \u00a7 20 of the Exchange Act, the Court\u2019s prior Order applies with equal force to the \u00a7 20 claims against these defendants. <em>Hollinger v. Titan Capital Corp., </em>914 F.2d 1564, 1578 (9th Cir.1990). Count Two and Three are adequately pleaded. The Outside Directors\u2019 and Defendants Woods and Ballenger\u2019s motions are DENIED as to all statements that remain actionable as described <em>supra. </em>Killinger, Casey, Rotella, Cathcart, and Schneider do not challenge their status as control persons, and all of Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20 claims against them survive dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">II.

(Dkt. No. 277 at 23-29.) The Court also found that Plaintiffs lacked standing to assert claims under \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act for the August 2006, September 2006, and December 2007 securities offerings. Plaintiffs have named three new plaintiffs in order to correct these deficiencies.

(Dkt. No. 310 at 10-11.) Pompano did not purchase the 5.50% Notes. Rather, it purchased Floating Rate Notes that were issued in the same offering. (\u00b6 279.) Plaintiffs do not have standing to pursue \u00a7 11 claims as to the 5.50% Notes. There is no named plaintiff who can be deemed a \u201cperson acquiring such security\u201d (the 5.50% Notes) as required by \u00a7 11(a), and, thus, no named plaintiff has suffered an \u201cactual injury.\u201d <em>See Casey v. Lewis, </em>4 F.3d 1516, 1519 (9th Cir.1993). Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 11 and \u00a7 12(a)(2) claims as to the 5.50% Notes are DISMISSED. However, Defendants do not move to dismiss Plaintiffs \u00a7 11 claims as to the Floating Rate Notes, for which Plaintiffs have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Defendants argue that Harlan Seymour, a newly named plaintiff who purchased Series K stock issued in the September 2006 offering on July 15, 2008, lacks standing. The parties agree that Seymour must allege reliance, but dispute the sufficiency of the pleadings. Plaintiffs allege that all named plaintiffs, including Seymour, \u201cacquired these securities relying upon the statements ... shown above to be untrue and/or relying upon the Registration Statements ... and not knowing the omitted material facts....\u201d (\u00b6841.) Plaintiffs also allege that \u201cClass members did not know, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence could have known, that the Offering Documents contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts.... \u201d (\u00b6 846.) These allegations are sufficient under Rule 9 to allege reliance, particularly given \u00a7 ll\u2019s express statement that reliance may established \u201cwithout proof of the reading of the registration statement.... \u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 11 claims as to the December 2007 offering of Series R Preferred Stock on the basis that the named plaintiff who purchased this stock, Police &amp; Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit (\u201cDetroit P &amp; F\u201d), was an \u201cin-and-out\u201d trader. (Dkt. No. 310 at 16-17.) This is a question of loss causation, not one of standing. Plaintiffs have standing to pursue claims as to this offering, given that Detroit P &amp; F\u2019s purchased the Series R Preferred Stock the same day it was first offered. (\u00b6 677; id. at 287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">Plaintiffs therefore have standing under \u00a7 11 to pursue claims regarding those securities the named plaintiffs purchased in the August 2006, September 2006, and December 2007 offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">3. <em>Substantive section 11 allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-11\">Plaintiffs allege that the offering documents for the August 2006, September 2006, and December 2007 securities offerings contain untrue statements and omissions of material fact regarding WaMu\u2019s lending practices, financial results, and internal controls. (\u00b6\u00b6 831; 769-830.) The Court previously found that the allegations as to the October 2007 offering were sufficiently pleaded with particularity to survive dismissal. (Dkt. No. 277 at 23-29.) Deloitte now challenges the sufficiency of the allegations as to the three new offerings regarding financial statements and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>internal controls. (Dkt. No. 313 at 11-18, 22-23.) The Underwriter Defendants attack the claims on the basis of negative causation. (Dkt. No. 17-25.) Defendants do not contest the sufficiency of the allegations as to the residential lending practices and the Court does not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">a. <em>2006 offerings: financial statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Plaintiffs allege that the 2006 offering documents contain \u201cmaterially misstated financial returns for WaMu for 2005 and the first half of 2006.\u201d (\u00b6 773.) Plaintiffs focus particularly on the Company\u2019s Allowance, which they claim was materially understated, causing WaMu\u2019s net income and earnings per share to be materially overstated. <em>(Id.) </em>The Court previously found these allegations with regard to the October 2007 offering documents pleaded with sufficient particularity to withstand dismissal. (Dkt. No. 277 at 27-28.) Under GAAP and SEC guidelines, WaMu was required to increase its Allowance commensurate with the Company\u2019s credit risk. (\u00b6 749.) Plaintiffs allege that the financial statements incorporated in the 2006 offering documents falsely presented an Allowance that should have been higher because: (1) the LPRM did not account for losses related to Option ARM loans, (2) the Company did not account for its vanishing underwriting standards, and (3) WaMu failed to report the misrepresented LTV ratios on its loans due to appraisal manipulation. (\u00b6\u00b6 777-78.) Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations sufficiently demonstrate with particularity that WaMu\u2019s financial statements materially misrepresented the Company\u2019s true financial condition, as the Court similarly finds <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">Deloitte argues that Plaintiffs have pleaded themselves out of Court by failing to explain the amount by which the Allowance was understated. (Dkt. No. 313 at 12-13.) Plaintiffs are not required to quantify the amount by which the Allowance was understated. Under Rule 9(b), Plaintiffs are required only to \u201callege enough information so that \u2018a court can discern whether the alleged GAAP violations were minor or technical in nature, or whether they constituted widespread and significant inflation of revenue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1017 (quoting <em>In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>126 F.Supp.2d 1248, 1273 (N.D.Cal.2000)). The alleged violations are widespread and material. Additionally, Plaintiffs have explained that it is not possible to state the precise amount by which the Allowance was understated in 2005 given the occurrence of one-time events, such as Hurricane Katrina. (\u00b6 327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">Deloitte argues further that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the Allowance fail because nothing shows that the LPRM lacked calibration in 2005. (Dkt. No. 313 at 14.) On this point, Deloitte is correct. Plaintiffs allege that \u201cas of the summer of 2007, the LPRM had not been calibrated to reflect actual loan performance data for over eighteen months.\u201d (\u00b6 722.) However, this is not the only allegation regarding the deficiency of the LPRM. Plaintiffs allege that separately from the issue of calibration, the LPRM \u201cdid not account for deteriorating loan performance during the Class Period\u201d and that the \u201cthe LPRM did not appropriately analyze for risk of losses in the Company\u2019s Option ARM loans, or other loans with the potential for \u2018negative amortization.\u2019 \u201d (\u00b6 751; \u00b6 721.) In addition, Plaintiffs allege that Option ARM loans accounted for more than 50% of WaMu\u2019s prime single-family residential portfolio throughout the Class Period. (\u00b6 192 Chart 1.) Thus, regardless of calibration, the LPRM\u2019s failure to account for Option ARM loans supports Plaintiffs\u2019 claim as to the Allowance\u2019s deficiencies. <em>(Id.) </em>Defendants\u2019 motion is DENIED as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>b. <em>2006 offerings: internal controls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">Plaintiffs allege that the 2006 offering documents contain false or misleading statements as to WaMu\u2019s internal controls. The Court previously found substantially similar allegations sufficient. (Dkt. No. 277 at 25-26.) As to 2006, Plaintiffs allege that throughout the Class Period \u201cthe Company falsely represented that WaMu maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting.\u201d (\u00b6 785.) Plaintiffs allege that \u201cthe Company was operating without adequate controls in place to ensure compliance with the Company\u2019s underwriting and appraisal standards\u201d and that it was \u201cwithout policies and appropriate methodology in place to ensure the soundness of its valuation of the assets and its Allowance.... \u201d (\u00b6 786.) The CRO Report from late 2005 supports this allegation. As explained in greater detail in Section I.A.l.d, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged with particularity why the internal controls statements in the 2006 offering documents were false and misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">c. <em>December 2007 offering</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">The December 2007 offering documents incorporate nearly identical documents and statements as those incorporated into the October 2007 offering that the Court previously found actionable under \u00a7 11. <em>(Compare </em>\u00b6 790 <em>to </em>\u00b6 816 <em>and </em>Dkt. No. 277 at 24-28.) Defendants provide no basis to conclude that Plaintiffs have inadequately pleaded a \u00a7 11 claim, and their motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">4. <em>Subjective Falsity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-9\">Deloitte argues that Plaintiffs must plead that the statements Deloitte made in connection to the 2006 and 2007 offering documents were both objectively and subjectively false. Deloitte relies on <em>Rubke v. Capitol Bancorp Ltd., </em>in which the Ninth Circuit held that fairness opinion from auditors must be plead to be objectively and subjectively false in order to be actionable under \u00a7 11. 551 F.3d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir.2009). Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Deloitte, however, turn not on statements of opinion, but statements of fact. Thus, Rubke\u2019s subjective falsity standard does not apply to the factual statements Plaintiffs allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-12\">In <em>Rubke, </em>the court addressed whether a plaintiff had to prove the subjective falsity of an auditor\u2019s fairness opinion regarding an exchange offer \u2014 that a particular offer was \u201cfinancially fair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court expressly delineated that it was not addressing factual statements, which the parties conceded: \u201cthese fairness determinations are alleged to be misleading opinions, not statements of fact....\u201d <em>Id. Rubke </em>cites with approval <em>In re McKesson, </em>126 F.Supp.2d 1248, a case which highlights the limits of the subjective falsity standard. In <em>McKesson, </em>the court considered an auditor statement that a merger exchange rate was \u201cfair, from a financial point of view.\u201d 126 F.Supp.2d at 1264. In applying the subjective falsity standard, the court noted that it did not apply to factual statements: \u201c[o]f course, any purely factual assertions in the fairness opinion, such as Bear Stearns\u2019 statements that it reviewed certain materials during its due diligence inquiry, would be held to a negligence standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265-66. As the <em>McKesson </em>court put it, \u201c[a] fairness \u2018opinion\u2019 is just that-an opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-13\">The statements examined by courts applying the subjective falsity standard highlight the distinction between opinion and fact statements. For example, the actionable statement in <em>Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, </em>501 U.S. 1083, 1090, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991), relied on by <em>Rubke, </em>was one of opinion: a fairness opinion stating that a merger would \u201cachieve a high value.\u201d Similarly, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>Court applied the <em>Rubke </em>standard to an opinion statement from the defendant that it \u201chosted a good inspection\u201d by the FDA. <em>McGuire v. Dendreon Corp., </em>688 F.Supp.2d 1239, 1241 (W.D.Wash.2009). These opinion statements are unlike the factual ones alleged by Plaintiffs against Deloitte. The court\u2019s decision in <em>In re AOL Time Warner, Inc. Sec. &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>is instructive on the division between factual and opinion statements. 381 F.Supp.2d 192 (S.D.N.Y.2004). There, the plaintiffs alleged that the auditor\u2019s certification of a financial statement and fairness opinion contained false and misleading statements. <em>Id. </em>at 241, 243. The court concluded that the subjective falsity standard applied to the fairness opinion, but not to the certification. <em>Id. </em>This holding is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">Here, Plaintiffs allege that Deloitte made the misleading and false statement that its internal control reports were audited \u201cin accordance with the PCAOB\u2019s standards.\u201d (\u00b6\u00b6 788, 830). Whether or not Deloitte employed the PCAOB standards is a verifiable factual statement that is material to those relying on its certification of WaMu\u2019s internal controls. Similarly, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding Deloitte\u2019s certification of the financial statements are not subject to the <em>Rubke </em>standard. Deloitte\u2019s affirmation that the financial statements were presented \u201cin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\u201d is an actionable statement of fact. <em>{See, e.g., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 779, 781.) And as Plaintiffs have set forth, this was false because the financial statements were not prepared in conformity with GAAP, given the improper understatement of the Allowance. (\u00b6\u00b6 773, 777.) The Court rejects Deloitte\u2019s argument that Plaintiffs must plead the subjective falsity of these statements and DENIES the motion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">5. <em>Negative causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">The Underwriter Defendants argue that they have shown that negative causation exists on the face of the Complaint as to Plaintiffs Seymour and Detroit P &amp; F. (Dkt. No. 310 at 19-23.) The Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">To sustain a securities fraud claim, Plaintiff must allege that the misrepresentations were the proximate cause of the losses suffered. <em>Dura Pharm., </em>544 U.S. at 344, 125 S.Ct. 1627. \u201c[T]he complaint must allege that the practices that the plaintiff contends are fraudulent were revealed to the market and caused the resulting losses.\u201d <em>Metzler, </em>540 F.3d at 1063. Revelation of the fraud need not be complete for loss causation to be adequately pled. <em>(See </em>Dkt. No. 277 at 28); <em>Freeland v. Iridium World Commc\u2019ns, Ltd., </em>233 F.R.D. 40, 47 (D.D.C.2006) (\u201c[Reading <em>Dura </em>to require proof of a complete, corrective disclosure would allow wrongdoers to immunize themselves with a protracted series of partial disclosures.\u201d). In raising the affirmative defense of \u201cnegative causation,\u201d the defendant must show that on the face of the complaint, the alleged misrepresentation could not have caused a plaintiffs damages. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">The Underwriter Defendants contend that loss causation is not adequately plead as to Detroit P &amp; F because it was an \u201cin- and-out\u201d trader, who sold its WaMu securities prior to any revelation of fraud. The Court previously found that Plaintiffs alleged \u201cthat a series of public disclosures, beginning in October of 2007 and continuing until July 2008, gradually and incrementally revealed previously undisclosed facts about WaMu\u2019s true financial condition.\u201d (Dkt. No. 277 at 28.) Plaintiffs allege that after Detroit P &amp; F purchased WaMu Preferred stock, a <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article revealed that the SEC had launched an investigation into WaMu\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>mortgage lending practices. (\u00b6 586.) This news is alleged to have caused WaMu\u2019s stock to decline. <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs therefore properly allege loss causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">The Complaint adequately pleads loss causation with regard to Plaintiff Seymour and the September 2006 offering. Plaintiff Seymour purchased his shares on July 15, 2008, four days before WaMu allegedly \u201cshocked the market\u201d on July 22, 2008, when it announced a net loss of $3.3 billion \u2014 more than double the Company\u2019s First Quarter 2008 net loss. (\u00b6 617.) WaMu\u2019s stock fell 20% from July 22 to July 23, 2008. The Complaint alleges further that WaMu\u2019s true financial condition continued to be revealed to the public after July 23, 2008, up until WaMu was seized by the federal government. (\u00b6\u00b6 624-26.) This adequately alleges loss causation as to Plaintiff Seymour and the September 2006 offering. The Court rejects Defendants\u2019 negative causation argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">B. <em>Count V: Section 12(a)(2) Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">Plaintiffs assert claims pursuant to \u00a7 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act against WaMu and the Underwriter Defendants on behalf of the three newly-named plaintiffs with regard to the August 2006, September 2006, and December 2007 securities offerings. The Underwriter Defendants challenge Plaintiffs\u2019 standing as to all three offerings. Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue \u00a7 12(a)(2) claims as to both 2006 offerings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">Standing under \u00a7 12(a)(2) is more restrictive than under \u00a7 11. Section 12 \u201cpermits suit against a seller of a security by prospectus only by \u2018the person purchasing such security from him,\u2019 thus specifying that a plaintiff must have purchased the security directly from the issuer of the prospectus.\u201d <em>Hertzberg, </em>191 F.3d at 1081 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>111 </em>(a)(2)). As the Ninth Circuit noted in <em>Hertzberg, </em>\u00a7 12(a)(2) standing will not exist where there purchase is only traceable to the offering. <em>Id.; see Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., </em>513 U.S. 561, 578, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995) (noting, in dicta, that suit under \u00a7 12 may only maintained by a person who purchases the stock in the public offering under the prospectus).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">There is no clear appellate authority as to whether aftermarket purchasers may have \u00a7 12(a)(2) standing. Some courts have held that it does not exist for those who purchase securities in private and secondary markets outside the initial offering. <em>See In re Sterling Foster &amp; Co., Inc., Sec. Litig., </em>222 F.Supp.2d 216, 244-45 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (collecting cases within S.D.N.Y); <em>Tsirekidze v. Syntax-Brillian Corp., </em>No. CV-07-02204-PHX-FJM, 2009 WL 2151838, at *2 (D.Ariz. July 17, 2009). Other courts, such as <em>Feiner v. SS &amp; C Tech., Inc., </em>47 F.Supp.2d 250, 253 (D.Conn.1999), have held that aftermarket purchases are actionable \u201cso long as that aftermarket trading occurs \u2018by means of a prospectus or oral communication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>111)-, see In re Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Sec. Litig., </em>527 F.Supp.2d 965, 982 (N.D.Cal.2007). In <em>Levi Strauss, </em>the court clarified that <em>Feiner </em>only goes so far as to say that \u00a7 12(a)(2) liability is coextensive with the prospectus\u2019s effective date. <em>Levi Strauss, </em>527 F.Supp.2d at 983. \u201cThis period is generally forty days, but extended to ninety days if the public offering is the issuer\u2019s initial public offering of securities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even under this more expansive reading of \u00a7 12(a)(2), Plaintiffs fail to state a claim as to the 2006 offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-14\">Pompano is alleged only to have purchased Floating Rate Notes \u201con and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>traceable to\u201d the August 2006 offering. (\u00b6 11.) The Certification in the Complaint shows that Pompano did not purchase the Floating Rate Notes until January 12, 2007, over four months after the initial offering. This falls outside the effective date for the prospectus. <em>See Levi Strauss, </em>527 F.Supp.2d at 983. Despite opportunity to clarify how Pompano has standing, Plaintiffs have failed to show how this purchase was made pursuant to an effective prospectus. The Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion on this issue and DISMISSES Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 12(a)(2) claims related to the August 2006 offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Similarly, Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Seymour purchased the Series K Preferred Stock pursuant to a misleading prospectus. To the contrary, Plaintiffs have alleged that Seymour\u2019s purchase was only \u201ctraceable to\u201d the September 2006 offering. (\u00b6 12.) This is insufficient to assert \u00a7 12(a)(2) standing. <em>See Hertzberg, </em>191 F.3d at 1081. The Court GRANTS Defendants motion on this issue and DISMISSES Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 12(a)(2) claims related to the September 2006 offering. However, Plaintiffs have standing to pursue \u00a7 12(a)(2) claims as to the December 2007 offering. Detroit P &amp; F purchased shares of Series R Stock directly in the initial offering on December 17, 2007. <em>(Compare </em>\u00b6 14 <em>with </em>Compl. at 287.) Defendants\u2019 motion on this issue is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">C. <em>Count Six: Section IS of the Securities Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">As explained in the prior Order, the Outside Director Defendants and Defendants Killinger, Casey, Woods, and Ballenger are sufficiently alleged to be control persons for the purpose of \u00a7 15 liability. Control liability extends to those claims now successfully pleaded under \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12(a)(2). <em>(See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 861-64.) Defendants\u2019 motion is DENIED as to those claims in Counts Four and Five which survive dismissal and is GRANTED as to those which do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">Plaintiffs have largely succeeded in remedying the deficiencies of their initial Complaint. As to Killinger, nearly all of Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) claims in Counts One and Two are adequately pleaded regarding false statements of risk management, appraisals, underwriting, financial statements, and internal controls. Defendants\u2019 motions on these claims are DENIED. However, two statements (\u00b6\u00b6 60, 182) lack sufficient clarity to state a claim, as described above, and Defendants\u2019 motions related thereto are GRANTED. As to Casey, Rotella, Cathcart, and Schneider, all of Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) claims in Counts One and Two are adequately pleaded as to all five areas of false statements, and Defendants motions are DENIED. Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Count Three are DENIED as to those \u00a7 10(b) claims which are adequately pleaded and GRANTED as to the two statements made by Killinger that fail to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Count Four are DENIED as to the August 2006, September 2006, and December 2007 offerings for those securities actually purchased by the named plaintiffs. Because Plaintiffs do not have standing to pursue claims related to the 5.50% Notes, Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss these claims in Count Four are GRANTED. Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Count Five are GRANTED as to the August 2006 and September 2006 offerings, including the 5.50% Notes, because Plaintiffs lack standing under \u00a7 12(a)(2) to pursue those claims. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims in Count Five related to the December 2007 offering, however, are adequately pleaded and Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss these claims are DENIED. Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Count Six are DENIED as to those claims in Counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>Four and Five that are adequately pleaded and GRANTED as to those claims that are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">No later than two weeks from the date of this ruling, all parties to the MDL shall file a status report offering a proposed schedule for the resolution of this matter. <em>(See </em>Dkt.
