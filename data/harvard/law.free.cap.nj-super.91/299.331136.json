We deem this a clear reminder to the jury that defendant had failed to take the stand in his own defense and thus a violation of defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, within <em>Griffin v. State of California, </em>380 <em>U. S. </em>609, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>1229, 14 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>106 (1965), recognized in New Jersey as authoritative in <em>State v. Lanzo, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>560 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The charges here were breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, and conspiracy. The gist of the prosecution case was testimony by two young men that defendant had conspired with them to arrange and finance an effort by them to break into a store from the roof, that the young men did so break in and were caught in the attempt. Defendant did not take the stand in his defense and offered no defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Among other things, the prosecutor in summation said: \u201cIt is a very simple issue here \u2014 one way. Normally, we have two sides to a story. Here, we have one side. There is no defense.\u201d At the end of the summation defense counsel stated his objection to these comments, asking either for a mistrial or in the alternative \u201cfor some form of cautionary instruction to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in that particular regard.\u201d The court declined to do so, saying: \u201cThe court feels that it was fair comment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The State argues that it was not by the comments mentioned adverting to the failure of the defendant to testify in his defense birt was merely responding to the defendant\u2019s summation. However, that summation consisted, purely and simply, of an attack upon the credibility of the two confessed would-be thieves. The clearly inferable import of the prosecutor\u2019s comment was, we think, that it was not enough for defendant to impugn the credibility of State\u2019s witnesses without himself going on the stand to deny his complicity. This was undoubtedly the impression the jury would derive from such comments. See <em>State v. Lanzo, supra, </em>(at <em>p. </em>563).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">In our view, the substance of what was held constitutionally fatal in <em>Griffin, </em>supra, was encompassed by the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>cutor\u2019s comment here. See <em>Desmond v. United </em>States, 345 <em>F. 2d </em>225 (1 <em>Cir. </em>1965); <em>Barnes v. United </em>States, <em>8F. 2d </em>832 (8 <em>Cir. </em>1925). The present is not a case in which the prosecutor\u2019s comment can be fairly understood as an animaadversion solely on the failure of the defense to offer the testimony of persons other than defendant himself, and the State does not so argue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
