Dreyer, </em>103 <em>N. J. Eq. 457 (Ch. Div. </em>1928), affirmed o. b. 105 <em>N. J. Eq. 585 (E. &amp; A. </em>1930); <em>Dieckmann v. Walser, </em>112 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>46, 48 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1932), affirmed 114 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>382 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The parties do not contest the application of this principle to devises of mortgaged real property under a will. The issue is only whether that general rule applies to this specific will contest. Defendant contends that it does since there is \u201cnothing contained\u201d in the testator\u2019s will that justifies departure therefrom. On the other hand, plaintiffs argue that the rule is not herein applicable because of \u201ccertain language in the testator\u2019s will indicating a contrary intent,\u201d and that the trial court was correct in considering certain \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d contained in the stipulation of facts to support its conclusion that a different apportionment of the mortgage debt should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Plaintiffs first argue that the facts that the testator devised the Riverside property to defendant \u201csubject, however, to any liens or mortgages that may be against said premises at the time of my death,\u201d and that no similar provision was employed by him in the residuary devise under which plaintiffs received the Delran property, are \u201cimportant\u201d on the question of his testamentary intent with regard to the apportionment of the \u201cblanket\u201d mortgage debt between these two properties. We do not agree with this argument. Even without an express proviso, each property devised goes to the devisee encumbered by the debt of the mortgage to which it was subject. <em>N. J. S. </em>3A:26-1. The issue is not whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>either of these properties is devised free from the mortgage lien but rather, as above stated, the proper apportionment between them. Plaintiffs concede that their property is liable for 3/10 of that debt and seek to hold defendant\u2019s property liable for 7/10 thereof, as held by the trial court. We conclude that the language of the will in the respect noted does not <em>ipso facto </em>throw any light on the testator\u2019s intent with regard to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Plaintiffs then attempt to support the trial court\u2019s determination on the basis of \u201cextrinsic evidence.\u201d Eeliance is had upon the stipulated facts concerning the manner in which the testator created the \u00a3\u00a3blanket mortgage\u201d and used the proceeds thereof. This mortgage was made on October 30, 1959 and was in the original amount of $10,000 \u2014 $7,000 thereof was used as the purchase price of the Eiverside property acquired by him on that day and devised to defendant by the will herein, and $3,000 was used to discharge an existing mortgage on the Delran property which he had previously owned, and which goes to plaintiffs under the residuary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">These facts do not in our judgment bear any relationship to his testamentary intention at the time he executed a will some three years and eight months thereafter. Thus, they shed no light on his later testamentary intent as to apportionment of the mortgage debt. See <em>In re Fox, </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>587, 594 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">It is to be noted that if the apportionment contended for by plaintiffs was applied there would be $5,818.75 levied against defendant\u2019s property, worth only $6,000. We do not believe we can attribute an intention to the testator to give his \u201cfriend\u201d so valueless a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We conclude that, since there is no clear provision to the contrary in testator\u2019s will, the general rule of apportionment upon the basis of proportional value should be applied. <em>Stuyvesant, supra. </em>It has been stipulated that as of the date of testator\u2019s death plaintiffs\u2019 property was valued at $22,000 and defendant\u2019s at $6,000. Therefore, the present balance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the mortgage should be apportioned so that plaintiffs pay 22/28 and defendant pays 6/28 thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Judgment reversed and remanded to the trial court for the entry of a judgment in accordance herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
