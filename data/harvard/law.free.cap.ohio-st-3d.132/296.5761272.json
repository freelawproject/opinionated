Sizemore contends that the original order was not in compliance with R.C. 119.09, preventing her from pursuing an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">{\u00b6 2} Sizemore is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief, because the objective of her administrative appeal \u2014 to reverse the board\u2019s finding of miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>duct and imposition of fines \u2014 has been achieved with the board\u2019s dismissal of the charges against her. <em>See State ex rel. Sawyer v. Cendroski, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 50, 2008-Ohio-1771, 885 N.E.2d 938, \u00b6 8 (mandamus claim is moot when its objective has been obtained).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ap0\">Terrie Sizemore, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ApB\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Walter J. McNamara, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 3} Nor did the board have any duty to reissue its prior adjudication order finding Sizemore guilty of misconduct. Instead, as the court of appeals properly held, the board has \u201cthe inherent power to dismiss charges against an individual who has had claims of misconduct levied against her or him.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Sizemore v. Ohio Veterinary Med. Bd., </em>10th Dist. No. 11AP-298, 2012-Ohio-63, 2012 WL 68887, at \u00b6 13. The remand orders of the court of appeals and the common pleas court did not prevent the board from dismissing the charges. <em>See State ex rel. Jelinek v. Schneider, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 332, 2010-Ohio-5986, 939 N.E.2d 847, \u00b6 14 (court that issued mandate is in the best position to interpret it).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 4} Finally, in the absence of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, Sizemore has an adequate remedy by way of a motion for contempt to raise her claim that the board violated the court of appeals\u2019 mandate to reissue its adjudication order. <em>See Dzina v. Celebrezze, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 385, 2006-Ohio-1195, 843 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 14 (\u201cthe use of extraordinary relief to enforce a judgment is not widespread, because of the availability of other means of enforcement, e.g., motion for contempt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.
