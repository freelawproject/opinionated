Culgan, for writs of mandamus and procedendo to compel appellee, Medina County Court of Common Pleas Judge Christopher J. Collier, to correct his sex-offender classification to classify him as a sexually oriented offender instead of a sexual predator. Insofar as Culgan sought to control Judge Collier\u2019s exercise of judicial discretion, neither mandamus nor procedendo can be used to control that discretion, even if it is abused. <em>State ex rel. Fontanella v. Kontos, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 514, 2008-Ohio-1431, 885 N.E.2d 220, \u00b6 7. Culgan had an adequate remedy by way of appeal from the judgment classifying him as a sexual predator to raise his claims of error. <em>See State ex rel. Hudson v. Sutula, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 177, 2012-Ohio-554, 962 N.E.2d 798, \u00b6 1 (\u201cNeither mandamus nor procedendo will issue if the party seeking extraordinary relief has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law\u201d); <em>State v. Sparks, </em>9th Dist. No. 25320, 2011-Ohio-3245, 2011 WL 2571525, \u00b6 8 (sex-offender classification constitutes final, appealable order even when the sentencing entry itself is not a final, appealable order for lack of compliance with Crim.R. 32(C)); <em>State v. Gibson, </em>2d Dist. No. 2009 CA 47, 2010-Ohio-3447, 2010 WL 2891512, \u00b6 25 (appeal from sex-offender classification is legally distinct from an appeal from the underlying sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-13\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A0i\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Dean Holman, Medina County Prosecuting Attorney, and Matthew Kern, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
