Sutula of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, to rule on Compton\u2019s motions for jail-time credit. The writ was denied.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ajt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>John Compton, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Afm\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and James E. Moss, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">{\u00b62} By separate entry, the appellate court denied Compton\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to add a claim seeking to compel appellee to issue a final, appealable order in Compton\u2019s criminal case. In so ruling, the court rejected Compton\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s nunc pro tunc sentencing entry was defective under Crim.R. 32(C) and therefore not final and appealable, leaving him without a remedy. It is from this ruling that Compton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 3} The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying Compton\u2019s motion because any order to comply with Crim.R. 32(C) to correct a clerical error in his original sentencing entry would not constitute a final, appealable order from which a new appeal may be taken. <em>State v. Lester, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 303, 2011-Ohio-5204, 958 N.E.2d 142, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 4} Moreover, Compton waived his claim that Judge Sutula could not rely on a nunc pro tunc order to rectify any error in his sentencing entry because he failed to raise the claim in the court of appeals. <em>See State ex rel DeGroot v. Tilsley, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 311, 2011-Ohio-231, 943 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 5} Finally, Compton\u2019s claims concerning jail-time credit were rendered moot when he was released from prison. <em>State ex rel.
