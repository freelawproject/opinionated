Duncan asserts that his current sentencing entry is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">{\u00b6 2} Contrary to Duncan\u2019s assertion, to be final and appealable, the sentencing entry did not need to contain a disposition concerning specifications that Duncan was charged with but was not convicted of. <em>See State ex rel. Rose v. McGinty, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 371, 2011-Ohio-761, 944 N.E.2d 672, \u00b6 3; <em>State ex rel. Davis v. Cuyahoga Cty.

Mayer Jr., Richland County Prosecuting Attorney, and Jill M. Cochran, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">{\u00b6 3} The December 8, 2009 sentencing entry for Duncan fully complies with Crim.R. 32(C) and R.C. 2505.02 because it states that he was convicted by a jury of specified crimes, it sets forth the sentence, it is signed by the judge, and it was entered upon the journal by the clerk of court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Rose </em>at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, Duncan is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus to compel Judge DeWeese to enter a new sentencing entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b702-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\">. The entry orders Duncan to \u201cpay restitution for medical expenses to Kathy Ward, Richard Miller, or providers.\u201d In a subsequent entry denying Duncan\u2019s motion for resentencing, the court stated that Duncan owed no monetary restitution. The entries thus resolved any issue concerning restitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
