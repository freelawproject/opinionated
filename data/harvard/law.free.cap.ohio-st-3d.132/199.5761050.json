Because the court of appeals erred in dismissing the appeal, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>application of <em>Havel v. Villa St. Joseph, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 235, 2012-Ohio-552, 963 N.E.2d 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 2} In January 2010, appellees, John T. Flynn and Judy Gordon, executors of the estate of Gladys F. Feran, deceased, filed a complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas against appellants, Fairview Village Retirement Community, Ltd., d.b.a. Lakewood Village Retirement Community, Saber Healthcare Group, L.L.C., and Saber Management, Inc., as well as Michael Francus and several unknown entities and individuals. Appellees\u2019 complaint alleged negligence, violation of the Ohio Nursing Home Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights, violation of federal law under C.F.R. Title 42, wrongful death, and falsification of medical records. Appellees demanded compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 3} Appellants filed motions to bifurcate the trial to separate appellees\u2019 claims for compensatory damages from their claims for punitive damages, pursuant to R.C. 2315.21(B)(1). The common pleas court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants appealed the common pleas court\u2019s denial of their motions to bifurcate, and the court of appeals sua sponte dismissed their appeal for lack of a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02. The court of appeals cited <em>Finley v. First Realty Property Mgt., Ltd., </em>9th Dist. No. 23355, 2007-Ohio-2888, 2007 WL 1695116. We accepted appellants\u2019 appeal from that judgment, 127 Ohio St.3d 1531, 2011-Ohio-376, 940 N.E.2d 985, and the parties submitted briefs and oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 5} Article IV, Section 3(B)(2) of the Ohio Constitution establishes that courts of appeals \u201cshall have such jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or <em>final orders </em>of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See State ex rel. Bates v. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Appellate Dist., </em>130 Ohio St.3d 326, 2011-Ohio-5456, 958 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 14. \u201cR.C. 2505.03(A) limits the appellate jurisdiction of courts of appeals to the review of final orders, judgments, or decrees.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bd. of State Teachers Retirement Sys. of Ohio v. Davis, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 410, 2007-Ohio-2205, 865 N.E.2d 1289, \u00b6 44. An order must satisfy the criteria of R.C. 2505.02 to constitute a final, appealable order. <em>Gehm v. Timberline Post &amp; Frame, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 514, 2007-Ohio-607, 861 N.E.2d 519, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">{\u00b6 6} Under R.C. 2505.02(B)(6), an order is a final, appealable order if it is \u201c[a]n order determining the constitutionality of * * * any changes made by Sub.S.B. 80 of the 125th general assembly, including the amendment of section[ ] * * * 2315.21 of the Revised Code.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 80, 150 Ohio Laws, Part V, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>7915, 7969 (\u201cS.B. 80\u201d), amended R.C. 2315.21(B) in 2004 to require a trial court, on motion of any party, to bifurcate a tort action to allow presentation of the claims for compensatory and punitive damages in separate stages. <em>Havel, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 235, 2012-Ohio-552, 963 N.E.2d 1270, \u00b6 13. By contrast, Civ.R. 42(B) vests discretion in a trial court to order a separate trial of any claims or issues in civil actions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Anq\">Seaman Garson, L.L.C., David H. Krause, and Joyce E. Carlozzi, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 7} By denying appellants\u2019 motions to bifurcate under R.C. 2315.21(B), the trial court implicitly determined that the S.B. 80 amendment to the statutory provision is unconstitutional, i.e., that Civ.R. 42(B) prevails over the conflicting statutory provision. <em>See Hanners v. Ho Wah Genting Wire &amp; Cable SDN BHD, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-361, 2009-Ohio-6481, 2009 WL 4698618, \u00b6 13; <em>Havel v. Villa St. Joseph, </em>8th Dist. No. 94677, 2010-Ohio-5251, 2010 WL 4308208, \u00b6 19, <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 235, 2012-Ohio-552, 963 N.E.2d 1270; <em>Myers v. Brown, </em>192 Ohio App.3d 670, 2011-Ohio-892, 950 N.E.2d 213 (5th Dist.), \u00b6 6-10, <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 17, 2012-Ohio-1577, 967 N.E.2d 1212. Notably, the court of appeals\u2019 lone case citation in support of its dismissal was a case that discussed whether an order to bifurcate a civil trial pursuant to Civ.R. 42(B) constituted a final, appealable order and did not consider the applicability of R.C. 2505.02(B)(6). <em>Finley, </em>2007-Ohio-2888, 2007 WL 1695116, at \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 8} Therefore, consistent with the foregoing precedent, we hold that the trial court\u2019s order denying appellants\u2019 motions under R.C. 2315.21(B) to bifurcate the trial into separate stages for appellees\u2019 claims for compensatory damages and punitive damages constituted a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals erred in dismissing the appeal for lack of a final, appealable order. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the court of appeals for application of <em>Havel, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 235, 2012-Ohio-552, 963 N.E.2d 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b377-11\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AVP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Poling &amp; Petrello, Brant E.
