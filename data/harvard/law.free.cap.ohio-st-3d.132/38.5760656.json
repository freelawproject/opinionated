Trustees of Indiana Univ., </em>787 N.E.2d 893, 909 (IndApp.2003) (ordering trial court on remand \u2014 in public-records case brought by newspaper against university trustees \u2014 to redact any portion of records that might contain \u201cinformation that could identify any present <em>or former students </em>in violation of the confidentiality mandated by FERPA\u201d [emphasis added]); R.C. 3319.321(B).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVR\">Sidney Lee Souffrance, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AKa\">Janik, L.L.P., Steven G. Janik, Audrey K. Bentz, and Sean T. Needham, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-12\">. Souffrance does not raise the contention that FERPA merely sets conditions on the receipt of federal funds and does not constitute a prohibition on the release of public records under R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v), which exempts \u201c[r]ecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law,\u201d so we need not address that issue in this appeal. <em>Compare State ex rel. ESPN v. Ohio State Univ., </em>case No. 2011-1177, where that issue is raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
