Pierron v. Indus. Comm., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 40, 2008-Ohio-5245, 896 N.E.2d 140, \u00b6 9. Appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio denied appellant Ronald R. Corman\u2019s application for TTC after finding, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>things, that Corman had abandoned the work force for reasons unrelated to his injury. Corman challenges that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 2} Corman has an allowed workers\u2019 compensation claim arising from a 2002 injury. He retired from appellee Allied Holdings, Inc. a year later and never worked again. The record contains no evidence that he was medically incapable of other work. In 2009, the commission denied Corman\u2019s request to have TTC reinstated. It found, among other things, that Corman\u2019s retirement was voluntary and unrelated to his injury. The commission noted that Corman never sought other work in the years after he left Allied Holdings, thus demonstrating his intent to permanently abandon the labor market.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 3} Corman filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission had abused its discretion in denying TTC. The court of appeals, however, agreed that Corman had abandoned the work force for reasons unrelated to his injury and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 4} This cause is now before this court on Corman\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 5} TTC compensates claimants \u201cfor the loss of earnings which he [or she] incurs while the injury heals.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm., </em>34 Ohio St.3d 42, 44, 517 N.E.2d 533 (1987). There \u201ccan be no lost earnings, however, or even a potential for lost earnings, if the claimant is no longer part of the active work force.\u201d <em>Pierron </em>at \u00b6 9. Thus, \u201c[w]hen the reason for this absence from the work force is unrelated to the industrial injury, temporary total disability compensation is foreclosed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 6} There are important similarities between the case before us and <em>Pierron. </em>Both claimants sought TTC years after retiring from their former positions of employment. In those intervening years, neither individual made a credible effort to secure other employment. Neither claimant produced evidence of a medical inability to perform other work during those years, prompting the commission to conclude in each case that the claimant had permanently left the work force. In upholding the commission\u2019s order in <em>Pierron, </em>we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">[w]hen a departure from the entire work force is not motivated by injury, we presume it to be a lifestyle choice, and as we stated in <em>State ex rel. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Morse </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 210, 216, 648 N.E.2d 827, workers\u2019 compensation benefits were never intended to subsidize lost or diminished earnings attributable to lifestyle decisions. In this case, the injured worker did not choose to leave his employer in 1997 [i.e., his job was eliminated], but once that separation nevertheless occurred, Pierron had a choice: seek other employment or work no further. Pierron chose the latter. He cannot therefore credibly allege that his lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>income from 2001 and beyond is due to industrial injury. Accordingly, he is ineligible for temporary total disability compensation.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AI7U\">Clements, Mahin &amp; Cohen Co., L.P.A., William E. Clements, and Paul A.

Corman contends that he retired from his former position of employment with Allied Holdings because of his injury \u2014 a claim that was not made in <em>Pierron. </em>The commission, however, did not find that Corman\u2019s departure from Allied Holdings was injury-induced, but even if it had, that finding would not advance his cause. As in <em>Pierron, </em>there was no evidence of a medical inability to perform other work in the years between Corman\u2019s departure from Allied Holdings and his request for TTC, so Corman had the same choice as Pierron \u2014 seek other employment or work no further. When Corman elected the latter, he eliminated the possibility of, or potential for, lost wages. He cannot, therefore, credibly assert that he has lost income due to his industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 8} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
