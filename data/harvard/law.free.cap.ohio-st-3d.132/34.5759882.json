Hillman, for a show-cause contempt order against appellee, Judge Susan Brown of the Tenth District Court of Appeals, based on a judgment she entered in consolidated appeals involving Hillman. <em>Hillman v. Brown, </em>10th Dist. No. 11AP-22 (Sept. 29, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">{\u00b6 2} As constitutionally created courts, courts of appeals have inherent power to punish contempt. <em>See State ex rel. Johnson v. Perry Cty. Court, 25 </em>Ohio St.3d 53, 54, 495 N.E.2d 16 (1986), citing <em>State ex rel. Turner v. Albin, </em>118 Ohio St. 527, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>161 N.E. 792 (1928), paragraph one of the syllabus. But Hillman did not file his contempt motion in the pertinent appeals before the court of appeals; instead, he sought to invoke the original jurisdiction of the court of appeals with a complaint for a show-cause contempt order in a separate, new case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad6\">Robert L. Hillman, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AYy\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Eric Butcher-Lyden and Damian W.. Sikora, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 3} Hillman\u2019s complaint thus invoked neither the original nor the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeals under the Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 3(B), and was properly dismissed. <em>See Brock v. Niemeyer, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 80, 2011-Ohio-4704, 955 N.E.2d 981, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
