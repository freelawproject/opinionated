For the reasons that follow, we hold that it does. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">{\u00b6 2} On December 9, 2009, appellants, Donald and Tamara Troyer, filed a medical-malpractice complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas against appellee, Leonard J. Janis. In response, Janis filed a motion for summary judgment in which he alleged that the claims asserted against him in the complaint had already been filed and dismissed in a previous action and were now barred by the doctrine of res judicata. In support of his motion, Janis attached a copy of the complaint in the prior case, the trial court\u2019s decision granting his motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to file an affidavit of merit, and the court\u2019s judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">{\u00b6 3} The Troyers opposed summary judgment on the basis that the previous dismissal for failure to attach an affidavit of merit was a dismissal without prejudice. The Troyers relied on <em>Fletcher v. Univ. Hosps. of Cleveland, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 167, 2008-Ohio-5379, 897 N.E.2d 147, which held that a dismissal for failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to file the required affidavit is an adjudication otherwise than on the merits and is therefore a dismissal without prejudice. Thus, the Troyers argued, dismissal of their previous complaint did not bar refiling under the saving statute, which permits refiling of an action that has failed otherwise than on the merits. R.C. 2305.19(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">{\u00b6 4} But the trial court construed the previous judgment entry, which did not specify whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice, as a dismissal with prejudice. The court relied on <em>Nicely v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr., </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-187, 2009-Ohio-4386, 2009 WL 2623709, which held that under Civ.R. 41(B)(3), dismissal is with prejudice unless the entry specifies otherwise. Consequently, the court concluded that the dismissal had been a final judgment and that the current complaint was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court granted summary judgment for Janis.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 5} The Franklin County Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Troyer v. Janis, </em>10th Dist. No. 10AP-434, 2011-Ohio-2538, 2011 WL 2112512. The cause is before this court upon our acceptance of a discretionary appeal. 129 Ohio St.3d 1504, 2011-Ohio-5358, 955 N.E.2d 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 6} In reviewing whether the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment was proper, we apply a de novo review. <em>Smith v. McBride, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 51, 2011-Ohio-4674, 955 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 12. Thus, viewing the pleadings in the light most favorable to the Troyers, we must determine whether Janis was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 7} Civ.R. 10(D)(2) requires that every complaint containing a medical claim as defined in R.C. 2305.113 must include an affidavit of merit from an expert witness. We have held that the purpose of the affidavit of merit is to establish the adequacy of the complaint and thus deter the filing of frivolous medical-malpractice claims. <em>Fletcher, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 167, 2008-Ohio-5379, 897 N.E.2d 147, \u00b6 10. The rule also specifically provides that \u201c[a]ny dismissal for the failure to comply with this rule shall operate as a failure otherwise than on the merits.\u201d Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(d). We held in <em>Fletcher </em>that a dismissal for failure to comply with the rule is a dismissal without prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 8} In this case, the parties agree that the complaint in the previous case was properly dismissed due to the Troyers\u2019 failure to attach an affidavit of merit as required by Civ.R. 10(D)(2). The parties also agree that the trial court\u2019s entry of dismissal was silent as to whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. The Troyers contend that under <em>Fletcher, </em>the previous dismissal was an adjudication otherwise than on the merits and thus was without prejudice, by operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>law, regardless of the failure of the entry to so specify. Thus, they were permitted to refile the action using the saving statute, R.C. 2305.19(A). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 9} <em>Fletcher </em>examined the proper procedural remedy when a plaintiff fails to attach an affidavit of merit to a complaint. The trial court had granted a defense motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) and dismissed the case <em>with </em>prejudice. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that the proper remedy for a defendant under these circumstances was to request a more definite statement. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Fletcher, </em>we held that the trial court properly dismissed the case, but that the dismissal should have been <em>without </em>prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15-18. Because Civ.R. 10(D)(2) requires an affidavit of merit to be attached to the complaint, when one is not attached, the proper remedy is to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Such a dismissal is not based on the merits of the case, but on the insufficiency of the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. We held that \u201c[a] dismissal of a complaint for failure to file the affidavit required by'Civ.R. 10(D)(2) is an adjudication otherwise than on the merits. The dismissal, therefore, is without prejudice.\u201d 120 Ohio St.3d 167, 2008-Ohio-5379, 897 N.E.2d 147, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 11} In this case, because the previous dismissal entry did not specify whether it was with or without prejudice (unlike the entry in <em>Fletcher, </em>which erroneously stated that it was with prejudice), the trial court applied <em>Nicely, </em>2009-Ohio-4386, 2009 WL 2623709, and Civ.R. 41(B)(3) in support of its conclusion that the previous dismissal entry was <em>with </em>prejudice. But a close reading of <em>Nicely </em>demonstrates that it further supports the Troyers\u2019 position that a court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for lack of an affidavit of merit is <em>without </em>prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Nicely, </em>the trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to attach an affidavit of merit, but the court\u2019s entry did not specify whether the dismissal was with, or without, prejudice. <em>Id., </em>2009-Ohio-4386, 2009 WL 2623709, \u00b6 3. On appeal, Nicely argued that the dismissal must be considered as having been without prejudice, citing <em>Fletcher. </em>The <em>Nicely </em>court of appeals held that the trial court properly had dismissed the complaint for lack of a Civ.R. 10(D)(2) affidavit of merit, <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 6, but agreed that under <em>Fletcher, </em>it was error to dismiss the case with prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14. The appellate court acknowledged that generally, under Civ.R. 41(B)(3), when the entry is silent, the dismissal is with prejudice. But when the dismissal is for failure to attach the affidavit required by Civ.R. 10(D)(2), <em>Fletcher </em>and Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(d) dictate that the dismissal must be without prejudice. <em>Nicely </em>at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 13} Janis urges us to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. He argues that the Troyers did nothing to correct the previous judgment entry to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>include the phrase \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d that they did not appeal, and that, as a result, the previous entry became a final judgment. Thus, Janis urges, the refiled claim is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 14} We need not reach the issue of res judicata because, applying Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(d) and <em>Fletcher, </em>we conclude that the previous dismissal was an adjudication otherwise than on the merits and thus, <em>without </em>prejudice by operation of law. First, Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(d) expressly provides that <em>\u201c[a]ny dismissal </em>for the failure to comply with this rule shall operate as a failure otherwise than on the merits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Second, <em>Fletcher </em>recognized that this language can mean only that such dismissals are without prejudice. A close reading of <em>Nicely </em>only confirms the correctness of <em>Fletcher\u2019s </em>application of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 15} Here, we have a specific rule, Civ.R. 10(D)(2), which applies only to cases involving a medical claim, requires an affidavit of merit in these cases, and explicitly provides that any dismissal for failure to comply shall be a dismissal otherwise than on the merits. Under these circumstances, it is customary to apply th\u00e9 more specific provision, the one meant to govern the particular situation involved, rather than the more general rule. Moreover, we must construe the Civil Rules \u201cto effect just results\u201d and promote \u201cthe expeditious administration of justice.\u201d Civ.R. 1(B). Thus, the previous entry\u2019s silence on the matter of prejudice does not affect the application of Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, Janis argues that the Troyers should have appealed the previous judgment \u2014 as the plaintiff did in <em>Nicely </em>\u2014 thereby giving the appellate court an opportunity to correct the error. But we have held that the previous dismissal was, by operation of law under Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(d), without prejudice. Thus, the Troyers\u2019 failure to appeal that dismissal was irrelevant. They reserved their right to continue their suit by refiling them complaint within the time period set forth in R.C. 2305.19(A). This approach has the additional advantage of avoiding the delay engendered by yet another unnecessary procedural hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 17} Based on the clear language of Civ.R. 10(D)(2) and <em>Fletcher, </em>we hold that a dismissal of a complaint for failure to attach the affidavit of merit required by Civ.R. 10(D)(2) is an adjudication otherwise than on the merits and is a dismissal without prejudice by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">{\u00b6 18} The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aer\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Leeseberg &amp; Valentine, Anne M.
