Davis was indicted for witness intimidation based on a threat he made to his ex-wife after police began investigating the underlying crime but before any charges had been filed. Under these facts, the appellate court found that no \u201caction or proceeding\u201d existed at the time of the threat. Therefore, the victim of the threat was not a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">{\u00b6 3} As we recently explained, R.C. 2921.04(B) does not apply \u201cwhen the intimidation occurred after the criminal act but prior to any proceedings flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Malone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614, \u00b6 10. A police investigation, without more, is not a \u201cproceeding[ ] flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice.\u201d Therefore, Davis\u2019s ex-wife was not a witness pursuant to R.C. 2921.04(B) at the Isime of the threat.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">{\u00b6 4} This case stems from an extended chase and altercation involving Davis and a deputy sheriff that ended when Davis drove his ex-wife\u2019s minivan within feet of the deputy sheriff, who was on foot. The deputy fired at Davis, and was injured, while dodging the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Davis fled the scene. He traveled to the home of his ex-wife, where he changed out of bloodstained clothes and tried to conceal damage to the minivan from the altercation. Davis warned his ex-wife that she should lie about the incident or he would kill her and blow up her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 6} Davis was later apprehended and indicted on four counts: one count of felonious assault of a peace officer under R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), two counts of tampering with evidence under R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), and one count of intimidation of a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B). After a trial, a jury found Davis guilty of one count of tampering with evidence (relating to taping over bullet holes in the minivan) and one count of intimidation of a witness, and it found Davis not guilty of the second count of tampering with evidence (relating to efforts to conceal bloodstains on his clothing). However, a mistrial was declared with respect to the assault charge after the jury failed to reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court sentenced Davis to two years on the tampering-with-evidence conviction and four years on the intimidation-of-a-witness conviction, to be served concurrently. The trial court also imposed three years of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, Davis argued that the conviction of witness intimidation was not supported by sufficient evidence and that it was against the manifest weight of the evidence. He also claimed that the conviction of tampering with evidence was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">{\u00b6 9} The Second District Court of Appeals affirmed Davis\u2019s conviction of tampering with evidence. <em>State v. Davis, </em>193 Ohio App.3d 130, 2011-Ohio-1280, 951 N.E.2d 138, \u00b6 46 (2d Dist.). The appellate court, however, vacated Davis\u2019s conviction of witness intimidation. Because \u201cthere had only been an offense reported and a police investigation initiated, there was insufficient evidence of a criminal action or proceeding to sustain a conviction for witness intimidation in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29. In reaching this conclusion, the appellate court relied on our decision in <em>Malone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614, interpreting \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d in R.C. 2921.04(B) to require \u201c \u2018proceedings flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice\u2019 \u201d in order to convict a defendant of witness intimidation. (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Davis </em>at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">{\u00b6 10} The state appealed, raising one proposition of law: \u201cA conviction for intimidation of a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B) is sustainable when the witness is threatened after law enforcement officers have commenced investigation in a case.\u201d We accepted review. 129 Ohio St.3d 1449, 2011-Ohio-4217, 951 N.E.2d 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\n<em>Analysis of R.C. 2921.04(B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2921.04(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">No person, knowingly and by force or by unlawful threat of harm to any person or property, shall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder the victim of a crime in the filing or prosecution of criminal charges or an attorney or witness involved in a criminal action or proceeding in the discharge of the duties of the attorney or witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Under R.C. 2921.04(D), the offense is a third-degree felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 12} For the purpose of this appeal, the critical language of R.C. 2921.04(B) is \u201cinvolved in a criminal action or proceeding.\u201d We recently reviewed this language. In <em>Malone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614, we addressed a conflict in the appellate courts regarding the requirements for qualifying as a witness under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 13} Shortly after committing a rape, Malone threatened a person who observed the crime as it occurred. The victim had not reported the crime at the time of the threat. Because \u201c[t]he statute requires a witness\u2019s <em>involvement </em>in a criminal action or proceeding, not his or her potential involvement,\u201d we held that the person who observed the crime was not yet a witness when she was threatened. (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. Thus, we affirmed the decision reversing Malone\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 14} In the instant appeal, the state seizes upon our remark in <em>Malone </em>that \u201cwhen no crime has been reported and no investigation or prosecution has been initiated, a witness is not \u2018involved in a criminal action or proceeding\u2019 for purposes of R.C. 2921.04(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30. That statement, which appears in the conclusion of the <em>Malone </em>opinion, applied the holding of the decision to the specific facts of the case. It did not alter our clear holding that \u201ca conviction for intimidation of a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B) is not sustainable when the intimidation occurred after the criminal act but prior to any proceedings flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice.\u201d <em>Malone </em>at \u00b6 10. Instead, the remark emphasized that Malone\u2019s threat occurred long before the threat victim qualified as a witness under the statute, so the statute did not apply. <em>Malone </em>stands for the proposition that a \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d under R.C. 2921.04(B) requires the formal initiation of proceedings such as criminal charges or grand jury proceedings, not merely the investigation of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">{\u00b6 15} In the present case, a police investigation had begun before Davis threatened his ex-wife; indeed, police awareness of the acts leading to Davis\u2019s felonious-assault charge was immediate because the victim was a deputy. But no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d was initiated until later, when the state filed charges against Davis. Therefore, no \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d was underway at the time of the threat, and R.C. 2921.04(B) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 16} Moreover, R.C. 2921.04(B) has not changed since we issued our decision in <em>Malone; </em>our holding in that decision remains sound. Throughout the Revised Code, \u201c \u2018criminal action or proceeding\u2019 * * * indicates the involvement of a court.\u201d <em>Malone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614, at \u00b6 15; <em>see also id. </em>at \u00b6 18 (\u201cAs demonstrated in Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme and in this court\u2019s case law, a \u2018criminal action or proceeding\u2019 implies a formal process involving a court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 17} In this statute, the General Assembly has not only employed language indicating the need for court involvement, it has provided a stark contrast by pairing the witness-protection language with language explicitly protecting crime victims from intimidation immediately after a criminal act. <em>Compare </em>R.C. 2921.04(A) with (B). \u201cA key to our analysis is the clear-cut difference between the protections afforded victims and witnesses under the statute. * * * The General Assembly in R.C. 2921.04(B) could have protected witnesses from intimidation immediately upon their witnessing a criminal act, but it did not.\u201d <em>Malone </em>at \u00b6 19, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 18} We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly. Threats to prospective witnesses cause real harm to the administration of justice, as we recognized in <em>Malone. </em>But we are limited by the language chosen by the General Assembly to define the crime of witness intimidation, and we cannot apply that language to conduct outside the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2921.04(B) prohibits the intimidation of a person who observes a crime after the initiation of proceedings flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice. A police investigation of a crime, without more, is not a proceeding in a court of justice, and it does not invoke the protection of R.C. 2921.04(B) for a person who observes the crime. \u25a0 Therefore, the Second District Court of Appeals correctly determined that insufficient evidence exists to convict Davis for witness intimidation based on his threat to his ex-wife. We affirm the decision reversing Davis\u2019s conviction under R.C. 2921.04(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b204-12\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AE_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Mathias H.

However, since the General Assembly has chosen to amend the statute to cover these situations, 2011 Sub.H.B. No. 20, this case will have limited impact.
