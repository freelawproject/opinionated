Maroon sought the writ to compel appellee, Ohio State Highway Patrol Retirement System, to find that he is a member of the State Highway Patrol fund and is eligible to apply for disability-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>retirement benefits and to receive a hearing on his claim. The court of appeals adopted the decision of its magistrate, including her findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ApH\">Marc G. Doumbas, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AOer\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Dennis P. Smith Jr. and Catherine J. Calko, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 2} Because Maroon failed to object to the magistrate\u2019s decision and his proposition of law challenges the conclusions of law in that decision as adopted by the court of appeals, he waived any error made by the court of appeals in adopting the magistrate\u2019s conclusions and denying the writ. <em>See </em>Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iv) (\u201cExcept for a claim of plain error, a party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any factual finding or legal conclusion, whether or not specifically designated as a finding of fact or conclusion of law under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(ii), unless the party has objected to that finding or conclusion as required by Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)\u201d); Loc.R. 12(M)(1) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals (\u201cthe proceedings and decision of the magistrate and objections thereto shall be governed by Civ.R. 53\u201d); <em>State ex rel.
