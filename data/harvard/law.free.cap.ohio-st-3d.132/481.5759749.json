Wolff, sitting by assignment in the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas, to release all records that were sealed in <em>State v. Cafaro, </em>Mahoning Cty. C.P. Nos. 2010 CR 800 and 800A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>a writ of prohibition to compel the judge to vacate his December 21, 2010 and August 24, 2011 decisions in those cases and to prohibit him from issuing further orders presumptively sealing any documents or records in the cases. Because relators have established their entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief based on the Superintendence Rules, we grant the writs. This renders moot relators\u2019 remaining claims based on the United States and Ohio Constitutions, the common law, and R.C. 149.43, the Ohio Public Records Act. Relators are not entitled to an award of attorney fees, because the Superintendence Rules do not specifically authorize such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 2} In late July 2010, a Mahoning County grand jury returned a 73-count indictment charging seven persons, including current and former public officials, and three organizations with felony and misdemeanor charges, including engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, conspiracy, perjury, bribery, money laundering, tampering with records, disclosure of confidential information, conflict of interest, filing a false financial-disclosure statement, and soliciting or accepting improper compensation. The cases are designated as <em>State v. Cafaro, </em>Mahoning C.P. Nos. 2010 CR 800 and 800(A) through (I), with the defendants as follows: 2010 CR 800, Anthony M. Cafaro Sr.; A, the Cafaro Company; B, Ohio Valley Mall Company; C, the Marion Plaza, Inc.; D, John A. McNally IV; E, John Reardon; F, Michael V. Sciortino; G, John Zachariah; H, Martin Yavorcik; and I, Flora Cafaro. Anthony Cafaro is the retired president of the Cafaro Company, Flora Cafaro is Anthony Cafaro\u2019s sister and a part owner of the Cafaro Company, Ohio Valley Mall Company and the Marion Plaza, Inc. are affiliates of the Cafaro Company, McNally is a Mahoning County commissioner, Sciortino is the Mahoning County auditor, Reardon is the former Mahoning County treasurer, Zachariah is the former director of the Mahoning County Department of Job and Family Services, and Yavorcik is an attorney who ran an unsuccessful 2008 campaign for Mahoning County prosecuting attorney. The charges stemmed from the unsuccessful attempts of Anthony Cafaro and the Cafaro-related entities to keep the Mahoning County Department of Job and Family Services located at a site owned by the Ohio Valley Mall Company, operating through Marion Plaza, Inc., which received rental income from the county while located there.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 3} The Cafaro defendants \u2014 Anthony M. Cafaro Sr., Flora Cafaro, the Cafaro Company, Ohio Valley Mall Company, and the Marion Plaza, Inc. \u2014 filed a joint motion for a bill of particulars, and the state filed a notice of intent to voluntarily comply. After the state provided bills of particulars for defendants Flora Cafaro and Yavorcik that resulted in local newspaper articles, including one from the Vindicator, the attorneys for the Cafaro defendants submitted a letter to respondent, Judge William H. Wolff Jr., who is sitting by assignment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>underlying criminal eases. In their unfiled letter, the Cafaro defendants requested that the state be ordered either to produce its bills of particulars 14 days in advance of filing to afford them the opportunity to apply for relief or to file its bills of particulars under seal to permit them to move to redact the portions they challenge. The Cafaro defendants claimed that the presumptive sealing of the bills of particulars was appropriate because the state\u2019s responses endangered their ability to receive a fair trial. The state submitted a letter to the judge objecting to the request. This response was also not filed as a matter of public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 4} The judge held a private, pretrial proceeding with the parties\u2019 counsel that resulted in a September 9, 2010 decision in which he granted the defendants\u2019 pending discovery motions. The judge ordered that all filings in the case \u201cshall be under seal with the exception of filings that are clearly procedural and cannot possibly implicate Defendants\u2019 concern about receiving a fair trial.\u201d He also specified that the defendants had 14 days from filing to object to the state\u2019s filing and that the state had 14 days to respond, with counsel permitted to request a hearing. Following an editorial that appeared in the Vindicator, the judge issued a supplemental order on September 14, 2010, in which he further explained that his \u201cfiling under seal protocol\u201d was based on the \u201csignificant media coverage\u201d that the criminal cases had attracted and his obligation \u201cto balance the right of the defendants to a fair trial and the right of the public to be informed of these proceedings through the media or through personal examination of the record.\u201d The judge was concerned with whether \u201cfair and impartial potential jurors can be found in Mahoning County, i.e., potential jurors without preconceived notions of how this case should be decided that they cannot set aside due to pretrial publicity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 5} Based on the September 9 and 14, 2010 orders, various filings, including the Cafaro defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss the indictment and memorandum in support, were filed under seal. The Cafaro defendants also filed under seal a motion to seal, until after trial, all bills of particulars and notices of intent to introduce Evid.R. 404(B) \u201cother acts\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 6} In November 2010, relators, the Vindicator Printing Company, which publishes the Vindicator, a daily newspaper distributed principally in Mahoning County, and WFMJ Television, Inc., which broadcasts news in Mahoning County, submitted to the judge and the Mahoning County clerk of courts requests to inspect and copy filings and documents submitted to the court in the criminal cases, including those that had been filed under seal. When relators were not provided with access to some of the requested records, they filed a motion for an order vacating the September 9 and 14, 2010 sealing orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On December 6, 2010, the court held a hearing on the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to seal the bills of particulars and notices of intent to introduce evidence under Evid.R. 404(B) and relators\u2019 motion to vacate the prior sealing orders. At the hearing, the Cafaro defendants submitted the testimony of their sole witness, Ohio University journalism professor Hugh J. Martin. Martin testified that the Vindicator was distributed to about 40 percent of Mahoning County households for Mondays through Saturdays and to almost 50 percent of county households on Sundays and that WFMJ claimed to have the most-watched newscasts in Mahoning County. Martin referred to the Vindicator\u2019s coverage of the criminal cases as \u201cvery tough\u201d on the defendants and \u201csharply drawn\u201d to emphasize the allegations against them, but he conceded that he could not say whether the newspaper statements were true or false. The defendants had themselves issued press releases proclaiming their innocence of the charges and a eable-TV infomercial. Ultimately, Martin testified that he had \u201cno idea\u201d whether relators\u2019 coverage of the cases prevented the impaneling of an impartial jury or tainted the jury pool, because that was not his \u201carea of expertise.\u201d He also conceded that he could not render an opinion on whether opening the proceedings (i.e., unsealing the records) would impede the impaneling of a jury. One of the Cafaro defendants\u2019 attorneys admitted that he was not saying that they would be unable to pick a fair jury if the judge unsealed part of the bill of particulars, but merely that the jury-selection process would be burdened in the absence of a sealing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 8} On December 21, 2010, the judge issued a decision in which he granted the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to seal the bills of particulars that had not yet been filed as a public record \u2014 the bills of particulars for the Cafaro defendants and Zachariah \u2014 as well as any Evid.R. 404(B) notices. He determined that the bills of particulars and Evid.R. 404(B) notices of other-acts evidence were in the nature of discovery and were not entitled to any presumption of public access and that even if they were entitled to a presumption of public access, that presumption was outweighed by the substantial probability that the defendants\u2019 right to a fair trial in Mahoning County would be prejudiced. With these exceptions, the judge also \u201csustained prospectively\u201d relators\u2019 motion to vacate his September 9 and 14, 2010 sealing orders. But he continued a protocol in which the state would submit to defense counsel, prior to filing, any document that \u201ccan be reasonably expected to trigger a concern on the part of defense counsel that publication of the document will prejudice the impaneling of an impartial jury in Mahoning County,\u201d thus giving the opportunity for the defendants to file a motion to seal, which would be served on relators\u2019 counsel, but would not be permitted to be shared with relators. A subsequent e-mail exchange confirmed that the judge\u2019s intent was that motions to seal and responses to them be filed under seal, with the court to determine the motions in camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>{\u00b6 9} In January 2011, relators filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel the judge to release all records filed with the clerk of courts in the underlying criminal cases and a writ of prohibition to vacate the December 21, 2010 order, prohibit him from presumptively closing any proceedings or sealing any documents filed with or otherwise provided to the court, and requiring him to comply with all requirements of notice, evidentiary hearing, and findings before sealing any filed documents or records or closing any proceedings in the criminal cases. The judge submitted an answer, and the Cafaro defendants filed a motion to intervene as respondents and an answer. We granted the motion to intervene and an alternative writ and issued a schedule for the submission of evidence and briefs. 128 Ohio St.3d 1443, 2011-Ohio-1618, 944 N.E.2d 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 10} After evidence and briefs were submitted, respondents notified this court that on July 11, 2011, the judge, on motion of the state, dismissed the indictment in the underlying criminal cases without prejudice, thereby terminating the prosecution of the cases. According to a later opinion of the judge, the dismissal was prompted by the refusal of agents of the federal government to furnish the special prosecutors with materials essential to the special prosecutor\u2019s duty to provide discovery to the defendants. The respondents filed motions for leave to file supplemental briefs on postdismissal issues of access to the sealed records. We granted the motions, and the parties submitted supplemental briefs on the issue of the effect of the dismissal of the underlying criminal cases on relators\u2019 mandamus and prohibition claims. 129 Ohio St.3d 1446, 2011-Ohio-4217, 951 N.E.2d 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 11} Relators subsequently filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint instanter, which indicated that the following additional events had occurred in the underlying criminal cases after the parties had submitted evidence and their initial briefs. In June 2011, before the judge dismissed without prejudice the indictment against the defendants, the Cafaro defendants filed \u2014 as a matter of public record \u2014 a motion \u201cto dismiss the indictment to enforce non-prosecution agreement, and due to prosecutorial misconduct and vindictiveness, with request for an order releasing grand jury transcripts,\u201d with a 106-page memorandum in support. The memorandum included 45 pages under the heading \u201cRelevant factual background,\u201d which purported to detail multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct. In response to the motion and consistent with the court\u2019s protocol, the state filed under seal a memorandum in opposition, which included a six-page discussion under the heading \u201cRelevant, non-vindictive facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 12} The Cafaro defendants filed under seal a motion to seal the \u201crelevant, non-vindictive facts\u201d from the state\u2019s memorandum in response to their motion to dismiss the indictment. Relators\u2019 and the state\u2019s memoranda in opposition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>motion to seal and' the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion for leave to file a reply were also submitted under seal. The parties also filed other unrelated motions, including a motion for return of property and a motion for an extension of time to respond under seal. And following the court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of the indictment, various defendants, including the Cafaro defendants, filed under seal motions to seal the record of their cases under R.C. 2953.52. Responses to the motions were also submitted under seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 13} On August 24, 2011, without holding any hearing, the judge unsealed most of the sealed filings but granted the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to seal the six-page factual discussion in the state\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss. He based his sealing order on the following factors: (1) the sealed portion of the state\u2019s memorandum was not used by the court to decide the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion, because the motion was rendered moot by the court\u2019s dismissal upon the state\u2019s motion of the cases on July 11, 2011, (2) even if the court had been required to rule on the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion, the portion of the memorandum at issue would not have played a part in the court\u2019s decisional process, and (3) like the bills of particulars that remain sealed by court order, the \u201crelevant, non-vindictive facts\u201d in the state\u2019s memorandum \u201cwould trigger the same fair trial concerns that prompted the sealing orders in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 14} On October 24, 2011, the judge denied the motions of the Cafaro defendants and defendant Zachariah to seal the records of the dismissed criminal cases pursuant to R.C. 2953.52. In his decision, he concluded that the legitimate governmental need to keep the records unsealed due to the ongoing criminal investigation of the defendants outweighed the defendants\u2019 privacy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">{\u00b6 15} This cause is now before this court for a consideration of the merits and of relators\u2019 motions for leave to file an amended complaint, for leave to file a reply brief in support of their supplemental merit brief, and for a court order instructing the judge to file an unredacted copy of the state\u2019s memorandum in response to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in the underlying criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">\n<em>Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">{\u00b6 16} Relators request leave to amend their complaint instanter pursuant to Civ.R. 15 to address the August 24, 2011 order sealing the factual portion of the state\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment and the judge\u2019s continued application of an allegedly improper protocol resulting in the improper sealing of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Under S.Ct.Prac.R. 10.2, the \u201cOhio Rules of Civil Procedure shall supplement these rules unless clearly inapplicable.\u201d Civ.R. 15(A) and (E), which govern amendments of and supplements to pleadings, are not clearly inapplicable to original actions filed in this court. <em>See generally State ex rel. Essig v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 481, 2004-Ohio-5586, 817 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 16. \u201cLeave of court shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Civ.R. 15(A). \u201c[T]he language of Civ.R. 15(A) favors a liberal amendment policy and a motion for leave to amend should be granted absent a finding of bad faith, undue delay or undue prejudice to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Hoover v. Sumlin, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 465 N.E.2d 377 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 18} Moreover, Civ.R. 15(E) permits parties, upon motion and upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, to \u201cserve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented.\u201d And \u201cin determining actions involving extraordinary writs, a court is not limited to considering the facts and circumstances at the time that the writ was requested but can consider the facts and conditions at the time that entitlement to the writ is considered.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Skotv, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 423, 2004-Ohio-3652, 811 N.E.2d 1128, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 19} Therefore, because relators seek to amend their complaint to plead events that occurred after their original complaint and the submission of evidence and the initial merit briefs and because respondents did not file a timely memorandum in opposition, we grant the motion for leave to amend and consider the merits of the case based on relators\u2019 amended claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">\n<em>Relators\u2019 Remaining Motions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 20} We need not address the merits of relators\u2019 remaining motions- \u2014 -to order the judge to file under seal the state\u2019s complete memorandum in response to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and for leave to submit a reply supplemental brief \u2014 because they are rendered moot by our disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 21} Relators request a writ of mandamus to compel the judge to provide them with access to the records from the underlying criminal cases that remain sealed pursuant to his challenged sealing orders, i.e., the bills of particulars for the Cafaro defendants and defendant Zachariah and the portion of the state\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment under the heading \u201cRelevant, non-vindictive facts.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>{\u00b6 22} To be entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, relators must establish a clear legal right to access to the sealed records, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the judge to unseal them, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>See State ex rel. Dreamer v. Mason, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 190, 2007-Ohio-4789, 874 N.E.2d 510, \u00b6 11. \u201cWe have determined the propriety of access restrictions in the context of extraordinary-writ actions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Geer, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 511, 2007-Ohio-4643, 873 N.E.2d 314, \u00b6 14. Relators claim entitlement to the sealed records based on the Rules of Superintendence, the Public Records Act, the United States and Ohio Constitutions, and the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 23} We decide this case based on the Rules of Superintendence, which provide for public access to court records. For the claimed violation of these rules, a \u201cperson aggrieved by the failure of a court or clerk of court to comply with the requirements of Sup.R. 44 through 47 may pursue an action in mandamus pursuant to Chapter 2731. of the Revised Code.\u201d Sup.R. 47(B); <em>see also </em>Sup.R. 47(A). Sup.R. 44 through 47 became effective on July 1, 2009. Sup.R. 99(KK).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 24} Under Sup.R. 45(A), \u201c[cjourt records are presumed open to public access.\u201d \u201cCourt record\u201d for purposes of the public-access superintendence rules \u201cmeans both a case document and an administrative document, regardless of physical form or characteristic, manner of creation, or method of storage.\u201d Sup.R. 44(B). Relators assert that the requested records that remain sealed here \u2014 bills of particulars and a statement of facts in the state\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment \u2014 are entitled to the presumption of public access in Sup.R. 45(A) because they constitute case documents, which are defined in Sup.R. 44(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">(C)(1) \u201cCase document\u201d means a document and information in a document submitted to a court or filed with a clerk of court in a judicial action or proceeding, including exhibits, pleadings, motions, orders, and judgments, and any documentation prepared by the court or clerk in the judicial action or proceeding, such as journals, dockets, and indices, subject to the exclusions in division (C)(2) of this rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">(2) The term \u201ccase document\u201d does not include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">(a) A document or information in a document exempt from disclosure under state, federal, or the common law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">(b) personal identifiers, as defined in division (H) of this rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">(c) A document or information in a document to which public access has been restricted pursuant to division (E) of Sup.R. 45[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>{\u00b6 25} In his December 21, 2010 decision sealing the bills of particulars and his August 24, 2011 decision sealing the factual portion of the state\u2019s memorandum in response to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the judge determined that these filed documents were not entitled to presumptive public access, because they were not used by him to render a decision in the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 26} But \u201c[t]o interpret court rules, this court applies general principles of statutory construction. * * * Therefore, we must read undefined words or phrases in context and then construe them according to rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Law Office of Montgomery Cty. Pub. Defender v. Rosencrans, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 338, 2006-Ohio-5793, 856 N.E.2d 250, \u00b6 23. \u201cIf a court rule is unambiguous, we apply it as written.\u201d <em>Erwin v. Bryan, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 519, 2010-Ohio-2202, 929 N.E.2d 1019, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 27} There is no requirement under the Superintendence Rules that a record or document must be used by the court in a decision to be entitled to the presumption of public access specified in Sup.R. 45(A). Instead, to qualify as a case document that is afforded the presumption of openness for court records, the document or information contained in a document must merely be \u201csubmitted to a court or filed with a clerk of court in a judicial action or proceeding\u201d and not be subject to the specified exclusions. Sup.R. 44(C)(1). The bills of particulars and the factual portion of the state\u2019s memorandum in response to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss were manifestly submitted to the common pleas court and filed with the clerk of court in the criminal cases, and there is no exception in Sup.R. 44(C) for records not used by a court to render a decision. Therefore, we cannot read this exception into the plain language of the Superintendence Rules. <em>See State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 28} Respondents also claim that these sealed records are not entitled to the Sup.R. 45(A) presumption of public access because they are exempt from disclosure as discovery materials or work product, citing our decision in <em>State ex rel. WHIO-TV-7 v. Lowe, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 350, 673 N.E.2d 1360 (1997), to support their claim. Our holding in <em>Lowe, </em>however, was limited: \u201cInformation that a criminal prosecutor has disclosed to the defendant for discovery purposes pursuant to Crim.R. 16 is not thereby subject to release as a \u2018public record\u2019 pursuant to R.C. 149.43.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 29} Neither the bills of particulars nor the facts recited in the state\u2019s memorandum in response to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss were \u201cdisclosed to the defendants] for discovery purposes pursuant to Crim.R. 16.\u201d And unlike the discovery materials at issue in <em>Lowe, </em>these records were submitted to and filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>{\u00b6 30} Notwithstanding respondents\u2019 assertions, in Ohio, a \u201cbill of particulars has a limited purpose \u2014 to elucidate or particularize the conduct of the accused alleged to constitute the offense.\u201d <em>State v. Sellards, </em>17 Ohio St.3d 169, 171, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985). Its express purpose is not \u201cto serve as a substitute for discovery.\u201d <em>Id. See also United States v. Smith, </em>776 F.2d 1104, 1111-1112 (3d Cir.1985), holding that the First Amendment and common-law rights of access \u201cextend to bills of particulars because we think them more properly regarded as supplements to the indictment than as the equivalent of civil discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 31} Therefore, the sealed bills of particulars are not exempt from disclosure under state law as either discovery materials or work product. Nor is a recitation of facts in a response to a dispositive motion in a criminal case the equivalent of discovery or work product. Therefore, the sealed records are entitled to the presumption of access accorded case documents under Sup.R. 45(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 32} Respondents next claim that any presumptive access under Sup.R. 45(A) has been properly overcome under Sup.R. 45(E), which provides the procedure for restricting public access to a case document:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">(E) Restricting public access to a case document</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">(1) Any party to a judicial action or proceeding or other person who is the subject of information in a case document may, by written motion to the court, request that the court restrict public access to the information or, if necessary, the entire document. Additionally, the court may restrict public access to the information in the case document or, if necessary, the entire document upon its own order. The court shall give notice of the motion or order to all parties in the case. The court may schedule a hearing on the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">(2) A court shall restrict public access to information in a case document or, if necessary, the entire document, if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the presumption of allowing public access is outweighed by a higher interest after considering each of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">(a) Whether public policy is served by restricting public access;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">(b) Whether any state, federal, or common law exempts the document or information from public access;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">(c) Whether factors that support restriction of public access exist, including risk of injury to persons, individual privacy rights and interests, proprietary business information, public safety, and fairness of the adjudicatory process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Respondents claim that any presumptive right of access to the sealed bills of particulars and the statement of facts in the state\u2019s response to the motion to dismiss the indictment was outweighed under Sup.R. 45(E)(2)(c) by clear and convincing evidence that the \u201cfairness of the adjudicatory process\u201d would be compromised by public access to these records, i.e., unsealing these records would substantially prejudice the defendants\u2019 right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 34} Respondent\u2019s claim lacks merit. There was not clear and convincing evidence to establish that the prejudicial effect of pretrial publicity generated by public access to the bills of particulars and the recitation of facts in the state\u2019s memorandum in response to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment would prevent them from receiving a fair trial. The Cafaro defendants\u2019 lone witness at the December 6, 2010 hearing, Ohio University journalism professor Martin, admitted that he had \u201cno idea\u201d whether relators\u2019 coverage of the criminal eases would prevent the impaneling of an impartial jury, and although he referred to the coverage as \u201ctough\u201d on the defendants, he could not say whether the reporting was true or false. The judge thus overstated the prejudicial impact of the pretrial publicity. \u201c \u2018[P]retrial publicity' \u2014 even pervasive, adverse publicity \u2014 does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coley, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 253, 258, 754 N.E.2d 1129 (2001), quoting <em>Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 554, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976). In effect, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence establishing that the defendants\u2019 right to a fair trial would be violated, the judge erroneously relied on conclusory, speculative assertions. <em>See State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Henry Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 149, 2010-Ohio-1533, 926 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 39. In the order sealing the factual portion of the state\u2019s memorandum in response, he did not cite any additional evidence to support the sealing of the record. Rather, he merely stated that this portion of the memorandum was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a bill of particulars, which, as discussed, should be presumptively open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 35} Moreover, the constitutional right of the defendants to a fair trial can be protected by the traditional methods of voir dire, continuances, changes of venue, jury instructions, or sequestration of the jury. Consequently, the sealing orders were improper. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 36} Finally, the Cafaro defendants claim that after the judge dismissed the criminal cases upon the state\u2019s motion, their postdismissal privacy interests outweighed the presumption of public access to the sealed records. Not so. As the judge concluded in denying the Cafaro defendants\u2019 postdismissal motion to seal the entire record in the criminal cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Again, the question for the court is whether this legitimate governmental need [of not restricting the ongoing criminal investigation] outweighs these defendants\u2019 privacy interests. The court concludes that it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">As a practical matter, the defendants would gain little, if anything, from a sealing order. Except for the documents the court has kept under seal, the entire court record in this case is in the public domain. Counsel for the Vindicator and WFMJ-TV has represented that the Vindicator has created its own record of everything not under seal, and there would be no restriction upon its use of what it has mined, even if the court were to enter a sealing order. Further, information about this case is available on the internet. In short, a sealing order would do little, if anything, to protect the privacy of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">Accordingly, in \u201cbalancing the public and private interests,\u201d the privacy interests of the defendants are outweighed by a legitimate governmental need to keep the records unsealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 37} Thus, relators have established that the presumption of public access has not been overcome by the requisite clear and convincing evidence of a higher interest and that the public is entitled to access to the sealed records under the Superintendence Rules. Therefore, relators are entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the judge to unseal and provide access to the bills of particulars and the facts in the state\u2019s memorandum in response to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">\n<em>Prohibition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 38} Relators also seek a writ of prohibition to vacate the December 21, 2010 and August 24, 2011 decisions and to prohibit the judge from presumptively sealing any records in the cases. Because the sealing orders were never lifted, this claim is not moot. <em>Compare State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Heath, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 165, 2009-Ohio-590, 902 N.E.2d 976, \u00b6 11-14 (court held that sealing order that had been lifted did not moot mandamus claim because it was capable of repetition, yet evading review).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 39} Based on the previous discussion concerning relators\u2019 mandamus claim, they have also established their entitlement to the requested writ of prohibition. The Cafaro defendants did not submit clear and convincing evidence to support the court\u2019s sealing orders and sealing protocol presumptively sealing records, including motions to seal and memoranda in opposition, based on a claimed infringement on the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">{\u00b6 40} Therefore, relators\u2019 prohibition claim has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\n<em>Constitutional, Common-Law, and R.C. H94S Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 41} Relators also claim entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief based on the United States and Ohio Constitutions, the common law, and R.C. 149.43. We have recognized constitutional and common-law rights to certain judicial records. <em>See State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Winkler, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 382, 2004-Ohio-1581, 805 N.E.2d 1094, \u00b6 8; <em>State ex rel. Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Div., </em>73 Ohio St.3d 19, 22, 652 N.E.2d 179 (1995). We have also recognized the propriety of claims for court records under R.C. 149.43. <em>See State ex rel. Striker v. Smith, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 168, 2011-Ohio-2878, 950 N.E.2d 952, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 42} Nevertheless, because relators have established their entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief on the Superintendence Rules, we need not address other bases for relators\u2019 claims for records, which are rendered moot. <em>See State ex rel. Am. Civ. Liberties Union of Ohio, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 256, 2011-Ohio-625, 943 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 55. \u201cThis result is consistent with our well-settled precedent that we will not indulge in advisory opinions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Keyes v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>123 Ohio St.3d 29, 2009-Ohio-4052, 913 N.E.2d 972, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\n<em>Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 43} Relators request an award of attorney fees. But Sup.R. 44 through 47 do not authorize an award of attorney fees to a successful litigant contesting a court\u2019s denial of access to court records. <em>See </em>Sup.R. 47, which does not include an award of attorney fees as a remedy for a person aggrieved by the failure of a court or clerk of court to comply with Sup.R. 44 through 47. Thus, we deny relators\u2019 request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">{\u00b6 44} In sum, relators have established their entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief. We grant a writ of mandamus to compel the judge to unseal and provide access to the bills of particulars and the factual portion of the state\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the Cafaro defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment. We also grant a writ of prohibition to compel the judge to vacate his prior sealing orders and to prevent him from issuing further orders presumptively sealing records in the criminal cases.
