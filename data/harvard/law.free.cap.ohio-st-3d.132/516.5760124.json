On July 10, 2012, we heard oral argument in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">{\u00b6 2} The certified question is answered in the negative. This court has never recognized a claim under 4 Restatement 2d of Torts, Section 876 (1979), and we decline to do so under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-5\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and L\u00fandberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b693-6\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b693-7\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEX\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 3} Pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 18.6, we have accepted a question certified by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division. The question asks: \u201cUnder the applicable circumstances, does Ohio recognize a cause of action for tortious acts in concert under the Restatement (2d) of Torts, \u00a7 876?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">{\u00b6 4} Today, without opinion, the court answers the certified question in the negative. To the contrary, it seems clear that Ohio does recognize a cause of action for tortious acts in concert.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">{\u00b6 5} In <em>Great Cent. Ins. Co. v. Tobias, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 127, 130, 524 N.E.2d 168 (1988), this court stated, \u201c[A]ppellee argues, and the court of appeals held, that appellant could be liable on a concert of action theory as set forth within Section 876(b) of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, 315.\u201d This court did not state that Ohio does not recognize a cause of action for tortious acts in concert. Instead, it stated that the tort \u201chas application only when the principal actor\u2019s behavior amounts to tortious conduct,\u201d which, under the circumstances of that case, it did not. <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">{\u00b6 6} In <em>Pierce v. Bishop, </em>4th Dist. No. 10CA6, 2011-Ohio-371, 2011 WL 322444, \u00b6 26, the court of appeals stated that 4 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, Section 876 (1979), the restatement section that addresses tortious acts in concert, has been cited by this court, though \u201cnot expressly adopted.\u201d That is a good summary of the current situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">{\u00b6 7} In my opinion, a common-law tort can apply in Ohio even if this court has not expressly recognized it. We need look no further than <em>Tobias </em>to prove this point. Even though we did not expressly recognize the tort in that ease, we analyzed the facts of the case in relation to the elements of the tort and concluded that the elements had not been satisfied. <em>Tobias, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 127, 131, 524 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>N.E.2d 168. Though it does not include an express recognition of a cause of action for tortious acts in concert, <em>Tobias </em>is an example of de facto recognition.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqC8\">The Miltner Law Firm, L.L.C., and Ryan K. Miltner; and Shumaker, Loop &amp; Kendrick, L.L.P., David Wicklund, and John N. MacKay, for petitioner, DeVries Dairy, L.L.C.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Azm\">Kerger <em>&amp; </em>Hartman, L.L.C., and Richard Kerger; and Helfrey, Neiers &amp; Jones, P.C., and Philip C. Graham, for respondents T.C. Jacoby &amp; Co., Inc., and Dairy Support, Inc.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AiP\">Eastman &amp; Smith, Ltd., Jeffrey M. Stopar, John M. Carey, and Jared J. Lefevre, for respondent White Eagle Cooperative Association, Inc.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6a\">Amer Cunningham Co., L.P.A., and Thomas R. Houlihan, for amicus curiae, Ohio Association for Justice, in support of petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Pierce, </em>the court of appeals engaged in a similar, though more extensive, analysis before concluding that the elements of the cause of action of tortious acts in concert had not been established. <em>Pierce, </em>2011-Ohio-371, 2011 WL 322444, \u00b6 26-35. In <em>Boyd v. Lincoln Elec. Co., </em>179 Ohio App.3d 559, 2008-Ohio-6143, 902 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 62 (8th Dist.), the court of appeals declined to address the plaintiffs claim that the defendants had acted in concert in committing a tort. But the court\u2019s reason for declining to address the claim was not that Ohio did not recognize the tort, but that the plaintiff had abandoned the claim. In <em>Schuergerv. Clevenger, </em>8th Dist. No. 85128, 2005-Ohio-5333, 2005 WL 2462070, \u00b6 14-15, the court stated that the defendant\u2019s act was \u201cnot substantial encouragement to permit liability based upon a concert of action theory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 9} It seems clear from the case law that courts in Ohio have treated the common-law tort of tortious acts in concert as described in 4 Restatement, Section 876 as if it is part of the law of Ohio. That no plaintiff has presented sufficient facts to establish liability for tortious acts in concert does not mean that Ohio courts have not recognized the tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 10} The district court is not asking us whether the facts of this case are sufficient to establish liability. It is asking us whether, if the facts are sufficient, a defendant can be held liable for tortious acts in concert. I would answer the question in the affirmative. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
