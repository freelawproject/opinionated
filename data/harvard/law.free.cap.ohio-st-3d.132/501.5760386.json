Relator, Columbus Bar Association, and respondent stipulated to the facts and misconduct alleged in relator\u2019s amended complaint. A three-member panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard testimony in the case, issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, and ultimately recommended that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law for two years. The board adopted the panel\u2019s report in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">{\u00b6 2} The parties did not object to the board\u2019s report, and we ordered respondent to show cause why we should not adopt the board\u2019s report and recommendation. On review, we find that respondent committed the stipulated violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct and hereby suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">\n<em>Counts One through Three</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-15\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent\u2019s stipulated misuse of his client trust account is the basis of these three counts of misconduct. Respondent stipulated that he had deposited into his client trust account money from, or payable to, two clients \u2014 a corporation and an estate. A short time later, respondent began using both clients\u2019 funds to pay his personal and office expenses, and he continued to do so for several months. This frequently resulted in a balance in the client trust account that was less than the amount held in trust for these clients. To remedy this, respondent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>on several occasions, deposited personal funds into his client trust account. Three of these deposits exceeded $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 4} All the debts of the estate in Count Two were eventually paid in full. The $100,000 belonging to the corporate client in Count One was also repaid, but only after the client\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to secure a return of its money prompted it to file a grievance against respondent. Respondent initially attempted to justify his failure to promptly return these funds by alleging that the amount owed to the client was in dispute and that he had always been willing and able to remit the amount that was not being contested. Respondent later stipulated, however, that the disputed amount, if any, was minimal. He also stipulated that his professed ability to repay these funds at any time was untrue, because the balance in the client trust account was often insufficient to do so. Finally, respondent admitted that his delay in returning these funds financially harmed his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent further stipulated that he did not properly maintain and oversee his client trust account. In addition to the improprieties just discussed, respondent\u2019s recordkeeping was haphazard. His admitted failure to keep an individual client ledger for each client made it extremely difficult to determine the clients to which various withdrawals and deposits pertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent has stipulated that his misuse of his client trust account constituted violations of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) (failure to maintain complete records of clients\u2019 funds), 1.15(c) (failure to keep client funds separate from those of the lawyer),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). He has also stipulated that in Counts One and Two, he did not promptly return his clients\u2019 money, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(d) (failure to promptly deliver funds that the client is entitled to receive). Respondent lastly concedes that, in Count One, he improperly held funds belonging to his client and attempted to defend his action by fabricating a fee dispute. Respondent has stipulated that this conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(e) (improperly holding funds in dispute) and 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 7} The board concluded that respondent had engaged in all of the stipulated misconduct and had committed all of the stipulated violations. We agree and accept these findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">\n<em>Count Four</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent stipulated that he did not maintain malpractice insurance throughout much of 2009 and 2010 and did not inform many of his clients. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Respondent stipulated that these actions violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c) (failure to notify clients in writing that the attorney does not maintain professional-liability insurance).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 9} The board concluded that respondent had engaged in all of the stipulated misconduct and had committed the stipulated violation. We agree and accept these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">\n<em>Count Five</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent stipulated that the misconduct set forth in Counts One through Four constituted a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects upon his fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">{\u00b6 11} The board concluded that respondent had engaged in the stipulated misconduct and had violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h). We agree and accept this finding regarding misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">{\u00b6 12} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the duties violated by the lawyer in question and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. Before making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10. <em>Lake Cty. Bar Assn. v. Troy, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 51, 2009-Ohio-502, 901 N.E.2d 809, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">{\u00b6 13} In this case, the board found four aggravating factors. It found that respondent had (1) submitted false statements during the disciplinary investigation, (2) acted with a dishonest and selfish motive, (3) engaged in a pattern of misconduct, and (4) committed multiple offenses. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), (d), and (f). It also found one mitigating factor \u2014 the absence of any prior disciplinary record. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). The board, however, did not agree with the parties\u2019 stipulation that respondent\u2019s cooperation in the disciplinary proceeding was an additional mitigating factor. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). The board felt that respondent\u2019s eventual cooperation in the disciplinary process was outweighed by his fabrication of a fee dispute and other misrepresentations that respondent initially made in response to the grievance filed against him in Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">{\u00b6 14} The board recommended that respondent\u2019s license to practice law be suspended for two years and that reinstatement be premised on the following conditions: (1) respondent\u2019s completion of a minimum of 12 hours of continuing legal education related to accounting and law-practice management and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>monitored probation for one year following reinstatement. The board further recommended that the costs of these proceedings be taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 15} We accept the board\u2019s recommendation. In reviewing sanctions in similar cases regarding misuse of client funds, we find <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. </em>Crosby, 124 Ohio St.3d 226, 2009-Ohio-6763, 921 N.E.2d 225, to be instructive. There, as here, the attorney used his client trust account to pay for personal and business expenses, commingled personal funds with those held in trust for his clients, and did not maintain accurate records for funds deposited into his client trust account. In imposing a two-year sanction, we stressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">Even before the General Assembly authorized the creation of IOLTAs in R.C. 4705.09, we explained that the \u201cmishandling of clients\u2019 funds either by way of conversion, commingling or just poor management, encompasses an area of the gravest concern of this court in reviewing claimed attorney misconduct.\u201d <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Thompson </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 667, 669, 23 O.O.3d 541, 433 N.E.2d 602. We have also reiterated a number of times that \u201cit is \u2018of the utmost importance that attorneys maintain their personal and office accounts separate from their clients\u2019 accounts\u2019 and that any violation of that rule \u2018warrants a substantial sanction whether or not the client has been harmed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Wise, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 381, 2006-Ohio-1194, 843 N.E.2d 1198, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Erie-Huron Counties Joint Certified Grievance Commt. v. Miles </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 574, 577, 669 N.E.2d 831.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Id. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 16} In the case at bar, respondent not only committed the same misconduct as that in <em>Crosby, </em>he additionally fabricated a fee dispute in order to justify his failure to promptly return his corporate client\u2019s money. For these reasons, we find that a lesser sanction is inappropriate. Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years with reinstatement contingent upon his completion of a minimum of 12 hours of continuing legal education related to accounting and law-practice management in addition to the continuing-legal-education requirements of Gov.Bar R. X, followed by a one-year period of monitored probation. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b680-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AnW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Mazanee, Raskin &amp; Ryder Co., L.P.A., and Michael S.
