Because ESPN has established its entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief for only a few of the requested records, we grant the writ only for those records. For the remaining records, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"A2P\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">{\u00b6 2} At a March 8, 2011 press conference, then Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel disclosed that in April 2010, he had received e-mails notifying him that certain Ohio State football players were connected to Eddie Rife, the owner of Fine Line Ink, a tattoo parlor, and the subject of a federal law-enforcement investigation. According to Tressel, the e-mails alerted him that players had exchanged Ohio State memorabilia for tattoos and that federal authorities had raided Rife\u2019s house and found $70,000 in cash and \u201ca lot of Ohio State memorabilia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 3} Tressel did not forward the e-mails to his superiors at Ohio State or to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (\u201cNCAA\u201d). Tressel\u2019s decision ultimately led to his resignation and an NCAA investigation. Tressel did, however, forward the e-mails to Ted Sarniak, a mentor to Ohio State football player Terrelle Pryor during his high-school and collegiate career. Sarniak is not employed by Ohio State or the NCAA, and he is not a law-enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 4} Since February 2011, Ohio State has received more than 100 public-records requests relating to the NCAA investigation from more than 38 members of the media representing at least 20 media organizations. After the March 8, 2011 Tressel press conference, ESPN, a global sports-entertainment company, had at least seven different individuals make at least 21 different public-records requests relating to Ohio State\u2019s athletic department. In response to these requests, Ohio State provided ESPN with over 700 pages of responsive documents, made more than 350 pages available on its website, and provided \u2014 as a courtesy \u2014 more than 4,200 pages of additional records that were requested by, and provided to, other members of the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 5} On April 20, 2011, ESPN requested that Ohio State provide it with access to and copies of nine different categories of records, including \u201c[a]ll documents and emails, letters and memos related to NCAA investigations prepared for and/or forwarded to the NCAA since 1/1/2010 related to an investigation of Jim Tressel\u201d and \u201c[a]ll emails, letters and memos to and from Jim Tressel, Gordon Gee, Doug Archie and/or Gene Smith with key word Sarniak since March 15, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 6} Ohio State rejected ESPN\u2019s request for the Sarniak records by citing the confidentiality provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b), to support its denial of the request. Ohio State later denied ESPN\u2019s request for documents related to the NCAA investigation because it would \u201cnot release anything on the pending investigation.\u201d In this email, Ohio State attempted to respond to 16 separate requests by ESPN for public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On May 11, 2011, by e-mail, ESPN requested access to and copies of seven different categories of records from Ohio State, including \u201c[a]ny and all emails or documents listing people officially barred from student-athlete pass lists (game tickets) since January 1, 2007,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny report, email or other correspondence between the NCAA and Doug Archie or any other Ohio State athletic department official related to any violation (including secondary violation) of NCAA rules involving the football program, since January 1, 2005.\u201d Ohio State rejected ESPN\u2019s requests because the university deemed them to be \u201coverly broad per Ohio\u2019s public record laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 8} On July 11, 2011, ESPN filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel Ohio State to provide access to the requested records. After the lawsuit was filed, Ohio State claimed that its communications with ESPN concerning the public-records requests were not intended to be its final word on the requests and were part of what the university believed to be continuing communications with ESPN concerning the requests. Following the commencement of this case, Ohio State worked with ESPN to help refine its public-records requests and to provide responsive documents. Ohio State submitted an answer to ESPN\u2019s complaint for a writ of mandamus, and we granted an alternative writ and issued a schedule for the submission of evidence and briefs. 129 Ohio St.3d 1472, 2011-Ohio-4751, 953 N.E.2d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AQt\">\n<em>R.C. U943(B)(2) and (3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 10} ESPN first claims that Ohio State committed per se violations of R.C. 149.43(B)(2) and (3) in its responses to ESPN\u2019s requests for pass lists and documents regarding past and current NCAA violations and NCAA investigations. Ohio State initially denied the requests for pass lists and the documents regarding violations because they were \u201coverly broad\u201d and denied the requests for documents regarding the current investigation because Ohio State would \u201cnot release anything on the pending investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 11} We agree with ESPN\u2019s contentions that Ohio State violated R.C. 149.43(B)(2) and (3). For its denials based on overbreadth of the requests, Ohio State did not provide ESPN, in accordance with R.C. 149.43(B)(2), \u201cwith an opportunity to revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in which records are maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary course of the public office\u2019s or person\u2019s duties.\u201d And for Ohio State\u2019s denial of ESPN\u2019s request for documents concerning the current investigation, \u201cR.C. 149.43 does not contain an \u2018ongoing investigation\u2019 exemption for public records.\u201d <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>ex rel. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Mentor, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 440, 446, 732 N.E.2d 969 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 12} Nevertheless, although we conclude that Ohio State violated R.C. 149.43(B)(2) and (3) in this regard, we hold that ESPN did not specifically seek relief to remedy these violations. R.C. 149.43(C)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\"><em>If a person allegedly is aggrieved </em>by the failure of a public office or the person responsible for public records to promptly prepare a public record and to make it available to the person for inspection in accordance with division (B) of this section or <em>by any other failure of a public office or the person responsible for public records to comply with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section, the person allegedly aggrieved may commence a mandamus action to obtain a judgment that orders the public office or the person responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of this section, </em>that awards court costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the person that instituted the mandamus action, and, if applicable, that includes an order fixing statutory damages under division (C)(1) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">(Emphasis added.) Although ESPN alleged that Ohio State failed to comply with R.C. 149.43(B)(2) and (3) in its complaint and briefs, ESPN did not ask that Ohio State be ordered to inform it of the\u201eway the university maintains its records concerning pass lists and NCAA violations so that ESPN could revise its requests, or to cite legal authority for the university\u2019s denial of the request for records relating to the NCAA investigation. Instead, ESPN limited its request for relief to a writ of mandamus to compel Ohio State to provide access to the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 13} Nor does ESPN seek statutory damages for Ohio State\u2019s claimed failure to comply with R.C. 149.43(B)(2) and (3), for which injury arising from the lost use of the requested information could be conclusively presumed. R.C. 149.43(C)(1). And insofar as ESPN seeks attorney fees, these violations comprise only a small portion of its true claims here.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 14} Finally, ESPN does not suggest in its argument that any claimed failure by Ohio State to comply with R.C. 149.43(B)(2) and (3) in its initial responses to its requests resulted in an unreasonable delay in Ohio State\u2019s ultimately complying with the requests \u2014 except for the redacted and withheld portions of the responsive records that ESPN contests.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 15} Based on the foregoing, under these particular facts, although Ohio State committed per se violations of R.C. 149.43(B)(2) and (3) in initially respond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ing to ESPN\u2019s records requests, ESPN is not entitled to relief for these violations beyond that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>Exemptions from Disclosure under R.C. H9.I3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 16} ESPN next claims that Ohio State erred in redacting some information and withholding other records in their entirety in responding to its records requests. \u201cR.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v) exempts \u2018[r]ecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law\u2019 from the definition of \u2018public record.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Dawson v. Bloom-Carroll Local School Dist., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 10, 2011-Ohio-6009, 959 N.E.2d 524, \u00b627.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 17} Ohio State did not provide some of the records that might otherwise have been responsive to ESPN\u2019s request, claiming that those records were exempt under FERPA, the attorney-client privilege, and the work-product privilege. Each of these exemptions is next considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\"><em>FERPA </em>\u2014 Prohibition <em>on the Release of Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 18} Ohio State refused to release documents in response to ESPN\u2019s request for e-mails with the key word \u201cSarniak,\u201d claiming that those documents were exempt from disclosure based on FERPA. FERPA provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">[n]o funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records (or personally identifiable information contained therein other than directory information, as defined in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section) of students without the written consent of their parents to any individual, agency, or organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cCongress enacted FERPA under its spending power to condition the receipt of federal funds on certain requirements relating to the access and disclosure of student educational records.\u201d <em>Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, </em>536 U.S. 273, 278, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002). \u201cFERPA is directed to the conditions schools must meet to receive federal funds * * *.\u201d <em>Owasso Independent School Dist. No. 1-011 v. Falvo, </em>534 U.S. 426, 430, 122 S.Ct. 934, 151 L.Ed.2d 896 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">{\u00b6 20} ESPN argues that FERPA does not prohibit the disclosure of the requested records by educational agencies and institutions like Ohio State \u2014 it merely penalizes those educational agencies and institutions that have a policy or practice of permitting the release of those records without parental consent by withholding federal funding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>{\u00b6 21} ESPN\u2019s contention lacks merit. \u201cUnder FERPA, schools and educational agencies receiving federal financial assistance must comply with certain conditions. [20 U.S.C.] 1232g(a)(3). <em>One condition specified in the Act is that sensitive information about students may not be released without parental consent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Falvo </em>at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cBased upon these clear and unambiguous terms, a participant <em>who accepts federal education funds </em>is well aware of the conditions imposed by the FERPA and is clearly able to ascertain what is expected of it. Once the conditions and the funds are accepted, the school is indeed prohibited from systematically releasing education records without consent.\u201d (Emphasis sic and citations omitted.) <em>United States v. Miami Univ., </em>294 F.3d 797, 809 (6th Cir.2002). Although the court at footnote 11 limited this conclusion to federal government action to enforce FERPA, we agree with Ohio State that this limitation merely clarifies the means of enforcing FERPA and does not alter universities\u2019 duties under FERPA. In effect, \u201c \u2018legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power [, like the FERPA,] is much in the nature of a contract; in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.\u2019 \u201d (Bracketed material sic.) <em>Id. </em>at 808, quoting <em>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 23} Ohio State received approximately 23 percent of its total operating revenues \u2014 over $919 million \u2014 in the 2010-2011 academic year from federal funds, and it is estimated that the university will receive the same amount of federal funds in the 2011-2012 academic year. Therefore, Ohio State, having agreed to the conditions and accepted the federal funds, was prohibited by FERPA from systematically releasing education records without parental consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 24} This result is consistent with the holdings of other state courts that have addressed this issue. <em>See Osborn v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wisconsin Sys., </em>254 Wis.2d 266, 647 N.W.2d 158 (2002) \u00b6 22; <em>Unincorporated Operating Div. of Indiana Newspapers, Inc. v. Trustees of Indiana Univ., </em>787 N.E.2d 893, 904 (Ind.App.2003); <em>DTH Publishing Corp. v. Univ. of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, </em>128 N.CApp. 534, 496 S.E.2d 8, 12 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 25} Therefore, FERPA, if applicable, does constitute a prohibition on the release of records under R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\"><em>FERPA </em>\u2014 Policy <em>or Practice of Permitting the Release of Education Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 26} Notwithstanding ESPN\u2019s claim to the contrary, if this court were to hold either that R.C. 149.43 does not recognize any exemption for FERPA or that personally identifiable information in records related to NCAA investigations is not covered by FERPA, we would be compelling educational agencies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>institutions throughout Ohio to adopt a \u201cpolicy or practice\u201d permitting the release of education records. <em>See Miami Univ., </em>294 F.3d at 819-820.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><em>FERPA </em>\u2014 Education <em>Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 27} ESPN asserts that FERPA is inapplicable to the records responsive to its requests for documents related to Sarniak and the prior NCAA investigations because these records do not constitute \u201ceducation records.\u201d For purposes of FERPA, the term \u201ceducation records\u201d means \u201cthose records, files, documents, and other materials which \u2014 (i) contain information directly related to a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 28} ESPN first claims that the requested records are not education records because records concerning Sarniak, a Pennsylvania businessman who was the mentor to an Ohio State football player implicated in the NCAA investigation concerning trading memorabilia for tattoos, and records relating to compliance by Ohio State coaches and administrators with NCAA regulations do not directly involve Ohio State students or their academic performance, financial aid, or scholastic performance. ESPN relies on language from this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State ex rel. Miami Student v. Miami Univ., </em>79 Ohio St.3d 168, 171-172, 680 N.E.2d 956 (1997), in which the court granted a writ of mandamus to compel the disclosure of student disciplinary proceedings for 1993 through 1996 by reasoning that because the cases, which involved infractions of student rules and regulations, were \u201cnonacademic in nature,\u201d the records were not \u201ceducation records\u201d subject to FERPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 29} Following our decision in <em>Miami Student, </em>however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that student disciplinary records were education records subject to FERPA and permanently enjoined Miami University and Ohio State from releasing records in violation of FERPA. <em>Miami Univ., </em>294 F.3d 797. The court held that \u201c[ujnder a plain language interpretation of FERPA, student disciplinary records are education records because they directly relate to a student and are kept by that student\u2019s university. Notably, Congress made no content-based judgments with regard to its \u2018education records\u2019 definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 30} Upon consideration of our opinion in <em>Miami Student </em>and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Miami Univ., </em>we agree with the Sixth Circuit and hold that the records here generally constitute \u201ceducation records\u201d subject to FERPA because the plain language of the statute does not restrict the term \u201ceducation records\u201d to \u201cacademic performance, financial aid, or scholastic performance.\u201d Education records need only \u201ccontain information directly related to a student\u201d and be \u201cmaintained by an educational agency or institution\u201d or a person acting for the institution. 20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(A)(i) and (ii). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>records here \u2014 insofar as they contain information identifying student-athletes\u2014 are directly related to the students.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 31} In fact, in <em>Miami Student, </em>we permitted Miami University to redact certain personally identifiable information in accordance with FERPA. <em>Miami Student, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 172, 680 N.E.2d 956. \u201cWith these court-imposed redactions, the mandamus [granted by this court in <em>Miami </em>Student] appears to comport with the FERPA\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>Miami Univ., </em>294 F.3d at 811, citing <em>Miami Student </em>at 173 (Cook, J., dissenting). Thus, the records here are education records in that they contain information that is directly related to students.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 32} ESPN\u2019s next claim, that the requested records do not constitute \u201ceducation records\u201d under FERPA because they are not \u201cmaintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution,\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(A)(ii), also lacks merit. Ohio State submitted sufficient evidence to establish that the responsive records are \u201cmaintained\u201d for purposes of FERPA. Ohio State\u2019s Department of Athletics retains copies of all e-mails and attachments sent to or by any person in the department; the e-mails cannot be deleted. The department also retains copies of all documents scanned into electronic records, which are organized by student-athlete. Ohip State has additionally collected documents related to its investigation of student-athletes who exchanged memorabilia for tattoos and Tressel\u2019s failure to report that activity that were requested by the NCAA and has kept those documents in two secure electronic files. These records are not similar to the transient records involved in <em>Falvo, </em>534 U.S. at 433,122 S.Ct. 934,151 L.Ed.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 33} Therefore, Ohio State properly withheld identifying information concerning the student-athletes by redacting it from the records that the university released. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. 99.3, which defines \u201cpersonally identifiable information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 34} Nevertheless, a review of the sealed records that were responsive to ESPN\u2019s request but were withheld based on FERPA indicates that Ohio State should provide access to these records after redacting the personally identifiable information. An e-mail chain between Tressel, the Ohio State athletics department official in charge of compliance, attorneys, and other officials scheduling a meeting includes no personally identifiable information concerning any student-athlete. In e-mails to schedule a meeting to formulate a compliance plan for one of the student-athletes, aside from the name of the student-athlete and a person who agreed to attend the meeting, no personally identifiable information is included. Another document refers to one person\u2019s request to obtain a disability-insurance policy on behalf of a student-athlete, and with those names redacted, the document would not contain personally identifiable information. There are also two letters from Ohio State\u2019s athletics department compliance director to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>parents of a student-athlete concerning preferential treatment. With the personally identifiable information concerning the names of the student-athlete, parents, parents\u2019 addresses, and the other person involved redacted, FERPA would not protect the remainder of these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 35} Therefore, although the majority of the requested records were properly redacted before being provided to ESPN, ESPN is entitled to access to redacted copies of these few records that were completely withheld from it based on FERPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>Attorney-Client Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 36} Ohio State properly withheld the remaining requested records based on attorney-client privilege. <em>See State ex rel. Besser v. Ohio State Univ., </em>87 Ohio St.3d 535, 542, 721 N.E.2d 1044 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 37} These records include requests from Ohio State officials for legal advice and interpretation, communications from or between the attorneys providing legal advice or information to Ohio State, and investigatory fact-finding related to the legal advice. These are covered by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 38} ESPN\u2019s contention that Ohio State cannot rely on attorney-client privilege to shield these records is unfounded because \u201can attorney does not become any less of an attorney by virtue of state agency employment,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Pious. Fin. Agency, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508, 824 N.E.2d 990, \u00b6 29, the attorney-client privilege applies to agents working on behalf of legal counsel, <em>see Am. Motors Corp. v. Huffstutler, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 343, 346, 575 N.E.2d 116 (1991), and there is no requirement in public-records mandamus cases that public offices or officials must \u201cconclusively establish\u201d the privilege by producing agreements retaining agents or joint-defense agreements with attorneys representing other clients. Therefore, Ohio State properly withheld the remaining requested records based on the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\n<em>Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 39} Because Ohio State complied with the vast majority of its obligations under R.C. 149.43 in responding to ESPN\u2019s records requests, and ESPN\u2019s claims are largely without merit, we deny ESPN\u2019s request for attorney fees. <em>See State ex rel.

However, even in a society where an open government is considered essential to maintaining a properly functioning democracy, not every iota of information is subject to public scrutiny. Certain safeguards are necessary.\u201d <em>State ex tel. Wallace v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 431, 438, 732 N.E.2d 960 (2000). \u201cThe General Assembly has provided these safeguards by balancing competing concerns and providing for certain exemptions from the release of public records pursuant to R.C. 149.43.\u201d <em>Mahajan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 497, 2010-Ohio-5995, 940 N.E.2d 1280, \u00b6 66. By incorporating exemptions to disclosure provided by other federal and state law, R.C. 149.43(A)(l)(v) acknowledges these competing concerns that weigh in the favor of nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 41} Because, for the most part, Ohio State established that FERPA and the attorney-client privilege prohibited the disclosure of the requested records, we deny the writ to that extent. For those limited records that should have been disclosed \u2014 at Respondent\u2019s Evidence, Vol. Ill, Part 2, pages 668, 829-835, 859-863, 999-1001, and 1009-1012, following the redaction of personally identifiable information, that is, the names of the student-athlete, his parents, his parents\u2019 addresses, and the person associated with the student-athlete mentioned therein \u2014 and were thus not exempt from disclosure based on FERPA, however, we grant the writ. We also deny ESPN\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AkA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Laura Osseck and Kristen Henry; Hollie Reedy; Community Legal Aid Services, Inc., Christina M.

Ohio State also withheld some of the requested records based on the work-product privilege. Because all of the records for which it requested application of this privilege were also covered by the previously discussed attorney-client privilege, we need not address this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
