In 2009, we suspended Crosby from the practice of law in Ohio for 24 months, with reinstatement conditioned upon his satisfaction of numerous judgments. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Crosby, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 226, 2009-Ohio-6763, 921 N.E.2d 225, \u00b6 22-34. We have since suspended Crosby\u2019s license to practice law for an interim period pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(3), due to his felony conviction. <em>In re Crosby, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1424, 2010-Ohio-5295, 936 N.E.2d 72. In addition, Crosby\u2019s license is under suspension because he has failed to register as an attorney for the current biennium. <em>In re Attorney Registration of Crosby, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 1420, 2011-Ohio-5627, 956 N.E.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we disbar Crosby, based on his repeated misconduct and multiple violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree that Crosby committed professional misconduct as found by the board, and we accept the recommendation of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 3} In January 2011, relator, disciplinary counsel, filed a five-count amended complaint against Crosby, alleging multiple violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Crosby answered, and a panel of the board held a hearing on the complaint in June 2011 and proceeded on the evidence presented there, as well as on the stipulated exhibits and facts. After the hearing, the panel made findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended disbarment. The board adopted the panel\u2019s report in its entirety. Crosby filed objections to the board\u2019s recommendation, asserting that his misconduct warrants only a two-year suspension, to run concurrently with the suspensions already imposed. We overrule Crosby\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s recommendation to disbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">\n<em>Count One (The Tax Matter)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulated that in 2010, Crosby pled guilty to federal charges of attempted income-tax evasion, a felony, having failed to file tax returns from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>2001 through 2006. As part of his sentence, the court ordered Crosby to pay $314,637 to the IRS. <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>N.D.Ohio No. I:10cr253 (Sept. 23, 2010). Crosby stipulates that he has not made any restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 5} The parties further stipulated that Crosby used his Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Account (\u201cIOLTA account\u201d) to hide his income from the IRS. They agree that Crosby violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude), 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\n<em>Count Two (The J.R, and B.P. Matter)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 6} In June 2002, Crosby filed a lawsuit against the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland and others (\u201cthe Catholic Church\u201d) on behalf of J.R. and B.P., who alleged that they had been sexually abused by a Catholic priest. Crosby and J.R. agreed to a contingent fee, but because of a dispute over the timing of a handwritten revision to the agreement, the percentage agreed to is unclear. Jeffrey Anderson, an attorney from Minnesota, served as co-counsel. Crosby failed to advise J.R. and B.P. that he did not maintain malpractice insurance, failed to provide them with a written notice containing this information, and did not obtain their signatures on any such written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 7} In January 2003, J.R., represented by different counsel, filed for bankruptcy and listed the lawsuit against the Catholic Church as an asset. The bankruptcy court eventually issued an order discharging J.R.\u2019s debts. After this discharge, Crosby settled the lawsuit with the Catholic Church on behalf of J.R. for $175,000. Anderson instructed Crosby to prorate the costs and expenses among their clients. When Crosby presented the settlement agreement to J.R., he urged J.R. to sign it without reading it, so J.R. was unaware that his legal matter had been settled for $175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 8} Crosby received the $175,000 settlement check payable to J.R. and Crosby\u2019s law firm. Although Crosby did not have a power of attorney from J.R. or permission to sign, Crosby signed J.R.\u2019s name \u201c(per POA)\u201d on the back of the check. Crosby failed to prepare a settlement distribution sheet for J.R., but he charged J.R. a 40 percent contingent fee, plus $10,000 for expenses. Crosby did not promptly disburse any of the remaining $95,000 settlement funds to J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 9} Crosby also failed to inform the bankruptcy court about the J.R. settlement or to seek bankruptcy court approval for the settlement agreement or the attorney fees. After J.R.\u2019s bankruptcy attorney advised the court that J.R.\u2019s \u201ccase against the diocese has apparently been settled for $175,000,\u201d Crosby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>disbursed $5,000 to J.R. from his settlement funds, identifying the check as a \u201cnet distribution exemption.\u201d Two months later, Crosby disbursed $10,000 to J.R. from his settlement funds in his IOLTA account. Eight months after that, Crosby disbursed the remaining $80,000 to J.R., identifying this payment as the \u201cfinal distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 10} Crosby failed to turn over funds and provide documentation to the bankruptcy court regarding the J.R. settlement. As a result, the bankruptcy trustee filed a complaint for monetary damages against Crosby and J.R., seeking the remaining $80,000 in settlement funds paid to J.R. and the $17,500 in settlement funds paid to Crosby as attorney fees, and the court revoked J.R.\u2019s discharge of his debts. Two years later, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the trustee and against Crosby and J.R., jointly and severally, for $35,257.16 and against Crosby for $17,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 11} As to Count Two, the panel concluded and the board agreed that Crosby\u2019s conduct violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4), 1 \u2014 102(A)(5), 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), 1-104 (requiring a lawyer to inform a client if the lawyer does not maintain professional-liability insurance), 7-102(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from concealing or knowingly failing to disclose that which he is required by law to reveal), 7-102(A)(7) (prohibiting a lawyer from counseling or assisting his client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal or fraudulent), and 9-102(B)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client in the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his client regarding them).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\n<em>Count Three (The IOLTA-Account Matter)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 12} In July 2003, Crosby deposited a check for $175,000, representing J.R.\u2019s settlement proceeds, into his IOLTA account. After deducting a 40 percent contingent fee and a $10,000 expense reimbursement, Crosby owed J.R. $95,000. The next month, Crosby disbursed $5,000 to J.R. from this settlement. After J.R. cashed the check, Crosby\u2019s IOLTA account should have held a balance of at least $90,000, reflecting the funds still owed to J.R. Instead, the balance in Crosby\u2019s IOLTA account was $82,959.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 13} Two months later, Crosby disbursed an additional $10,000 to J.R. Crosby\u2019s IOLTA account should have then held a balance of at least $80,000, reflecting the funds still owed to J.R.; however, the balance in Crosby\u2019s IOLTA account was $4,619.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 14} In May 2004, Crosby\u2019s IOLTA account balance was $43.52 when he deposited $500,001 in unrelated settlement proceeds, which he used to disburse the remaining $80,000 to J.R. Because Crosby\u2019s IOLTA account balance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>below the amount of settlement funds owed to J.R. and being purportedly held by Crosby in his IOLTA account, Crosby misappropriated funds belonging to J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 15} As to this count, the panel found and the board agreed that Crosby\u2019s conduct violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4), 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), and 9 \u2014 102(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Count Four</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>(The J.R., B.P., M.A., H.F., and J.G. Matter)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 16} Crosby undertook representation of J.R., B.P., M.A., H.F., and J.G., who alleged that they had been sexually abused by a Catholic priest, in claims against the Catholic Church. Crosby entered into a contingent-fee agreement with J.G. and M.A. for this representation. This agreement advised them that Minnesota attorney Jeffrey Anderson would be acting as co-counsel. When the defendants and Crosby\u2019s clients settled the lawsuit, Anderson provided Crosby with a bill for $15,579.21 in costs and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 17} Because Crosby and Anderson were involved in representing several parties against the Catholic Church, Anderson advised Crosby that his costs and expenses should be prorated among the plaintiffs. In June 2003, when Crosby received $800,000 in settlement checks for the five clients, he prepared a settlement-distribution sheet for J.G. and M.A., which stated that each paid a 40 percent contingent fee and $5,000 for his share of case-related expenses. J.G. and M.A. signed these statements. Ultimately, Crosby\u2019s five clients paid $30,000 for expenses, twice as much as documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 18} As to this count, the panel concluded and the board agreed that Crosby\u2019s misconduct violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 1 \u2014 104(A), 7-102(A)(3), 9 \u2014 102(B)(3), and 9 \u2014 102(B)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver to the client the funds, securities, or other properties to which the client is entitled).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">\n<em>Count Five (The Malpractice Matter)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">{\u00b6 19} In 2009, Crosby was cross-examined in a malpractice lawsuit filed against him by J.R. Crosby testified that J.R. had given Crosby a power of attorney and that the $175,000 settlement check was deposited pursuant to that power of attorney. Crosby also testified that he kept $80,000 of the settlement proceeds owed to J.R. in his IOLTA account for almost one year because \u201cthat\u2019s where [J.R.] directed [Crosby] to maintain the funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">{\u00b6 20} When J.R. and his legal counsel filed a grievance with disciplinary counsel alleging that Crosby had engaged in ethical misconduct in the handling of the lawsuit for J.R. and the other four clients, Crosby replied that he \u201cdid not advise [J.R.] to make misrepresentations to the bankruptcy court\u201d and that \u201c[all five clients] received every dollar due under their settlement agreements.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>further testified that he had \u201chad no involvement with nor further notice of any events involving the [J.R.] bankruptcy\u201d beyond the fact that he \u201cunderstood that under bankruptcy law [J.R.] was entitled to the first $5,000 of his proceeds, and probably additional proceeds once the question of his \u2018exemption under Ohio law\u2019 was settled.\u201d Crosby added that he had \u201cconsulted with the Cleveland bankruptcy attorney about this matter, and mentioned to J.R. that he may want to speak with this lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 21} As to Count Five, the panel and board agreed that Crosby\u2019s misconduct violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4), 1 \u2014 102(A)(5), and 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring cooperation with disciplinary counsel\u2019s investigation of misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Aggravation and Mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 22} The panel and board found the following aggravating factors: prior disciplinary offense; dishonest or selfish motive; pattern of misconduct; multiple offenses; false statements made during the disciplinary process; and vulnerable clients, who had apparently been abused not only by a priest, but by the lawyer they trusted to right the wrongs that had been done to them as children. And as to J.R., the panel and board found that Crosby\u2019s conduct had caused him to lose his bankruptcy protection. Finally, Crosby still owes the full restitution amount of $314,637 to the IRS. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (h), and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 23} The panel and board found the following mitigating factors: imposition of other penalties or sanctions and alcohol dependency. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(f) and (g). However, Crosby provided no competent evidence that his alleged alcohol dependency contributed to cause the misconduct charged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">{\u00b6 24} Disciplinary counsel recommends that Crosby be disbarred. The panel and board also recommend disbarment. Crosby seeks a two-year suspension, to run concurrently with his other suspensions, and asks that treatment for alcohol abuse and mental illness be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">{\u00b6 25} Crosby argues that permanent disbarment would exceed the penalty that this court has imposed in similar cases. When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in other cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">{\u00b6 26} Crosby argues that this court has routinely applied one-year suspensions, with credit for the period of any interim suspension, to attorneys who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>convicted of tax evasion or fraud. However, with regard to Count One alone, Crosby\u2019s misconduct warrants disbarment. Crosby failed to file tax returns or pay his personal taxes for six years, intentionally used his IOLTA account to conceal assets from the IRS, and was convicted of felony attempted tax evasion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AgP\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert R. Berger Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 27} Similar cases have resulted in disbarment. In <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Schram, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 8, 2009-Ohio-1931, 907 N.E.2d 311, Schram failed to file income-tax returns for 20 years, failed to pay federal withholding taxes for her employees, and was convicted of felony tax crimes. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9. Like Crosby, Schram had a prior disciplinary record and had failed to make complete restitution to the IRS. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12. This court disbarred Schram. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13. Although Crosby\u2019s failure to file federal income-tax returns and failure to pay federal income taxes was for six years rather than 20, Crosby\u2019s other aggravating factors make disbarment appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b628} With regard to his other four counts, Crosby stipulated that he misappropriated nearly $80,000 in J.R.\u2019s funds, and the board found that Crosby had engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation when he charged his five clients $30,000 in expenses that in fact totaled around $15,000. As noted by disciplinary counsel, the presumptive sanction for misappropriation of client funds is disbarment. <em>See, e.g., Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Fernandez, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 426, 2003-Ohio-4078, 793 N.E.2d 434, \u00b6 9; <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Dixon, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 490, 2002-Ohio-2490, 769 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 27; and <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Belock, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 694 N.E.2d 897 (1998) (public confidence in the judicial system and the bar requires the strictest discipline for misappropriation cases, and the appropriate discipline when a lawyer converts client funds is disbarment).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 29} Crosby lied to the IRS, the bankruptcy trustee, his clients, the courts, and disciplinary counsel. His pervasive dishonesty, combined with his misappropriation of client funds, compels us to permanently disbar Crosby from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 30} Costs are taxed to Crosby.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AFF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Dworken &amp; Bernstein Co., L.P.A., and Patrick J.
