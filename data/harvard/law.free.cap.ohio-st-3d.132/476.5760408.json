VII(5b), the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law has recommended our approval of a consent decree proposed by relator, Ohio State Bar Association, and respondents Immigration Associates, L.L.C., Barbara Abbitt, and Gerald Abbitt. We accept the board\u2019s recommendation and approve the proposed consent decree submitted by the parties as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 2} 1. Respondent Immigration Associates, L.L.C., was a limited-liability company organized according to the laws of Ohio and did business at 37 West Broad Street, Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio 43215.

Pursuant to the articles of organization filed with the Ohio secretary of state, the individual members of Immigration Associates included Gerald Abbitt and Matthew Abbitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 3} 2. Elizabeth Harris was a member of Immigration Associates but was not named in the articles of organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b6 4} 3. Barbara Abbitt, Gerald Abbitt, and Matthew Abbitt are not and have never been admitted to the practice of law in Ohio or in any other state, and Immigration Associates did not employ any attorney in the regular course of its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">{\u00b6 5} 4. Matthew and Gerald Abbitt filed a \u201cRegistration of Limited Liability Company\u201d and articles of organization to form Immigration Associates on January 21, 2004, for the following purpose: \u201cTo assist and represent foreign nationals in the immigration process including work authorization, permanent residence, and obtaining American citizenship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">{\u00b6 6} 5. Immigration Associates maintained an office on the ground floor at 37 West Broad Street, across from the Columbus, Ohio office of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) with the display of its name, \u201cImmigration Associates, LLC,\u201d and signage that offered its services for \u201cRenewal Green Card/Work Authorization\u201d and \u201cForms and Assistance,\u201d among other services.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">{\u00b6 7} 6.
