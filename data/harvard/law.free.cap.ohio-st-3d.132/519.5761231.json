Adkins and Jo Ellen Adkins, for a writ of prohibition to prevent appellee, Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge Megan Shanahan, from exercising any further jurisdiction in <em>Smith v. Adkins, </em>Hamilton M.C. No. 10CV12756.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">{\u00b6 2} Judge Shanahan does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction in the underlying case despite appellants\u2019 claim that a no-asset bankruptcy discharge under 11 U.S.C. 727 in 2001 barred the action. As appellants acknowledge, the complaint in the municipal court case alleged a secured-debt claim, which would not be discharged by the bankruptcy. Moreover, the bankruptcy discharge specified that \u201cnot all\u201d types of debts were discharged. Further, there is evidence that the parties to the underlying suit had an ongoing relationship that continued well after the bankruptcy discharge was entered in 2001. Finally, appellants may have waived their affirmative defense of discharge in bankruptcy by failing to raise it in the municipal court case in an answer or an amended answer. <em>See, e.g., Fountain Skin Care v. Hernandez, </em>175 Ohio App.3d 93, 2008-Ohio-489, 885 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 21 (2d Dist.); <em>Hill v. Petty, </em>4th Dist. No. 93CA15, 1993 WL 525006, *4 (Dec. 14, 1993); <em>Jim\u2019s Steak House, Inc. v. Cleveland, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 18, 20, 688 N.E.2d 506 (1998) (plurality opinion) (\u201cAffirmative defenses other than those listed in Civ.R. 12(B) are waived if not raised in the pleadings or in an amendment to the pleadings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">{\u00b6 3} Therefore, appellants could not establish that Judge Shanahan <em>patently and unambiguously </em>lacked jurisdiction over the underlying municipal court case. \u201c[WJithout a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court possessed of general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party contesting that jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by appeal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bell v. Pfeiffer, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 114, 2012-Ohio-54, 961 N.E.2d 181, \u00b6 19. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Because the court of appeals\u2019 duty in prohibition cases is limited to determining whether jurisdiction is patently and unambiguously lacking, neither that court nor this court needed to rule on the merits of appellants\u2019 jurisdictional claim to resolve their prohibition claim. <em>See generally State ex rel. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Hamilton Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 111, 2010-Ohio-2467, 931 N.E.2d 98, \u00b6 39. Consequently, the court of appeals correctly dismissed appellants\u2019 claim for extraordinary relief in prohibition, and we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-U\">Charles E.
