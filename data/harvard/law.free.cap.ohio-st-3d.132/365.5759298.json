Capper of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, Juvenile Section, from proceeding in a parentage action involving the child and to direct Judge Capper to enter a finding that all orders that have been entered in that case are void. Because Judge Capper patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in the parentage proceeding, since the child was not made a party to the case and good cause was not shown for not making the child a party, we grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2009, Rachel Arnold gave birth to a child in Ohio. Arnold, who was unmarried, executed a document permanently surrendering her rights to the child, and the child was placed for adoption through a private adoption service. On May 26, 2010, relators\u2019 adoption of the child was finalized. No putative father had registered with the Ohio Putative Father Registry at that time. Relators and the child do not reside in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">{\u00b6 3} On October 6, 2010, Todd S. Rocearo filed a complaint to establish paternity in the Clark County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, Juvenile Section. Rocearo named only Arnold \u2014 the child\u2019s biological mother \u2014 as a defendant and requested a judgment declaring him to be the child\u2019s biological father, designating him as the child\u2019s sole and residential custodial parent, and ordering child support and other relief to which he may be entitled. Rocearo did not name the child as a party to the case and did not show good cause for not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In August 2011, Judge Capper denied Arnold\u2019s motion to dismiss and determined that the juvenile court had jurisdiction to determine Roccaro\u2019s paternity claim solely for the limited purpose of allowing him to exercise his statutory rights to provide information regarding his social and medical history for placement in the child\u2019s adoption records. In November 2011, Judge Capper ordered the parties to the parentage action \u2014 the alleged biological father (Roccaro) and the biological mother (Arnold) \u2014 as well as a nonparty \u2014 the minor child\u2014 to submit to genetic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 5} On January 25, 2012, relators, the child\u2019s adoptive parents, filed this action for a writ of prohibition to prohibit Judge Capper from proceeding in the underlying parentage action and to direct him to enter a finding that all orders that have been entered in the case are void. After Judge Capper submitted an answer to relators\u2019 complaint, we granted an alternative writ staying the pending juvenile court proceedings, including the order for genetic testing, and ordered the parties to submit evidence and briefs, including briefing on the \u201cissues of whether the juvenile court has subject-matter jurisdiction and in personam jurisdiction over relators and the minor child.\u201d 131 Ohio St.3d 1464, 2012-Ohio-714, 962 N.E.2d 313. The parties have submitted their evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 6} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of Judge Capper\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended answer and on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\n<em>Respondent\u2019s Motion for Leave to File Amended Answer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 7} Judge Capper filed a motion for leave to file an amended answer, and he attached the written consent of relators\u2019 counsel to his motion. In his amended answer, which was filed after the court ordered briefing on, inter alia, the issue whether the juvenile court has in personam jurisdiction over relators and the minor child in the parentage case, Judge Capper admits that he has exercised and is about to exercise judicial power in the case when he patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to do so. More specifically, the judge agrees that the juvenile court lacks in personam jurisdiction over the child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">In the underlying case, Clark C.P. 2010-JUV-0536, the child was not named as a party, and the plaintiff in the underlying case did not show good cause why the child should not be named or attempt to amend the complaint, pursuant to R.C. 3111.07(A). Therefore, in personam jurisdiction over the child and Relators is lacking, and Respondent does not have jurisdiction to order the genetic testing or to order the filing of a social and medical history by the claimed putative father of the child, and the underlying matter must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure supplement the Supreme Court Rules of Practice unless they are clearly inapplicable. S.Ct.Prac.R. 10.2. Civ.R. 15(A), which governs amendments to pleadings, is not clearly inapplicable to original actions filed in this court. <em>See State ex rel. Essig v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 481, 2004-Ohio-5586, 817 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 16. \u201c[T]he language of Civ.R. 15(A) favors a liberal amendment policy and a motion for leave to amend should be granted absent a finding of bad faith, undue delay or undue prejudice to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Hoover v. Sumlin, 12 </em>Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 465 N.E.2d 377 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 9} We find that the motion was not filed in bad faith and that granting the motion will not result in undue delay or undue prejudice to relators. The judge\u2019s motion was filed only a little over a month after his answer was filed, and relators have consented to the amendment, which concedes that they are entitled to the requested writ. For these reasons, and given the policy favoring liberal amendment of pleadings under Civ.R. 15(A), we grant Judge Capper\u2019s motion for leave to file his amended answer. <em>See State ex rel. Hackworth v. Hughes, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 110, 2002-Ohio-5334, 776 N.E.2d 1050, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\"><em>Prohibition </em>\u2014 General <em>Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 10} In general, to be entitled to the requested writ of prohibition, relators must establish that Judge Capper is about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power, that the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and that they lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Bell v. Pfeiffer, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 114, 2012-Ohio-54, 961 N.E.2d 181, \u00b6 18. Judge Capper is exercising judicial power by proceeding in the parentage action instituted by Roccaro, who claims to be the child\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 11} For the remaining requirements, if a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions. <em>See State ex rel. Otten v. Henderson, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 453, 2011-Ohio-4082, 953 N.E.2d 809, \u00b6 22. When a court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction, the availability of other remedies, such as an appeal, is immaterial. <em>State ex rel. Bates v. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Appellate Dist., </em>130 Ohio St.3d 326, 2011-Ohio-5456, 958 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 12} Relators claim that Judge Capper patently and unambiguously lacks both personal and subject-matter jurisdiction to proceed in the parentage action.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">\n<em>Personal Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIt is rudimentary that in order to render a valid personal judgment, a court must have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d <em>Maryhew v. Yova, </em>11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Ohio St.3d 154, 156, 464 N.E.2d 538 (1984). Consequently, a \u2018\u201ctrial court is without jurisdiction to render judgment or to make findings against a person who was not served summons, did not appear, and was not a party to the court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>MB West Chester, L.L.C. v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 430, 2010-Ohio-3781, 934 N.E.2d 928, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>State ex rel. Ballard v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>50 Ohio St.3d 182, 553 N.E.2d 650 (1990), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 14} Moreover, a parentage action under R.C. 3111.04(A) brought to establish the existence of a father-and-child relationship must include the child as one of the necessary parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">The natural mother, each man presumed to be the father under section 3111.03 of the Revised Code, and each man alleged to be the natural father shall be made parties to the action brought pursuant to sections 3111.01 to 3111.18 of the Revised Code or, if not subject to the jurisdiction of the court, shall be given notice of the action pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The child support enforcement agency of the county in which the action is brought also shall be given notice of the action pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The court may align the parties. <em>The child shall be made a party to the action unless a party shows good cause for not doing so. </em>Separate counsel shall be appointed for the child if the court finds that the child\u2019s interests conflict with those of the mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">(Emphasis added.) R.C. 3111.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 15} A party\u2019s failure to join an interested and necessary party constitutes a jurisdictional defect that precludes the court from rendering a judgment in the case. <em>See Portage Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Akron, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-954, 846 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 99 (declaratory-judgment action). In the underlying parentage action, the alleged biological father, Roccaro, faded to name the minor child \u2014 an interested and necessary party pursuant to R.C. 3111.07(A) \u2014 as a party and failed to show good cause why the child should not be joined as a party. The child was not served with a summons, did not appear, and was not a party to the parentage action. Therefore, as Judge Capper now concedes, he patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to proceed in the case by ordering that the child submit to genetic testing, and the writ of prohibition is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\n<em>Subject-Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">{\u00b6 16} Relators next claim that Judge Capper patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to order the child to undergo genetic testing in the parentage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>case because their adoption of the child was finalized before the parentage case was filed. Judge Capper contends otherwise, relying on our decision in <em>State ex rel. Furnas v. Monnin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 279, 2008-Ohio-5569, 898 N.E.2d 573, \u00b6 23 (denying a writ of prohibition sought by adoptive parents by holding that \u201ca final decree of adoption does not patently and unambiguously divest a juvenile court of jurisdiction to determine paternity solely for the limited purpose of allowing the putative father to establish that he is the biological father so that he can exercise his statutory rights under R.C. 3107.09 and 3107.091 to provide information regarding his social and medical history for placement in the child\u2019s adoption records\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 17} Because relators\u2019 personal-jurisdiction claim, which Judge Capper agrees has merit, resolves this prohibition case, we need not address relators\u2019 subject-matter-jurisdiction claim. \u201cThis result is consistent with our well-settled precedent that we will not indulge in advisory opinions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Keyes v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>123 Ohio St.3d 29, 2009-Ohio-4052, 913 N.E.2d 972, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 18} In sum, because Judge Capper patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in the underlying parentage case, we grant the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition to prevent him from exercising further jurisdiction and to compel him to find void the orders that have been entered in that case, including his order of genetic testing, and to dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b545-10\">McGee Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWZ6\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">{\u00b6 19} I concur in the judgment granting the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition but write separately to add that I believe that the court should address the second issue raised by relators and hold that Judge Capper patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to order genetic testing because the claimed biological father did not timely register on the Ohio Putative Father Registry and did not timely object to relators\u2019 adoption of the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">{\u00b6 20} In general, \u201cR.C. 3107.15(A) provides that a final decree of adoption issued by an Ohio court has the effect of terminating all parental rights of biological parents and creating parental rights in adoptive parents.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kaylor v. Bruening, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 142, 145, 684 N.E.2d 1228 (1997). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the final decree of adoption entered in May 2010 generally terminated the parental rights of the child\u2019s biological parents.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"As3\">Voorhees &amp; Levy, L.L.C., and Michael R. Voorhees, for relators.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A4j\">D. Andrew Wilson, Clark County Prosecuting Attorney, and Andrew P. Pickering, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 21} The importance of finality in adoption proceedings cannot be overstated. Nevertheless, in <em>State ex rel. Furnas v. Monnin, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 279, 2008-Ohio-5569, 898 N.E.2d 573, \u00b6 23,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we recognized an exception to this general rule by authorizing paternity testing \u201csolely for the limited purpose of allowing the putative father to establish that he is the biological father so that he can exercise his statutory rights under R.C. 3107.09 and 3107.091 to provide information regarding his social and medical history for placement in the child\u2019s adoption records.\u201d The applicability of this limited exception, however, was circumscribed by the facts of that case, which included an objection in the adoption proceeding before the adoption became final. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 22} Because no comparable facts are present here, the putative father lacked standing to raise his paternity claim by not timely registering on the putative-father registry and by failing to timely object to the adoption. Therefore, I believe that the judge patently and unambiguously lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to order genetic testing in the parentage case. And given the possibility that other judges may similarly misconstrue the court\u2019s limited holding in <em>Furnas </em>by applying it to cases that do not have facts similar to those in <em>Furnas, </em>the issue is capable of repetition, yet evades review. Thus, the court should address relators\u2019 remaining jurisdictional claim and hold that it also has merit.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\">. For the reasons expressed in the dissenting opinions in <em>Furnas, </em>I am also troubled by the holding in that ease. <em>See Furnas </em>at \u00b6 28-il (O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
