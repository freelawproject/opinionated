The plaintiff claimed that the defendant supplied concrete that did not meet the specifications the plaintiff had ordered and that, as a result, the sidewalks and driveways it built for approximately 60 clients required replacement. The plaintiff further alleged that it had started replacing the concrete at its own expense. As pertinent here, the second cause of action alleged fraud and the fourth cause of action alleged a violation of General Business Law \u00a7 349. In the order appealed from, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted those branches of the defendant\u2019s motion which were for summary judgment dismissing, as time-barred, so much of the second cause of action as sought to recover damages for conduct allegedly committed prior to August 2, 2009, and for summary judgment dismissing the fourth cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The Supreme Court properly granted that branch of the defendant\u2019s motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the fourth cause of action, alleging a violation of General Business Law \u00a7 349. The defendant established, prima facie, that the cause of action did not involve consumer-oriented deceptive practices, but was based on a private contract that is unique to the parties (see <em>New York Univ. v Continental Ins. </em>Co., 87 NY2d 308, 320 [1995]; <em>Caterpillar Ins. Co. v Metro Constr. Equities, </em>130 AD3d 856, 859 [2015]; <em>Biancone v Bossi, </em>24 AD3d 582, 583 [2005]). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact (see <em>Biancone v Bossi, </em>24 AD3d at 583).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The Supreme Court, however, erred in granting that branch of the defendant\u2019s motion which was for summary judgment dismissing, as time-barred, so much of the second cause of action as sought to recover damages for conduct allegedly committed prior to August 2, 2009. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the second cause of action stated a cause of action to recover damages for fraud, not for an intentional tort. The defendant thus failed to demonstrate its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on this issue, as its arguments were based on the one-year statute of limitations for intentional torts <em>(see </em>CPLR 215 [3]), not the longer limitations period applicable to fraud <em>(see </em>CPLR 213 [8]). That branch of its motion should therefore have been denied without regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the sufficiency of the opposition papers (see <em>Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr., </em>64 NY2d 851, 853 [1985]). The defendant\u2019s contention that the cause of action alleging fraud is duplicative of the cause of action alleging breach of contract is not properly before us since the defendant did not move to dismiss the fraud cause of action on this ground.</p>\n<judges id=\"A1t\">Leventhal, J.P., Sgroi, Hinds-Radix and Maltese, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
