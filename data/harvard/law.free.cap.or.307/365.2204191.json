We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Petitioners are in the Oregon State Penitentiary. Each was the subject of a Board of Parole (Board) order setting his initial release date. In petitions to the Court of Appeals for judicial review, each challenged his release date. ORS 144.335(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before the Court of Appeals made any decision on the merits, the Board withdrew both orders and then issued new orders giving petitioners the relief they had been seeking in the Court of Appeals. Thereafter, the Court of Appeals dismissed Dumler\u2019s petition, designated him the prevailing party,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and awarded him costs, but it denied his claim for a prevailing party fee. Stelljes also was designated the prevailing party, but he continued his action against the Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals then affirmed the Board\u2019s new order in his case and designated the Board as the prevailing party. <em>Stelljes v. Board of Parole, </em>90 Or App 643, 754 P2d 40, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>(1988) <em>rev den </em>306 Or 156, 758 P2d 347 (1988). Stelljes then petitioned for costs and a prevailing party fee. The Court of Appeals awarded him costs; however, it denied his claim for a prevailing party fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Petitioners argue that they prevailed in the Court of Appeals because on reconsideration they obtained the relief they had been seeking in the Court of Appeals, even though the Board withdrew and modified its original orders before the Court of Appeals made any decision on the merits. They argue further that ORS 20.320 mandates award of the prevailing party fee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Stelljes also relies on ORS 183.482(6).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board argues that petitioners did not prevail on the merits <em>in </em>the Court of Appeals and, further, that ORS 183.482(6) does not apply to judicial review of Board orders. We agree with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Costs and attorney fees are not recoverable absent a statute or contractual provision authorizing the award. <em>Compton v. Weyerhaeuser, </em>302 Or 366, 367, 730 P2d 540 (1986); <em>Lewis v. Department of Revenue, </em>294 Or 139, 142, 653 P2d 1265 (1982); <em>State Highway Com. v. Efem Whse. Co., </em>207 Or 237, 242, 295 P2d 1101 (1956). ORS chapter 183 generally governs judicial review of administrative actions and ORS 183.497 controls the award of costs in such cases. <em>See Shetterly, Irick &amp; Shetterly v. Emp. Div., 302 </em>Or 139, 142, 727 P2d 117 (1986). However, the Board is specifically exempted from the provisions of ORS 183.497. ORS 183.315(5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ORS 144.335 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>governs judicial review of Board of Parole orders. Under that statute, the Court of Appeals is granted authority to \u201caffirm, reverse or remand the order. ORS 144.335(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">We conclude that in order to receive a prevailing party fee in these cases, petitioners had to prevail on the merits <em>in </em>the Court of Appeals. They did not do so. The Court of Appeals dismissed Dumler\u2019s petition, and Stelljes\u2019s case was decided in favor of the Board. Petitioners may have benefited from the Board\u2019s new orders; however, any such benefit resulted from the <em>Board\u2019s </em>action not from any decision on the merits by the Court of Appeals. Thus, they did not prevail on the merits <em>in </em>the Court of Appeals and, therefore, are not entitled to ORS 20.190 prevailing party fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We recognize that this result may be contrary to what might happen in a different case under ORS 183.482(6). However, our duty is to interpret the law, not to rewrite it. The problem, if any, is for the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\"> ORS 20.190 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cA prevailing party in a civil action or proceeding who has a right to recover costs and disbursements in the following cases also has a right to recover, as a part of the costs and disbursements, the following additional amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\u201c(1) In the * * * Court of Appeals, on an appeal, $85.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\"> ORS 144.335 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">\u201c(1) When a person over whom the board exercises its jurisdiction is adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the board related to the granting, revoking or discharging of parole, such person is entitled to judicial review of the final order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">&lt;&lt;* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">\u201c(3) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order on the same basis as provided in ORS 183.482(8).
