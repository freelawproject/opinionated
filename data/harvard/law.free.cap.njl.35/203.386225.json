The surveyors commenced, as their return certifies, at the beginning stake, and ran to the stake planted for the ending of the road. No useful purpose can be subserved by requiring .greater certainty than is .used in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">2. The return certifies that regard was had to the public and private convenience, and the prosecutor insists that in this the surveyors erred; that they should have considered only the private convenience of the applicant and land-owner, and not the convenience of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The return is in strict accordance with the letter of the fifth section of the road act, which directs that the surveyors shall view \u25a0 the premises, and if they think it necessary, lay \u2022out the said public or private road, as may appear to them to be most for the public and private convenience. In this respect, the statute makes no difference between a public and a private road, and conformity with it is not only proper, but necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">A private road, laid out under the statute, is not a private way, or right of way, but is open to the use of the public, and a failure to certify that, in laying it, regard was had to the public convenience, would be fatal to the validity of the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">3. The third r-eason assigned for reversal is, that the applicant paid each surveyor $5 for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In <em>The State </em>v. Bergen, 1 <em>Zab. </em>344, where the surveyors were paid $2 each, Justice Whitehead says: \u201cThat it is manifestly improper for the applicants for a road to tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the surveyors, or for the surveyors to receive more for their services than the fees prescribed by statute.\u201d Whether this would be a fatal objection was not decided in that case, as it was not among the reasons assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The working of the practice, if permitted, is that the applicant will pay the surveyors more than their leg\u00e1l fees, if his application is favorably considered ; otherwise he will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">If he may pay them $5, he may pay them $25 each; conceding the right, leaves the sum to be paid at the option of the applicant. The surveyors may not be influenced by the hope of increased compensation, yet the fact that they receive it will tend to cast suspicion upon their action, and withdraw from them the respect and confidence of those upon whose rights they pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">I agree with Justice Whitehead, that the acceptance by the surveyors of anything in excess of their legal fees is manifestly improper, and shall hold that, for this reason, the return should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Justice Scudder concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Cited <em>in State, Hubbard, pros., </em>v. <em>Reckless, </em>9 <em>Vr. </em>396.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
