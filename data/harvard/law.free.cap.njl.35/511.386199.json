If such is the fact, we cannot disregard it, notwithstanding if the fact were otherwise we would be obliged to require other notices. If the notices have been sufficient to procure a proper remonstrance, we must refuse to make the appointment of commissioners under these proceedings. A rule will be granted the applicants, if desired, to take affidavits on the question whether the remonstrance is signed by the owners of a majority of the lands. No further action will be taken until that fact is determined</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
