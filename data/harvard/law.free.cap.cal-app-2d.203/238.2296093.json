Previously, upon motion for new trial and consistent with a condition imposed by the court, plaintiff consented to a reduction of the judgment to the sum of $10,000; the motion for new trial was thereupon denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The bizarre events in which the criminal prosecution had its genesis are of such a nature that we relate only those details which will furnish the general background of the instant litigation; necessarily they and other material matters are viewed in the light most favorable to plain tiff-respondent. In 1956 plaintiff was employed by defendant as a branch store manager in the latter\u2019s vacuum cleaner business; in that capacity he was obliged to make frequent calls at defendant\u2019s main store for supplies. One evening in the summer of 1958 he made such a call, requesting certain articles from Jerry Kahan, one of defendant\u2019s employees. According to plaintiff, Kahan said to him: \u201cOh, don\u2019t bother me.\u201d Such statement was immediately followed by an obscene suggestion which resulted in a $10 wager and certain lewd acts performed by plaintiff in the rear of the store, after which he told Kahan the latter owed him $10. Present were Jerry Kahan, Kahan\u2019s brother and one Graf; also in the store were defendant and his partner, David Barer.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Immediately after the incident plaintiff went to the front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>of the store; in the presence of the defendant and all of the persons above named, plaintiff again stated that Kahan owed him $10.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Within a short time thereafter plaintiff voluntarily left defendant\u2019s employ\u2014they are said to have parted amicably, although plaintiff admitted that he subsequently \u201cpestered\u201d Jerry Kahan on numerous occasions for payment of the wager. On August 6, 1958, or thereabouts, plaintiff filed a claim with the Labor Commissioner for wages assertedly due him; while a hearing was had, no decision (one way or the other) was apparently ever reached. Plaintiff also applied for unemployment insurance; his application was not approved by defendant, but plaintiff in due time received all the benefits to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">On or about September 18, 1958, defendant went to the Wilshire police station; eventually he was referred to one Fusilier, a detective assigned to the vice detail. He told Fusilier about the events in the back room of his store, and Fusilier thereafter interviewed the Kahan brothers at the scene of the incident. A crime report was prepared and signed by Fusilier, the defendant and the Kalians. After preparing the report, Fusilier phoned the chief complaint deputy in the city attorney\u2019s office, related the facts to him and was told to forward the report for further action. The report eventually reached Deputy City Attorney John Concannon; following routine procedure, Concannon set the case down for hearing and instructed both sides by letter to be present in order that he might determine whether to issue a complaint. On September 30, the scheduled date, the defendant, Barer (his partner) and the Kahan brothers appeared in Concannon\u2019s office; plaintiff did not appear. Concannon questioned those present at some length and then discussed the case with his immediate superior. Later that day a complaint, sworn to by defendant, issued; it charged plaintiff with indecent exposure (Pen. Code, \u00a7331) and \u201clewd and dissolute\u201d conduct (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647). After two days of trial to a jury, the court of its own motion dismissed the complaint. Approximately two months later (February 3, 1959) the present action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Having denied in his answer the necessary averments in plaintiff\u2019s complaint that he acted with malice and without probable cause, and having affirmatively alleged (as a separate defense) that he relied in good faith on the advice of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>duly qualified prosecuting officer of the City of Los Angeles,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defendant now contends that the trial judge \u201cwas guilty of error or abused his discretion\u201d in denying the motion for nonsuit based upon plaintiff's failure to sustain the burden of proof with respect to such essentials (malice and want of probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The burden of proving the basic elements of the tort must be met by one complaining that the criminal charge was unjustifiable. <em>(Clary </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>175 Cal.App.2d 880, 886 [1 Cal.Rptr. 91].)  Here it was necessary for plaintiff to prove the following facts: (1) termination of the criminal proceedings in his favor; (2) want of probable cause for instituting such proceedings; and (3) malice on defendant\u2019s part. <em>(Jaffe </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>18 Cal.2d 146, 149 [114 P.2d 335, 135 A.L.R 775].) Since defendant in his answer has admitted (1) above, we are only concerned with (2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Citing the early (and leading case) of <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Rawles, </em>93 Cal. 222 [28 P. 937, 27 Am.St.Rep. 174], as well as later cases in accord, appellant argues that there was no dispute concerning the existence of the facts relied on to establish want of probable cause; therefore, he concludes, the trial court should have determined as a matter of law whether such facts warranted an inference of want of probable cause. In the <em>Ball </em>case, <em>supra, </em>however, the court had these additional observations to make concerning the determination of the question of probable cause: \u201cWhile it is not necessary to show that the crime has in fact been committed, it is necessary to show, not only that the defendant had reasonable ground to believe, but that he did in fact believe, that the crime had been committed, and that the plaintiff had committed the crime. Although the question of probable cause, as we have seen above, is a question of law, yet the belief of the defendant in a state of facts is itself a fact which it is proper to submit to the jury for its consideration; and when<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ever the <em>good faith </em>of the defendant, or his knowledge or belief in an existing state of facts, is an element in determining whether there was probable cause, the court should submit that question to the jury, as well as the other facts which, in its opinion, bear upon that issue.\u201d (P. 234.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u201cGood faith is an independent element of probable cause in malicious prosecution cases, and an actual and honest belief in the guilt of the plaintiff is obviously an integral part of good faith.\u201d (32 Cal.Jur.2d, Malicious Prosecution, \u00a7 23.)  There was evidence that the police department was not contacted until mid-September although the criminal complaint alleges that the offense was committed on or about July <em>10; </em>meantime, plaintiff remained in appellant\u2019s employ (although for a brief period) and was admittedly a guest in appellant\u2019s home on at least one occasion. Appellant also admitted, when Ms deposition was taken, that, \u201cIt had never occurred to me that a crime was committed. It only occurred to me that the man did a ridiculous thing that he just shouldn\u2019t do any more.\u201d It was for the jury to determine from the foregoing circumstances, taken collectively, whether \u201can actual and honest belief in the guilt of the plaintiff\u201d was entertained by appellant. The adverse inference, implicit in the verdict reached, is substantially supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Appellant\u2019s good faith in soliciting the advice of a duly qualified deputy city attorney was also material to the affirmative defense (setting forth such matters) because it is the law that when a defendant in a malicious prosecution action seeks such advice \u201cand makes a full and fair statement of all material facts with respect to an alleged criminal charge, and <em>in good </em>faith, accepts the advice of counsel that he has a meritorious cause, it must be presumed he has \u2018made out a complete defense to the action.\u2019 [Citation.] \u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 269, 274 [212 P.2d 569].) As further pointed out in the case just cited, \u201cthe advice of counsel must be sought <em>in good faith </em>and not as a mere cloak to protect one against a suit for malicious prosecution or to refute the theory of malice. [Citation.] It follows that when the advice of counsel is not sought in good faith, it affords no defense to a suit for malicious prosecution, particularly when material facts have been omitted from the statement made to counsel. \u2019 \u2019 (P. 274.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Portions of the testimony of various witnesses are quoted at length in appellant\u2019s opening brief\u2014he has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>filed a reply brief. Emphasized is part of Fusilier\u2019s testimony which, according to appellant, establishes the claim that he gave the officer \u201cthe whole story\u201d: \u201cWell, he mentioned to me about the Labor Commission, for instance, that Mr. Klotz had gone up there and he mentioned that he was smart, he said smart so and so,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and he got more, shall we say confidential as we went along, and I got the whole story, everything that happened, and then I later took this application for a complaint.\u201d Omitted from appellant\u2019s brief, however, is other testimony (on the part of Fusilier) which negatives the claim that <em>counsel, </em>as distinguished from Fusilier, was furnished all the facts. It appears that Fusilier, following his taking of the application for a complaint, telephoned Deputy City Attorney Thomas, Concannon\u2019s superior, regarding the matter. Asked whether he gave Thomas \u201cthe benefit of your information as to the possibility that this was a private quarrel and that Mr. Alexander might be motivated for selfish reasons in that he discussed the matter of the Labor Commission and things like that, did you include that in your report?\u201d Fusilier answered: \u201cNo, not in the typewritten, but I called him up on the telephone.\u201d Later, while Fusilier was still on the stand, the following occurred: \u2018 \u2018 Q.' Now, still then at no time, at any time, either verbally or in writing, did you notify the City Attorney that you had some reservations about this, that there was a possibility that this was a private feud and there might be some agitation on Mr. Alexander\u2019s part to get even about this Labor Commission thing, and at no time did you impart any of that information to the City Attorney? A. That\u2019s correct. At no time did I impart that information to the City Attorney. Q. Either to Mr. Thomas or anybody else? A. That\u2019s correct. I, at no time, imparted that information. Q. You didn\u2019t see fit to attend the hearing that was held in Mr. Coneannon\u2019s office ? A. That\u2019s correct. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Subpoenaed by the appellant, Concannon testified that he had no \u201cindependent recollection\u201d of the case\u2014relying on an \u201cinterview sheet\u201d which was prepared at the time of appellant\u2019s appearance in his office. He was further questioned as follows: \u201cQ. Did you receive any information from any source other than the crime report that you have before you, before you prepared and issued that complaint? A. I don\u2019t have any record or notation to that effect. Q. You have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>present recollection of having received any other information f A. I don\u2019t have any recollection at the present time, no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Although, as noted above, the burden of proving want of probable cause rested with the plaintiff, the burden of establishing reliance upon the advice of counsel was upon defendant-appellant. <em>(Albertson </em>v. <em>Raboff, </em>185 Cal.App.2d 372, 386 [8 Cal.Rptr. 398] ; <em>Diggs </em>v. <em>Arnold Bros., Inc., </em>132 Cal.App. 518, 523 [23 P.2d 71].)  Advice of counsel can only be shown by proving the facts that were stated by a defendant to counsel <em>(Singleton </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 681, 695 [157 P.2d 886]) and not by what was disclosed by him to a police officer. <em>(Centers </em>v. <em>Dollar Markets, </em>99 Cal.App.2d 534, 545 [222 P.2d 136].)  Fusilier\u2019s testimony gives the impression that he considered appellant\u2019s complaint not to have been wholly uninspired by animosity or malice; he also stated that he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure this crime had actually taken place,\u201d adding, \u201cThat is why I had the hearing rather than proceed by warrant, had the hearing in the City Attorney\u2019s Office and leave it to his discretion whether or not he would get a warrant.\u201d If Thomas or Concannon had been informed of the entire background of this controversy, one or both might have concluded that appellant was not in good faith and was simply using the episode in question as a means of retaliation for the asserted annoyance plaintiff had caused him in collateral matters which affected the operation of his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u201c Where the evidence is in conflict or subject to different inferences as to whether there was a full, fair and complete disclosure to the attorney of all of the facts of the case within the knowledge of the client or as to whether the client acted in good faith on the advice of the attorney, it is for the trier of the fact to resolve such conflict or draw the credible inferences.\u201d <em>(Albertson </em>v. <em>Raboff, supra, </em>185 Cal. App.2d 372, 386.)  As in the case of want of probable cause, the evidence at bar sufficiently supports the adverse inference drawn by the jury that the disclosure was neither full nor fair nor made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">With respect to the element of malice, Fusilier testified (as pointed out already) that appellant stated he was going to \u201cget\u201d the plaintiff, referring to the latter as a \u201cson of a bitch.\u201d Similar threats and epithets were used in <em>Siffert </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 373, 377 [229 P.2d 388], which prompted this court to conclude: \u201c In such a situation it was certainly a jury function to determine whether the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of malicious prosecution had been established.\u201d  In <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>188 Cal. 118, 126 [204 P. 578], it was further declared (quoting from an earlier case) that the existence of malice may be \u201c \u2018inferred by the jury from want of probable cause for the prosecution, or from acts or declarations of the defendant expressing or indicating prejudice, ill will, or malicious motive in the matter of the prosecution.\u2019 \u201d There is no merit to appellant\u2019s claim as to this phase of the instant proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Next, it is contended that plaintiff failed to prove any damages beyond the cost of his defense of the criminal action; in this general connection appellant argues that the award of $25,000 by the jury, reduced to $10,000 by the trial court, was so \u2018\u2018fantastically excessive \u2019 \u2019 that it was \u2018 \u2018 obviously given under the influence of passion and prejudice\u201d\u2014appellant does not, however, expressly challenge the reduced amount consented to by plaintiff. The attorney for plaintiff was paid $800 to defend him in the criminal proceeding, the reasonableness of which sum is not questioned; a further expenditure of $100 was also proved and likewise is not challenged. We cannot say that the amount remaining, $9,100, is excessive as a matter of law, particularly since, \u201cIt is the province of the jury and then of the trial court upon motion for new trial, to determine and fix the amount of damages awarded a litigant.\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>106 Cal.App. 518, 531-532 [289 P. 940].) It is settled that damages for malicious prosecution may include \u201c \u2018loss of time, deprivation of liberty, . . . injury to fame, reputation, character, . . . mental suffering. ...\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ray Wong </em>v. <em>Earl C. Anthony, Inc., </em>199 Cal. 15, 18 [247 P. 894].) There was evidence of mental suffering, mortification and humiliation\u2014plaintiff, after all, stood trial for two days before a jury. We repeat that appellant has not expressly challenged the reduced amount fixed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Another assignment of error concerns the admission of expert testimony, over objection, that plaintiff could not have performed the act for which he demanded payment of the wager agreed upon. Although the error is said to be prejudicial, it appears that appellant\u2019s counsel undertook to cross-examine the witness at considerable length; under the circumstances, we are of the view that no prejudice appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Finally, appellant complains of the giving of an instruction relating to probable cause and malice which assertedly \u201ctold the jury to bring in a verdict for the respond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ent, Klotz.\u201d The instruction is not open to such criticism when read with other instructions; furthermore, appellant is in no position to complain since the record does not reveal the source of any of the instructions\u2014whether given at plaintiff\u2019s request, at his (appellant\u2019s) request, or on the court\u2019s own motion. <em>(Rodriguez </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>171 Cal.App.2d 761,768 [341 P.2d 410].)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Wood, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 27, 1962.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Said separate defense reads: \u201cThe defendant acted in good faith, and before aiding in the procuring of the arrest of plaintiff, he stated all the facts and circumstances connected with the transaction fully, fairly, and truthfully to a representative of the police department and a Deputy City Attorney of the City of Los Angeles and after such statement said Deputy City Attorney advised this defendant that the plaintiff was guilty of the crimes set forth in Paragraph II of the complaint on file herein; that this defendant having full faith in and acting upon the advice of said Deputy City Attorney that plaintiff was guilty of said crime did cooperate with said Deputy City Attorney and sign a document in connection with the issuance of said complaint and did testify at plaintiff\u2019s trial,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Earlier, according to Fusilier, appellant said of plaintiff: \u201cThat son of a bitch, I\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
