In the fall of 1960 he was advised that if he parked his vehicle in one of the parking lots on the campus without entering into a lease agreement he would receive a ticket for illegal parking. The college charged a fee of $13 per semester for the privilege of parking in an unreserved space on campus. With certain exceptions not applicable here, it was necessary to enter into an agreement and pay a fee for the privilege of parking on the campus.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The issue presented by this appeal is whether or not a state agency, and particularly a state college, was authorized prior to September 15, 1961, by statute, regulation or otherwise to provide parking facilities for state employees on state-owned property and charge the users of such facilities a fee for the privilege of parking their private vehicles on said parking lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">The decision of the trial court was based upon the court\u2019s view that no statutory authority existed authorizing the charging of such a fee and in the absence of such statutory authority the college officials lacked the right to charge a parking fee. Appellants contend that no such specific statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tory authorization is required to support the imposition of the parking fees involved in this case and that if such specific statutory authority is required adequate authority is found in the provisions of section 13109 of the Government Code and section 24103 of the Education Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Section 13109 of the Government Code at the time of the decision in this matter in the trial court, and at the present time, provides in part as follows; \u201cWith the consent of the state agency concerned, the director may: (a) Let for a period of not to exceed five years, any real or personal property which belongs to the State, the letting of which is not expressly prohibited by law, if he deems such letting is in the best interests of the State. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Section 24103 of the Education Code, as it was in effect at the time here involved, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cThe president of a state college, with the approval of the Director of Education and Director of Finance, may let any property of the state college for any purpose which will not interfere with the requirements of the state college. The Director of Education and the Director of Finance may each exempt from the requirement of his approval under this section certain types or classes of transactions and authorize the entering into of such transactions without submitting them for his approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201cAny rental received under this section shall be deposited in the State Treasury and credited to the support appropriation or appropriations of the college current during the period of occupancy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The trial court in its decision held that the word \u201clet\u201d used in these sections, authorizing the letting of state property, is the equivalent of the word \u201clease.\u201d From this assumption the court then proceeded to hold that since the arrangement entered into between the college and the members of the staff for the providing of parking facilities does not amount to a \u201clease\u201d as that term is interpreted with respect to a granting of an interest in real property, the imposition of the fees were not authorized by these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Appellants contend that the word \u201clet\u201d as used in these two statutes is not the equivalent of the word \u201clease\u201d and that the authorization given by these statutes is not restricted to the execution of a lease creating the relationship of landlord and tenant, but such authorization includes the right to execute an agreement for the use of state property in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>nature of a license, i.e., the granting of the use of state property for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Appellants argue that this interpretation is supported first by the fact that the Legislature in enacting section 24103 of the Education Code, with which we are here concerned, purposely used the word \u201clet\u201d in the phrase \u201cmay let any property of the state college,\u201d whereas in the two preceding sections the Legislature specifically used the word \u201clease.\u201d Section 24101 provides that the director \u201cmay lease any property of a state college,\u201d and section 24102 provides that the director \u2018\u2018 may lease land of a state- college. \u201d  They argue further that \u201cIt must be presumed that this use of a different word in section 24103 was deliberate and that the legislature had in mind a distinction between a \u2018lease\u2019 and a \u2018letting\u2019 of property. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that section 24103 authorizes the Director to \u2018let\u2019 both real and personal property. There would not be a leasing of personal property but rather a hiring out of such property. For example, if a state college had a number of typewriters which were not needed, under this section such typewriters might be let to private persons upon the payment of a consideration. This would not be a lease creating the relationship of landlord and tenant, but a letting out of property. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We have concluded that appellants\u2019 contention must be sustained. We believe that in using the word \u201clet\u201d the Legislature intended that the Director of Education might permit the use of state property upon the payment of a consideration and that such letting need not amount to the execution of a formal lease. This conclusion is supported by a study of the word \u201clet\u201d and its meaning. In 52 Corpus Juris Secundum, at page 1052, the various meanings of the word \u201clet\u201d as judicially construed are set forth. It is therein stated that the word \u201clet\u201d when used as a verb means: \u201cTo allow; to award; to demise; to exchange; to give; to give leave to ; to permit; to grant the use of realty for compensation; to hire out a thing for a compensation; to lease; to lease or grant the use and possession of a thing for compensation.\u201d It is also stated therein that the word \u201clet\u201d has been held to mean the correlative of the word \u201chire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1959) defines the word \u201clet\u201d to mean, \u201cTo allow to be used or occupied for a compensation; to lease; to rent; to hire out; . . .\u201d; also \u201cTo permit; allow; suffer; ...\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word \u201clet\u201d as follows: \u201cTo grant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>temporary possession and use of (land, buildings, rooms, movable property) to another in consideration of rent or hire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We believe that these definitions of the word \u201clet\u201d do not indicate a restricted meaning such as that indulged in by the trial court in reaching its conclusion herein. Section 24103 of the Education Code provides that the president of a state college \u201cmay let any property of the state college for any purpose which will not interfere with the requirements of the state college.\u201d Section 2 of the Education Code provides that its provisions are to be liberally construed with a view to effect its objects.  We are satisfied that the Legislature used the word \u201clet\u201d in the broad sense and that the requirement that members of the faculty of the state college could not park their automobiles in the parking lot on the campus without entering into an agreement to pay a fee for the privilege was within the authority granted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">As an \u25a0 alternative ground for affirming the judgment respondent contends that appellant, Sacramento State College, has no power to adopt a revenue raising regulation in the absence of specific authority and states that the so-called fee is in reality a revenue raising device and a tax. In support of this contention he relies on the finding of emergency appended to section 953.5 of title 5, California Administrative Code when it was filed with the Secretary of State. This is the section which provides for the letting of parking space. The finding of emergency stated in part that the budgets for the state colleges had been reduced by an amount equal to the estimated revenue from vehicle parking charges, and it was necessary that there be no interruption in the collection of such charges to finance the operation of the state colleges in accordance with legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">While it is no doubt true that appellant has no power to adopt a revenue-raising regulation in the absence of specific authority, the parking fee involved in the instant case is not a tax.  \u201cA tax is a forced charge, imposition, dr contribution; it operates in invitum, and is in no way dependent upon the will or contractual assent, express or implied, of the person taxed.\u201d (51 Am. Jur., Taxation, \u00a7 5; see also <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>20 Cal. 318.)  In the instant case the fee for parking was not imposed against respondent regardless of whether he wanted to use the parking facilities or not. It was optional with him whether or not he chose to use the facilities. In such a case the fee charged was not a tax. <em>(Westbrook, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town of Falls Church, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>185 Va. 577 [39 S.E.2d 277, 167 A.L.R. 1027].) There is therefore no merit in this argument of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">No other points require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Peek, P. J., and Pierce, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 3, 1962.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
