He argues the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Specifically, he contends the Commonwealth failed to establish he performed the act through the use of the victim\u2019s mental incapacity. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\u201cOn appeal, \u201cwe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">So viewed, the evidence proved that on December 8, 2001, Michael Wright picked up Ross Klinefelter, a twenty-two-year-old mentally retarded male. Wright drove Klinefelter to Mitchell\u2019s residence. Mitchell played a pornographic videotape depicting homosexual sex acts and asked Klinefelter if he was \u201cgetting turned on.\u201d Mitchell then performed oral sex on Klinefelter. Klinefelter became upset, left the house, and reported the incident to his mother who contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In a statement to the police, Mitchell initially denied having performed oral sodomy on Klinefelter, but later admitted having done so. Mitchell also remarked that he knew Klinefelter was mentally ill and that he thought Klinefelter \u201cdid not know what was going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">An accused shall be guilty of forcible sodomy if he or she engages in ... fellatio ... with a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse ... and ... [t]he act is accomplished against the will of the complaining witness ... through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">The evidence established Klinefelter is mentally retarded. Mitchell admitted he knew Klinefelter was retarded, and in his written statement acknowledged he did not think Klinefelter knew what was happening. Mitchell, alone with Klinefelter in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>his bedroom, played a pornographic video in order to arouse his victim. He admitted he then performed oral sex on Klinefelter. The evidence also indicated that Klinefelter did \u201cnot understand \u2018the nature and consequences of the sexual act involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 332, 343, 457 S.E.2d 382, 387 (1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\u201cThe inferences to be drawn from proven facts, so long as they are reasonable, are within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Hancock v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 774, 782, 407 S.E.2d 301, 306 (1991). Based upon the evidence presented, the trial court reasonably concluded Mitchell performed the sex act through the use of Klinefelter\u2019s mental incapacity. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was competent, was not inherently incredible, and was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mitchell was guilty of forcible sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
