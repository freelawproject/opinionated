(mother) appeals from an order terminating her parental rights to her children, a daughter, M., and a son, R. On appeal, she contends termination under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii) was error because the evidence failed to establish that she was convicted for \u201cfelony sexual assault\u201d or that termination was in the best interests of the children. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>lee, the Albemarle County Department of Social Services (DSS), contends this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal because mother failed to join the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem. </em>In the alternative, DSS contends the appeal is barred because mother failed to give proper notice of her filing of the trial transcript. We hold that both the appeal and the trial transcript are properly before us. We hold further that mother\u2019s federal conviction was for \u201cfelony sexual assault\u201d within the meaning of the termination statute and that the evidence was sufficient to support the termination. Thus, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">M. was born in 1991, and R. was born in 1993. Mother\u2019s husband, a member of the military who was the father of R. but not the father of M., was convicted of multiple criminal sexual offenses committed against both children while the family lived on a military base in North Carolina, and he was incarcerated as a result. Mother subsequently moved to Virginia to live with her family, and when mother was indicted for related offenses and held pending extradition, she signed an entrustment agreement with the Albemarle County Department of Social Services (DSS).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">By order entered June 25, 2002, mother was convicted for abusive sexual contact in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(1) and (c) and contributing to the delinquency of a minor pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, in conjunction with North Carolina Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-316.1. That contact involved mother\u2019s son, R. As a result of those convictions, DSS sought termination of mother\u2019s parental rights. A guardian <em>ad litem </em>was appointed for the children and also for mother based on her incarceration. The juvenile and domestic relations district court termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>nated mother\u2019s parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii), and mother appealed. Thereafter, mother was sentenced on the federal convictions to serve 70 months in prison and to undergo three years of supervised probation, during which time the court ordered that mother \u201cshall not have any contact with the victims\u201d or \u201cany child under age 18.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The circuit court terminated mother\u2019s parental rights based on a finding that mother\u2019s conviction for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(1) and (c) justified termination under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii) because her conviction was for \u201ca crime which constitutes felony sexual assault under the Code of Virginia.\u201d The court also found that termination was in the children\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Mother\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>filed a timely notice of appeal in the circuit court. The certificate included as part of the notice of appeal indicated that \u201cA Guardian <em>ad litem </em>was appointed for the children as well as the Defendant mother (incarcerated at the time of the proceedings).\u201d Neither the notice nor the certificate identified the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>by name or indicated that mother served the children\u2019s guardian with a copy of the notice of appeal. Mother submitted a cover letter with the notice of appeal, which letter (1) stated that \u201ca Notice of Appeal\u201d was enclosed and (2) included the notation, \u201cCc: Andrew H. Herrick, Esq.[;] William M. Marshall, Esq.\u201d Although that letter did not specifically identify Marshall as the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>other documents in the trial court\u2019s record confirmed his status as their guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"Anv\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">DEFICIENCIES IN NOTICE OF APPEAL AND ACCOMPANYING CERTIFICATE</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">DSS moves to dismiss the appeal on the ground that this Court lacks jurisdiction because of deficiencies in mother\u2019s notice of appeal. DSS argues that mother \u201cfail[ed] to join the children\u2019s Guardian <em>ad litem </em>as a party to the case\u201d because she failed to certify in her notice of appeal that she mailed or delivered a copy of the notice to all opposing counsel, i.e., the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem. </em>It also complains that the notice failed to list the name and address of appellant; name, address and telephone number of counsel for appellant; and name, address and telephone number of appellee\u2019s counsel. Mother argues she substantially complied with the requirements of Rule 5A:6 because she in fact notified the guardian of the filing in a timely fashion, as indicated by the cover letter attached to the notice of appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Rule 5A:6 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">(a) Timeliness. \u2014 No appeal shall be allowed unless, within 30 days after entry of final judgment or other appealable order or decree, counsel files with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal, and at the same time mails or delivers a copy of such notice to all opposing counsel and the clerk of the Court of Appeals____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>(d) Certificate. \u2014 The appellant shall include with the notice of appeal a certificate stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">(1) the names and addresses of all appellants and appellees, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of counsel for each party, and the address and telephone number of any party not represented by counsel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">(2) that a copy of the notice of appeal has been mailed or delivered to all opposing counsel....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u201cWe have held that the failure to file a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court within 30 days after entry of final judgment as required in Rule 5A:6(a) is jurisdictional and that we have no authority to extend the time____\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 510, 512, 339 S.E.2d 919, 920 (1986). Further, in a suit involving a termination of parental rights, a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the child or children is an indispensable party to the appeal and, thus, qualifies as an \u201copposing counsel\u201d under Rule 5A:6(a), to whom the appellant has a duty to mail or deliver a copy of the notice of appeal. <em>Hughes v. York County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>36 Va.App. 22, 25-26, 548 S.E.2d 237, 238-39 (2001). Thus, we have held that where the certificate accompanying the notice of appeal does not list the name and address of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>and \u201c[t]he record reflects that [the] appellant failed to provide the guardian <em>ad litem </em>with the notice of appeal or the opening brief[,] [t]he guardian <em>ad litem </em>was not ... made a party to the appeal,\u201d and the appeal must be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>Under these circumstances, the court never acquires jurisdiction over the indispensable party. <em>Asch v. Friends of the Community of the Mount Vernon Yacht Club, </em>251 Va. 89, 93, 465 S.E.2d 817, 819 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">We have never held, however, that Rule 5A:6(d)\u2019s provisions regarding the contents of the accompanying certificate are jurisdictional. The fact that subsection (d) states the certificate \u201cshall include\u201d certain information does not compel a different result. <em>Cf. Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 440, 454, 579 S.E.2d 671, 678 (2003) (holding that, as long as petition for appeal is timely filed, \u201cthe provisions of Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>5A:12(c) stating what the petition \u2018shall contain\u2019 ... are not jurisdictional\u201d and \u201cdo not prevent us from exercising jurisdiction over assignments of error added to the petition, with leave of court, at a later date\u201d). Thus, we have jurisdiction over both the appeal itself and the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>an indispensable party, as long as the record establishes that, \u201cwithin 30 days after entry of final judgment or other appeal-able order or decree, counsel file[d] with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal, and at the same time mail[ed] or delivered] a copy of such notice to all opposing counsel.... \u201d Rule 5A:6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Here, the certificate accompanying the notice of appeal indicated that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>had been appointed for the children. Although the certificate did not indicate whether mother mailed a copy of the notice to the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the notice of appeal was accompanied by a cover letter signed by mother\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>that did, in fact, provide such information. The letter indicated (1) that it accompanied the notice of appeal and (2) that a courtesy or carbon copy was provided to William M. Marshall, Esq., whom other documents established was the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem. </em>Thus, the record establishes that appellant complied with the requirements of Rule 5A:6(a) by \u201cmailing] or delivering] a copy of such notice to all opposing counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 (providing that \u201csignature of an attorney or party [on a pleading, motion, or other paper] constitutes a certificate by him that (i) he has read the pleading, motion, or other paper, [and] (ii) to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact\u201d and that sanctions may be imposed for violations of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Further, although the certificate itself omitted other information required by Rule 5A:6(d), other portions of the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>contained everything but appellant\u2019s address,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the name and address of the appellee, and the telephone number for appellee\u2019s counsel. The certificate clearly indicated that mother provided appellee\u2019s counsel with notice of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201c[W]e do not minimize the necessity of adherence to the mandate of the Rule[s] by members of the bar. We consider the requirements in the Rule[s] to be significant and one[s] that should not be ignored.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>1 Va.App. at 513, 339 S.E.2d at 921. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">[bjecause appellant did in fact file a [timely] notice of appeal, and because the purpose of Rule 5A:6 was met, notice being given to appellees of continuing litigation, we hold that, under the facts of this case, dismissal for failure to satisfy the rules governing notice of appeal is unwarranted. Our construction of the rule assures judicial review of a decision affecting substantial interests without compromising either the rule or appellee\u2019s rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\"><em>Carlton v. Paxton, </em>14 Va.App. 105, 111, 415 S.E.2d 600, 603 (holding court acquired jurisdiction over appeal where notice of appeal was timely filed and properly styled to appeal May 11, 1990 adoption order but erroneously referred to order being appealed as one entered on April 22, <em>1986), aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>15 Va.App. 265, 422 S.E.2d 423 (1992). We hold that omission of the above-mentioned information was not jurisdictional, and we deny DSS\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">FAILURE TO GIVE NOTICE OF FILING OF TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">DSS contends mother\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 5A:8 precludes our consideration of the transcript of proceedings in the trial court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Rule 5A:8(a) provides that \u201c[t]he transcript of any proceeding is a part of the record when it is filed in the office of the clerk of the trial court within 60 days after entry of the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>judgment.\u201d Subsection (b) of the rule states that \u201ccounsel for appellant shall,\u201d within the time frame specified in the rule, \u201c(1) give written notice to all other counsel of the date on which the transcript was filed, and (2) file a copy of the notice with the clerk of the trial court.\u201d That subsection also details the circumstances under which an appellee who has not received timely notice of the filing under the rule may seek to have the offending transcript stricken from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">Any failure [by an appellant] to file the notice required by this Rule that materially prejudices an appellee will result in the affected transcript[ ] being stricken from the record on appeal. For purposes of this Rule, material prejudice includes preventing the appellee from raising legitimate objections to the contents of the transcript or misleading the appellee about the contents of the record. The appellee shall have the burden of establishing such prejudice in the brief in opposition or, if no brief in opposition is filed, in a written statement filed with the clerk of the Court of Appeals within twenty-one days after the record is received by the clerk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Rule 5A:8(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Here, appellant filed the transcript in a timely fashion under Rule 5A:8(a) but did not give written notice of that filing to opposing counsel, with a copy filed in the trial court. DSS contends that, as a result, its \u201ccounsel was not afforded the opportunity to review the trial transcript.\u201d DSS does not, however, allege that this failure \u201cprevent[ed][it] from raising legitimate objections to the contents of the transcript,\u201d \u201cmisle[d] [it] about the contents of the record,\u201d or disadvantaged it in any other way that would constitute material prejudice under Rule 5A:8(b). Thus, we hold the challenged transcript is properly a part of the record before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT PARENTAL RIGHTS TERMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">On appeal of an action to terminate residual parental rights, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>party prevailing below and afford the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991). The trial court\u2019s judgment, \u201cwhen based on evidence heard <em>ore tenus, </em>will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Peple v. Peple, </em>5 Va.App. 414, 422, 364 S.E.2d 232, 237 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The trial court granted DSS\u2019s petition to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 283(E)(iii). That code section provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">The residual parental rights of a parent ... of a child who is in the custody of a local board or licensed child-placing agency may be terminated by the court if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that ... (iii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of this Commonwealth or a substantially similar law of any other state, the United States or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes ... felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent or a child with whom the parent resided at the time of such offense____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u201cFELONY SEXUAL ASSAULT\u201d UNDER CODE \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 283(E)(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">\n<em>1. Sexual Assault Under Virginia Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Mother contends her federal conviction did not support the termination of her parental rights because it did not constitute a conviction for \u201cfelony sexual assault\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 283(E)(iii). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">\u201cIn construing statutes, courts are charged with ascertaining and giving effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Hill, </em>254 Va. 88, 91, 488 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1997). \u201c[A] fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that courts view the entire body of legislation and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>statutory scheme to determine the \u2018true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 157, 384 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1989) (quoting <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 292, 99 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1957)). In interpreting a statute, \u201c \u2018[t]he Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 77, 79, 441 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1994) (quoting <em>King v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 708, 710, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Mother argues that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)(iii) does not define \u201cfelony sexual assault\u201d and that \u201cthere is no criminal offense known as \u2018felony sexual assault\u2019 in Virginia\u2019s own criminal code.\u201d Mother is correct that no single offense in the Virginia Code is known as \u201cfelony sexual assault\u201d and that the only offense referred to as \u201csexual assault\u201d is \u201cmarital sexual assault,\u201d as proscribed in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2:1. What mother overlooks, however, is that the caption for the entire article within which the offense of marital sexual assault is contained is \u201cCriminal Sexual Assault.\u201d <em>See </em>1981 Va. Acts 518, ch. 397. The legislature itself chose this caption when it revised Virginia\u2019s rape statute and enacted additional statutes defining and proscribing various other sexual offenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>hold that, when the legislature amended Code \u00a7 16.1-283 in 1998 and added language permitting termination of the parental rights of a parent convicted of \u201cfelony sexual assault\u201d under certain circumstances, <em>see </em>1998 Va. Acts 1306, ch. 550, it intended by that reference to include <em>all </em>felony sexual assault offenses contained in Chapter 4, Article 7, of Title 18.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We also hold that mother\u2019s conviction for \u201cAbusive Sexual Contact\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(1)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was an offense \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to a qualifying sexual offense under Virginia law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) defines aggravated sexual abuse as \u201cknowingly engaging in a sexual <em>act </em>with another person who has not attained the age of 12 years ... or attempting] to do so.\u201d (Emphasis added). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(1) proscribes as a felony<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cknowingly engaging] in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>or causing] sexual <em>contact </em>with or by another person, if [doing] so ... would violate ... section 2241 of this title had the sexual contact been a sexual act.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, one violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(1) by \u201cknowingly engaging in [sexual contact] with another person who has not attained the age of 12 years ... or attempting] to do so.\u201d \u201c[S]exual contact\u201d is defined as \u201cthe intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Virginia\u2019s Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 defines aggravated sexual battery as encompassing the sexual abuse of a complaining witness who is less than thirteen years of age and proscribes the offense as a felony. \u201cSexual abuse\u201d is defined as \u201can act committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person, where ... [t]he accused intentionally touches the complaining witness\u2019s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts\u201d or \u201cforces the complaining witness to touch the accused\u2019s, the witness\u2019s own, or another person\u2019s intimate parts or the material directly covering such intimate parts.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6). Finally, \u201c \u2018[i]ntimate parts\u2019 means the genitalia, anus, groin, breast or buttocks of any person.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Thus, we affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that mother\u2019s \u201cfederal conviction\u201d for \u201cabusive sexual contact ... amounts to a felony sexual assault equivalent to aggravated sexual battery [under Virginia law], a felony.\u201d Mother in effect concedes on brief that her federal conviction constituted a finding of \u201csexual contact through the clothing of the child\u201d but argues that \u201cskin-to-skin contact or penetration\u201d was required to establish felony sexual assault under Virginia law. Based on our holding that felony sexual assault encompasses all felony offenses proscribed by Title 18.2, Chapter 4, Article 7 \u2014 including aggravated sexual battery as prescribed in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3\u2014 we reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\n<em>2.

It did not require that any appeals related to that conviction be exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Although the term, \u201cconviction,\u201d has been \u201cdifferently defined\u201d through the years, the Supreme Court has said that where the prior conviction establishes an element of a crime, that is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">\u201cwhere the reference is to the ascertainment of guilt in another proceeding in its bearings upon the status or rights of the individual in a subsequent case, ... a \u2018conviction\u2019 is ... established [or] a person [is] deemed to have been \u2018convicted\u2019 ... [where] it is shown [that the fact finder has rendered a verdict and] that a judgment has been pronounced upon the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\"><em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 589, 598, 113 S.E. 707, 710 (1922) (interpreting meaning of statute authorizing removal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>various public officials \u201cwho shall have been convicted\u201d of specified offenses) (quoting <em>People v. Fabian, </em>192 N.Y. 443, 85 N.E. 672, 675 (1908)), <em>cited with approval in Jewel v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 430, 432, 536 S.E.2d 905, 906 (2000) (discussing principle in context of impeachment with prior felony convictions); <em>see also Webb v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.

Whether an appeal has been noted or is pending generally is not relevant in this context. <em>See also Royal v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 110, 118, 458 S.E.2d 575, 579 (1995) (noting that, on issue of future dangerousness in capital case, \u201cthe trial court was entitled to consider Royal\u2019s prior murder conviction even though that conviction was on appeal at the time of sentencing\u201d); <em>Patterson v.

Had the legislature wished to provide that a felony sexual assault conviction could not be used as a predicate for the termination of parental rights unless all appeals had been exhausted, it could have said so in the statute. The legislature\u2019s recognition of the need for a reasonably swift resolution in foster care and termination cases<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> further supports the conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>legislature did not intend for a court considering such a petition to have to await the outcome of an appeal of a conviction serving as the predicate for the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Based on the language of the statute, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying mother\u2019s motion for a continuance pending the outcome of her appeal on the predicate federal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) requires proof by clear and convincing evidence <em>not only </em>that the parent was convicted of felony sexual assault of a child of the parent or a child with whom the parent resided <em>but also </em>that the termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the specific child or children regarding whom termination is sought. The particular facts upon which a parent\u2019s felony conviction for sexually assaulting her child was based may constitute clear and convincing evidence that termination of the parent\u2019s rights is in the best interests of the child assaulted or any other child in her legal or physical custody. In this opinion, we address only the specific facts of this case. Although \u2018\u201cthe rights of parents may not be lightly severed,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward v. Faw, </em>219 Va. 1120, 1124, 253 S.E.2d 658, 661 (1979) (quoting <em>Malpass v. Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 400, 192 S.E.2d 794, 799 (1972)), \u201ctrial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests,\u201d <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990). Under the facts of this case, we analyze the best interests issue in terms of both (1) the length of time mother will be legally unable to exercise physical custody of the children due to her incarceration and conditions of probation and (2) the nature of the acts that led to the conviction for sexually abusing R., as well as other acts and omissions of mother bearing on the best interests of both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u201cIt is clearly not in the best interests of a child to spend a lengthy period of time waiting to find out when, or even if, a parent will be capable of resuming his [or her] responsibilities.\u201d <em>Kaywood v. Halifax County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 535, 540, 394 S.E.2d 492, 495 (1990). Here, the evidence established that, based solely on the fact of mother\u2019s conviction, it was unlikely that she would be able to resume her parental responsibilities in the near future. Foster care social worker Sarah Klegar, a licensed clinical social worker with a master\u2019s degree in social work, testified that she had been the children\u2019s social worker for over a year prior to the circuit court termination hearing on October 23, 2002. Klegar testified that both mother and her husband, R.\u2019s father, were incarcerated at that time. The whereabouts of M.\u2019s father were unknown, and his parental rights had already been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Mother had been sentenced to serve five years ten months in prison, and her conviction required three years of supervised probation upon her release, one of the conditions of which was that she could have no contact with her children during that period of time. Based upon those conditions, Klegar testified that the earliest mother could again have contact with the children would be when M. was 21 and R. was 19. Klegar explored the possibility of placing the children with relatives in lieu of terminating mother\u2019s parental rights, but \u201cno[] [relatives] ha[d] been found to be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Further, Klegar opined that, even if mother\u2019s federal conviction and the provision barring contact with her children were overturned on appeal, Klegar would require, at a minimum, that any visitation between mother and the children be supervised. Klegar said further that she would want to talk to the children\u2019s therapist about whether they should have any contact with mother at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Although the precise basis for mother\u2019s federal conviction was not clear from the record, the evidence established that the conviction was for abusive sexual contact of her son, R. The limited substantive evidence that was introduced in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>termination proceedings permitted a finding that, in addition to the acts supporting her conviction for abusive sexual contact with R., mother had exercised poor judgment relative to both children and that this poor judgment had resulted in psychological harm to both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u2022Klegar testified that it was in the best interest of the children, who were nine and eleven at the time of the circuit court hearing, \u201cto be adopted, to have a permanent home that they know where they\u2019re going to grow up, they have a sense of identity, they have a sense of belonging. Children need that to feel safe and grow and develop.\u201d She also testified that she had had an opportunity to review \u201cin detail\u201d the recent psychological evaluations done on the children. She noted the children \u201chave numerous psychological diagnoses\u201d as a result of \u201cwhat\u2019s happened to them\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that M. \u201chas numerous behavior problems,\u201d as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Finally, the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>also opined that termination was in the children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to DSS, was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination of mother\u2019s parental rights was in the best interests of both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In sum, we hold that both the appeal and the trial transcript are properly before us. We hold further that mother\u2019s federal conviction was for \u201cfelony sexual assault\u201d within the meaning of the termination statute and that the evidence was sufficient to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination was in the children\u2019s best interests. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\">. As noted in footnote 3 and Part H.A., we grant DSS\u2019s pending motion to strike mother\u2019s affidavits and deny DSS's motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. At the hearing, DSS raised \"aggravated circumstances [under] ... [Code \u00a7 ] 16.1-283(E)[(iv)]\u201d as an alternative basis for termination of mother\u2019s parental rights. DSS explained that \"the aggravated circumstances provision ... was just added July 1st of 2002. Our petition was filed March 29th of 2002. So at the time the petition was filed in J and D R Court, I don\u2019t believe the aggravated circumstances alternative was even a possibility for social services at that point.\u201d However, DSS did not expressly move to amend the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The trial court, in framing <em>\"[tjhe </em>issue\u201d as whether mother's federal conviction \"constitutes a felony sexual assault under 16.1 \u2014 283(E)(iii),\u201d implicitly refused to amend the petition and did not consider whether termination could occur based on a finding of aggravated circumstances under subsection (E)(iv). (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-10\">. With the motion, mother filed affidavits from herself and the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>swearing that mother did, in fact, serve the notice on the children\u2019s guardian. DSS moves to strike the affidavits because they were not part of the record before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Under settled principles, we may not consider evidence that was not offered to the trial court unless such consideration is specifically authorized by statute or rule of court. <em>See, e.g., Kidder v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Pgm., </em>37 Va.App. 764, 780 n. 5, 560 S.E.2d 907, 914 n. 5 (2002). Thus, we grant DSS\u2019s motion to strike the affidavits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">. Unlike in <em>Hughes, </em>36 Va.App. at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 239, the certificates of service accompanying mother\u2019s appendix designation and questions to be presented as well as her opening and reply briefs all certify that copies of the designation and briefs also were served on William Marshall, guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\">. The certificate indicated that mother was incarcerated but did not state where she was incarcerated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">.

The legislature defines the term \"caption\u201d as \"that word or group of words appearing direcdy below the numerical designation given the subtitle, chapter or <em>article.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 1-13.9:1 (emphasis added). Unlike the contents of Code \u00a7 1-13.9 regarding the \"headlines\u201d of code \"sections,\" the code contains no provision stating that captions of subtitles, chapters or articles \"are intended as mere catchwords,\u201d and it expressly provides that a \"subtitle, chapter or article may be cited by its caption\u201d where no \"section or provision establish[es] or authoriz[es] a short tide citation for such subtide, chapter or article.\u201d Here, the legislature expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>chose the \"Criminal Sexual Assault\u201d caption and used that caption in various other statutes to refer to that article in the code. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-162.9:1 (prohibiting licensed home health care organizations from employing \"persons who have been convicted of ... sexual assault as set out in Article 7 (\u00a7 18.2-61 <em>et seq.) </em>of Chapter 4 of Title 18.2\u201d); Code \u00a7 53.1-131.2 (providing that \"any offender who is convicted of any of the following violations of Chapter 4 (\u00a7 18.2-30 <em>et seq.) </em>of Title 18.2 shall not be eligible for participation in the home/electronic incarceration program: ...
