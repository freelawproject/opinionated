ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">Timothy J. Parker (appellant) appeals from his jury trial conviction for maliciously causing bodily injury in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51. On appeal, appellant contends the admission of hospital records under the business records exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause because the records included his report of how he sustained the injuries for which he was treated. We hold the trial court\u2019s admission of the records was not error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In December of 1999 or January of 2000, appellant\u2019s brother, Anthony Parker (Parker), \u201chad an altercation\u201d with the victim while playing basketball in an athletic club. The victim feared for his safety but departed without sustaining any injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The victim next saw Parker on September 10,2000, at about 2:00 p.m., when the victim and two friends, Anthony Agee and William White, went to a different location, \u201cthe Dell,\u201d to play basketball. The victim recognized Parker but did not know appellant. Everyone but appellant began to play a \u201cpick-up game\u201d of basketball. Appellant stood behind the basketball rim holding a glass bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Two to three minutes into the game, someone hit the victim on the head from behind, cutting his head and neck. The victim \u201cwasn\u2019t sure who had hit [him] or what [he] got hit with,\u201d but he \u201cknew it was something that shattered.\u201d The victim \u201cknew [Parker] wasn\u2019t the one that hit me ... because I could see him [in front of me]. So I knew obviously there was someone else____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Agee, whose attention had been focused on the game and away from the victim, \u201cheard a sudden crash or break of glass.\u201d Agee immediately turned around and saw Parker and appellant \u201csurrounding\u201d the victim, whose head and neck were bleeding. Parker was in front of the victim, and appellant was behind the victim. No one else was nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">After the victim was hit from behind, Parker said something like, \u201c[Y]ou thought I forgot about that shit, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Agee and White immediately went to the victim to separate him from Parker and appellant. Agee noticed glass on the ground in the area of the attack. He also observed that appellant had a piece of glass \u201can inch or two\u201d long \u201csticking out of his finger\u201d \u201cfrom the glass that was on the ground\u201d on the basketball court. The victim confirmed that one of Parker\u2019s companions was holding his hand as he left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>On September 13, 2000, Officer Michael A. Blakey went to the residence of Parker to serve an arrest warrant on him for the incident in question. There, Blakey encountered appellant, who answered the door with a \u201cheavily bandaged\u201d right hand. Appellant \u201cdenied any involvement\u201d in the attack on the victim, saying that \u201che hurt his hand playing basketball at Garrett Square with his kids\u201d \u201con [Monday,] September the 11th\u201d and that he received medical treatment at Martha Jefferson Hospital that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth subpoenaed appellant\u2019s medical records from Martha Jefferson Hospital. The records indicated that appellant received medical treatment there between 2:30 and 7:00 p.m. on September 10, 2000, rather than on September 11 as he had told Officer Blakey. Notes from that treatment indicate appellant reported to two nurses and a physician that he \u201c[f]ell onto\u201d or \u201cput his hand down onto\u201d broken \u201cglass while playing basketball.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">On the morning of trial, appellant moved to exclude the medical records on the ground that the Commonwealth\u2019s plan to offer the records into evidence deprived appellant of his rights under the Confrontation Clause. The Commonwealth averred that the purpose of the records was to show appellant sustained an injury consistent with the offense for which he was on trial. The trial court made a preliminary ruling denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">At trial, Clarissa W. Bell, the custodian of medical records at Martha Jefferson Hospital, testified regarding records of medical treatment appellant received on September 10, 2000. She testified the records were \u201ckept in the normal course of business\u201d and were \u201crelied upon by the hospital in the course of its business.\u201d Appellant renewed his hearsay objection, stating, \u201cWe have no objection to [Ms. Bell\u2019s] being a proper custodian. It\u2019s really the Sixth Amendment ... confrontation\u201d argument because \u201cI\u2019m not able to cross-examine the individuals that apparently wrote these things.\u201d After the trial court overruled the objection and admitted the records, appellant argued the Commonwealth had to make a \u201cshowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>of unavailability of the authors of the documents.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a requirement of the business records exception. If you\u2019ve got a custodian and they\u2019re kept in the ordinary course of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">After the Commonwealth rested, appellant took the stand and denied striking the victim. He said that, during the scuffle, he heard a crash and saw glass on the court. He claimed that a piece of the glass stuck in his hand when he reached down to remove a piece that had become lodged in the sole of his shoe. Appellant admitted lying to the emergency room physician about how he sustained the injury because he was afraid for both himself and his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The jury found appellant guilty of maliciously causing bodily injury as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Appellant contends the trial court\u2019s admission of the hospital records under the business records exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause because \u201cI\u2019m not able to cross-examine the individuals that apparently wrote these things or created the hearsay we\u2019re concerned about.\u201d He also contends the Commonwealth had to prove \u201cthe authors of the documents\u201d were unavailable. The Commonwealth argues that the statements were not hearsay, that their admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause, and that, even if it did, the error was harmless. We hold that admission of the medical records containing appellant\u2019s statements was proper under a firmly rooted exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule and, thus, did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">The challenged statements in appellant\u2019s medical records contain two potential levels of hearsay \u2014 first, appellant\u2019s statements to the various hospital staff members and, second, the staff members\u2019 recordings of those statements in the medical records. \u201c[Hjearsay evidence which contains hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>should not be subject to an automatic rule of exclusion.\u201d <em>West v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 906, 909, 407 S.E.2d 22, 24 (1991). As long as \u201cboth the primary hearsay declaration and each hearsay declaration included within it ... conform to a recognized exception to the hearsay rule,\u201d those declarations are admissible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">APPELLANT\u2019S STATEMENTS TO MEDICAL PERSONNEL</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Appellant does not challenge the admissibility of the first level of potential hearsay, his statements to hospital personnel. We agree that those statements were properly admitted either because they were used for impeachment only and, thus, were not hearsay, <em>see Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 369, 374, 355 S.E.2d 591, 594-95 (1987), or because they were party admissions and, thus, were admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, <em>see Alatishe v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 376, 378, 404 S.E.2d 81, 82 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">ADMISSION OF MEDICAL RECORDS UNDER CONFRONTATION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">As to the second level hearsay issue, the medical records containing appellant\u2019s statements were admissible if they satisfied the requirements of the Confrontation Clause and the business records exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which applies to the States, provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The right to confront witnesses secured by the Sixth Amendment encompasses the right to cross-examine them. The right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses is a \u201cfunctional right\u201d that \u201cadvancefs] the pursuit of truth\u201d and \u201cpromotes reliability\u201d in criminal trials by \u201censuring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>convictions will not be based on the charges of unseen and unknown \u2014 and hence unchallengeable \u2014 individuals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4Z\"><em>Rankins v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 352, 364, 523 S.E.2d 524, 530 (2000) (quoting <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 540, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986)) (citations omitted). Under the Confrontation Clause, a hearsay statement of a declarant not present at trial is admissible \u201conly if it bears adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). The United States Supreme Court consistently has held, for Confrontation Clause purposes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">that the veracity of hearsay statements is sufficiently dependable to allow the untested admission of such statements against an accused when (1) \u201cthe evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or (2) it contains \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d such that adversarial testing would be expected to add little, if anything, to the statements\u2019 reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"><em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 124-25, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 1894, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (plurality opinion) (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The Supreme Court also has made clear \u201cthat unavailability analysis is a necessary part of the Confrontation Clause inquiry <em>only </em>when the challenged out-of-court statements were made in the course of a prior judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 354, 112 S.Ct. 736, 741, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (emphasis added). \u201c[I]f the challenged out-of-court statements were not made in the course of a prior judicial proceeding, the statements must only show \u2018indicia of reliability<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to meet the requirements of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>State v. Sutherland, </em>939 S.W.2d 373, 378 (Mo.1997) (citing <em>White, </em>502 U.S. at 354, 112 S.Ct. at 741). The Court held in <em>White </em>that \u201cestabhshing a generally applicable unavailability rule would have few practical benefits [beyond the reliability requirements already imposed by the Confrontation Clause]\u201d and would \u201cimposte] pointless litigation costs\u201d by requiring the prosecution \u201cto repeatedly locate and keep continuously avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>able each declarant, even when neither the prosecution nor the defense has any interest in calling the witness to the stand.\u201d <em>White, </em>502 U.S. at 355, 357, 112 S.Ct. at 742, 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Thus, if the business records exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rale is a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d and the contested \u201cevidence falls within' [that] exception,\u201d admission of the hospital records did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>1.

The business records exception to the hearsay rule has been a part of Virginia law since at least the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s 1917 decision in <em>French, </em>121 Va. 383, 93 S.E. 585.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Virginia\u2019s appellate courts have applied the business records exception repeatedly since that time. <em>See, e.g., White Sewing Mach.

L. Rev. 651, 668 (1970)). We hold the business records exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule is, in fact, a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\n<em>3. Admission of Appellant\u2019s Hospital Records Under Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Virginia expressly permits the introduction of certain portions of medical records under the business records exception to its hearsay rule. <em>See Dalton, </em>204 Va. at 104-06, 129 S.E.2d at 648-50 (admitting hospital records to show medical treatment injured party received prior to accident at issue); <em>see also Neeley, </em>215 Va. at 570-72, 211 S.E.2d at 105-06 (refusing to extend <em>Dalton </em>to hold opinions in medical records admissible under business records exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Appellant concedes the non-opinion portions of the emergency room records would have been admissible if the Commonwealth had laid a proper foundation. He agrees that Clarissa Bell was the proper custodian through whom the emergency room records could be introduced and argues that the records were improperly admitted solely because the Commonwealth failed to prove \u201cthe authors of the documents\u201d were unavailable. We hold the evidence in the record established the authors\u2019 \u201ccommercial unavailability\u201d as discussed in Part II.B.1. and, thus, supported the trial court\u2019s admission of the records into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The portions of the records to which appellant objects are the places in which three different members of the emergency room staff \u2014 one doctor and two nurses \u2014 recorded three similar reports from appellant regarding how he sustained the injuries for which he sought treatment. Just as was the case with the train records in <em>French, </em>the \u201c[medical records] of a properly operated [hospital] must be accurately and properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>kept by the [treating doctors and nurses], or else the lives ... of its [patients] ... are ... imperiled.\u201d <em>French, </em>121 Va. at 386-87, 93 S.E. at 586; <em>see also </em>12 VAC 5-410-370 (requiring that every hospital licensed in state must establish and maintain medical record for every person treated and that content of record and who may make entries shall comply with written policies and procedures of hospital). Further, appellant\u2019s trial occurred almost eight months after he received the emergency room treatment at issue, reducing the likelihood that any of the emergency room staffers who recorded appellant\u2019s statements would have an independent recollection of those statements. Under these circumstances, the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s implicit conclusion that \u201c \u2018the practical inconvenience of producing on the stand the numerous persons thus concerned [with creating the medical records] would in [this] particular case outweigh the probable utility of doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>French, </em>121 Va. at 386, 93 S.E. at 585 (quoting <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 1530).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The trial court\u2019s statement that proof of unavailability was not a requirement of the business records exception \u201c[i]f you\u2019ve got a custodian and [the records are] kept in the ordinary course of business\u201d does not compel a different result. Established precedent provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">[a]bsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.... We will not fix upon isolated statements of the trial judge taken out of the full context in which they were made, and use them as a predicate for holding the law has been misapplied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\"><em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977). Further, a \u201ctrial court\u2019s remark is not, in and of itself, \u2018the full context\u2019 simply because it represents the only point at which the court [expressly] addressed the issue [in dispute].\u201d <em>Bassett v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 580, 583-84, 414 S.E.2d 419, 421 (1992) (applying <em>Yarborough).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>In light of these principles, coupled with the fact that the challenged entries were made by three different emergency room employees almost eight months prior to trial, we interpret the trial court\u2019s statement as its recognition of the fact that the proponent of the records need not prove actual unavailability because commercial unavailability is sufficient in a case such as this one, in which the evidence supports a finding that \u201c \u2018the practical inconvenience of producing\u2019 \u201d the doctor and two nurses \u201c \u2018outweigh[ed] the probable utility of doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>French, </em>121 Va. at 386, 93 S.E. at 585 (quoting <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 1530).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Finally, we note that appellant sought only to preclude the admission of the records into evidence. Although he could have attempted to call the entrants of the records as witnesses himself, he did not claim unfair surprise when the Commonwealth provided him with the records on the day before trial. When the trial court ruled that the records were admissible, he did not request a continuance in order to attempt to secure the presence of one or more of the entrants for trial. <em>See </em>John Douglass, <em>Confronting the Reluctant Accomplice, </em>101 Colum.

Professor Friend has opined that abolition of the unavailability requirement would do little harm to Virginia law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">In theory, ... there is a clear distinction between ... the true \"shopbook rule[,\u201d which] appl[ies] to the records of parties only and requir[es] no showing of \"necessity\u201d or \"unavailability[,\u201d and] the more modem \"business records rule[,\u201d which] appl[ies] to any regularly kept business record and requires at least a showing of \"commercial\u201d unavailability, i.e., inconvenience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-12\">The Virginia courts have sometimes overlooked this distinction, with some attendant confusion in the cases. It is probable that the now-blurred distinction could be formally abolished, and the unavailability requirement abandoned, without greatly altering or affecting Virginia law, particularly in view of the weakening of the unavailability requirement by defining it to include inconvenience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Charles E.
