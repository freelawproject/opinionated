The claim alleged that Leon Kiser suffered an injury by accident and that complications from the accident resulted in his death. Claimants contend that the commission erred (1) by allowing a hearing on the claim to be \u201creopened\u201d to accept testimony from a witness discovered post-hearing, without following the requirements for admission of after-discovered evidence as set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>forth in <em>Williams v. People\u2019s Life Ins. Co., </em>19 Va.App. 530, 452 S.E.2d 881 (1995), and (2) in finding that the testimony of the new witness was not reasonably available before the initial hearing. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Leon Kiser had worked for Pulaski Furniture Company for eight years when, on March 26, 1999, he allegedly fell backward over a flat, or pallet, located by his workstation and fractured his hip. While convalescing from the hip injury, Kiser developed pneumonia, resulting in his death. Kiser\u2019s estate and widow sought death benefits, alleging that Kiser\u2019s death was a compensable consequence of the hip injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A hearing on the claim was held on June 22, 2000. At the close of the hearing, the deputy commissioner held open the record for thirty to sixty days for additional medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">On July 7, 2000, employer filed a motion to reconvene the hearing in order to introduce the testimony of Chester Hundley, an alleged eyewitness to the accident. Hundley had informed employer six days after the June hearing that he had witnessed Kiser\u2019s fall, but failed to say anything because he did not know that a claim had been filed. Employer asserted that it had attempted to interview all potential witnesses, but because of the large number of workers employed at the facility, it had neither prior knowledge nor reason to believe that Hundley had witnessed Kiser\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Over claimants\u2019 objection, the deputy commissioner reconvened the hearing on October 24, 2000, for the limited purpose of taking Hundley\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hundley testified that he was walking through the plant when he saw Kiser standing near his workstation. He was approximately eight feet away when he saw Kiser fall. He testified that he saw nothing for Kiser to trip on, but that he just leaned left and fell down.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The deputy commissioner, finding Hundley\u2019s testimony \u201cquite compelling,\u201d held, in an October 25, 2000 opinion, that claimants failed to prove that Kiser sustained an injury by accident arising out of his employment, and denied benefits. Claimants requested review by the full commission, arguing that the after-discovered evidence rule should have been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Upon review, by opinion on March 18, 2002, the commission found that the after-discovered evidence rule did not apply. It reasoned that, because the record had remained open, even if only for medical evidence, the deputy commissioner had discretion to consider additional evidence that was not reasonably available before the hearing, provided that the parties had an opportunity to rebut and cross-examine the evidence. It vacated the decision and remanded the matter back to the deputy commissioner to determine whether Hundley\u2019s testimony was not reasonably available before the first hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On remand, by opinion dated March 21, 2002, the deputy commissioner found that the evidence established that Hundley\u2019s testimony was not reasonably available to employer before the first hearing. The evidence showed that Hundley\u2019s witnessing of the accident was random and that because Hundley was unaware of claimants\u2019 pursuit of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, he did not know his testimony was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Claimants requested review of the opinion, again urging the commission to apply the after-discovered evidence rule. Once again, the commission rejected application of that rule, finding that the employer met the \u201cnot reasonably available\u201d standard as set forth in its prior opinion. The commission noted that in this case, claimants were allowed three months to conduct additional discovery in response to Hundley\u2019s testimony, and were afforded ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In accordance with well established principles, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>prevailing below. <em>States Roofing Corp. v. Bush Constr. Corp., </em>15 Va.App. 613, 616, 426 S.E.2d 124, 126 (1993). \u201cFactual findings by the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>So. Iron Works, Inc. v. Wallace, </em>16 Va.App. 131, 134, 428 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1993). The commission\u2019s findings, if supported by credible evidence or reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence, will not be disturbed upon review, even though the record may contain evidence to support a contrary finding. <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int'l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Claimants\u2019 continued assertion that the after-discovered evidence rule, as required by Rule 3.3 of the Rules of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, and <em>Williams, </em>19 Va.App. 530, 452 S.E.2d 881, applies to this case is incorrect. The application of that rule is appropriate when a party seeks to introduce new evidence at the \u201ctime of review.\u201d This case was still pending decision by the deputy commissioner when he decided to reconvene the evidentiary hearing to take Hundley\u2019s testimony and, therefore, was not under \u201creview,\u201d as contemplated in Rule 3.3 and the <em>Williams </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The commission applied the \u201cnot reasonably available\u201d standard in determining that the deputy commissioner had not abused his discretion by taking -witness testimony when the record had been left open for medical evidence. The commission has authority to decide how its hearings shall be conducted. The \u201c[c]ommission is afforded considerable latitude in adapting the conduct of hearings to the circumstances of the ease.\u201d <em>Kim v. Sportswear, </em>10 Va.App. 460, 470, 393 S.E.2d 418, 424 (1990). \u201cExcept for rules which the Commission promulgates, it is not bound by statutory or common law rules of pleading or evidence nor by technical rules of practice.\u201d Rule 2.2, Hearing Procedures, Rules of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. <em>See also </em>Rule 1.12 (commission has authority to enforce its rules); and <em>Arellano v. Pam E. K\u2019s Donuts Shop, </em>26 Va.App. 478, 495 S.E.2d 519 (1998) (commission has the power to interpret its own rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.2-201(A) (General duties and powers of the Commission) states, \u201cIt shall be the duty of the Commission to administer this title and adjudicate issues and controversies relating thereto. The Commission shall make rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions of this title.\u201d Thus, the commission is within its own authority to devise a test for determining whether to reconvene an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u2018\"When a challenge is made to the commission\u2019s construction of its rules, the appellate court\u2019s review is limited to a determination of whether the commission\u2019s interpretation was reasonable. The commission\u2019s interpretation will be accorded great deference and will not be set aside unless arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 129 n. 2, 510 S.E.2d 255, 260 n. 2 (1999) (citations omitted); <em>Arellano, </em>26 Va.App. at 483, 495 S.E.2d at 521 (citing <em>Classic Floors, Inc. v. Guy, </em>9 Va.App. 90, 93, 383 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1989)). This Court finds that the commission\u2019s interpretation of its standard for admission of evidence is reasonable and that credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that employer satisfied the \u201cnot reasonably available\u201d standard as set forth in its March 18, 2002 opinion. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\">.
