On May 6, 2003, a divided panel of this Court affirmed Norman\u2019s conviction, holding that the evidence was sufficient to establish Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender because it demonstrated his driving privilege had only been conditionally, rather than fully, restored prior to the offense. <em>Norman v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 496, 579 S.E.2d 699 (2003). On June 17, 2003, we granted Norman\u2019s petition for a rehearing en banc, stayed the mandate of the panel decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing en banc, we reverse the conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">On August 14, 2001, Deputy Sheriff H.L. Gatewood, of the Pittsylvania County Sheriffs Office, spotted Norman\u2019s car travelling east on Route 57. Having received a notice from dispatch to be on the lookout for that car, Gatewood stopped the car. When he approached the car, Gatewood asked Norman for identification, but Norman was unable to produce his driver\u2019s license. Norman told Gatewood he had \u201ca license at home and it was a piece of paper issued by the Court.\u201d Gatewood observed that Norman, who was the sole occupant of the car, had a gun in the car. He further observed that Norman was \u201cseverely intoxicated.\u201d Gatewood arrested Norman for drunk driving and brandishing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Deputy Gatewood checked Norman\u2019s social security number through his dispatcher and was told that Norman\u2019s driver\u2019s license was either \u201csuspended or revoked.\u201d He then proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ed to Norman\u2019s home to obtain Norman\u2019s license. Norman\u2019s girlfriend gave Gatewood a \u201cgreen sheet of paper\u201d stating that Norman\u2019s privilege to drive was restricted pursuant to a May 4, 2001 court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">When he arrived at the police station, Deputy Gatewood ran Norman\u2019s criminal history and learned that he was a convicted felon. He also ran Norman\u2019s driver\u2019s license and found that he was indeed driving on a restricted license. Norman was then additionally charged with driving as an habitual offender, second or subsequent offense, and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">At trial, the Commonwealth and Norman introduced several documents pertaining to the habitual offender charge, which can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">1. An October 13, 1989 order from the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County, entering judgment on Norman\u2019s guilty plea of operating a motor vehicle after having been declared an habitual offender. The order directed that Norman be sentenced on the conviction to two years in prison, but suspended one year of the sentence on the conditions of good behavior and supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">2. A December 20, 1999 order from the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County on Norman\u2019s petition \u201cfor restoration of his privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Virginia,\u201d which had been suspended since April 12, 1984. In pertinent part, the order directed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">Accordingly, the prayer of the petition should be granted, subject to the conditions set forth below ..., it is ORDERED that pursuant to \u00a7 46.2-360 of the Virginia Code Annotated the privileges to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth of Virginia should be restored and they are hereby restored to George Halcott Norman, III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">It is further ORDERED that this is not a license or privilege to drive in itself; that the petitioner shall present himself and this Order to the Department of Motor Vehicles for such administrative proceedings and payment of fees and costs as may be required, and further, that the petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>er is referred to Dan River ASAP for monitoring and supervision for twelve (12) months from the date of this Order; that the petitioner shall not possess or use alcohol, alcoholic beverages or drugs (other than bonafide prescription drugs); that should the petitioner incur any alcohol or drug related offense during the period of supervision as set forth herein, the Court may in its discretion issue process to the petitioner to show cause why his privilege to drive should not be suspended permanently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">The object of this proceeding having been accomplished, it is ORDERED that the same be, and it is hereby, removed from the docket and place[d] among the ended of cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">3. An order dated May 4, 2001, from the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County finding that Norman \u201cviolated the terms of the Court\u2019s Order of December 20, 1999,\u201d and granting Norman a restricted license to drive to work and to medical providers on the condition that he be monitored by Dan River ASAP for twelve months. The order directed that \u201cshould [Norman] have any violations of law during the period of supervision,\u201d his license would be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">4. An order dated May 7, 2001, signed by Norman and issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, stating that Norman, having \u201cbeen adjudicated/determined to be an habitual offender,\u201d sought \u201ca restricted license after having been declared an habitual offender or having had [his] license revoked pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 46.2-391(B) three years or more prior to this date,\u201d and giving Norman a one-year restricted license, pursuant to the May 4, 2001 court order, authorizing him to drive to and from work, to and from the Dan River ASAP office, and when medically necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Norman argued at trial that, despite the May 4, 2001 order restricting his privilege to drive, the December 20, 1999 order had fully restored his privilege to drive and, thus, he could no longer be considered an habitual offender for the purpose of the charge at issue. The Commonwealth responded that the December 20, 1999 order did not fully restore Norman\u2019s privilege to drive, but only restored it on a conditional basis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The Commonwealth further contended that the conditional restoration was revoked by the circuit court when Norman violated the terms of the December 20, 1999 order and was issued a restricted license on May 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth, finding that, by signing the Department of Motor Vehicles order of May 7, 2001, Norman acknowledged that his status as an habitual offender remained in effect, despite the purported restoration of his driving privilege in the December 20, 1999 order. The court then found him guilty of the habitual offender charge and sentenced him to serve two years in prison on that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether the trial court was correct in determining that the December 20, 1999 order purportedly restoring Norman\u2019s privilege to drive did not terminate Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender. If so, the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was sufficient as a matter of law to support Norman\u2019s conviction for driving as an habitual offender, second or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. If, however, that order terminated Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender, the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to show that Norman was an habitual offender at the time of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Norman contends, as he did below, that the circuit court fully restored his driving privilege in its December 20, 1999 order. Therefore, he concludes, he was no longer an habitual offender at the time of the offense at issue and the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to convict him for operating a motor vehicle after having been declared an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The Commonwealth contends that, because the December 20, 1999 order provided for the conditional, rather than full, restoration of Norman\u2019s driving privilege, that order did not terminate Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender. The Commonwealth argues that, as the trial court found, Norman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>signature on the May 7, 2001 order proves that Norman knew his status as an habitual offender remained in effect after entry of the December 20, 1999 order. Hence, the Commonwealth concludes, the evidence established that Norman was an habitual offender at the time of the charged offense and was thus sufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Bright v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 248, 250, 356 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1987). We will not disturb the conviction unless it is plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Sutphin v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 241, 243, 337 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person determined or adjudicated an habitual offender to drive any motor vehicle ... on the highways of the Commonwealth while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect.\u201d Therefore, to sustain Norman\u2019s \u201cconviction for driving a motor vehicle in violation of that statute,\u201d the Commonwealth had to prove that, at the time of the alleged offense, Norman was determined or adjudicated an habitual offender and his privilege to drive was revoked. <em>Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 430, 434, 578 S.E.2d 758, 760 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">It is well settled that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">once a person is declared an habitual offender by order of a trial court, he retains that status and loses his driving privilege for so long as the order is effective. Thus, ... the habitual offender status of the person so declared continues until that person successfully petitions the court to have that status removed and his privilege to drive restored under one of the code sections permitting such petitions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-9\"><em>Varga v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 547, 551, 536 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1) allows a court to remove an individual\u2019s status as an habitual offender and to restore his or her privilege to drive. That statute permits any person declared an habitual offender to petition the court for restoration of his or her driving privilege. It further provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">[o]n such petition, and for good cause shown, <em>the court may, in its discretion, restore to the person the privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth on whatever conditions the court may prescribe, </em>... if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that: (i) at the time of the previous convictions, the petitioner was addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or other drugs; (ii) at the time of the hearing on the petition, he is no longer addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or such other drug; and (iii) the person does not constitute a threat to the safety and welfare of himself or others with regard to the driving of a motor <em>vehicle____The court may, in lieu of restoring the person\u2019s privilege to drive, authorize the issuance of a restricted license </em>for a period not to exceed five years.... Any violations of the restrictions shall be reported to the court, and the court may then modify the restrictions or revoke the license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2x\">Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Thus, in responding to an habitual offender\u2019s petition for restoration of his or her privilege to drive, the court may take one of three actions under Code \u00a7 46.2-360(l):(l) deny the petition; (2) restore the person\u2019s privilege to drive, with or without conditions enforceable by the court; or (3) authorize the issuance of a restricted license. The statute draws no distinction between a \u201cfull restoration\u201d and a \u201cconditional restoration.\u201d Hence, an individual\u2019s privilege to drive is either restored or not restored under Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Here, as reflected in the circuit court\u2019s December 20, 1999 order, Norman petitioned the court \u201cfor restoration of his privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Virginia.\u201d Finding Norman\u2019s petition to restore his privilege to drive \u201cshould be granted, subject to the conditions set forth\u201d in the order, the circuit court ordered that, \u201cpursuant to [Code] \u00a7 46.2-360[,] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>... the privileges to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth of Virginia should be restored and they are hereby restored to\u201d Norman. The circuit court further ordered that Norman (1) report to the Department of Motor Vehicles before driving \u201cfor such administrative proceedings and payments] ... as may be required,\u201d (2) be monitored and supervised by \u201cDan River ASAP\u201d for one year, and (3) \u201cnot possess or use alcohol ... or drugs.\u201d The court also stated in its order that, should Norman \u201cincur any alcohol or drug related offense during the period of supervision as set forth herein, the Court may in its discretion issue process to the petitioner to show cause why his privilege to drive should not be suspended permanently.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Citing <em>Travis v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 410, 415, 457 S.E.2d 420, 422 (1995), Norman correctly acknowledges in his appellate brief that one who has been granted only a restricted license retains his habitual offender status.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is undisputed in this case, however, that the circuit court did not grant Norman a restricted license in its December 20, 1999 order, but rather a \u201crestoration\u201d of his privilege to drive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that, in entering the December 20, 1999 order, the circuit court restored Norman\u2019s privilege to drive. Based on that order, the Department of Motor Vehicles was authorized to issue Norman a full, unrestricted operator\u2019s license. The fact that the court prescribed certain conditions in restoring Norman\u2019s privilege to drive and, thus, retained authority to enforce those conditions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> does not alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the conclusion that Norman\u2019s privilege to drive was restored. Indeed, given that the court cannot logically suspend what does not exist, the circuit court\u2019s admonition that it might suspend Norman\u2019s \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d permanently if he failed to comply with the court\u2019s conditions only buttresses the conclusion that the court intended to restore Norman\u2019s driving privilege on December 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We further conclude that the trial court\u2019s reliance in its resolution of this case on Norman\u2019s signature on the Department of Motor Vehicles order of May 7, 2001, as proof that Norman acknowledged that his status as an habitual offender remained in effect, is misplaced. Norman\u2019s mistaken belief that he was an habitual offender on May 7, 2001, is not dispositive of the issue of whether the circuit court\u2019s December 20, 1999 order terminated his status as an habitual offender, the resolution of which is a matter of law. <em>Cf. Rose, </em>265 Va. at 435-36, 578 S.E.2d at 761 (holding that, in light of the \u201cincomplete\u201d order that failed to direct defendant not to drive on the Commonwealth\u2019s highways, as required by statute, proof of defendant\u2019s awareness that he was an habitual offender and of his mistaken belief that his privilege to drive had been revoked was not sufficient to prove that the revocation of defendant\u2019s privilege to drive remained in effect at the time of the alleged offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">We hold, therefore, that the circuit court\u2019s order of December 20, 1999 terminated Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender on that date. <em>See Varga, </em>260 Va. at 552, 536 S.E.2d at 714 (holding that one\u2019s habitual offender status \u201cremains in force until that person actually has his privilege to drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>restored\u201d). We also hold that, because the record contains no evidence that a court declared Norman an habitual offender subsequent to that date,, the Commonwealth failed to show that Norman was an habitual offender when he drove on August 14, 2001, and the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to sustain his conviction for driving as an habitual offender, second or subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Accordingly, we reverse Norman\u2019s conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\">. Norman was also convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, second offense within five years, possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, and brandishing a firearm. Norman pled guilty to these charges and does not raise any issues as to these convictions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\">. Since the issue is not before us, we need not consider here the authority of the trial court to \u201cpermanently\u201d suspend the privilege to drive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\">. Indeed, on a petition for restoration of driving privileges under Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1), a trial judge wishing to maintain the petitioner\u2019s habitual offender status, without denying the petition outright, may authorize the issuance of a restricted license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\">. The Commonwealth concedes as much in its appellate brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\">. Plainly, a court has the power to impose an appropriate remedy for a violation of a condition placed by the court on a restored privilege to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>drive under Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1). <em>See, e.g., Branch v. Branch, </em>144 Va. 244, 251, 132 S.E. 303, 305 (1926) (\"Courts are invested with the power and charged with the duty of enforcing their [orders].\u201d); <em>Ange v.

Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 547, 550, 536 S.E.2d 711, 713 (2000) (quoting Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1) permits a court to remove an individual\u2019s status as an habitual offender by permitting the individual so declared, under certain circumstances, to petition the court for restoration of his or her driving privilege. Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1) states as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-11\">Any person who has been found to be an habitual offender ... <em>may petition the court </em>in which he was found to be an habitual offender, or the circuit court in the political subdivision in which he then resides <em>to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-12\">1. <em>Restore his privilege to drive a motor vehicle </em>in the Commonwealth, provided that five years have elapsed from the date of the final order of a court entered under this article, or if no such order was entered then the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the determination by the Commissioner. <em>On such petition, and for good cause shown, the court may, in its discretion, restore to the person the privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth on whatever conditions the court may prescribe </em>subject to other provisions of law relating to the issuance of driver\u2019s licenses, if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that: (i) at the time of the previous convictions, the petitioner was addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or other drugs; (ii) at the time of the hearing on the petition, he is no longer addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or such other drug; and (iii) the person does not constitute a threat to the safety and welfare of himself or others with regard to the driving of a motor vehicle.... <em>The court may, in lieu of restoring the person\u2019s privilege to drive, authorize the issuance of a restricted license for a period not to exceed five years in accordance with the provisions of subsection E of \u00a7 18.2-271.1. </em>The local Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program shall during the term of the restricted license monitor the person\u2019s compliance with the terms of the restrictions imposed by the court. Any violation of the restrictions shall be reported to the court, and the court may then modify the restrictions or revoke the license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">(Emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The majority recognizes that a \u201cconditional restoration\u201d is available pursuant to the terms of the statute. Nevertheless, the majority declares that this distinction is one without a difference. In so holding, the majority ignores the term \u201cconditions,\u201d as used in the statute, by finding that any \u201crestoration\u201d of an individual\u2019s privilege to drive necessarily operates to remove the individual\u2019s status as an habitual offender and fully \u201crestores\u201d their privilege to drive, despite any statutorily permitted conditions imposed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">I would not so lightly cast aside the legislature\u2019s explicit use of the term \u201cconditions.\u201d <em>See Shelor Motor Co. v. Miller, </em>261 Va. 473, 479, 544 S.E.2d 345, 348 (2001) (\u201cWhen the legislature has used words of a plain and definite meaning, courts cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>accord those words a meaning that amounts to holding that the legislature did not mean what it actually expressed.\u201d); <em>see also Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Partnership, </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998) (noting the \u201csettled principle of statutory construction that every part of a statute is presumed to have some effect and no part will be considered meaningless unless absolutely necessary\u201d). That term, as defined in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>presupposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">A future and uncertain event on which the existence or extent of an obligation or liability depends; an uncertain act or event that triggers or negates a duty to render a promised performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>288 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Thus, although the trial court, in December of 1999, may have \u201crestored\u201d Norman\u2019s privilege to drive, it did so only conditionally, as the majority recognizes is permitted pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1). Specifically, the trial court\u2019s order required Norman to \u201cpresent himself and [the] Order to the Department of Motor Vehicles for such administrative proceedings and payment of fees and costs as may be required,\u201d to present himself \u201cto Dan River ASAP for monitoring and supervision for twelve (12) months from the date of [the] Order,\u201d and to refrain from possessing or using \u201calcohol, alcoholic beverages or drugs.\u201d The order further provided that if Norman were to \u201cincur any alcohol or drug related offense during the period of supervision as set forth herein, the Court may in its discretion issue process to [Norman] to show cause why his privilege to drive should not be suspended permanently.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By restoring Norman\u2019s privilege to drive, contingent upon his performance of these express conditions (whether positive or negative), the trial court did not fully restore Norman\u2019s driving privilege as the majority declares. Instead, the trial court expressly retained the authority to revoke the privilege if Norman failed to comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>conditions set forth in the order granting the conditional restoration. Such a retention of authority is clearly permitted by the statute and simply cannot be construed as a removal of Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender, much less a mandate declaring the order originally placing Norman in that status completely null and void. <em>See Varga, </em>260 Va. at 551, 536 S.E.2d at 714 (\u201cReading the habitual offender statutes <em>in pari materia, </em>it is clear that once a person is declared an habitual offender by order of a trial court, he retains that status and loses his driving privilege for so long as the order is effective. Thus, unless the trial court specifically limits the duration of the effect of the order ... the habitual offender status of the person so declared continues until that person successfully petitions the court to have that status removed and his privilege to drive restored under one of the code sections permitting such petitions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Further, the majority\u2019s implicit contention that the only way a trial court may retain an individual\u2019s status as an habitual offender is to issue a restricted license, belies the plain language of the statute. As the majority states, under Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1), the trial court may restore an individual\u2019s privilege to drive, either with or without conditions, or it may issue the individual a restricted license. A restricted license, issued \u201cin accordance with the provisions of subsection E of \u00a7 18.2-271.1,\u201d permits an individual to drive only for certain specified purposes. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-360(1) and 18.2-271.1. However, a restored license with conditions, restores an individual\u2019s privilege to drive for any lawful purpose, but \u2014 by its very terms \u2014 makes the full restoration of that individual\u2019s driving privilege contingent upon the court ordered conditions. As stated above, the record demonstrates that this is what has occurred in the case at bar. I believe that such a scenario is clearly permitted by the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Moreover, Norman was aware that he retained habitual offender status when the circuit court found that he violated the provisions of the December 20, 1999 order and, by its order of May 4, 2001, revoked his driving privilege, granting him instead restricted driving privilege. Indeed, when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>signed the resulting Restricted Driver\u2019s License Order, on May 7, 2001, Norman acknowledged that he was granted the restricted license \u201cafter having been adjudicated/determined to be an habitual offender.\u201d Yet, Norman never appealed and/or took issue with the clear import of these orders until his trial on the charge at issue, which took place in March of 2002 \u2014 nearly nine months later. <em>See Morgan v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 645, 507 S.E.2d 665 (1998) (holding, in the context of an habitual offender adjudication, that where a defendant has knowledge of an underlying order, never appeals the order, and subsequently violates the order, he cannot attack the underlying order in a subsequent proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In light of the above, I would hold that the trial court properly found the evidence sufficient to establish Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender at the time of the offense, and I would, thus, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\">. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that because the issue is not before us, we need not here consider the trial court\u2019s authority to \u201cpermanently\u201d suspend Norman\u2019s privilege to drive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
