Lusby, appellee, citing four grounds for reversal. Appellants contend the commission erred 1) in finding that Lusb/s cardiovascular disease is attributable to his employment; 2) in applying an erroneous legal standard of causation; 3) in awarding continued disability benefits based upon income that Lusby voluntarily limited; and 4) in finding that Lusby had cured his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>unjustified refusal to work. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On August 7, 1995, Thomas Lusby filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits alleging as grounds the existence of a compensable occupational disease, specifically coronary artery disease (\u201cCAD\u201d); The claim was initially heard before the deputy commissioner in a bifurcated proceeding to first determine whether the statutory presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) applied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner found that it did, and the commission affirmed. In a subsequent hearing on August 9, 2000, the deputy commissioner found that the statutory presumption had been rebutted under Bass <em>v. City of Richmond, </em>258 Va. 103, 515 S.E.2d 557 (1999), and dismissed the claim. On appeal, the full commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and found that the medical opinions admitted on behalf of MWAA were insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption. It remanded the case to the deputy commissioner for further proceedings, who awarded Lusby temporary partial disability benefits commencing March 16, 1998. The commission affirmed the award, modifying the beginning date for temporary partial benefits from March 16, 1998 to January 1, 1997. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Under the relevant standard of review, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed in the proceedings below, in this case, Lusby, together with all reasonable inferences that may be drawn. <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>I. <em>Employment History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The evidence established that Lusby began working for MWAA in July 1979, and remained employed there until May 5, 1995, when he was diagnosed with heart disease. While employed by MWAA, Lusby did not engage in actual firefighting or emergency rescue activities. His duties consisted primarily of \u201ctraining drills and exercises\u201d and, on occasion, outdoor inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">During the time Lusby worked for MWAA, he held part-time jobs as a tour bus driver for Gold Line Bus Company and as a security guard for Calvert Memorial Hospital and worked 80 hours per week. Acting upon medical advice, Lusby retired on disability from MWAA in May 1995. At the time Lusby retired, he held the position of assistant fire marshal. Shortly thereafter, Lusby was offered light-duty employment as a dispatcher with MWAA. The dispatcher position paid an annual salary of $21,000 or an average weekly wage of $403.85; the position was not expected to continue longer than one year. Lusby refused the offered position because of what he believed was insufficient pay relative to his prior earnings of $44,000. The deputy commissioner determined that the refusal was unjustified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although he refused the dispatcher position, Lusby continued his part-time work for Gold Line Bus Company and Calvert Memorial Hospital. He also applied for a position as an inspector with the Alexandria Fire Department, but was not hired. After rejecting the dispatcher position, Lusby submitted an application for Civil Service retirement on February 16, 1996, stating he could not \u201cfight fire at M.W.A.A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In 1996, Lusby earned $527.05 per week in his two part-time jobs, in 1997, he earned $620.50 per week, in 1998, he earned $704.31 per week, and in 1999, he earned $783.19 per week.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lusby acknowledged that he could have worked more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>hours at these two jobs and earned more income. However, his Civil Service disability pension restricts the earnings he can make. Lusby acknowledged that he did. not request additional work hours because he did not want to jeopardize his pension benefits which would have been reduced had he earned more than $39,000 per year (80% of his base pay).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">II. <em>Medical History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Lusby did not have heart disease before his employment with MWAA. However, his medical history was significant for hypertension that was controlled by medication, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and color blindness. Dr. Martin Brown, MWAA\u2019s medical director, performed an annual physical on Lusby in September 1989 and found that Lusby satisfied the requirements for the firefighter position.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In the course of his employment, Lusby was exposed to smoke and fumes on the job, especially at car and pit fires, where fuel, chemicals, rags, and tires were burned. Pit fires are controlled fires generating heavy black smoke; they are conducted to simulate aircraft fires. He was also exposed to aircraft fuel fumes and smoke in the shop area he frequented while making inspections, as well as in his office, which was poorly ventilated. His job duties did not include firefighting or performing emergency rescue services, but he was expected to complete all the tasks required of a firefighter and he had participated in those activities during controlled training drills and exercises. He generally described the stress level on the job as the same as in other jobs, but noted periods of heightened job-related stress, specifically when he dealt with toxic chemicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Lusby was intermittently placed on light duty after the results of a stress test performed in February 1994, and repeated in April 1995, showed \u201ca reason for concern.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>April 28, 1995, a cardiologist, Dr. Steven Roberts, evaluated Lusby. Dr. Roberts reported that the results of a screening exercise electrocardiogram were abnormal, as were the results of a subsequent exercise and resting study, which \u201csuggest[ed] scar[ring] in the right coronary artery and possibly the left circumflex artery as well.\u201d Dr. Roberts performed a cardiac catheterization and angioplasty on May 5, 1995 and diagnosed Lusby with severe coronary artery disease (\u201cCAD\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">On May 19, 1995, Dr. Mahesh Shah, who assumed responsibility as Lusby\u2019s treating cardiologist, noted that Lusby suffered from premature CAD, without significant symptomatology. Dr. Shah acknowledged Lusby\u2019s history of diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, and noted that Lusby\u2019s position as a firefighter \u201crequires very harsh and extreme exertion under extreme conditions.\u201d He recommended that Lusby retire or find alternative work, if MWAA failed to provide a position with modified duty requirements. Lusby retired shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On June 2, 1995, Dr. Holland found that Lusby was \u201c[n]ot medically fit for fire fighting as a career.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He reported the results to MWAA, stating that Lusby had a \u201chistory of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and a generally sedentary life-style, all which have contributed to his premature coronary artery disease.\u201d He advised that Lusby\u2019s disease was severe, chronic, progressive, and unlikely to improve. He concluded that, \u201calthough the [MWAA] and the career of fire fighting did not cause Mr. Luzby\u2019s [sic] coronary artery disease, the stress and physical demands of the job could result in myocardial infarction or other catastrophic cardiac events, given his compromised coronary artery circulation.\u201d He also noted that, consistent with MWAA policy, permanent light-duty status was not available and that Lus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>by\u2019s medical condition could not be accommodated by MWAA \u201cbecause every firefighter is expected to be physically capable of performing, safely and healthfully, all aspects of the job, even if they are not routinely called on to do so.\u201d Dr. Holland recommended that MWAA consider offering Lusby less demanding positions in the non-public-safety sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">On October 5, 1995, Dr. Shah had Lusby perform a thallium stress test, and he interpreted the results to be abnormal, \u201cshowing stress-induced ischemia.\u201d In a report to Lusby\u2019s family physician on December 26, 1995, Dr. Shah reported that Lusby could not perform the work duties of a firefighter. Dr. Shah stated that \u201cexposure to extreme exertion and temperature would cause undue stress on his cardiovascular system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">On July 15, 1999, MWAA\u2019s counsel sent a letter to Dr. Holland, asking whether Lusby\u2019s employment with MWAA caused his heart disease. In response to the letter, Dr. Holland\u2019s opinion addressed only Lusby\u2019s contention that he was exposed to several chemical agents, which he believed \u201cplayed a role in the development of [his] coronary artery disease.\u201d Dr. Holland reported that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">Coronary artery disease refers to narrowing of the coronary vessels due to atherosclerosis, the exact cause of which are [sic] unknown, but which is widely acknowledged to be due to the interaction of certain risk factors. The principal modifiable risk factors include cigarette smoking, hypertension, elevated serum cholesterol, physical inactivity, and obesity, while increasing age, male gender, and family history are the principal non-modifiable risk factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Dr. Holland stated that non-work-related factors caused Lusby\u2019s coronary artery disease, specifically noting a \u201ccombination of \u2018bad genes\u2019 and lifestyle choices.\u201d Dr. Holland confined his discussion of work-related causes to Lusby\u2019s claim that his CAD was caused by exposure to certain chemicals. In his report, he listed four chemicals as \u201cpotential occupational cardiotoxic agents\u201d and other miscellaneous agents and reviewed the literature describing their possible effect on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>cardiovascular health. He denied that four of the five chemical agents to which Lusby may have been exposed in his work as a firefighter would \u201ccause\u201d CAD, but noted that carbon disulfide could cause atherosclerosis, and nitro compounds could induce angina or cardiovascular death. He discounted their role in Lusby\u2019s case, however, opining that it was unlikely he had been exposed to such chemicals in the course of his employment. Dr. Holland concluded that \u201cthe medical literature does not support the contention that Mr. Lusby\u2019s periodic exposure to chemical fumes \u2018caused\u2019 his coronary artery disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Cardiologist Dr. Stuart Seides reviewed Lusby\u2019s medical records for MWAA and concluded that there was no association between Lusby\u2019s employment with MWAA and the development of his coronary artery disease. He stated, \u201cAny attempt to make this association is contrary to our current scientific understanding as to the genesis of this process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Cardiologist Dr. Warren Israel also reviewed Lusby\u2019s medical records for MWAA. In his report on August 19, 1999, Dr. Israel noted Lusby\u2019s history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, prior cigarette smoking, cholesterol problems, a sedentary lifestyle, ischemia and multiple coronary artery obstructions. Dr. Israel agreed that Lusby had coronary artery disease, but opined that the disease in Lusby\u2019s case was \u201centirely explained\u201d and caused by the multiple risk factors cited above. Dr. Israel further opined that, while Lusby may have been exposed to multiple chemicals during his employment, \u201cthese would not be causative agents in the development of his atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.\u201d However, in support of his conclusion that occupational stress is \u201cnot even [a] minor risk factor\u201d for coronary artery disease, Dr. Israel explained that scientific investigations into a causal link between work-related stress and coronary artery disease were inconsistent. He concluded that, if such a relationship existed, it \u201cwould have been proven by now.\u201d Thus, Dr. Israel opined, \u201cbased upon reasonable medical certainty ... Mr. Lusby\u2019s atherosclerotic coronary artery disease would not be causally related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>to work activities as a firefighter, even if he were an active firefighter over the years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Lusby was examined in August 1999 by Dr. Richard Schwartz.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dr. Schwartz reviewed Dr. Roberts\u2019 records as well as other medical documentation and concluded that Lusby\u2019s family history was not a contributory factor, but identified other risk factors operating in Lusby\u2019s case. He opined that Lusby\u2019s occupation-related stress could not be excluded as a cause of his coronary disease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">This is documented both by history and by the medical records. Following the discovery of coronary artery disease, the patient was relieved of his duties in active fire suppression. This is a decision with which I concur.... [C]oronary artery disease is a multifactorial process involving many risk factors. Those present in Mr. Lusby include his occupational stress as a firefighter, his adult onset diabetes, his hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. As noted in the past, it is impossible to identify proportional causation amongst these risk factors. Likewise, it is impossible to exclude any of these risk factors by history. Therefore, one must conclude that it is at least as likely that his occupational stress contributed to his coronary artery disease as his hyperlipidemia. Clearly, there is no genetic, congenital, or traumatic cause for his disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Dr. Israel disputed Dr. Schwartz\u2019s findings, stating that Dr. Schwartz had failed to consider that, although Lusby\u2019s job title was firefighter, he only fought fires in controlled training, drills, and exercises.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">I. <em>Statutory Presumption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">It is undisputed that Lusby is an employee covered under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and that he is enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tied to the presumption accorded police and firemen under Code \u00a7 65.2-402, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">Hypertension or heart disease causing the death of, or any health condition or impairment resulting in total or partial disability of [covered employees] shall be presumed to be occupational diseases, suffered in the line of duty, that are covered by this title unless such presumption is overcome by a preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">MWAA claims that it has satisfactorily rebutted the presumption and that the commission\u2019s award of benefits constitutes reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u201cThe commission having found in favor of claimant, it follows that all just inferences deducible from the evidence must be resolved by us in his favor. The Commission\u2019s finding may not be disturbed if it be sustained by credible evidence.\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Fletcher, </em>201 Va. 645, 647-48, 112 S.E.2d 838, 834 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In <em>Bass v. City of Richmond Police Dep't, </em>258 Va. 103, 515 S.E.2d 557 (1999), the Virginia Supreme Court held that an employer overcomes the statutory presumption by showing <em>\u201cboth </em>that 1) claimant\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment, and 2) there was a non-work related cause of the disease____[I]f the employer does not prove by a preponderance of the evidence both parts of this two-part test, the employer has failed to overcome the statutory presumption.\u201d <em>Bass, </em>258 Va. at 114, 515 S.E.2d at 562-63 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The commission found that MWAA did not rebut the statutory presumption because it failed to prove that Lusby\u2019s disease \u201cwas not caused by his employment.\u201d The commission based its conclusion on Dr. Schwartz\u2019s testimony, which attributed Lusby\u2019s CAD to occupational stress, and on Dr. Shah\u2019s diagnosis, which described Lusby\u2019s condition as \u201cstress induced ischemia.\u201d It further found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9d\">[t]hese positive opinions are not rebutted by the mere general denials of cardiologist Dr. Seides, or of occupational medicine specialist Dr. Holland.... [C]ardiologist Dr. Israel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>conceded that the association had not yet been resolved by the medical community.... At best, we can only find that the evidence offered by the parties is inconclusive and in equipoise, insufficient to satisfy the employer\u2019s burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The record supports the commission\u2019s finding that MWAA failed to rebut the presumption because it failed to prove that Lusby\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment. \u201cAs the factfinder, the commission is charged with the responsibility of resolving questions of credibility and of controverted facts.\u201d <em>Virginia Employment Commission v. Gantt, </em>7 Va. App. 631, 635, 376 S.E.2d 808, 811 (1989). Based on its review of the medical evidence, the commission credited and accepted as more persuasive the testimony of cardiologist Dr. Richard Schwartz, who directly attributed Lusby\u2019s heart disease to \u201coccupational stress\u201d and cardiologist Dr. Mahesh Shah, who specifically diagnosed Lusby\u2019s condition as \u201cstress induced ischemia.\u201d We are bound by the commission\u2019s findings if they are supported by credible evidence. <em>Lynch v. Lee, </em>19 Va.App. 230, 234, 450 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The record also supports the commission\u2019s finding that the medical evidence upon which MWAA relied constituted \u201cmere general denials\u201d that coronary heart disease is work-related, <em>see Medlin v. Co. of Henrico Police, </em>34 Va.App. 396, 542 S.E.2d 33 (2001), and did not rebut the \u201cpositive opinions\u201d regarding causation given by Drs. Schwartz and Shah. Although Dr. Seides denied any relationship between Lusby\u2019s position with MWAA and his CAD, he made clear that his opinion was based on general scientific principles. He stated, \u201cAny attempt to make this association [between Lusby\u2019s CAD and his employment at MWAA] is contrary to our current scientific understanding as to the genesis of this process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Dr. Israel similarly observed that occupational stress did not cause Lusby\u2019s coronary heart disease. He explained the basis of his opinion by referencing the inability of the medical community to establish a causative relationship between occupational stress and heart disease. On that ground, he concluded there was no relationship in Lusby\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Finally, Dr. Holland stated in conclusory fashion that Lusby\u2019s employment did not cause his coronary artery disease. He subsequently explained the basis of his conclusion, stating that the cause of CAD, which results from atherosclerosis, is unknown and that non-work-related risk factors present in Lusby\u2019s medical history caused his CAD. He more specifically explained his opinion by reviewing the literature that addressed the potential of certain chemicals to cause cardiovascular disease. Based on that review, he determined that none was a known agent of such disease. His opinion did not address Lusby\u2019s exposure to smoke in the course of his employment, however, or the role occupational stress plays in generating the disease. In short, Dr. Holland concluded that Lusby\u2019s CAD was not caused by his employment by restricting his review to the potential cardiotoxic effect of certain chemicals while ignoring the effect that smoke and the stress-related aspects of Lusby\u2019s job can have on cardiovascular health, which both Drs. Schwartz and Shah found causative.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The statements and opinions of Drs. Seides, Israel and Holland constitute general rebuttals of \u201cthe underlying premise [and legislatively enacted presumption] of the statute, which establishes a causal link between stress and heart disease.\u201d As such, they are \u201cnot probative evidence for purposes of overcoming the presumption.\u201d <em>Medlin, </em>34 Va. App. at 407, 542 S.E.2d at 39. \u201cWhere the General Assembly has concluded that there is a causal link between stress and heart disease, it is not for the commission or the courts to reconsider the issue, for to do so would defeat the intentions of the legislature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">MWAA nonetheless contends it proved Lusby\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment because the commission found that non-work-related risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, smoking history, and a generally sedentary life-style, caused his coronary artery disease.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MWAA, in essence, reasons that proof of one prong of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the <em>Bass </em>test, i.e. that non-work-related factors caused the CAD, at once establishes, or is necessarily encompassed within, the other, i.e. that Lusby\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">MWAA misapprehends the holding in <em>Bass </em>and the burden of proof it establishes. In <em>Bass, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court expressly held that both prongs of the test must be proved, notwithstanding their seemingly corollary nature. If the Supreme Court intended that proof of one prong necessarily proved the other, the Court would not have posited a two-prong test.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Finally, MWAA contends that our decision in <em>Henrico Co. Div. of Fire v. Woody, </em>39 Va.App. 322, 572 S.E.2d 526 (2002), mandates a different result. The holding in <em>Woody </em>is inapposite. In <em>Woody, </em>we held that the commission, without weighing the evidence of causation, concluded that the employer failed to rebut the statutory presumption. We found that the commission based its conclusion solely on evidence that the claimant had been exposed to potentially causative disease factors in the work environment. In the case at bar, the commission weighed the testimony given by all the physicians as well as other medical evidence, giving credence and weight to the opinions of Drs. Schwartz and Shah, and discounting the \u201cgeneral denials\u201d in the opinions of Drs. Israel, Seides and Holland. We find no error in that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In summary, we find that the commission\u2019s conclusion that MWAA failed to rebut the statutory presumption set forth in Code \u00a7 65.2-402 was supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">II. <em>Refusal of Selective Employment and Marketing of Residual Capacity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">MWAA next contends that the commission erred as a matter of law in finding that Lusby cured his refusal of selective employment. It cites as grounds Lusby\u2019s failure to contact MWAA subsequent to his refusal and his decision to limit his annual income to less than $39,000 per year in order to avoid losing his pension benefits. MWAA relies on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>latter ground as well to support its contention that Lusby failed to reasonably market his earning capacity. We find MWAA\u2019s arguments to be without merit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In deciding whether a claimant has cured a refusal of employment by obtaining other comparable employment, we examine the wage secured by the claimant in dissimilar work relative to the wage offered by the employer and refused by the claimant. <em>See Virginia Wayside Furniture, Inc. v. Burnette, </em>17 Va.App. 74, 79, 435 S.E.2d 156, 160 (1993). The record establishes that the dispatcher position MWAA offered to and refused by Lusby paid $21,000 a year, or $403.85 per week. The commission determined that Lusby cured his refusal of selective service in January 1997, when he earned $620.50 per week, $216.65 more than the refused weekly wage. We find that, when Lusby earned wages from dissimilar employment that equaled or exceeded the average weekly wage of $403.85 he would have earned had he accepted the employment offered by MWAA, he cured his unjustified refusal of selective service and was entitled to benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In asserting that the wages were not comparable, MWAA consistently and erroneously uses as its basis for comparison a salary of $39,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The flaw in MWAA\u2019s argument is fatal to its position on appeal. Neither the evidence, which establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>that the refused wage was $21,000 per year or $403.85 per week, nor the relevant law, which premises cure on a comparison of present and refused wages, support the conclusions urged by MWAA. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">MWAA also contends Lusby failed to establish that he reasonably marketed his residual earning capacity. <em>Wall Street Deli, Inc. v. O\u2019Brien, </em>32 Va.App. 217, 220, 527 S.E.2d 451, 453 (2000); <em>National Linen Service v. McGuinn, </em>8 Va. App. 267, 272, 380 S.E.2d 31, 34 (1989). MWAA contends that Lusby consciously limited his earnings from the two part-time positions he held and reasons that his failure to earn more constitutes a failure to reasonably market his residual earning capacity. The argument is not supported by either the evidence or the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u201cIn general, an employee who has reached maximum medical improvement and remains partially disabled must make a reasonable effort to market his remaining capacity to work in order to continue receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Burnette, </em>17 Va.App. at 78, 435 S.E.2d at 159 (citing <em>McGuinn, </em>8 Va.App. at 269, 380 S.E.2d at 33). \u201cThe determination of whether a partially disabled employee has adequately marketed his residual work capacity lies within the factfinding judgment of the commission, and its decision on that question, if supported by credible evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>32 Va.App. at 220-21, 527 S.E.2d at 453. Whether an employee has made a reasonable effort to market his remaining work capacity is determined by an objective standard of reasonableness and depends on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>particular circumstances of each situation. <em>McGuinn, </em>8 Va. App. at 270-72, 380 S.E.2d at 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">In <em>McGuinn, </em>this Court examined the criteria that may be applied in determining whether an individual has reasonably marketed residual earning capacity. Citing to a decision in our sister state of Maine, we said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">[I]n defining what would be considered a reasonable effort at obtaining employment ... the employee must present \u201csome evidence that he had engaged in a good faith effort to obtain work within the tolerance of his physical condition\u201d and has failed to find a job, either due to his injury or because no such work was available in the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH3\"><em>Id. </em>at 271, 380 S.E.2d at 34 (quoting <em>Dunkin Donuts of America, Inc. v. Watson, </em>366 A2d 1121 (Me.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Under the holding in McGuinn, the following factors may be considered to determine whether a claimant has reasonably marketed his residual capacity: (1) the nature and extent of employee\u2019s disability; (2) the employee\u2019s training, age, experience, and education; (3) the nature and extent of employee\u2019s job search; (4) the employee\u2019s intent in conducting his job search; (5) the availability of jobs in the area suitable for the employee, considering his disability; and (6) any other matter affecting employee\u2019s capacity to find suitable employment. Id. at 272, 380 S.E.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We subsequently established another factor that is appropriately considered in determining whether a claimant has reasonably marketed residual earning capacity. <em>See Burnette, </em>17 Va.App. at 79, 435 S.E.2d at 160. The <em>Burnette </em>Court held that, when a claimant is willing to accept a position that pays a wage \u201ccomparable\u201d to that which he would have earned had he accepted the selective employment offered, he has both cured the unjustified refusal of selective employment and marketed his residual capacity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In <em>Burnette, </em>the claimant was offered a job with a beginning wage of $3.85 per hour for a two-week training period, after which they would increase his wage to $5.00 to $ 5.50 per hour. He refused the position and later found a job that paid $5.45 per hour. In determining that the claimant cured his unjusti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>fled refusal of selective employment, we stated, \u201cthe wage that [claimant] now earns ... falls within the mid-range of the projected starting wage [of the refused job]____ Thus, by obtaining employment at a wage that is comparable to that which was offered him, he has cured his unjustified refusal of the selective employment that was offered him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 435 S.E.2d at 160. We further stated, \u201c[T]he commission did not err in finding that [claimant] had cured his prior unjustified refusal of the suitable employment by obtaining comparable employment and, thereby, had marketed or made a reasonable effort to market his residual capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 435 S.E.2d at 160. In short, in such cases the conduct establishing that a claimant has cured an unjustified refusal of employment and has reasonably marketed his residual capacity, are coincident.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The commission determined that Lusby reasonably marketed his residual work capacity on January 7, 1997, the date on which he cured his unjustifiable refusal of MWAA\u2019s proffered employment. We find the commission\u2019s decision is supported by credible evidence and is controlled by our decision in <em>Burnette. </em>The evidence establishes that Lusby\u2019s income from dissimilar employment in January 1997 exceeded by several hundred dollars the weekly wage he would have earned by accepting the position offered by MWAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Contrary to MWAA\u2019s contention, Lusby\u2019s failure to contact MWAA for other available positions or to inquire about positions with other employers,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and his decision to limit his earnings from dissimilar employment to preserve his retirement benefits, are of no significance. <em>See Greif Companies v. Sipe, </em>16 Va.App. 709, 715, 434 S.E.2d 314, 318 (1993) (\u2018What constitutes a reasonable marketing effort depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d). Evidence that other positions were available to him is notably lacking in the record. Moreover, as a matter of law, Lusby was required to earn wages comparable to those he would have enjoyed had he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>accepted MWAA\u2019s proffered employment to entitle him to compensation and nothing more. <em>See Burnette, 17 </em>Va.App. at 79, 435 S.E.2d at 160. Here, Lusby\u2019s earnings were significantly greater than those he would have earned in employment offered by MWAA in a position that was expected to be of limited duration. Under these facts, it cannot be said that Lusby\u2019s decision to limit his inquiries to MWAA regarding other positions, to limit his job search to one application with another fire department and to limit his earnings from dissimilar employment constituted a failure to reasonably market his residual earning capacity. Thus, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision that Lusby cured his refusal of light-duty work.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">We hold that the commission did not err in 1) finding that Lusby\u2019s cardiovascular disease is attributable to his employment, 2) in applying the law applicable to determining causation, 3) in awarding continued disability benefits based upon income that Lusby voluntarily limited, or 4) in finding that Lusby had cured his unjustified refusal to work and had reasonably marketed his residual capacity. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-402 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">Hypertension or heart disease causing the death of, or any health condition or impairment resulting in total or partial disability of [covered employees] shall be presumed to be occupational diseases, suffered in the line of duty, that are covered by this title unless such presumption is overcome by a preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. Lusby does not dispute that the refusal was unjustified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. Lusby worked part-time as a bus driver and full-time in security until 1998, when the time patterns were reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\">. Dr. Christopher S. Holland, the medical director of the facility where Lusby was treated, initially placed Lusby on light duty on February 4, 1994. He returned Lusby to full duty on February 18, 1994. However, after a stress test in April 1995 revealed \"perfusion deficit highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>suggestive for coronary artery disease,\u201d Dr. Holland placed Lubsy on light duty once again.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\">. Dr. Holland had previously reported, on May 2, 1995, that the results of Lusby's thallium perfusion scan were \"highly suggestive for coronaiy vascular disease.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\">. Dr. Schwartz was an associate of Dr. Steven A. Roberts, who had previously treated Lusby.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\">. Lusby does not dispute the commission\u2019s determination that non-work-related factors contributed to his coronary artery disease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-510 governs the refusal and subsequent cure of selective employment. The statute was amended in 1995 to allow for a \"partial\u201d cure. It is clear from the full commission's opinion that it proceeded under the former statute, which was in effect at the time of Lusby\u2019s injury, because it does not contemplate or consider partial cure as a basis for recovery in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">. We note that, based on the record provided on appeal, Lusby cured his refusal of selective service in 1996, when his wages first exceeded the wage offered by MWAA. In 1996, Lusby earned $527.05 per week in his two part-time jobs and by January 1997, he earned $620.50 per week. However, because Lusby failed to preserve for appeal the full commission\u2019s decision for the March 1996 \u2014 January 1997 period, we do not address it on appeal, affirming only the commission\u2019s determination that a cure occurred in January 1997. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">. That figure, approximately 80% of his pre-injury salary, reflects the amount Lusby could earn without losing his pension benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\">. The commission also erroneously used $39,000 as the base line figure against which it compared the wages he earned from his employment with Gold Line Bus Company and Calvert Memorial Hospital in its determination of whether Lusby cured his refusal of MWAA\u2019s employment offer and whether he reasonably marketed his residual working capacity. However, the error is immaterial to our decision. <em>See Driscoll v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 449, 452, 417 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1992) (\"[A]n appellate court may affirm the judgment of the trial court when it has reached the right result for the wrong reason.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">.
