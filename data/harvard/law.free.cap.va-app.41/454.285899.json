Imposing the sentence fixed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>jury, the trial court sentenced Brooks to 99 years in prison, 10 of which were suspended, and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Brooks appeals his convictions on the ground that the trial court erred because it denied his motion to excuse for cause a juror who was related to several of the prosecution witnesses and to the victims and denied his motion for a mistrial. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Brooks was indicted and ultimately convicted of committing various sexual offenses against several minors: L.M., A.G., De.M., R.M., and D.M.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The minors testified for the Commonwealth at the trial, as did their fathers.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">During pretrial <em>voir dire, </em>the judge asked the venire members: \u201cAre any of you related by blood or marriage to any of those persons against whom the alleged offenses were committed, or do you know them?\u201d All the jurors responded in the negative. However, after the first day of the trial, the clerk received a telephone call from one of the seated jurors, Nancy Cook, expressing some concerns. As a result, the judge conducted the following <em>voir dire </em>the next morning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">THE COURT: Ms. Cook, it has come to the Court\u2019s attention that you conversed with the Clerk about a matter that was of concern to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">MS. COOK: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">THE COURT: All right. Would you go ahead, for the record, so that the attorneys get an opportunity to hear what your concern is and the Court gets an opportunity to evaluate your concern and see if it is well-placed or if it is not of great consequence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">MS. COOK: Okay. My brother-in-law is the [victims\u2019] great uncle. And, I don\u2019t know them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">THE COURT: You want to run that by me gain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>MS. COOK: My brother-in-law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">THE COURT: Explain that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">MS. COOK: My sister\u2019s husband. It is my brother-in-law. He is the girls\u2019 great uncle and, I didn\u2019t know that yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u00a3 # # sjj</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">THE COURT: Don\u2019t think it would make a difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">MS. COOK: No. It is kind of like you wake up at nighttime all of a sudden and it kind of hits you, you know. When [the victims\u2019 uncle] came in, he looked familiar to me. I thought that I was introduced to him one time.... He just looked familiar to me, and then I put the girls in place. THE COURT: You don\u2019t actually know any of these people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">MS. COOK: I don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know them from Adam. I would [sic] know them if I passed them on the street. I wouldn\u2019t know them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">THE COURT: Mr. Ambrogi, any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">MR. AMBROGI: No question. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">THE COURT: Mr. Crane, any questions of this lady?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">MR. CRANE: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-15\">THE COURT: Ma'am, you believe you can continue to sit and hear this case and act fairly and impartially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-16\">MS. COOK: Yes, I do.-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-17\">THE COURT: You believe you can follow the instructions of law that the Court gives you and decide this case fairly and impartially, giving a fair trial to both sides?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-18\">MS. COOK: Yes, sir. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-19\">THE COURT: Ma'am, I appreciate your diligence by bringing this concern to our attention. It is important that a fair trial be had for all sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-20\">MS. COOK: Yes. That is what I wanted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-21\">THE COURT: Ask you to retire back with the jury. Thank you, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Defense counsel then asked the court to remove Cook from the jury. He argued, \u201c[t]he fact that she is related would make it difficult for her to be unbiased in evaluating the evidence\u201d and \u201cin the interest of fairness it is important not to have relatives of the prosecutrixes on the jury panel. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d The prosecutor opposed the motion, arguing that any relationship was remote. He also noted Cook\u2019s assertion that her decision would be unaffected by her brother-in-law\u2019s relationship to the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Defense counsel renewed his objection and moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion and stated that the relationship was not close enough to disqualify the juror. The court also found that \u201cMr. Brooks will receive a fair trial and will continue to do so with Mrs. Cook sitting as a jury member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Brooks\u2019s appeal comes before this Court on a denial of a motion for a mistrial. Upon familiar principles, we will not reverse the denial of a motion for a mistrial unless a manifest probability exists that the trial court\u2019s ruling was prejudicial. <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 12, 17, 486 S.E.2d 108, 110 (1997). \u201c[T]he burden of establishing that probability [rests] upon the party moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 394, 401, 494 S.E.2d 888, 891 (1998) (citations omitted). Moreover, it is well settled that the credibility of witnesses and the weight accorded witnesses\u2019 testimony are matters that are within the province of the fact finder. <em>Phan v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 506, 513, 521 S.E.2d 282, 286 (1999); <em>Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 407, 414, 424 S.E.2d 566, 571 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">When the issue arises from a mid-trial challenge to a juror\u2019s impartiality, we \u201cwill reverse the trial court\u2019s decision only for an abuse of discretion,\u201d applying the same standard of review appropriate to appellate consideration of the trial court\u2019s decision to seat a venireperson. <em>David v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 77, 80, 493 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1997) (noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that juror impartiality is a factual determination, disturbed on appeal only for \u201cmanifest error\u201d). Hence, we will not reverse \u201cthe denial of a motion for a mistrial ... unless there exists a manifest probability that [the ruling] was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The instant case involves a mid-trial challenge to a juror\u2019s impartiality. Brooks contends that Cook\u2019s relationship to the victims and to the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses absolutely bars her from acting as a juror in the case, on the ground that, due to those relationships, she could not be impartial. Brooks specifically invokes the rules governing consanguinity and affinity in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The Virginia Supreme Court held in <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 591, 311 S.E.2d 409 (1984), that \u201cthe longstanding, common-law rule disqualifying a venireman who is related, within the ninth degree of consanguinity or affinity, to a party to a suit\u201d also \u201capplies to a victim of a crime as well as to a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 311 S.E.2d at 410. The relationship at issue here involved Cook\u2019s brother-in-law, her sister\u2019s husband, who was the great uncle of the victims and, by implication, the uncle of the victims\u2019 fathers, who were expected to be called as witnesses in the case. Brooks contends that Cook was \u201cabsolutely disqualified\u201d as a juror because she was related within the \u201cninth degree of consanguinity\u201d to the alleged victims and their parents. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u201cConsanguinity\u201d is a \u201crelation by blood.\u201d <em>Doyle v. Commonwealth, </em>100 Va. 808, 810, 40 S.E. 925, 926 (1902). It is patent Cook was not related by blood to her sister\u2019s husband and, by extension, she was not related by blood to the victims or their fathers.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Cook was also not related to the victims or their fathers by affinity. Affinity is the relation of one spouse to the other spouse\u2019s kindred. <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Affinity properly means the tie which arises from marriage betwixt the husband and the blood relatives of the wife, and between the wife and the blood relatives of the husband.... <em>[T]here is no affinity between the blood relatives of the husband and the blood relatives of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>wife.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Norris v. Presley, </em>292 Ala. 155, 290 So.2d 643, 645 (1974) (citations omitted). Here, the relationship at issue did not involve Cook and her husband\u2019s blood relatives. Rather, it involved a relationship between her sister\u2019s husband and his blood relatives. We conclude that the relationship does not fall within the definition of affinity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Doyle, </em>100 Va. at 810-11, 40 S.E. at 926 (finding that a juror, who was the nephew of a man related by marriage to kindred of the victim, was not disqualified from sitting through \u201caffinity\u201d); <em>see also Anderson v. State, </em>30 Ala.App. 124, 2 So.2d 461, 462 (1941) (finding that a juror in a murder case, who was the brother-in-law of the victim\u2019s sister, was not disqualified because \u201c[n]o relationship by consanguinity or affinity is presented as would disqualify said juror\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Moreover, Brooks has the burden of establishing that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s decision not to grant his motion for a mistrial. <em>See Green, </em>26 Va.App. at 401, 494 S.E.2d at 891. \u201cTo determine if a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial was prejudicial, when a juror\u2019s conduct is at issue, we must look to the juror\u2019s possible bias. The existence of an individual juror\u2019s possible bias or partiality is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court.\u201d <em>Perez v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 648, 655, 580 S.E.2d 507, 509 (2003) (citing <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 480, 331 S.E.2d 422, 431 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Brooks contends that, even if Cook is not excluded from serving as a juror in this case in accordance with the principles of consanguinity and affinity, her familial relationship, in and of itself, gives rise to inherent bias on her part and would affect her decision-making. Brooks\u2019s argument is a simple recast of his contentions rooted in the principles of consanguinity and affinity, which we have determined do not apply as a bar to Cook\u2019s serving as a juror in this case. Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>reject this argument because no presumption of bias may be said to arise by virtue of the relationship itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Reviewing Brooks\u2019s contention factually, we find, furthermore, that nothing in the record supports the conclusion that Cook would be unable to fairly try the case. The Supreme Court of Virginia has set out the following standard for appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision whether to retain or exclude prospective jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">Upon appellate review, this Court gives deference to the trial court\u2019s decision whether to retain or exclude prospective jurors. This is because the trial judge has observed and heard each member of the venire and is in a superior position to evaluate whether the juror\u2019s responses during voir dire develop anything that would prevent or substantially impair the juror\u2019s performance of duty as a juror in accord with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. A trial court\u2019s decision on this issue will be affirmed absent a showing of manifest error. And, a juror\u2019s entire voir dire, not isolated portions, must be considered to determine a juror\u2019s impartiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\"><em>Vinson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 459, 467, 522 S.E.2d 170, 176 (1999) (citations omitted). We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s finding that Cook was an impartial juror was manifest error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Finally, we address whether the trial court erred in denying Brooks\u2019s motion to strike Cook for cause on the ground that her participation as a juror in the case eroded public confidence in the integrity and fairness of the judicial process. <em>See Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000); <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 658, 576 S.E.2d 222 (2003). Contrary to the argument of the Commonwealth that the issue is not properly before us because Brooks failed to raise it before the trial court and did not raise it on appeal, under the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Medici, </em>by implication, the question of public confidence is inherent in the jury selection process and is necessarily implicated when a juror\u2019s retention is purportedly improper. <em>Med </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>ici, </em>260 Va. at 227, 532 S.E.2d at 31. In <em>Medici, </em>the issue of public confidence was not listed as a question on appeal; nor did the defendant make an objection at trial on the issue of public confidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Virginia Supreme Court, nonetheless, addressed the question and reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction based on the trial court\u2019s failure to strike a juror who had a relationship with the office of defendant\u2019s counsel, finding that \u201cpermitting [the potential juror] to sit [on the jury] ... would weaken public confidence in the integrity of criminal trials.\u201d <em>Medici </em>260 Va. at 227, 532 S.E.2d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Relying on <em>Medici </em>and its progeny, this Court stated in <em>Patterson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">The Supreme Court cases on this issue do not indicate that prior appellants specifically raised \u201cpublic confidence\u201d at the trial level, but instead suggest the trial judge must specifically consider the effect that placing the venireman on the jury will have on the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial system....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"><em>Patterson, </em>39 Va.App. at 666, 576 S.E.2d at 226 (citations and quotations omitted). \u201cWe conclude ... that an analysis of \u2018public confidence\u2019 is <em>inherent </em>in any appellate review of a juror\u2019s impartiality____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669, 576 S.E.2d at 228 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore address the question, as it is inherent in Brooks\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s seating of the juror was improper, notwithstanding Brooks\u2019s failure to raise it at the trial court and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">We find that seating Ms. Cook as a juror, under the circumstances of this case, would not erode public confidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>in the integrity of the judicial process. As noted earlier, the relationship between the juror and witness was not one of either consanguinity or affinity, which would require her removal from the jury on the ground that \u201cthe law presumeth that one kinsman doth favor another more than a stranger.\u201d <em>Jaques v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 690, 694 (1853). Thus, as a matter of law, Ms. Cook\u2019s relationship by marriage to the victims and the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses is treated as remote and tenuous, a factor to be considered in resolving this issue. Moreover, she was questioned at length regarding the relationship. She stated that she \u201cthought she was introduced to [him] one time\u201d because he \u201clooked familiar.\u201d However, when the judge asked Ms. Cook, \u2018You don\u2019t actually know any of these people,\u201d she responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know them from Adam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We cannot say that the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the process would be undermined by the seating of an unbiased juror who was remotely related, by marriage, to the victims\u2019 great uncle and to two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, and whom the juror \u201c[did not] know from Adam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Because we find Cook was not related by consanguinity or affinity to the victims or to any witnesses in the case, we hold the trial court properly refused to strike Cook for cause. Additionally, we find Brooks failed to meet his burden of establishing that the trial court\u2019s denial of his mid-trial motion for a mistrial, stemming from Cook\u2019s presence on the jury, resulted in a manifest probability of prejudice. Finally, we find that public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process would not be undermined by Ms. Cook\u2019s service as a juror in the case at bar because the relationship at issue was too remote and tenuous to create the perception of bias. We, accordingly, hold that the trial court did not err in denying Brooks\u2019s motion for a mistrial and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-14\">. Because two of the minors have the same first and last name initials, we have identified one as De.M. and the other as D.M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. Cook\u2019s sister is arguably related to the victims and their fathers by affinity; affinity is the relationship between one spouse and the blood relatives of the other spouse. It does not follow, however, that Cook is, therefore, related to the victims and their fathers by affinity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\">. A review of both the record and the briefs to the Supreme Court indicates the arguments at trial and on appeal were general arguments about the error in seating the juror at issue. Public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process was not raised as a ground for reversal at the trial level or on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\">. We note that, in <em>Patterson, </em>the issue of public confidence was raised on appeal in appellant\u2019s brief to this Court. However, as noted above, it was not raised on appeal in <em>Medici, </em>and we find that, as a Supreme Court case, <em>Medici </em>controls our decision to address the question in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>CLEMENTS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"At3\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">While I agree with the holding of the majority opinion that the trial court did not err in denying Brooks\u2019s motions for the removal of Cook from the jury and for a mistrial, I write separately because I find it unnecessary and, indeed, inappropriate, under the circumstances of this case, to address <em>sua sponte </em>the issue of public confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We have consistently held that we will not address an issue that was not raised on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Shoup v. Shoup, </em>37 Va.App. 240, 253 n. 6, 556 S.E.2d 783, 790 n. 6 (2001) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>Frias v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 193, 196 n. 1, 538 S.E.2d 374, 375 n. 1 (2000). \u201cOn appeal, we [will] consider only the issues raised.\u201d <em>Mullins v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va. App. 728, 733, 576 S.E.2d 770, 772 (2003); <em>see also Richardson v. Moore, </em>217 Va. 422, 423 n. 1, 229 S.E.2d 864, 865 n. 1 (1976) (stating the Court would \u201cexpress no opinion\u201d on a particular question because that question \u201cwas not raised on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In this case, Brooks argues Cook was \u201cabsolutely disqualified\u201d because she was related \u201cwithin the ninth degree of consanguinity\u201d or affinity to the \u201calleged victims in this case and their parents.\u201d He also argues, as the Commonwealth notes, that Cook \u201cmay have been inherently biased by her familial relationships.\u201d Brooks, however, makes no claim on appeal that Cook\u2019s presence on the jury would erode public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process. He simply does not challenge the trial court\u2019s rulings on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Moreover, in my view, none of the decisions by the Supreme Court of Virginia addressing the issue of public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process requires us to consider the public confidence issue when, as here, it has not been raised on appeal. As noted in the instant majority opinion, the Supreme Court reversed the appellant\u2019s conviction in <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the basis of the issue of public confidence even though that issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201cwas not listed as a question on appeal.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Medici, </em>however, \u201clisted\u201d only the overall issue of \u201cwhether the trial court erred in refusing to strike for cause a potential juror,\u201d without identifying the specific issues addressed by the parties on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 532 S.E.2d at 30. Consequently, it is not possible to tell from the opinion in <em>Medici </em>whether the issue of public confidence was raised on appeal by the appellant in that case or whether the Supreme Court addressed the issue <em>sua sponte. </em>The same may be said of each of the other opinions in which the Supreme Court has focused on the issue of public confidence with regards to the jury-selection process, none of which indicate whether the appellant raised the issue on appeal. <em>See Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 553 S.E.2d 731 (2001); <em>Cantrell v. Crews, </em>259 Va. 47, 523 S.E.2d 502 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Likewise, while we addressed the issue of public confidence in <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 658, 576 S.E.2d 222 (2003), and <em>Perez v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 648, 580 S.E.2d 507 (2003), neither case is controlling here because, unlike Brooks, the appellants in both of those cases specifically raised the issue of public confidence on appeal. Accordingly, neither of those decisions requires our consideration of the issue of public confidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">I, therefore, believe that raising the issue of public confidence on our own accord is contrary to established principles of appellate review and would not do so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">. The opinion in <em>Medici </em>was released approximately two years before Brooks filed this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b510-7\">FITZPATRICK, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae0e\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. While I agree with the majority that the factual scenario presented in the instant case does not meet the traditional technical definitions of \u201cconsanguinity\u201d and \u201caffinity,\u201d it is a distinction without a difference. Juror Cook\u2019s brother-in-law was the uncle of two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses and the great-uncle of all five victims. This relationship, in my opinion, triggers the public confidence analysis recently enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Cantrell v. Crews, </em>259 Va. 47, 51, 523</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>S.E.2d 502, 504 (2000), <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 226-27, 532 S.E.2d 28, 30-31 (2000), and <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 826-27, 553 S.E.2d 731, 733 (2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">Public confidence in the integrity of the process is at stake. It cannot be promoted when a sitting juror is, at the time of trial, a client of the law firm representing one of the parties to the litigation.... This is true even though, as the record shows, the juror states that the circumstances of her [relationship] would have no \u201cbearing\u201d on her judgment as a juror and that she could \u201cbe totally fair to both sides.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap9\"><em>Cantrell, </em>259 Va. at 51, 523 S.E.2d at 504. <em>See also Medici </em>(reversed seating of a juror whose husband had been murdered and the accused was represented by the Office of the Public Defender, Medici\u2019s counsel\u2019s employer); <em>Barrett </em>(reversed seating of a prospective juror whose brother was a police officer expected to testify).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">While \u201ca juror\u2019s family relationship to a police-officer witness does not require dismissal per se of the juror if the trial court is satisfied that the juror can stand indifferent in the cause, ... [failure to strike the juror for cause] makes it unlikely that the public would have confidence in the judicial process.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 826, 553 S.E.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Recently, in <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 658, 576 S.E.2d 222 (2003), we again addressed the importance of analyzing on a case-by-case basis the importance of public perception and confidence in an impartial venire. \u201cIn a series of opinions decided over the last several years, the Supreme Court of Virginia has clearly found that inherent in appellate review of impartiality is a determination of whether \u2018the public would have confidence in the integrity of the process\u2019 if the prospective juror remained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667, 576 S.E.2d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The facts of this case clearly dictate that the seating of Juror Cook, who was related, albeit by marriage rather than blood, to all five child victims and two additional Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, was reversible error. Like the jurors in <em>Cantrell, Medici, </em>and <em>Barrett, </em>Juror Cook indicated and the trial court found that she would not be affected by her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>relationship with the witnesses. However, our inquiry does not end there. We must address the objective impact upon the public as a whole. What could undermine confidence in an impartial judicial system more readily than a juror who is a relative of both the victims and the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses? On these facts, I would reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
