Mulvey physically abused a student was founded. The Commissioner of the DSS affirmed that decision after an administrative hearing, and the trial court affirmed the agency\u2019s decision. The appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support the agency\u2019s factual findings. He argues he had no intent to injure the student and that his conduct was authorized. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the agency and limit our review of issues of fact to the agency record. <em>Carter v. Gordon, </em>28 Va.App. 133, 141, 502 S.E.2d 697, 701 (1998). On May 18, 2001, an eleven-year-old student was misbehaving and disrupting the appellant\u2019s classroom. The appellant asked the student to leave the room three times. He took the student\u2019s book bag and placed it at a desk in the hallway. The student protested because he would lose points if he were removed from the classroom, but he went to the hallway crying and whining. The student then refused to sit, kicked the chair, and called the appellant a \u201cbutthead.\u201d The appellant grabbed the student from behind with a strong grip on the shoulders, lifted him, and pushed him into the chair. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>He \u201csqueezed and hurt [the student] by accident.\u201d Student witnesses reported the appellant \u201cslammed\u201d the student into the chair. Another witness reported the student kept saying \u201cow, ow.\u201d Less than an hour later, the student had abrasions on his left shoulder and bruising on his right underarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">A Child Protective Services worker conducted an investigation three days later and determined the complaint was \u201cFounded, Level Three, for Physical Abuse.\u201d The worker concluded that the appellant placed his hands on the student and the resulting bruises \u201cappear consistant [sic] with that of rough handling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The intake report noted that the appellant denied touching the student at all. The appellant subsequently denied making that statement. In a June 19, 2001 letter, the appellant admitted he grabbed the student\u2019s shoulders but denied he intended to injure him. At the administrative hearing, the appellant asserted he was facing the student, whose arms were crossed in front of his chest, and that he grabbed the student to prevent him from falling. The appellant admitted he was frustrated during the incident, \u201cI was upset at that time.\u201d The hearing officer determined that the appellant \u201clost his composure,\u201d \u201cforcefully grabbed\u201d the student, and then fabricated an explanation for touching him.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Under the Administrative Process Act, the trial court\u2019s duty is \u201climited to ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record\u201d to support its decision. Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. \u201cThe phrase \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 refers to \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind <em>might </em>accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983) (citation omitted). A court \u201cmay reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact, \u2018only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting B. Mezines, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 51.01 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\u201cPhysical abuse occurs when a caretaker ... inflicts ... physical injury by other than accidental means----\u201d 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>VAC 40-705-30(A). Regardless of the appellant\u2019s lack of intent to injure, he acted intentionally when he grabbed the student in a strong grip and shoved him into the chair. Those acts inflicted bruises and abrasions. The results of his actions were reasonably foreseeable. \u201c[A] person is presumed to intend the immediate, direct, and necessary consequences of his voluntary act.\u201d <em>Nobles v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 548, 551, 238 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1977). The agency was permitted to accept the description of the incident given by the students, and it was permitted to discount the conflicting characterization given by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The appellant maintains Code \u00a7 22.1-279.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorized his conduct because he intended to maintain control and prevent the student from harming himself or others. The bruises to the student make evident that the touching was not incidental, minor, or reasonable. The appellant admitted he was upset when he grabbed the student, and the witnesses described the degree of force employed. No evidence indicated the appellant was acting to prevent the student from harming himself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">We conclude substantial evidence supported the agency\u2019s findings that the injury was not accidental and constituted physical abuse. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\">.

The Department of Social Services (DSS) hearing officer similarly concluded that proof \u201cappellant caused the [student\u2019s] injuries ... by an intentional act\u201d was sufficient to \u201cmeet[ ] the definition of physical abuse pursuant to [Child Protective Services] Policy.\u201d I would hold that finding either the occurrence of physical abuse or a violation of the corporal punishment statute requires independent proof that the act was unreasonable under the circumstances. Because the DSS hearing officer committed an error of law in failing to consider whether the act was unreasonable, I would vacate DSS\u2019s finding that appellant, a fifth grade teacher of special education, committed physical abuse and remand to the circuit court to remand to DSS for additional findings based on application of the proper standard. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The DSS hearing officer found that appellant \u201cundoubtedly did not intend the ... bruising\u201d that resulted from his intentional acts. The hearing officer concluded that appellant \u201clost his composure\u201d when the student became disruptive and that \u201che forcefully grabbed\u201d the student and \u201cshoved him into a chair.\u201d The hearing officer did not determine whether these actions were unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Code \u00a7 63.1-248.2 defines an abused or neglected child as one, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[w]hose parent[ ] or other person responsible for his care creates or inflicts ... upon such child a physical or mental injury by other than accidental means____\u201d DSS regulations track the language of that code section, providing that \u201c[p]hysical abuse occurs when a caretaker ... inflicts ... physical injury by other than accidental means____\u201d22 VAC 40-705-30(A). The purpose of the statute and related regulations is not to punish but to protect the abused child and the community. <em>J.P. v. Carter, </em>24 Va.App. 707, 727, 485 S.E.2d 162, 172 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Although \u201cthe interpretation which an administrative agency gives its [law] must be accorded great deference,\u201d an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>agency\u2019s interpretation may be reversed \u201cif [its] construction ... is arbitrary or capricious or fails to fulfill the agency\u2019s law as defined by its basic law.\u201d <em>Jackson v. W., </em>14 Va.App. 391, 401, 419 S.E.2d 385, 390 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We interpreted the statutory definition of an abused or neglected child in <em>Turner v. Jackson, </em>14 Va.App. 423, 417 S.E.2d 881 (1992). In that case, the father was found to have physically abused his three-year-old daughter by pulling out a section of her hair. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 417 S.E.2d at 884-85. The father\u2019s children reported that after the daughter spilled water in her room, the father grabbed her by her hair and attempted to take her from one room to another. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 417 S.E.2d at 884. The father contended first that he grabbed the child by the hair to prevent her from being harmed by stepping out onto a busy street. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 417 S.E.2d at 887. He subsequently admitted that he pulled the hair out while attempting to discipline his daughter in her room, although he contended the hair loss was accidental and gave conflicting accounts as to precisely how it occurred. <em>Id. </em>We upheld the ruling that substantial evidence existed to support the finding that the father abused the child. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 417 S.E.2d at 888. In rejecting the father\u2019s claim that the language \u201cphysical injury\u201d was unconstitutionally vague, we held that \u201ca person of average intelligence would understand that pulling out a section of hair from a three-year-old child\u2019s head would result in a physical injury to that child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433-34, 417 S.E.2d at 888-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The facts in <em>Turner </em>illustrate why the definition of physical abuse must be construed to take into account whether the intentional act that caused physical injury was reasonable or unreasonable under the circumstances. Under the father\u2019s first version of events, he grabbed the child by her hair and caused injury but did so in order to protect her from greater harm that was likely to occur if she stepped out into traffic. If the injury had occurred under those circumstances, the father\u2019s acts would have been reasonable and would not have constituted physical abuse. However, because the evidence established that the father grabbed the child by her hair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>attempted to pull her from one room to another, either out of anger or in order to discipline her, it supported a finding that his intentional act was unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The language in Code \u00a7 22.1-279.1, cited by appellant, supports this interpretation of the abuse and neglect statute as it applies to teachers and other school personnel. Code \u00a7 22.1-279.1 proscribes corporal punishment, but it exempts from the definition of corporal punishment, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe use of incidental, minor or reasonable physical contact or other actions designed to maintain order and control.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-279.1(A). It also expressly acknowledges that \u201cphysical pain, <em>injury </em>or discomfort\u201d may be \u201ccaused by the use of incidental, minor or reasonable physical contact or other actions designed to maintain order and control.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-279.1(C) (emphasis added). Thus, under the corporal punishment statute, contrary to the conclusion of the majority, the mere occurrence of bruising does not, in fact, make evident that the touching was not incidental, minor, or reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the corporal punishment statute requires an independent finding, based on all the circumstances surrounding the encounter, that the touching was not, among other things, reasonable. It would be anomalous to hold that Code \u00a7 22.1-279.1 permitted appellant\u2019s actions but that those same actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>constituted physical abuse under the abuse and neglect statute and related DSS regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">For these reasons, I would hold that, in order to find appellant \u201cinflict[ed] ... physical injury [on the student] by other than accidental means,\u201d the DSS hearing officer had to conclude not only that the contact which caused the bruising was intentional but also that the contact was unreasonable under the circumstances. Because the DSS hearing officer failed to consider whether the evidence proved the act was unreasonable, I would vacate DSS\u2019s finding that appellant committed physical abuse and remand to the circuit court to remand to DSS for additional findings based on application of the proper standard. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\">. The majority seems to acknowledge the hearing officer\u2019s finding that appellant did not act with an intent to injure, but it holds that appellant\u2019s acts nevertheless constituted physical abuse because the resulting bruising and abrasions were \"reasonably foreseeable.\u201d It then notes the general principle of law that \"[a] person is presumed to intend the immediate, direct, and necessary consequences of his voluntary act.\u201d This principle is a presumption only. If the evidence establishes as a fact that appellant did not intend to cause injury, then we may not apply the presumption to conclude, contrary to the evidence, that appellant intended to cause injury. However, as outlined above, the statute does not require proof of an intent to cause injury. Rather, it requires proof that the actor intended the act, whether or not injury was intended. I do not disagree with the conclusion that appellant may be considered \"responsible\u201d for causing the bruising if it was a \"reasonably foreseeable\u201d result of his intentional act. What I dispute is the majority\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s act constituted physical abuse without a concomitant finding that the intentional act that caused the bruising was unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\">. After the events at issue in this case occurred on May 18, 2001, legislation took effect that was designed to prevent such an anomalous result. As of July 1, 2001, Virginia\u2019s \"Welfare (Social Services)\u201d statutes reference the exceptions to the statutory prohibition against corporal punishment in Code \u00a7 22.1-279.1. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-248.4:1 (1995 Repl.Vol. &amp; Supp.2001); 2001 Va. Acts ch. 588; <em>see also </em>2002 Va. Acts ch. 747 (effective October 1, 2002, recodifying former Code \u00a7 63.1-248.4:1 as Code \u00a7 63.2-1511). The legislature has expressly provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">In determining whether the actions of a teacher, principal or other person employed by a school board or employed in a school operated by the Commonwealth are within the exceptions [contained in the corporal punishment statute and repeated verbatim] ... in this section, the local [social services] department shall examine whether the actions at the time of the event that were made by such person were reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Code \u00a7 63.2-1511.
