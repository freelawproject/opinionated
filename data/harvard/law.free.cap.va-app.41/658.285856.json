Crowder, II, guilty of felony destruction of property valued in excess of $1,000 under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)(ii). On appeal, Crowder contends that no evidence proved that the value of the property destroyed exceeded $1,000. Agreeing with Crowder, we reverse the felony conviction and remand the case for retrial, if the Commonwealth is so advised, on the lesser-included offense of misdemeanor destruction of property under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">When examining a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, \u201cthe evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the trial court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003) (citations omitted). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Craddock v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 539, 542-43, 580 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">On June 16, 2001, Crowder drove his brother\u2019s new Chevrolet ZR2 pickup truck to a party in Augusta County. After spending some time at the party, Crowder asked an acquaintance, Brian Thomas, if he would like to go for a ride in the new truck. Thomas agreed and the two men, with Crowder driving, proceeded to a nearby field that was leased by Neil Cash. Cash raised barley in the field and, at the time Crowder drove into it, the barley was \u201cwithin eight to ten days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>of being ready to harvest.\u201d Upon entering the field, Crowder \u201cdrove through\u201d and \u201cdid donuts\u201d in the crops. The truck, according to Cash, \u201cjust shattered the barley all over the ground\u201d and left ruts in the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Cash\u2019s son, Joshua Cash, saw the truck driving in the field and drove his truck over to confront Crowder. Thomas and Crowder, seeing Joshua Cash approaching, departed from the field by \u201cjumping a bank\u201d onto the highway. Joshua Cash, however, obtained the license plate number from the truck and reported the incident to the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Deputies subsequently arrested Crowder, and a grand jury indicted him for feloniously causing damage \u201cin excess of $1000.00 to property belonging to Neil Cash, in violation of Virginia Code Section 18.2-137.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">During the bench trial, the Commonwealth called Neil Cash to testify regarding the damage to the property. On direct examination, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">Q. It\u2019s been alleged that the damage to your property was in the amount of $2,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">MR. GARNETT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">Judge, he\u2019s going to have to question \u2014 put that in the form of a question. I \u2014 I think he just needs to ask him a question about the value, not suggest what the answer is. MR. SMITH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">Your Honor, the indictment read that the amount of damage was $2,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-12\">COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">I understand that. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-14\">Q. How \u2014 how did you arrive at the amount of damage that was done to your property, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-15\">A. Well, I figured \u2014 I had two \u2014 three other farmers there to come and give me an estimate on what they thought the property damage was. That\u2019s taking into consideration plowing, working the ground, re-seeding. I put down grass seed. Now I\u2019m going to have to go back and do it over because of the ruts and stuff in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief, Crowder moved to strike the evidence on the ground that the Commonwealth had not proved the \u201cvalue of the crops.\u201d The Commonwealth responded that Cash \u201chad three independent estimates made by three other farmers who all are aware of value [sic] of barley\u201d and that \u201cthe value is based on fair market value,\u201d which Cash and the three other farmers \u201care capable\u201d of estimating. Crowder objected and argued that these were facts not in evidence because Cash never testified to the fair market value of the damaged crops as of the date of the incident. Nor did Cash adopt, Crowder contended, the $2,000 figure mistakenly cited by the prosecutor as the amount of damage alleged by the grand jury in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The trial court overruled the motion to strike. After neither party submitted further evidence regarding the value of the barley, Crowder asked the Court to \u201cincorporate\u201d in his \u201cclosing arguments the comments that I made previously about the fair market value of the ... crop.\u201d The trial court again overruled the motion to strike and found Crowder guilty of felony destruction of property valued in excess of $1,000 under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">When faced with a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we \u201cpresume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u201d and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence\u201d to support it. <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted); <em>see also McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197-98, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc). When a jury decides the case, Code \u00a7 8.01-680 requires that \u201cwe review the jury\u2019s decision to see if reasonable jurors could have made the choices that the jury did make. We let the decision stand unless we conclude no rational juror could have reached that decision.\u201d <em>Pease v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 342, 355, 573 S.E.2d 272, 278 (2002) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>aff'd, </em>266 Va. 397, 588 S.E.2d 149 (2003) (per curiam). The same standard applies when a trial judge sits as the factfinder because the \u201cjudgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the same weight as a jury verdict.\u201d <em>Cairns v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 271, 293, 579 S.E.2d 340, 351 (2003) (citation omitted); <em>see also Shackleford v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 196, 209, 547 S.E.2d 899, 906-07 (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Put another way, a reviewing court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original and citation omitted). We must instead ask whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789 (emphasis in original)); <em>see also Hoambrecker v. City of Lynchburg, </em>13 Va.App. 511, 514, 412 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1992) (observing that the question on appeal is whether \u201ca rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\u201d of the convicted offense). \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257-58, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Governed by this standard of review, we find that no rational factfinder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the Commonwealth proved the $1,000 threshold value element of the felony destruction of property charge under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)(ii). Though we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Commonwealth that Cash, as the owner of the damaged crop, could have given an admissible lay opinion on its value, <em>Lester v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 495, 504-05, 518 S.E.2d 318, 322 (1999),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the fact is, he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">At trial, the prosecutor took the position that his interrupted attempt at a leading question on direct examination (\u201cIt\u2019s been alleged that the damage to your property was in the amount of $2,000.\u201d), coupled with his mistaken description of the indictment (\u2018Tour Honor, the indictment read that the amount of damage was $2,000.00.\u201d), somehow established $2,000 as the damage estimate. Suffice it to say, however, counsel cannot testify<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and indictments are not evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">True, admissible or not, the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the $2,000 figure could have been adopted by Cash in his testimony absent a valid objection. Cash, however, was never asked if he agreed with the $2,000 figure. The only question asked of Cash was \u201cHow \u2014 how did you arrive at the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>damage that was done to your property, sir?\u201d His elliptic reply was that he had obtained estimates from two or three other farmers. Cash never said what those estimates were. Nor did Cash say whether those estimates confirmed the $1,000 allegation of the indictment or the $2,000 figure erroneously attributed by the prosecutor to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">By his silence, Cash may have implicitly agreed with the $2,000 figure. But to accept this supposition as a substitute for evidence, in our judgment, pushes the concept of reasonable inferences into the realm of <em>non sequitur. </em>An inference \u201cpermits a finder of fact to conclude the existence of one fact from the proof of one or more other facts.\u201d <em>Carfagno v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 718, 727, 576 S.E.2d 765, 769 (2003) (citations and quotation marks omitted). It allows a factfinder to reason \u201cfrom basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257-58, 584 S.E.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). Properly used, however, an inference may only extend a syllogism \u2014 not begin one.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In short, from the record before us, no rational factfinder could conclude that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the damage to Cash\u2019s crop exceeded the $1,000 required for a felony conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)(ii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For this reason, we reverse Crowder\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">That said, we disagree with Crowder\u2019s assertion that a reversal precludes further proceedings against him. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>court in this case specifically found that Cash\u2019s crop sustained economic damage. Though we find no testimony measuring that damage in excess of $1,000, Cash clearly testified that some measurable damage occurred to the crop. Thus, the Commonwealth made a sufficient showing for a misdemeanor conviction for the lesser-included charge of intentional property damage under Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 137(B)(i), which requires no threshold damage value.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">When an appellant successfully challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on some (but not all) aspects of his conviction, we must determine if the proven elements of the original charge qualify as a lesser-included offense. If so, the appropriate remedy on appeal is a reversal of the conviction on the greater charge and a remand of the lesser charge for retrial \u2014 assuming the Commonwealth, in its prosecutorial discretion, chooses to go forward on the lesser charge. <em>See generally Gorham v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 673, 678, 426 S.E.2d 493, 496 (1993) (observing that the \u201cconsistent practice in Virginia, when the evidence is found insufficient to sustain a felony conviction on appeal, but sufficient to sustain a conviction on a lesser-included misdemeanor offense, has been to remand the case for retrial on the lesser-included offense\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Finding the evidence insufficient to establish the statutory $1,000 threshold, we reverse Crowder\u2019s conviction for felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>destruction of property under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)(ii). Because the evidence sufficiently establishes every element of the lesser-included offense of misdemeanor destruction of property under Code \u00a7 18.2-137(B)(i), we remand this matter for retrial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">.
