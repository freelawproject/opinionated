For the reasons stated, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">On July 31, 2000, when Cheyenne Knight was born to appellant and Alana Jackson, she suffered from gastrochisis, a condition where \u201cthe intestinal content are [sic] outside the abdomen.\u201d Surgery corrected the condition. On September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>7, 2000, at her first visit to the doctor\u2019s office after leaving the hospital, Cheyenne weighed six pounds and two ounces and was healthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">On September 10, 2000, at approximately 4:04 a.m., paramedics responded to an emergency call at appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s house. Cheyenne was \u201cbasically flaccid and lifeless.\u201d Thomas Hoover, a paramedic, noticed \u201ca deformity to the child\u2019s head,\u201d which \u201cappeared to be swollen.\u201d Hoover asked whether she had fallen. Appellant responded, \u201c[T]he child was in the bed.\u201d Cheyenne was transported to Southside Community Hospital, accompanied by appellant and the paramedics. Several witnesses testified appellant was crying, \u201cvery upset, very panicked\u201d on the morning the paramedics arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">A triage nurse at Southside asked appellant, \u201cDid the baby suffer any kind of fall or anything like that?\u201d Appellant responded in the negative. The nurse confirmed the baby\u2019s head was \u201c[v]ery misshapen on the right side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">An emergency room physician, Janette Mamuric, interviewed appellant at the hospital, asking whether the child suffered any trauma. Again, appellant replied in the negative. A CAT scan revealed skull fractures. Dr. Mamuric testified that, had she been told the child suffered a traumatic injury, a proper diagnosis and treatment would have been expedited.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Cheyenne ultimately was transported to MCV hospital in Richmond. Dr. Samuel T. Bartle examined Cheyenne and opined that she had \u201csome type of blunt force\u201d injury to the skull. He described her condition as a \u201cvery significant close head injury,\u201d involving several skull fractures and bleeding in or around the brain. He noted, \u201cInjuries like this you would see in a child who has been in a car, in a car [c]rash, that was ejected and was thrown so many feet after traveling 55 miles per hour.\u201d Dr. Bartle further explained that such trauma injuries have a \u201cgolden hour,\u201d referring to the need to have the victim transported immediately following the injury to a trauma center. After this \u201cgolden hour,\u201d \u201cthe percentage of survival drops off.\u201d He also explained that, since an infant\u2019s skull is \u201cmuch more plastic,\u201d \u201cmore force is required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>fracture an infant\u2019s skull than it does [sic] to [fracture] an adult skull.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Dr. William T. Gromley, a forensic pathologist, performed the autopsy. He testified the injuries to the child\u2019s head were \u201cprimarily in this frontal portion of the head and on the right side.\u201d The cause of death was \u201cblunt force injuries to the brain.\u201d The pathologist could not opine whether more than one blow caused the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">On the evening of September 10, 2000, appellant and his mother arrived at the Lunenburg County Sheriffs Office. Jeff Paul, a deputy sheriff who knew nothing about the death of Cheyenne, interviewed appellant. Paul read appellant his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Appellant then explained that he was taking care of Cheyenne and that she began to cry. He went into her room and decided to stay with his daughter and watch television. As he reached over Cheyenne to get some VHS tapes, the tapes dropped, and one tape hit her on the head. When appellant picked her up, he noticed \u201cthe side of her head was swollen,\u201d and her breathing was difficult. He took the child to his mother\u2019s bedroom, and she called the rescue squad.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Appellant told Deputy Paul that, when the medical personnel at the hospital asked what had happened, he replied he did not know rather than telling them about the tapes. He explained, \u201cI did not want anyone thinking bad of me,\u201d adding, \u201cthe last thing I needed was someone coming in and making me seem like a bad father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Deputy Paul and Sheriff Wesley D. Adams later interviewed appellant at his mother\u2019s home. The interview was videotaped in the room where the incident occurred. Appellant repeated his story that Cheyenne was injured when some videotapes accidentally fell on her. After they turned off the video recorder, Sheriff Adams told appellant he did not believe falling videotapes \u201ccould have killed that child.\u201d The sheriff asked appellant if he wanted to \u201ctell us what really happened.\u201d Appellant said he would. Everyone returned to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>room in the house and continued video recording the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">This time, appellant explained to the officers that he had been asleep and awoke to hear the infant\u2019s crying. He tried to feed her, but she would not eat. She kept crying. He explained, \u201cI was not angry with her, but before I knew it, I had struck her in the back of the head with my right fist.\u201d Appellant weighed approximately 200 pounds at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">After he was taken to the magistrate and charged, appellant gave a signed, written statement to the officers confirming the videotaped statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">After gathering some information from the medical examiner, Deputy Paul interviewed appellant again, this time while appellant was in jail. Appellant \u201cseemed to be in good spirits and was happy to see\u201d the deputy. During this interview, appellant was calm and did not cry.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In his statement at the jail, appellant said he had fed Cheyenne, but afterwards she started crying. He tried to feed her again, \u201cbut she wouldn\u2019t take the bottle.\u201d He then \u201csqueezed her stomach and she passed gas.\u201d He began feeding the child again, but she stopped drinking and started to cry. He then \u201cchoked her until her face started turning blue, and [he] then stopped choking her and laid her on the bed.\u201d When the child continued to cry, he \u201cstruck her on the side of her head,\u201d hitting her \u201chard enough to push her into the wall.\u201d Because the child then started to get quiet, he placed her on her stomach and put a pillow on top of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Appellant then left the room and fell asleep while watching television. However, he was awakened by Cheyenne\u2019s crying and returned to the infant\u2019s bedroom. At that point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">She was still crying, so I walked over to the bed and hit her again through the pillow. I hit her harder this time and there was a loud pop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Appellant again explained why he did not tell the medical personnel or the police what occurred. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone what happened because I didn\u2019t want social services to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>my daughter from me.\u201d Appellant told Deputy Paul, \u201c[D]uring the process of harming his daughter, he was never angry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">At trial, appellant gave yet another version of the incident. He claimed Cheyenne was crying around 3:20 a.m. and woke him. He entered her room without turning on the lights, and he tripped over a baby bottle. While falling, he grabbed a shelf that acted as a headboard above the bed. He testified, \u201cMy weight yanked off the headboard and \u2014 and it caused the headboard to fall onto the bed, hitting Cheyenne on the head.\u201d Appellant claimed he \u201cpanicked\u201d when he saw the shelf on the bed after they called the rescue squad. He then re-nailed the shelf to the wall. He claimed his mother never had a chance to see the shelf off the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Appellant admitted he did not tell anyone about the shelf. He explained his statements to the officers \u201cgot worse\u201d because he \u201cdid not care\u201d after the death of his daughter. He claimed he told Deputy Paul that he hit Cheyenne with such force that he heard a \u201cpop\u201d because that story was what the deputy wanted to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, appellant moved to strike the evidence, arguing the evidence was insufficient to prove premeditation. The trial court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">On appeal, appellant contends, as a matter of law, the evidence did not support a finding of premeditation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">When reviewing sufficiency arguments on appeal, we review the evidence and the inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Snow v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 766, 774, 537 S.E.2d 6, 10 (2000). We will not disturb the fact finder\u2019s verdict unless that decision was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Ashby v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 540, 548, 535 S.E.2d 182, 186-87 (2000). In determining whether the verdict was plainly wrong or not supported by the evidence, we examine both the direct and circumstantial evidence in the record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Rhodes v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 480, 486, 384 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1989); <em>see also Hagy v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 152, 159, 543 S.E.2d 614, 617 (2001) (finding circumstantial evidence is sufficient to support a verdict if it excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence that flows from the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">An essential element of a first-degree murder conviction is premeditation, i.e., the development in the mind of the murderer of the specific intent to kill prior to the act itself. Code \u00a7 18.2-32 (defining first-degree murder); <em>Betancourt v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 363, 372-73, 494 S.E.2d 873, 877 (1998) (defining premeditation). This specific intent \u201cmay be formed only a moment before the fatal act is committed provided the accused had time to think and did intend to kill.\u201d <em>Giarratano v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1064, 1074, 266 S.E.2d 94, 100 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Appellant contends <em>Rhodes v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 480, 384 S.E.2d 95 (1989), requires that we reverse his conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Rhodes was tried for the premeditated murder of her infant daughter, who had a healing fracture of the left leg, new and old bruises, and skull fractures. <em>Id. </em>at 482, 384 S.E.2d at 96. The doctor also found \u201c \u2018retinal hemorrhages ... diagnostic of severe shaking and trauma to the head.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The cause of death was \u201cbrain damage resulting from skull injuries,\u201d inflicted by \u201c \u2018blunt impact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 384 S.E.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Rhodes never made any inculpatory statements. <em>Id. </em>Instead, she said she found the child choking and attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 384 S.E.2d at 97. When that failed, she claimed she slapped the child on the leg and then shook her. <em>Id. </em>Rhodes then called the rescue squad. <em>Id. </em>She told a social worker a different version: that she went to prepare a bottle, heard a \u201c \u2018thump,\u2019 \u201d and returned to find the baby lying on the floor. <em>Id. </em>A doctor testified a fall from the couch was not consistent with the baby\u2019s injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 384 S.E.2d at 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In analyzing premeditation, the <em>Rhodes </em>Court cited <em>Epperly v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 294 S.E.2d 882 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>In <em>Epperly, [id. </em>at 232, 294 S.E.2d at 892-93,] the jury-heard evidence to show the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted upon the deceased; the physical disparity between the accused and his victim; the defendant\u2019s concealment of the fruit of his crime and other efforts to avoid detection; the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse; and the defendant\u2019s motive to silence the only witness who might convict him of the sexual crime he had committed. We held that this combination of factors was sufficient \u201cto support the jury\u2019s finding that the killing ... was not only malicious, but also willful, deliberate, and premeditated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">In its opinion affirming the judgment of the trial court, the Court of Appeals invoked the rule applied in <em>Epperly. </em>We think the Court of Appeals erred; <em>Epperly </em>is clearly distinguishable. True, the accused in this case was an adult and the victim an infant, and the deceased suffered grievous injuries caused by a number of blows struck on several occasions. With respect to all other circumstantial factors detailed in <em>Epperly, </em>however, this case is significantly different. Unlike the defendant in <em>Epperly, </em>Mrs. Rhodes was guilty of no effort to conceal evidence or avoid the risk of detection and blame; to the contrary, she initiated a call for medical help for a child who had suffered respiratory problems from birth. Nor was Mrs. Rhodes guilty of a lack of remorse; rather, all who saw her \u2014 the paramedics and the doctors at both hospitals \u2014 described her as \u201ccrying,\u201d \u201cdistraught,\u201d \u201chysterical,\u201d and \u201cfainting.\u201d And in <em>Epperly, </em>there was evidence pointing to motive, a factor which we said \u201cis relevant and often most persuasive upon the question of ... intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 294 S.E.2d at 892-93. We find no evidence of motive here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">We do not mean to suggest that each and every factor mentioned in <em>Epperly </em>is essential to the application of the rule applied there. As our decision in that case illustrates we will affirm a conviction of premeditated murder, even though based upon wholly circumstantial evidence, whenever we can say that the reasonable import of such evidence, considered as a whole, is sufficient to show beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>able doubt that the accused was the criminal agent and that he acted with a premeditated intent to kill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">238 Va. at 486-87, 384 S.E.2d at 98-99. Thus, we apply the <em>Epperly </em>factors in analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence to prove premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">One factor applied in <em>Epperly </em>was the brutality of the assault. <em>Epperly, </em>224 Va. at 232, 294 S.E.2d at 892. Here, the jury heard considerable evidence as to Cheyenne\u2019s skull fractures, caused by \u201cblunt force trauma.\u201d The infant\u2019s head was \u201cvery misshapen on the right side.\u201d The MCV pediatrician compared the severity of her injury to one suffered by someone \u201cthrown so many feet after travelling 55 miles per hour.\u201d The infant\u2019s skull, more pliable than an adult\u2019s, required significant force to fracture. Knight admitted he struck Cheyenne several times that morning, at different intervals, eventually hitting her with enough force that he heard her skull \u201cpop.\u201d The jury had sufficient evidence to find the killing was brutal.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Another <em>Epperly </em>factor is \u201cthe physical disparity between the accused and his victim.\u201d <em>Rhodes, </em>238 Va. at 486, 384 S.E.2d at 98. Appellant was an adult, weighing over 200 pounds. The victim was a helpless six-week-old child, weighing six pounds, two ounces.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\"><em>Epperly </em>also considered attempts to conceal the crime as relevant to determinations of premeditation. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 384 S.E.2d at 99. In this case, while appellant did not conceal the infant\u2019s body,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he clearly concealed the cause of the child\u2019s injuries, not only from the police, but also from emergency and medical personnel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, appellant gave no less than five different accounts of how the baby was injured. Clearly, appellant attempted to conceal his role in Cheyenne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Appellant argues his remorse, as evidenced by his tears and emotional behavior at the hospital and during the videotaped statement, militates against the premeditation factors in <em>Epperly. </em>Various witnesses did, in fact, characterize appellant\u2019s demeanor at the emergency room as \u201cupset.\u201d A paramedic testified appellant was \u201cemotional\u201d and teary. Appellant and his mother both testified that he was distraught, crying, \u201cnervous and shaking\u201d after the incident. At times, he was emotional during the videotaped interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Yet, the sheriffs personnel gave a different version of appellant\u2019s emotional state. When Deputy Paul re-interviewed him at the regional jail the day after his daughter died, appellant \u201cseemed to be in good spirits and was happy to see [the officer].\u201d His demeanor was characterized as \u201ccalm.\u201d He did not cry. \u201cHe was just a normal, everyday person.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The jury also had an opportunity to evaluate appellant\u2019s emotional state at the time of his daughter\u2019s death. They saw the videotaped statement taken in his home after Cheyenne died. While appellant exhibited some emotion during this interview, he also appeared concerned about how other people would view his actions. The jury could determine from this evidence that his emotions were the result of concern for his own predicament and not regret over his actions. The evidence supports a conclusion that appellant\u2019s only concern was for himself and not remorse for killing his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Given his testimony, the fact finder could conclude appellant was more concerned about other people\u2019s impression of him than he was about getting appropriate treatment for his daughter. In explaining his failure to tell the medical personnel how the traumatic injury occurred, appellant said, \u201cI did not want anyone thinking bad of me.\u201d \u201c[T]he last thing I needed was someone coming in and making me seem like a bad father.\u201d Thus, at a time when specific knowledge of the circumstances leading to the injury possibly could have saved Cheyenne, appellant chose not to advise the medical personnel of the true nature of his child\u2019s injury, but, instead, chose to protect himself by refusing to explain how the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The Supreme Court of Virginia noted in <em>Epperly, </em>\u201cWhile motive is not an essential element of the crime, it is relevant and often most persuasive upon the question of the actor\u2019s intent.\u201d 224 Va. at 232, 294 S.E.2d at 892-93. Motive was not developed in the instant case. The Supreme Court, however, noted in <em>Rhodes </em>that it did \u201cnot mean to suggest that each and every factor mentioned in <em>Epperly </em>is essential to the application of the rule applied there.\u201d 238 Va. at 487, 384 S.E.2d at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Further, <em>Rhodes </em>is distinguishable on its facts from this case. Rhodes gave no inculpatory statements admitting that she deliberately inflicted severe injury to her child, although evidence of child abuse was included in the record. Additionally, her remorse was unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Here, appellant admitted inflicting a series of brutal assaults upon the infant and also indicated he was not angry with the child. He told the police that he \u201cchoked her until her face started turning blue\u201d because she would not stop crying. He then hit her on the side of the head \u201chard enough to push her into the wall.\u201d Appellant then left the room, fell asleep, and was awakened by the child\u2019s crying. When he returned to Cheyenne\u2019s room, he \u201chit her harder this time and there was a loud pop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Throughout these series of assaults, appellant said he was never angry. Although he was concerned people would consider him a bad father, he did not express regret over the loss of his daughter\u2019s life when he made his statements to the police. He admitted he did not put his daughter\u2019s interests first when the doctors needed information from him. While some evidence indicates he was emotional, at times, at the hospital and during the videotaped interview, other evidence suggests appellant was not remorseful about the injury to his daughter. The jury, after hearing appellant\u2019s testimony, was entitled to discount his explanation of his emotional state. <em>See Zook v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 560, 571, 525 S.E.2d 32, 37 (2000) (noting juries can reject testimony they determine is not credible).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The jury was properly instructed on premeditation. From the evidence, they could conclude appellant\u2019s attack was premeditated, based on the brutality of the attack, the disparity in size, his efforts to conceal his guilt, including his conflicting explanations of the incident, <em>see Dowden v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 459, 469-70, 536 S.E.2d 437, 442 (2000) (finding a jury can infer guilt when they believe a defendant has lied), the period of time between the two blows, his lack of remorse, and his admission that he inflicted severe blows to the child\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We find the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-14\">. While the jury imposed the death penalty, the trial court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment without parole, in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\">. Although appellant did not call the ambulance, he did take the child to his mother for her assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\">.
