On appeal, she argues that (i) the trial court incorrectly applied the legal standard governing visitation with a non-parent, and (ii) under a correct application of the standard, the evidence does not justify awarding visitation over her parental objection. Agreeing with both contentions, we reverse the trial court\u2019s visitation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">Andrea Griffin (wife) and Elbert Griffin (husband) married in 1996 and separated in September 1997. During the separation, wife became sexually involved with Michael Groh. Wife continued, however, to have sexual relations with husband during this period of separation. In October 1997, wife learned that she was pregnant and informed husband that he was the father. In December 1997, husband was injured in an automobile accident and spent six to seven weeks in the hospital. Upon husband\u2019s discharge from the hospital, wife returned to the marital home to care for him. Husband suffered extensive injuries, leaving him with significant physical and mental impairments. During this period of recupera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tion, however, the couple did not reconcile or express any joint interest in saving the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Wife gave birth to a boy on June 25, 1998. Husband believed at that time, based on what wife had told him, that he was the child\u2019s father. As a result, husband treated the child as his own and participated in his early development. In September 1999, wife and her son moved in with her mother. Wife agreed to allow husband weekly visitation with the child. In December 1999, however, a court-ordered paternity test established that Michael Groh was the child\u2019s father. Upon learning the results of the paternity test, wife denied husband any further weekly visitation with her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In August 2000, over wife\u2019s objection, the juvenile and domestic relations district court awarded husband temporary visitation rights with the child despite the results of the paternity test. In June 2001, the JDR court expanded the visitation schedule and made its order final. The final order stated that the JDR court applied the best-interests test codified in Code \u00a7 20-124.3. Wife appealed to the circuit court on the ground that, as a non-parent, husband could not obtain visitation rights over her son on a mere showing of best interests. In February 2002, the circuit court held a hearing concerning the visitation issue. The child\u2019s biological father, Michael Groh, appeared and testified that he paid child support, but did not intend to foster a relationship with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Wife called Dr. Patricia Martin, a clinical psychologist, as an expert witness. Dr. Martin testified that the best interests of the child would be served by ending husband\u2019s visitation. Dr. Martin concluded that, given the animosity between them, wife and husband were not \u201cable to co-parent effectively.\u201d Dr. Martin noted wife\u2019s legitimate concerns over her son\u2019s \u201csafety\u201d when he was with husband as well as husband\u2019s \u201chistory of drinking.\u201d In addition, Dr. Martin testified, husband\u2019s psychological tests revealed \u201cdysfunctional personality characteristics.\u201d Husband engaged in chronic disparagement of wife in her son\u2019s presence and displayed an attitude of \u201crevenge\u201d stemming from a sense of betrayal by wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The child was \u201cobviously aware\u201d of the hostility between husband and wife, Dr. Martin observed. She explained that this level of antagonism, even between parents, was cause for alarm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">One of the most significant findings in family research concerns the serious hazard posed to the psychological health and develop[ment] of children by continued exposure to high conflict between the parents, whether in the contexts of an intact marriage or as part of ongoing post-divorce antagonism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">It only compounded things, Dr. Martin concluded, for such hostility to exist between a mother and a non-parent seeking to play the role of a <em>defacto </em>father.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Husband called Wendy Carroll, a family counselor, as an expert witness. Carroll testified that she thought it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d on the child if visitation with husband did not continue. The child referred to husband as \u201cDaddy,\u201d Carroll pointed out, and had obvious affection for him. Carroll also found it significant that \u201cMr. Griffin vehemently and consistently state[s] that he views himself as [the child\u2019s] father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Although she did not apply any \u201cformal criteria,\u201d Carroll concluded that under \u201cattachment theory\u201d the child had developed an emotional tie to husband. Severing that tie, Carroll believed, would likely cause the child to consider himself \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cunlovable\u201d and to grieve over the loss. As a result, Carroll opined, it \u201ccould be\u201d emotionally hurtful for the child if visitation ended. All in all, Carroll concluded, it would be in the child\u2019s best interests for husband to have visitation rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The trial court ruled for husband, stating that the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child would be served by ordering visitation over the mother\u2019s objection and that not doing so would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201cdetrimental\u201d to the child. The court advised husband to read <em>Wednesdays And Every Other Weekend, </em>a book \u201cwhich talks about non-custodial parents and what\u2019s best for the child.\u201d The court\u2019s final order required wife to make the child available for visitation by husband on Wednesday afternoons and every other weekend (from Friday night until Sunday evening). The order also provided that husband \u201cshall not consume alcoholic beverages while the child is in his care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Wife filed this appeal, seeking a reversal of the visitation order. Before oral argument, wife filed a motion to remand the case to the trial court alleging that on March 30, 2003, husband had been in another automobile accident \u2014 this time with her son as a passenger. Police officers arrested husband for driving under the influence and endangering the child\u2019s life. By order entered April 15, 2003, we denied wife\u2019s request for a plenary remand of the case, but nonetheless granted leave for her to seek from the trial court either a reconsideration or stay of the visitation order based upon changed circumstances. In the meantime, we ordered this appeal to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">As the United States Supreme Court has observed, the \u201cliberty interest at issue in this case \u2014 the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children \u2014 is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.\u201d <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). The Due Process Clause protects the \u201cfundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 120 S.Ct. at 2060. As a result, the statutory best-interests test \u201cunconstitutionally infringes on that fundamental parental right\u201d if it authorizes a court to \u201cdisregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision files a visitation petition, based solely on the judge\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 120 S.Ct. at 2060-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Troxel </em>expressly declined to rule that all \u201cnonparental visitation statutes violate the Due Process Clause as a <em>per se </em>matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 120 S.Ct. at 2064. Citing <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998), as an example, <em>Troxel </em>pointed out that some state statutes have been interpreted to require a showing of actual harm as a precondition to awarding visitation to a non-parent over the objection of fit parents. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 120 S.Ct. at 2064-65. In <em>Williams, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court agreed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiL\">[f]or the constitutional requirement to be satisfied, before visitation can be ordered over the objection of the child\u2019s parents, a court must find an <em>actual harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare </em>without such visitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><em>Williams, </em>256 Va. at 22, 501 S.E.2d at 418 (quoting <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>24 Va.App. 778, 784-85, 485 S.E.2d 651, 654 (1997)) (emphasis added). Thus, when fit parents object to non-parental visitation, a trial court should apply \u201cthe \u2018best interests\u2019 standard in determining visitation <em>only after </em>it finds harm if visitation is not ordered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Custody and visitation disputes between two fit parents involve one parent\u2019s fundamental right pitted against the other parent\u2019s fundamental right. The discretion afforded trial courts under the best-interests test, Code \u00a7 20-124.3, reflects a finely balanced judicial response to this parental deadlock. A very different kind of legal contest, however, exists in a dispute between a fit parent and a non-parent. In this latter situation, the best-interests test should be applied only if the trial court first finds \u201can actual harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare without such visitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Williams, </em>24 Va.App. at 784-85, 485 S.E.2d at 654).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We disagree with husband that our reasoning conflicts with <em>Dotson v. Hylton, </em>29 Va.App. 635, 639, 513 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1999), which held: \u201cWhen only one parent objects to a [non-parent\u2019s] visitation and the other parent requests it, the trial court is not required to follow the standard enumerated in <em>Williams.\u201d </em>Unlike <em>Dotson, </em>the \u201cother parent\u201d in our case (Michael Groh) did not request that visitation be awarded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>husband. Thus, the trial eourt was not asked to referee between one parent\u2019s request that visitation be granted to a non-parent and the other parent\u2019s objection to it. The only contest here is between a parent and a non-parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We are equally unpersuaded by husband\u2019s suggestion that wife has no constitutionally protected rights as a parent because she and the child\u2019s father cannot be considered an \u201cintact family.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Troxel </em>involved an unmarried, single mother. \" Nothing in <em>Troxel </em>implies that the legal superiority of a fit parent\u2019s rights over those of a non-parent turns on whether the parent is married, separated, divorced, or widowed. A single mother has no less constitutional right to parent her son than a married mother. \u2018We, therefore, reject any argument that single parents are entitled to less constitutional liberty in decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d <em>Wickham v. Byrne, </em>199 Ill.2d 309, 263 Ill.Dec. 799, 769 N.E.2d 1, 6 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Because it exists as a means of expressing the compelling state interests necessary to overcome the constitutional parental rights recognized in <em>Troxel, </em>the actual-harm standard must be understood as conceptually different from, and significantly weightier than, the best-interests test. As we made clear in <em>Williams, </em>the actual-harm test cannot be satisfied by a showing that \u201cit would be \u2018better,\u2019 \u2018desirable,\u2019 or \u2018beneficial\u2019 for a child\u201d to have visitation with a non-parent. <em>Williams, </em>24 Va.App. at 784, 485 S.E.2d at 654. \u201cIt is irrelevant, to this constitutional analysis, that it might, in many instances be \u2018better\u2019 or \u2018desirable\u2019 for a child\u201d to have visitation with a non-parent. <em>Brooks v. Parkerson, </em>265 Ga. 189, 454 S.E.2d 769, 773-74 (1995). \u201cFor the state to delegate to the parents the authority to raise the[ir] child as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>parents see fit, except when the state thinks another choice would be better, is to give the parents no authority at all.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>24 Va.App. at 784, 485 S.E.2d at 654 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Absent a showing of actual harm to the child, the constitutional liberty interests of fit parents \u201ctake precedence over the \u2018best interests\u2019 of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, \u201ca court may not impose its subjective notions of \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 \u201d in derogation of parental rights protected by the Constitution. <em>Id. A </em>\u201cvague generalization about the positive influence\u201d of non-parent visitation cannot satisfy the actual-harm requirement. <em>In re Herbst, </em>971 P.2d 395, 396, 398-99 (Okla.1998). To be sure, in this context, forced visitation \u201ccannot be ordered absent compelling circumstances which suggest something near unfitness of custodial parents.\u201d <em>Stacy v. Ross, </em>798 So.2d 1275, 1280 (Miss.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In addition, Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B) requires a showing of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d before visitation may be awarded to a non-parent. This erects a \u201cmore stringent standard\u201d than a mere \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 263, 578 S.E.2d 833, 837 (2003). Clear and convincing evidence involves \u201cthat measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lanning v. Va. Dept. of Transp., </em>37 Va.App. 701, 707, 561 S.E.2d 33, 36 (2002) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In this case, the trial court collapsed the two legal standards together \u2014 not only in the decisionmaking sequence, but in the substance of the decision as well. In effect, the trial court\u2019s reasoning treated the actual-harm requirement as simply a restatement of the best-interests test. To justify a finding of actual harm under the clear and convincing burden of proof, the evidence must establish more than the obvious observation that the child would benefit from the continuing emotional attachment with the non-parent. No doubt losing such a relationship would cause some measure of sadness and a sense of loss which, in theory, \u201ccould be\u201d emotionally harmful. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>that is not what we meant by <em>\u201cactual </em>harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>24 Va.App. at 784-85, 485 S.E.2d at 654 (emphasis added). If it were, any non-parent who has developed an emotionally enduring relationship with another\u2019s child would satisfy the actual-harm requirement. The constitutional rights of parents cannot be so easily undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The-evidence in this case, at its best, goes no further than supporting the inference that the child would grieve the loss of the emotional attachment he has for his mother\u2019s estranged husband and \u201ccould be\u201d emotionally hurt if visitation with him ended. While that might satisfy a trial court\u2019s \u201csubjective notions of \u2018best interest of the child,\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>24 Va.App. at 785, 485 S.E.2d at 654, it falls far short of satisfying by clear and convincing evidence the actual-harm test. Wife\u2019s decision to discourage her young son\u2019s relationship with husband, therefore, must be judicially respected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In sum, we hold that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard to the non-parent visitation award and that, under the correct standard, the evidence does not support a finding by clear and convincing evidence of actual harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare. For this reason, we reverse and vacate the trial court\u2019s visitation order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\n<em>Reversed and vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\">. Wife also contends that the trial court erred by admitting the testimony of Wendy Carroll because she was unqualified to address the psychological aspects of \"attachment theory\u201d and that, in any event, the topic was an improper subject for expert opinion in the first place. Our reasoning assumes, without deciding, that Carroll\u2019s testimony was admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">. In <em>Dotson, </em>29 Va.App. at 638, 513 S.E.2d at 903, we distinguished the situation in that case (a divorced couple with one parent requesting visitation, the other objecting to it) from <em>Williams, </em>which involved a \u201cunified family\" with both parents objecting to non-parent visitation. <em>Dotson </em>did not hold, as husband appears to contend, that the actualhami standard applies only to married parents in an intact family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\">. Given our holding, we need not address whether husband qualifies as a \"[p]erson with a legitimate interest\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.1. <em>Cf. Kogon v. Ulerick, </em>12 Va.App. 595, 405 S.E.2d 441 (1991) (defining \"stepparent\u201d for purposes of being deemed a \"party with a legitimate interest\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\">. We also deny husband\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
