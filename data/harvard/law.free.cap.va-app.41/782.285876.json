Finding that the chancellor did not abuse his discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">When reviewing a chancellor\u2019s decision on appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting her the benefit of any reasonable inferences. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>(2003). \u201cThat principle requires us to discard the evidence of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Craig and Roseann Petry were reared on Long Island in New York and their extended families still reside there. They began dating in high school and married on Long Island in 1993, just after husband\u2019s first year in medical school at Medical College of Wisconsin. In the early years of her marriage, wife had several jobs ranging from \u201cworking for a rheumatologist, bank employment, an administrative assistant, and a second evening and part-time weekend job at a department store.\u201d Her earnings supplemented the student loans husband was receiving. In 1996, husband completed medical school and the parties moved to Pennsylvania for husband\u2019s medical residency. Wife gave birth to a daughter the same year, and in 1998 she gave birth to a son. Both parties agreed that wife would be a stay-at-home mom, though wife still worked from home for a brief period as a medical transcriptionist to supplement their income.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Wife made it a practice to return home to Long Island with the children every two to three months to visit family and friends. Visits commonly lasted for one to three weeks. The children became very familiar with Long Island and developed substantial connections there. Both children developed long-term friendships with other children living on Long Island. They were baptized at wife\u2019s family\u2019s church on Long Island. And both children have celebrated most of their birthdays, Christmas holidays, Easters, and Thanksgivings there. The children, wife testified, \u201cknow New York as their home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Though husband accompanied them to New York at times, usually wife and the children went alone while husband either was working extended hours or was participating in social events related to work. If wife \u201cknew he was going to be on call or if he knew it was going to be a busy week, busy rotation, he would say \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go to New York and spend time with your mom, I\u2019m not going to be around.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Wife and two other witnesses testified that husband had difficulty bonding with his daughter. Husband, moreover, became increasingly distant from wife and the children during the last two years of his residency. He often spent time jogging with another woman. He would also golf, work out with a different woman, or engage in other activities in lieu of spending his limited time off with his family. Wife testified that it bothered her that he was \u201c[s]pending so much time with another woman instead of focusing on his new family. He seemed to have time to do his activities. Instead of including us in activities that we could do with a newborn infant, he found activities to do by himself instead of including us [as] a family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In May 1999, after husband\u2019s residency, the parties moved to Lynchburg, Virginia, where husband became a partner in a local medical practice. When the parties decided to move to Lynchburg, wife explained, they did so \u201cunder the condition that he understood that because it was eight hours away, eight to ten hours away, I would take more frequent trips with our children to New York. And he said that is absolutely no problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Husband began an adulterous affair with one of his employees in January 2000. He continued this relationship for eighteen months, becoming increasingly detached from his family, and ultimately leaving the marital residence in July 2001. About a month after husband moved out of the family residence, he admitted having the affair. Wife filed for divorce on grounds of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Husband requested no overnight visitation with the children for approximately three and a half months after moving out. In October 2001, husband began visitation with the children from 3:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and from 5:30 p.m. Friday evening to 5:00 p.m. Saturday evening. As of August 2002, however, he admitted he maintained no clothes or other materials for the children in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">During the litigation, the parties agreed to joint legal custody of the children with primary physical custody to wife. Wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>stated that she wished to return home with the children to Long Island, New York. In January 2002, husband wrote a letter to wife stating that, while he objected to the move to New York, he was \u201cwilling to agree to a move outside the Lynchburg area, outside the State of Virginia even\u201d if he could see the children \u201cevery other weekend\u201d and \u201c[alternating major holidays and birthdays.\u201d He wanted to have this visitation, however, at his home in Lynchburg. So he asked wife to meet him \u201chalf way for child pick up and drop off\u2019 and to live no further than would be reasonable for the children to \u201cbe expected to sit in the cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The trial court conducted a two-day <em>ore terms </em>hearing, taking evidence from husband, wife, and three witnesses testifying on wife\u2019s behalf (one by <em>de bene esse </em>deposition). Husband called no witnesses to corroborate his testimony. The court found that wife proved husband\u2019s adultery, but nonetheless granted a no-fault divorce given the parties\u2019 twelve-month separation. The chancellor ordered joint legal custody of the children with primary physical custody to wife, in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The trial court also granted wife\u2019s request to move to New York with the children. With regard to visitation, the trial court gave two options depending on whether wife remained in Lynchburg or relocated to New York. In the former case, the court gave husband visitation every other weekend. In the event wife relocated to New York, the court granted husband visitation one weekend a month in Lynchburg, with wife responsible for transportation from New York to Lynchburg. If he desired, husband could have an additional weekend each month in New York at his own expense. Thus, whether wife relocated or not, husband was entitled to a total of two weekends a month with the children. The holiday and vacation visitation schedule remained the same whether or not wife relocated. The chancellor also granted husband four weeks of summer visitation in Lynchburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Husband filed a motion to reconsider. The chancellor reaffirmed his earlier ruling, holding that husband \u201cabdicated to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>great extent the caretaking and rearing of the children to the wife.\u201d Though taking note of husband\u2019s considerably better efforts after the breakup of the family,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the chancellor again made clear his opinion that \u201cfrom all the evidence I\u2019ve heard in this case\u201d the best interests of the children would be served by relocating to Long Island with their mother. The court also pointed out that the \u201carrangements made both by the Court and by the wife to have a continuing contact\u201d between husband and the children were \u201cnot significantly different than the contact he was having when they were living in Lynchburg.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">No Virginia statute specifically addresses relocation of a custodial parent. Though sometimes treated as a special topic, with principles unique to it, the relocation issue is best understood under traditional constructs governing custody and visitation. <em>See Goodhand v. Kildoo, </em>37 Va.App. 591, 599-600, 560 S.E.2d 463, 466-67 (2002). When a trial court has entered a final custody and visitation order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it cannot be modified absent (i) a showing of changed circumstances under Code \u00a7 20-108 and (ii) proof that the child\u2019s best interests under Code \u00a7 20-124.3 will be served by the modification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>When no such order has been issued, the court must only examine the best interests question.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In either case, the chancellor\u2019s decision regarding the relocation of a custodial parent \u201cis a matter of discretion,\u201d which we will not reverse \u201cunless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Knick, </em>38 Va.App. 773, 783, 568 S.E.2d 430, 435 (2002) (quoting <em>Bostick v. Bostick-Bennett, </em>23 Va.App. 527, 533, 478 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1996)); <em>see also Cloutier v. Queen, </em>35 Va.App. 413, 427, 545 S.E.2d 574, 581 (2001). On appeal, we will overturn a decision committed to the chancellor\u2019s sound discretion only upon a showing that he abused that discretion. An abuse of discretion can be found if the \u201ctrial court uses \u2018an improper legal standard in exercising its discretionary function,\u2019 \u201d <em>Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. at 262, 578 S.E.2d at 836 (quoting <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 216, 233, 559 S.E.2d 652, 661 (2002)), because a trial court \u201c \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Shooltz v. Shooltz, </em>27 Va.App. 264, 271, 498 S.E.2d 437, 441 (1998) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)); <em>see also Mughrabi v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 538, 545, 567 S.E.2d 542, 545 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">A trial court also abuses its discretion by failing \u201cto consider the statutory factors required to be part of the decisionmaking process,\u201d <em>Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. at 262, 578 S.E.2d at 836 (citing <em>Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 139, 480 S.E.2d 760, 767 (1997)), or by making \u201cfactual findings that are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 196, 571 S.E.2d 912, 914 (2002)). Even so, we do not \u201cretry the facts or substitute our view of the facts for those of the trial court.\u201d <em>Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. at 266, 578 S.E.2d at 838 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). That is particularly true when a chancellor hears evidence <em>ore tenus. </em>A decree based on such evidence \u201cis entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict\u201d and receives the same deference on appeal. <em>Chesterfield Meadows Shopping </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>Ctr. v. Smith, </em>264 Va. 350, 355, 568 S.E.2d 676, 679 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In this case, the chancellor addressed the relocation issue for purposes of entering a final decree. Not required to find changed circumstances, the trial court properly focused on the best interests of the children. On appeal, husband argues that the chancellor abused his discretion in applying the best interests standard \u2014 claiming that our recent decision in <em>Sullivan, </em>which reversed a trial court relocation order, is \u201cdispositive\u201d of this case and requires the same result here. \u201cIf the current ruling of the trial court is affirmed,\u201d husband argues on brief, \u201cthen this would leave the bar and public with two decisions that are inexplicably directly in contradiction to each other, thus providing no guidance on the law as to future cases on the issue.\u201d Finding <em>Sullivan </em>distinguishable, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>the trial court ordered liberal visitation for the father in its final divorce decree. <em>Sullivan, </em>38 Va.App. at 776, 568 S.E.2d at 432. The father later remarried, purchased a new residence close to his former wife, and filed a change-of-condition petition for even more extensive visitation. The trial court granted this petition. Three months later, the mother announced her intention to remarry and relocate to South Carolina. Father immediately filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and requested a hearing to prevent her from relocating with the parties\u2019 child. <em>Id. </em>at 777, 568 S.E.2d at 432. During the relocation hearing, the mother\u2019s new husband admitted that the \u201c \u2018prime motivation\u2019 for pursuing the move was to locate nearer the [sic] South Carolina residence of his eight-year-old son from a prior marriage, thereby affording him \u2018more involve[ment]\u2019 in the child\u2019s life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 778, 568 S.E.2d at 433. Nothing in the record showed that the relocation would be independently in the best interests of the parties\u2019 child.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>On appeal, we pointed out that the record showed that the father was \u201can exceptionally committed and attentive noncustodial parent\u201d and had \u201cestablished and maintained an \u2018attachment\u2019 or \u2018bond\u2019\u201d with the child that \u201cdemonstrably benefited\u201d the child\u2019s development. <em>Id. </em>at 783, 568 S.E.2d at 435. The requested relocation \u201cwas prompted solely by wife\u2019s marriage\u201d and her new husband\u2019s \u201cdesire to pursue employment and residence in South Carolina to be nearer his child by a prior marriage____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784, 568 S.E.2d at 435. For these reasons, we held that despite the presence of changed circumstances the trial court abused its discretion by artificially conflating the best interests of the custodial wife and her new husband with those of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 784-85, 568 S.E.2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Here, the trial judge directly addressed <em>Sullivan </em>during the motion to reconsider hearing. He found no persuasive parallels between <em>Sullivan </em>and the case before him, and thus, rejected husband\u2019s argument that <em>Sullivan </em>dictated a ruling against the proposed relocation as a matter of law. For five reasons, we concur with the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">First, unlike the father in <em>Sullivan </em>\u2014 who was found to be \u201can exceptionally committed and attentive\u201d parent, <em>id. </em>at 783, 568 S.E.2d at 435 \u2014 the chancellor in our case found that, prior to the separation, husband had \u201cabdicated to a great extent\u201d his parental duties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The functioning family unit during the marriage consisted of wife and the children. Wife had \u201cdevoted her life to taking care of the children,\u201d the chancellor found. Though husband\u2019s parenting improved after the divorce litigation began, his prior history of paternal disinterest could not be overlooked. Code \u00a7 20-124.3(5) requires the chancellor to consider the \u201crole which each parent <em>has played </em>and will play in the future, in the upbringing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>care of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added). This mandatory examination of the historic role each parent has played does not, as husband argues, punish a parent for past failings. It simply stands for the maxim that, sometimes, the most reliable way to gauge a person\u2019s future actions is to examine those of his past. As many courts have observed, one permissible \u201cmeasure of a parent\u2019s future potential is undoubtedly revealed in the parent\u2019s past behavior with the child.\u201d <em>In re Jasmon </em>O., 8 Cal.4th 398, 33 Cal.Rptr.2d 85, 878 P.2d 1297, 1310 (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, did not err in taking account of husband\u2019s prior parental abdication and contrasting it with the dissimilar findings in <em>Sullivan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Second, the child in <em>Sullivan </em>had no connection whatsoever to the area where the mother sought to relocate. In our case, however, husband, wife, and the children have substantial contacts with Long Island. Both sets of paternal and maternal grandparents live on Long Island, and the children have spent many extended vacations visiting family there. They also developed friendships with other children, attended religious services, and spent most of their holidays on Long Island. As their mother put it, the children think of \u201cNew York as their home.\u201d The trial court, therefore, had ample basis to conclude that the children would benefit from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the nurture and support of their extended family in New York, as well as the familiarity of their Long Island community.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Third, the chancellor pointed out that the post-relocation visitation ordered in this case was \u201cnot significantly different than the contact [husband] was having when they were living in Lynchburg.\u201d Nor did husband present any evidence demonstrating that the frequency of post-relocation visitation would be detrimental to the best interests of the children. To be sure, husband conceded before trial that a visitation schedule of \u201cevery other weekend\u201d and \u201c[alternating major holidays and birthdays\u201d would be acceptable so long as he could enjoy that visitation at his home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If nothing else, this concession belies his assertion on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering two weekends a month visitation (one in Lynchburg at wife\u2019s expense, the other in New York at husband\u2019s expense) and evenly dividing the holiday schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">On the issue of the frequency of post-relocation visitation, the facts of <em>Sullivan </em>were considerably different. There, expert psychological testimony established that the amount and frequency of post-relocation visitation were \u201cnot optimal\u201d and differed so greatly from the prior schedule that the change could have a negative effect on the emotional well-being of the child. <em>Sullivan, </em>38 Va.App. at 779, 568 S.E.2d at 433. The child in <em>Sullivan, </em>the psychologist testified, would be better off with regular and frequent contacts with the father rather than \u201cinfrequent contacts of longer duration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Fourth, on the issue of distance, we again see no conflict between the chancellor\u2019s decision in this case and our holding in <em>Sullivan. </em>As <em>Sullivan </em>made clear, distance \u201cshould not be the sole basis for restricting a custodial parent\u2019s residence <em>except </em>where the benefits of the relationship cannot be substantially maintained if the child is moved away from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>the non-custodial parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 783, 568 S.E.2d at 435 (quoting <em>Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, </em>2 Va.App. 571, 574, 347 S.E.2d 149, 151 (1986)) (emphasis in original). In this respect, the \u201c \u2018added difficulty in maintaining the parental relationship is not unique\u2019 but \u2018common to all parents whose children live some distance away.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the evidence before the chancellor demonstrated that husband had both the job flexibility and the financial resources to maintain visitation with the children in New York. The trial court, therefore, did not err in concluding that the \u201cbenefits of the relationship\u201d between husband and his children could be \u201csubstantially maintained\u201d after their relocation. <em>Sullivan, </em>38 Va.App. at 783, 568 S.E.2d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Finally, we do not accept husband\u2019s assertion that the chancellor confused what was in wife\u2019s best interests with what was in her children\u2019s best interests under the so-called \u201cunity of interest\u201d approach expressly rejected in <em>Cloutier, </em>35 Va.App. at 430, 545 S.E.2d at 583, and implicitly rejected in <em>Sullivan, </em>38 Va.App. at 784-85, 568 S.E.2d at 436. In his resolution of the issues, the chancellor weighed the quality and consistency of the nurturance the children would receive in New York with their extended family and reaffirmed that his decision rested solely on the best interests of the children. That the relocation also benefited wife, he reasoned, did not \u201cnecessarily\u201d conflict with the children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">We find the chancellor\u2019s reasoning sound. A trial court may consider a benefit to the custodial parent from relocation so long as the \u201cmove independently benefits the children.\u201d <em>Cloutier, </em>35 Va.App. at 430, 545 S.E.2d at 583. To be sure, as we acknowledged in <em>Sullivan, </em>\u201cadvantages accruing to a custodial parent from relocation <em>oftentimes </em>inure to the benefit of a child\u201d and should be taken into account. <em>Sullivan, </em>38 Va.App. at 784, 568 S.E.2d at 436 (emphasis added). These inuring advantages must then be weighed against the possibility of \u201cdeleterious effects,\u201d particularly any adverse impact on \u201cthe relationship between the child and non-custodial parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the record demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>strates that the chancellor weighed the benefits and harms consistent with the teachings of <em>Cloutier </em>and <em>Sullivan. </em>We thus find unconvincing husband\u2019s argument that the chancellor erroneously fused wife\u2019s interests with those of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In sum, we hold that the chancellor did not abuse his discretion by permitting wife to move with her children to Long Island, New York. We defer to the trial judge\u2019s view of the best interests of the children, finding that he applied the proper legal standard and rested his decision on a sufficient factual basis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">. The chancellor noted that husband \u201cprobably has spent more time with [the children] after the separation than he had before.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. Prior to the final decree, husband had been seeing his children for a few hours each Wednesday afternoon and for one day and night per weekend (from 5:30 p.m. on Friday to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday). His post-relocation proposal, put forward in his January 2002 letter, requested two full weekends a month at his home in Lynchburg with no weekday visits. The trial court\u2019s final order authorized two weekends a month (one in Lynchburg, the other in New York) and four weeks of summer visitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-9\">. By statute, <em>pendente lite </em>orders entered by trial courts prior to a final decree have \"no presumptive effect and shall not be determinative when adjudicating the underlying cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-103(E); <em>see also Shackelford v.
