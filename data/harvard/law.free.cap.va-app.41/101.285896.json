On appeal, Slayton challenges only the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial suppression motion. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">\u201cOn appeal from a denial of a suppression motion, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Barkley v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 682, 687, 576 S.E.2d 234, 236 (2003); <em>see also Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 470, 475, 525 S.E.2d 921, 924 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">On November 30, 2001, Slayton was a passenger in a vehicle traveling in a high crime area in Halifax County. Deputies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Jimmy Clay and Craig Spencer stopped the vehicle for failure to display a county decal. Spencer approached the vehicle\u2019s passenger side while Clay issued a summons to the driver. From his vantage point, Spencer was able to see several bullets in the vehicle\u2019s open glove box. The sheriffs department had been investigating a number of shootings in the area involving rifles and the bullets in the glove box appeared to Spencer \u201cto be rifle bullets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">After issuing the summons for the decal, Deputy Clay asked the driver for consent to search the vehicle. The driver consented and Slayton exited the passenger seat of the vehicle. At that point, Deputy Spencer noticed that \u201cSlayton\u2019s \u2018long mid-thigh\u2019 winter coat was \u2018cockeyed\u2019 and that there was \u2018something\u2019 in the right pocket.\u201d Spencer asked Slayton if he was carrying a weapon. Slayton \u201cshook his head, no.\u201d Nonetheless fearing for his safety, Spencer initiated a limited weapons pat-down, beginning with Slayton\u2019s left side and then working over to his right side. As Spencer inspected Slay-ton\u2019s right side, he saw what appeared to be the butt of a handgun with a shell clip in it protruding from the pocket \u201ca couple of inches.\u201d Except for the portion of the butt sticking out of Slayton\u2019s pocket, the remainder of the weapon could not be seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">While removing the handgun, Spencer \u201ccould hear it hit something else in the pocket.\u201d Spencer retrieved the other object from Slayton\u2019s pocket, which turned out to be a pill bottle containing nine rocks of crack cocaine. Immediately thereafter, Spencer placed Slayton under arrest for possession of crack cocaine and the simultaneous possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">At trial, Slayton moved to suppress the crack cocaine claiming that (i) Deputy Spencer did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion warranting the initial pat-down, and, in any event, (ii) the search exceeded the permissible scope of a weapons frisk when Deputy Spencer removed the canister from Slayton\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The trial court denied the suppression motion, finding that the totality of the circumstances (the presence of bullets in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>open view, the recent history of violence, the reputation of the location as a \u201chigh crime area\u201d notorious for drug transactions, the possibility of a weapon causing Slayton\u2019s coat pocket to droop down, and the presence of an unknown object in the same pocket as the firearm) provided sufficient justification for Deputy Spencer\u2019s removal of both the firearm and the pill bottle from Slayton\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u201cThough the ultimate question whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment triggers <em>de novo </em>scrutiny, we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of \u2018historical fact\u2019 and give \u2018due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u2019\u201d <em>Barkley, </em>39 Va.App. at 689-90, 576 S.E.2d at 237-38 (citations omitted). Thus, we must give \u201cdeference to the factual findings of the trial court\u201d and \u201cindependently determine\u201d whether those findings satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Whitfield v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 358, 361, 576 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2003). To prevail on appeal, \u201cthe defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was reversible error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">On appeal, Slayton concedes that \u201cDeputy Spencer was entitled to conduct a limited pat-down search of the defendant for weapons.\u201d Slayton argues, however, that the subsequent removal of the pill bottle containing crack cocaine violated the Fourth Amendment. Slayton acknowledges the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the warrant requirement, but contends it does not apply here because (i) Deputy Spencer had no probable cause to arrest Slayton for carrying a concealed weapon, and (ii) even if probable cause existed, Spencer\u2019s failure to arrest Slayton on that particular charge precludes it from being a basis for the incidental search. For the following reasons, we disagree with both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">We begin with probable cause, which \u201cas the very name implies, deals with probabilities. These are not techni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>cal; they are the factual and practical considerations in every day life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d <em>Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 421, 410 S.E.2d 662, 666 (1991) (citation omitted). \u201cProbable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer\u2019s knowledge and of which he has reasonable trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense had been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Purdie v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 178, 185, 549 S.E.2d 33, 37 (2001) (quoting <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 229, 231, 443 S.E.2d 189, 190 (1994)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Al-Karrien v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 35, 47, 561 S.E.2d 747, 753 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Probable cause relies on a \u201cflexible, common-sense standard\u201d \u2014 one that does not \u201cdemand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.\u201d <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1543, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the standard \u201cdoes not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cLong before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain common-sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same \u2014 and so are law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, \u201cin determining whether probable cause exists, the evidence \u2018must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gomez v. Atkins, </em>296 F.3d 253, 262 (4th C5r.2002) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 232, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2329, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Under this standard, Deputy Spencer had probable cause to believe Slayton was carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308. Except for a \u201ccouple of inches\u201d of the butt of the handgun protruding from Slayton\u2019s pocket, the rest of the weapon was completely hidden. And even those \u201ccouple of inches\u201d were observed by Deputy Spencer only during the close-quarters encounter of a weapons frisk, not beforehand. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>A reasonable probability exists, therefore, that Slayton\u2019s firearm \u2014 both at the time of the pat-down and during the few moments immediately preceding it \u2014 was \u201chidden from all except those with an unusual or exceptional opportunity\u201d to observe it. <em>Winston v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 746, 756, 497 S.E.2d 141, 146 (1998) (quoting <em>Main v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 370, 372-73, 457 S.E.2d 400, 402 (1995) <em>(en banc)). </em>An equally reasonable probability supports the inference that Slayton, having lied about having a firearm on him when directly questioned by Deputy Spencer, did not possess a permit issued under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(D) authorizing him to carry a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Slayton disagrees, arguing that the firearm was not hidden from common observation because Deputy Spencer observed a portion of the butt protruding from Slayton\u2019s pocket and immediately knew it to be a handgun. Anyone else observing Slayton from that vantage point, he contends, might likewise have seen it. As a result, Slayton reasons, the evidence would not have been sufficient to support a conviction under \u00a7 18.2-308. Perhaps so \u2014 but that misses the point. \u201cThe substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt. And this means less than evidence which would justify condemnation or conviction.\u201d <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1312, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In other words, even though probable cause means more than a \u201cmere suspicion,\u201d it is not necessary for the facts to be \u201csufficient to convict\u201d the accused of the offense. <em>Gomez, </em>296 F.3d at 262 (quoting <em>Taylor v. Waters, </em>81 F.3d 429, 434 (4th Cir.1996)). Unlike a factfinder at trial, \u201creasonable law officers need not \u2018resolve every doubt about a suspect\u2019s guilt before probable cause is established.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Torchinsky v. Siwinski, </em>942 F.2d 257, 260 (4th Cir.1991)). We reject, therefore, Slayton\u2019s assertion that the alleged insufficiency of the evidence for a conviction necessarily precludes a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Because Deputy Spencer had probable cause to believe Slayton illegally possessed a concealed weapon, Spencer had authority both to arrest Slayton and to search him incident to that arrest. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S.Ct. 467, 471, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (\u201cIt is well settled that a search incident to a lawful arrest is a traditional exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d); <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 492, 545 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001); <em>Ross v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 103, 105, 542 S.E.2d 819, 820 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It matters not that the search preceded the actual arrest so long as probable cause existed at the time of the search. <em>McCracken v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 254, 261, 572 S.E.2d 493, 496 (2002) <em>(en banc). </em>Once \u201cprobable cause exists to arrest a person, a constitutionally permissible search of the person incident to arrest may be conducted by an officer <em>either before or after </em>the arrest if the search is contemporaneous with the arrest.\u201d <em>Italiano v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 334, 336, 200 S.E.2d 526, 528 (1973) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Slayton also argues that even if probable cause existed for a concealed weapons violation, that was not the ground on which he was arrested. The search-incident-to-arrest doctrine, he reasons, simply does not apply. The argument has some intuitive appeal, but only if one assumes a subjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>standard governs the probable cause test. Probable cause, however, turns only on \u201c \u2018objective facts,\u2019 not the \u2018subjective opinion\u2019 of a police officer.\u201d <em>Golden v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 618, 625, 519 S.E.2d 378, 381 (1999) (citations omitted). As a result, \u201cthe fact that the officer does not have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which provide the legal justification for the officer\u2019s action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action.\u201d <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (quoting <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 138, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The absence of probable cause to believe a suspect committed the particular crime for which he was arrested does not necessarily invalidate the arrest if the officer possessed sufficient objective information to support an arrest on a different charge. <em>See Golden, </em>30 Va.App. at 625, 519 S.E.2d at 381; <em>McGuire v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 584, 596-97, 525 S.E.2d 43, 49 (2000). This principle merely recognizes the settled rule that the \u201cvalidity of an arrest is normally gauged by an objective standard rather than by inquiry into the officer\u2019s presumed motives.\u201d <em>Limonja v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 532, 538, 383 S.E.2d 476, 480 (1989) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). For this reason, the fact that Slayton was arrested under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-248 (cocaine possession) and 18.2-308.4(A) (possession of firearm and cocaine simultaneously), rather than under Code \u00a7 18.2-308 (possession of a concealed weapon), does not preclude the concealed weapon basis for Slayton\u2019s search incident to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In sum, the trial court did not err by denying Slayton\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Deputy Spencer had probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>arrest Slayton for a concealed weapon offense as well as the concomitant right to conduct a search incident to that arrest. It is legally irrelevant that, upon the discovery of the pill bottle containing suspected cocaine, Spencer chose not to charge Slayton with the lesser concealed-weapon violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">. \"It is axiomatic,\u201d however, \"that an incident search may not precede an arrest and serve as part of its justification.\u201d <em>Smith v. Ohio, </em>494 U.S. 541, 543, 110 S.Ct. 1288, 1290, 108 L.Ed.2d 464 (1990) (quoting <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 63, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1902, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968)); <em>see also Henry v.

In other words, \"the legality of the arrest cannot depend on the search.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Han, </em>74 F.3d 537, 541 (4th Cir.1996).
