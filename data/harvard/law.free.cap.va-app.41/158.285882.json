All the events were alleged to have occurred in 1969 under statutes that have since been recodified and amended. In a pretrial pleading and at a pretrial hearing, Pilcher\u2019s attorney contended that the rape shield law was <em>ex post facto </em>because \u201cthe law of evidence must be the law in effect in 1969.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>At trial, one of Pilcher\u2019s daughters testified that in October 1969, when she was six years old, Pilcher was in bed with her and touched between her legs. While playing with her, he \u201cput his penis inside her,\u201d said he was only trying to \u201cteach\u201d her what girls do, and told her the incident was their secret. She also testified that a few weeks prior to this incident, Pilcher asked her to go to the basement with him. There, he touched her vaginal area and inserted his fingers in her.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">During cross-examination of the daughter, the following incidents occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">Q: And, as a matter of fact, your hymen was broken when you had sexual relations with Tom ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: I have a right to show that she is lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: This is absolutely inadmissible and [he] knows it. Judge, the Rape Shield Statute is very clear on this issue. No motion has been filed and no hearing has been had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">[JUDGE]: I sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: You mean I can\u2019t ask her about when she did first have sexual relations, and she is testifying that she had them with my man? I don\u2019t understand the nature of the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">[JUDGE]: ... you understand the Rape Shield law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeZ\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Well, that doesn\u2019t apply here. This was before the Rape Shield law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">[JUDGE]: It is procedure now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">[JUDGE]: The motion is sustained.... You can\u2019t get into this area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">At the conclusion of the evidence the trial judge convicted Pilcher of rape of a child and of putting his hands against the sexual parts of a child, as charged in the indictments. The judge acquitted Pilcher of the charge of carnal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Constitution of the United States, Article 1, \u00a7 10, and the Constitution of Virginia, Article 1, \u00a7 9, prohibit the General Assembly from enacting <em>ex post facto </em>laws. The United States Supreme Court has traditionally recognized four categories of <em>ex post facto </em>criminal laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was <em>innocent </em>when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that <em>aggravates a crime, </em>or makes it <em>greater </em>than it was when committed. 3d. Every law that <em>changes the punishment, </em>and inflicts a <em>greater punishment, </em>than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the <em>legal </em>rules of <em>evidence, </em>and receives less, or different, testimony, then the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, <em>in order to convict the offender.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\"><em>Calder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. 386, 390, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798). <em>See also Collins v. Youngblood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 42, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2719, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u201cIt is equally well settled, however, that \u2018[t]he inhibition upon the passage of <em>ex post facto </em>laws does not give a [defendant] a right to be tried, in all respects, by the law in force when the crime charged was committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 293, 97 S.Ct. 2290, 2298, 53 L.Ed.2d 344 (1977) (citations omitted). In addition, the Court has held that no <em>ex post facto </em>violation occurs if the change effected by the law is merely procedural and does \u201cnot increase the punishment nor change the ingredients of the offence or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt.\u201d <em>Hopt v. Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 590, 4 S.Ct. 202, 210, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884). For example, in <em>Dobbert, </em>the Supreme Court cited the following example of a procedural change that was not considered <em>ex post facto </em>even though it worked to the disadvantage of a defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As9\">[I]n <em>Hopt v. Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 4 S.Ct. 202, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884), as of the date of the alleged homicide a convicted felon could not have been called as a witness. Subsequent to that date, but prior to the trial of the case, this law was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>changed; a convicted felon was called to the stand and testified, implicating Hopt in the crime charged against him. Even though this change in the law obviously had a detrimental impact upon the defendant, the Court found that the law was not <em>ex post facto </em>because it neither made criminal a theretofore innocent act, nor aggravated a crime previously committed, nor provided greater punishment, nor changed the proof necessary to convict. <em>Id., </em>at 589 [4 S.Ct. at 210].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1F\"><em>Dobbert, </em>432 U.S. at 293, 97 S.Ct. at 2290. In other words, although it is possible for retroactive application of a procedural law to violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause, a violation only occurs when one of the four recognized categories of <em>ex post facto </em>law is implicated. <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">At trial, Pilcher\u2019s attorney argued that the \u201crape shield\u201d law was an <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition against his use of impeachment evidence. He also argued that the statutory requirements \u2014 that the party offering evidence file a written notice describing the evidence and that the judge conduct an evidentiary hearing \u2014 change the rules of evidence. Thus, Pilcher contends that application of the rape shield law in this prosecution was <em>ex post facto </em>because it changed the rules of evidence in effect in 1969.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also contends that, were it not for the rape shield law, he could have proved his daughter did not have sexual intercourse until she was sixteen and, thus, lied at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In pertinent part, the pretrial discussions concerning these issues included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">[PILCHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: [W]e are talking about rules of evidence, if you can show that someone else had sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>intercourse with this [child] and not [Pilcher], then that shows she is lying, and the case is <em>Dotson v. Commonwealth </em>[170 Va. 630, 196 S.E. 623 (1938)]. It is a case in Virginia under the old law which deals with the fact that you can show it for credibility, even though it is not an issue, and ... I mean it otherwise has to be relevant and admissible, but to the extent it is relevant and admissible, this Rape Shield Statute seems to make it excludable. It is a defense that a person has, and it is a defense that he would have had, if ... otherwise ... it [is] admissible, that they are trying to pass a new law to exclude, and that is what the <em>ex post facto </em>says you can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">So I mean what I introduce may or may not be admissible at the time of the trial, ... we don\u2019t even know what is coming up. I mean they don\u2019t really know what we are going to ask her on cross examination ... until it happens, but the thing is that from the point of view of the Rape Shield law, that has no applicability; that is all I am saying. The Rape Shield law is ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">[THE COURT]: Well, what is it that you think you are going to ask her that is going to allow you to use testimony of somebody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">[PILCHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I am not so sure, but other sexual encounters not with [Pilcher], that he didn\u2019t ever have sexual intercourse with her. I contend [Pilcher] never had sexual intercourse with her, ever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">And some of the questions could, maybe won\u2019t, but could go into other sexual encounters with other people, and that is admissible under <em>Dotson </em>... even though under fifteen and so forth there is no consent. That is not an issue, but you can still show it for credibility, and that case is right smack on point and holds that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">My only issue here is that the Rape Shield Statute wouldn\u2019t bar me if I am otherwise going to use it, and that is just clear. It is on all fours, and that other case holds that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Well, Judge, I absolutely disagree. I think the Rape Shield Statute, it does not preclude the production of that evidence or the admission of that evidence. What it does is it requires the Defendant to have a hearing ahead of time so that the Court can determine what the evidence is before it is put in front of a Jury. The effect of it is to attempt to avoid mistrials and to attempt to avoid Juries from hearing evidence which is inadmissible____It is a pre-screening device, effectively, particularly as to sexual relations with third parties. The statute specifically made those inadmissible where they were, according to the Court in <em>Winfield [v. Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 211, 301 S.E.2d 15, (1983),] inadmissible prior to that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">[THE COURT]: You all are taking the opposite positions, if I understand it. You are saying that with the statute he can get it in, and he says with the statute he can\u2019t get it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aib\">[PROSECUTOR]: With the statute he can get it in, but he has to make a showing of relevance in a hearing prior to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">[PILCHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well, that still changes the rule of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: What I am trying to avoid is a situation in which the witness is asked questions about her prior sexual history without having any idea whether it is objectionable because there has been no hearing ahead of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjHK\">[THE COURT]: Well, what we will do, you will put her on on direct, see what she says, and we will take a recess, see what you are going to ask her, and then I will rule on whether you can ask her or you can\u2019t ask her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">[PILCHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: ... I am just trying to get this straight, insofar as the pre-trial argument is concerned, that is an evidentiary procedure that we didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t use to have to disclose that, what we are going to do at the trial under the old rule. That changes the rule of evidence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">In <em>Carmell v. Texas, </em>529 U.S. 513, 529, 120 S.Ct. 1620, 1631, 146 L.Ed.2d 577 (2000), the Supreme Court held that a law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>was <em>ex post facto </em>when it \u201cchanged the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a conviction ... [such that] under the new law, petitioner could be (and was) convicted on the victim\u2019s testimony alone, without any corroborating evidence.\u201d Reversing the conviction, the Court ruled that the Texas statute, which changed the law, was \u201ca sufficiency of the evidence rule ... [and] does not merely \u2018regulat[e] ... the mode in which the facts constituting guilt may be placed before the jury.\u2019 \u201d 529 U.S. at 545, 120 S.Ct. at 1620 (citation omitted). In so ruling, however, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he issue of the admissibility of evidence is simply different from the question whether the properly admitted evidence is sufficient to convict the defendant. Evidence admissibility rules do not go to the general issue of guilt____\u201d 529 U.S. at 546, 120 S.Ct. at 1640. \u201c[I]t is now well settled that statutory changes in the mode of trial or the rules of evidence, which do not deprive the accused of a defense and which operate only in a limited and unsubstantial manner to his disadvantage, are not prohibited.\u201d <em>Beazell v. Ohio, </em>269 U.S. 167, 170, 46 S.Ct. 68, 69, 70 L.Ed. 216 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">As the Supreme Court of Virginia has noted, the \u201crape shield\u201d law was adopted to \u201climit or prohibit the admission of general reputation evidence as to the prior unchastity of the complaining witness, but ... [to] permit the introduction of evidence of specific acts of sexual conduct between the complaining witness and third persons in carefully limited circumstances.\u201d <em>Winfield, </em>225 Va. at 218, 301 S.E.2d at 19. Indeed, the Court further observed that the \u201claw gives a defendant access for the first time to far more probative evidence: specific prior sexual conduct with third persons, if it is relevant for the purposes set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7.\u201d <em>Winfield, </em>225 Va. at 220, 301 S.E.2d at 20. Thus, to the extent that Pilcher contends the statutory change affects the rules of evidence, we note that the United States Supreme Court also has held that \u201cthe prescribing of different modes or procedure ..., leaving untouched all the substantial protections with which the existing law surrounds the person accused of crime, are not considered within the constitutional inhibition.\u201d <em>Dun </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>can v. Missouri, </em>152 U.S. 377, 382-83, 14 S.Ct. 570, 572, 38 L.Ed. 485 (1894). Likewise, \u201c[s]o far as mere modes of procedure are concerned a party has no more right, in a criminal than in a civil action, to insist that his case shall be disposed of under the law in force when the act to be investigated is charged to have taken place.\u201d <em>Mallett v. North Carolina, </em>181 U.S. 589, 596-97, 21 S.Ct. 730, 733, 45 L.Ed. 1015 (1901) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Applying these <em>ex post facto </em>principles to this case, we hold that Pilcher has not demonstrated that the statute affected his substantive rights, and we further hold that it is not an <em>ex post facto </em>law as applied in this case. In so holding, we note that courts of other jurisdictions, when confronted with similar <em>ex post facto </em>arguments regarding rape shield statutes, have reached the same result. <em>See Turley v. State, </em>356 So.2d 1238, 1243-44 (Ala.App.1978) (holding that a rape shield statute was not <em>ex post facto </em>when it barred evidence of a prior sexual relationship that was admissible before enactment of the statute); <em>People v. Dorff, </em>77 Ill.App.3d 882, 885-86, 33 Ill.Dec. 300, 396 N.E.2d 827 (1979) (holding that a statute is not <em>ex post facto </em>when it created an \u201calteration in rules of evidence ... [, which] served only to prevent use of certain evidence relating to the alleged victim\u2019s credibility, and had no bearing upon evidence relating to the crime itself\u2019); <em>Finney v. State, </em>179 Ind.App. 316, 385 N.E.2d 477, 480-81 (1979) (holding that the \u201crape shield statute affects the use of character evidence to impeach witnesses ... and is therefore procedural in nature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We further note that in response to Pilcher\u2019s pretrial argument, the prosecutor suggested \u201cthat the rape shield statute ... does not preclude ... the admission of that evidence ... [if] he has [made] a showing of relevance in a hearing prior to the case.\u201d Recognizing that Pilcher\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor voiced \u201copposite positions on this matter,\u201d the trial judge ruled that after the witness testified on direct examination, he would consider at \u201ca recess ... what [Pilcher\u2019s attorney is] going to ask her, and then ... will rule on whether [Pilcher\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>attorney] can ask her\u201d that line of questions. The record reflects that Pilcher did not request a recess and did not make the requisite showing of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We explicitly do not decide whether the evidence Pilcher wanted to introduce was barred by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 or fell within the rules announced in <em>Dotson. </em>That issue is not before us. Although it is unclear whether the trial judge would have admitted the evidence had Pilcher requested a preliminary hearing, the absence of such a hearing is the most direct cause of the exclusion. Indeed, Pilcher specifically notes in his brief that, \u201c[w]hile an argument can be made that the sustaining of the objection on cross-examining the prosecutrix denied Pilcher the constitutional right to present evidence in his own behalf, the Court need not consider that issue.\u201d Thus, despite Pilcher\u2019s suggestion that Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 barred the evidence, the real cause of the exclusion in this case was his failure to follow the statute\u2019s procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In summary, we hold that the procedural change wrought by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 does not implicate the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. As the Supreme Court held long ago,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU4\">alterations which do not increase the punishment, nor change the ingredients of the offence or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt ... <em>relate to modes of procedure only, </em>in which no one can be said to have a vested right, and which the State, upon grounds of public policy, may regulate at pleasure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\"><em>Hopt, </em>110 U.S. at 590, 4 S.Ct. at 210 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-12\">. The following statute is generally referred to as the \"rape shield law\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arj\">A.

If such evidence relates to the past sexual conduct of the complaining witness with a person other than the accused, it shall not be admitted and may not be referred to at any preliminary hearing or trial unless the party offering same files a written notice generally describing the evidence prior to the introduction of any evidence, or the opening statement of either counsel, whichever first occurs, at the preliminary hearing or trial at which the admission of the evidence may be sought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATas\">C.

If the court determines that the evidence meets the requirements of subsections A and B of this section, it shall be admissible before the judge or jury trying the case in the ordinary course of the preliminary hearing or trial.
