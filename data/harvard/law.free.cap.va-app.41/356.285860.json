We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The material facts underlying this case are not in dispute. On April 3, 2001, Peyton was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. On July 12, 2001, the trial court sentenced him to 10 years in prison and suspended 7 years. The trial court further ordered that Peyton be evaluated for participation in an alternative sentencing program pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2. Peyton was accepted into the program, and the trial court suspended the balance of his sentence on the condition that he complete the program. On October 1, 2001, he was transferred from local confinement to a detention center in accordance with the alternative sentencing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In January 2002, Peyton began vomiting blood while at the detention center and was taken to the hospital. He had approximately one month remaining in the program. Peyton was discharged from the detention center program on January 15, 2002 due to \u201cmedical/psychological reasons.\u201d In a show cause proceeding on February' 7, 2002, the trial court determined that Peyton had violated the terms of his suspended sentence by not completing the program and imposed the original three-year active sentence, with credit for time served. The trial court stated that Peyton\u2019s participation in the detention center program \u201cdidn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">On appeal, Peyton argues the trial court abused its discretion in revoking his suspended sentence, on the ground his discharge from the detention center was not due to his willful conduct or behavior. We find his contention without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u201cA trial court has broad discretion to revoke a suspended sentence and probation based on Code \u00a7 19.2-306, which allows a court to do so \u2018for any cause deemed by it sufficient.\u2019 The court\u2019s findings of fact and judgment will not be reversed unless there is a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 81, 86, 402 S.E.2d 684, 687 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(1991) (citations omitted). Furthermore, the trial court \u201c \u2018undoubtedly has the power to revoke [the suspension of a sentence] when the defendant has failed to comply with the conditions of the suspension.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russnak v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 317, 321, 392 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1990) (quoting <em>Griffin v. Cunningham, </em>205 Va. 349, 354, 136 S.E.2d 840, 844 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A) authorizes courts to \u201cconsider[ ]\u201d committing certain non-violent felons to a detention center in lieu of an active period of incarceration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The detention centers operate as part of the Department of Corrections, pursuant to Code \u00a7 53.1-67.7. Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(2) requires a prospective participant to meet certain physical and emotional requirements as a condition for acceptance and participation in the program. Satisfying these requirements is a prerequisite to the Department\u2019s recommendation that the trial court commit the defendant to the program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4) further provides: \u201cUpon a finding that the defendant ... was removed from the program by the Department for intractable behavior ... the court may revoke all or a part of the probation and suspended sentence----\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>816.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defines <em>\u201cIntractable behavior,\u201d </em>in part, as: \u201cbehavior which, in the determination of the Department of Corrections, (i) indicates an inmate\u2019s unwillingness or inability to conform his behavior to that necessary to his successful completion of the program[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Applying these statutory provisions to the case at bar, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Peyton\u2019s commitment to the detention center and his suspended sentence. Code \u00a7 19.2-316.1 does not provide that an inmate\u2019s \u201cunwillingness\u201d to continue the program is the sole or exclusive reason warranting removal from a detention center program and the revocation of a suspended sentence pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4). The Code also provides that an inmate\u2019s \u201cinability\u201d to conform his behavior to program requirements will justify his removal from the program and the revocation of a suspended sentence. Code \u00a7 19.2-316.1. Moreover, Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(2) provides that a \u201cdetermination that ... [a] defendant is physically ... suited for the program\u201d is a prerequisite to being recommended or accepted into the program. When, subsequently, a defendant can no longer meet the initial requirements for participation, and is no longer \u201cphysically suited\u201d for the detention program, neither the program nor the court is required to continue him in the program. Where, as here, participation in a detention center program is a required condition under Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A) to qualify a nonviolent felon for diversion in lieu of incarceration, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking the suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Peyton began vomiting blood in January 2002, while he was in the program, and had to be taken to the hospital. When he returned from the hospital, he continued to have abdominal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>pain. Shortly thereafter, the Department of Corrections discharged him from the detention center for \u201cmedieal/psychological reasons.\u201d From this evidence, the trial court concluded that the Department of Corrections had determined Peyton no longer met the physical requirements for participation in the program and, thus, did not have the ability to conform his behavior to that necessary to complete the program. The trial court acted within its discretion under Code \u00a7 19.2-S16.2(A) when it revoked Peyton\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Peyton relies on our holding in <em>Duff v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 293, 429 S.E.2d 465 (1993), to support his contention that \u201cif noncompliance [with the terms of the suspended sentence] is not willful, revocation is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Duff </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar because the suspended sentence in <em>Duff </em>did not involve the application of express statutory provisions establishing specific criteria to qualify for diversion rather than incarceration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4) requires willful conduct in order to justify revocation of a suspended sentence was not at issue in <em>Duff </em>and Peyton\u2019s reliance on it is, therefore, misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Peyton further argues that the trial court abused its discretion in revoking the suspended sentence because the trial court erroneously believed it was required to impose Peyton\u2019s original sentence. We disagree with this contention. Assuming the trial judge was unaware that he had the discretion to continue the suspended sentence he earlier imposed, Peyton explicitly informed him of that principle during the motion to reconsider. After the trial court revoked Peyton\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>suspended sentence, Peyton made a motion to reconsider, in which he specifically stated to the court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">I wanted to make sure that I had done my job and noted that he is before you \"with, or had been before you with ten years suspended and that this court had the power and the jurisdiction not to impose any of that, not to revoke any of that suspended sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">After hearing the motion, the trial judge stated, \u201c[H]e gets the three year sentence. That\u2019s plain and simple. Same as last time ... I don\u2019t have any different feeling about it.\u201d The trial judge considered the argument and responded that his decision remained the same. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">. Code\u00a7 19.2-316.2(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">A defendant who otherwise would have been sentenced to incarceration for a nonviolent felony as defined in \u00a7 19.2-316.1 or who has been previously incarcerated for a nonviolent felony as defined in \u00a7 19.2-316.1 but otherwise meets the following criteria and (i) who is determined by the court to need more security or supervision than provided by the diversion center incarceration program under \u00a7 53.1-67.7, (ii) whose age or physical condition disqualifies him from the Boot Camp Incarceration Program under \u00a7 53.1-67.1, and (iii) who can benefit from a regimented environment and structured program, may be considered for commitment to a detention center established under \u00a7 53.1-67.8____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\">.

Code \u00a7 19.2-316.1 specifically addresses the \"Boot Camp Incarceration Program\u201d while \u00a7 19.2-316.2 addresses the \"Detention Center Incarceration Program.\u201d Both sections use the phrase \"intractable behavior,\" as a ground for removal from the programs. The phrase is only defined in \u00a7 19.2-316.1. Thus, we have cited to \u00a7 19.2-316.1 for purposes of defining \u201cintractable behavior,\u201d despite the fact that Peyton entered a detention center program pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-316.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">. In <em>Duff, </em>the defendant was convicted of embezzlement and received a partially suspended sentence, on the condition that he make restitution payments. When he failed to comply with the restitution condition, the trial court revoked his suspended sentence. The evidence established that the defendant\u2019s failure to make restitution payments resulted from various financial setbacks and was not \"willful.\u201d Accordingly, we reversed the trial court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, on the ground that the revocation was unreasonable. <em>Duff, </em>16 Va.App. at 298, 429 S.E.2d at 468.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b406-8\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u201cAlthough the power of the court to revoke a suspended sentence granted by ... [Code \u00a7 19.2-306] is broad, it is not without limitation.\u201d <em>Duff v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 293, 297, 429 S.E.2d 465, 467 (1993). By well established rules of decision \u201c \u2018[t]he cause deemed by the court to be sufficient for revoking a suspension must be a reasonable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we have held that \u201ca reasonable failure to [conform to the condition of the suspension] negates a reasonable cause to revoke a suspended sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 429 S.E.2d at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">The evidence established that the trial judge suspended Peyton\u2019s prison sentence for a non-violent crime on the condition that he participate in an alternative detention program. Peyton was accepted in the program and successfully completed three months of the program. A month before he would have finished the program, Peyton began to develop abdominal pains and was discharged from the program. The trial judge indicated it \u201csounds like ulcers.\u201d Although the trial judge found that he did not question Peyton\u2019s sincerity or desire to finish the program, he nevertheless revoked Peyton\u2019s suspended sentence and ordered him to prison, noting \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I can do ... it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The statute governing the detention program contains the following proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">Upon the defendant\u2019s (i) voluntary withdrawal from the program, (ii) removal from the program by the Department for intractable behavior as defined in \u00a7 19.2-316.1, or (iii) failure to comply with the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall cause the defendant to show cause why his probation and suspension of sentence should not be revoked. Upon a finding that the defendant voluntarily withdrew from the program, was removed from the program by the Department for intractable behavior, or failed to comply with the terms and conditions of probation, the court may revoke all or part of the probation and suspended sentence and commit the defendant as otherwise provided in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">I would hold that the trial judge abused his discretion by revoking the suspended sentence and ordering Peyton to prison. The record does not establish the existence of any of the statutory conditions that would support the revocation of the suspended sentence. Peyton demonstrated neither intractable behavior nor an unwillingness or refusal to finish the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In <em>Duff, </em>we reversed the trial judge\u2019s revocation of a suspended sentence because the evidence proved that Duffs \u201cfailure to pay the restitution resulted from an inability to pay it rather than an unwillingness or refusal to do so.\u201d 16 Va.App. at 296, 429 S.E.2d at 466. We reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvJ\">[T]he trial court\u2019s determination that Duffs failure to pay the restitution was neither willful nor the result of fraudulently secreting funds precludes a determination that his failure to pay the restitution was unreasonable. Rather, the court\u2019s determination inexorably leads to the conclusion that Duff simply did not have the ability to pay the restitution. Moreover, the evidence suggests and supports no other determination. Under such facts, we hold as a matter of law that the evidence was insufficient to revoke the sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>pended sentence and that the trial court, in so doing, abused its discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">In reaching this result, we are not unmindful of the conscientious concerns of the trial judge for the victims of Duffs crime, and for Duff, that are patently clear from the record. We share the concern that restitution should be completed within a reasonable period of time. Nor do we mean to suggest that Duffs current financial situation prevents the trial court from imposing alternate means of punishment upon him. Rather, the court is required to consider reasonable alternatives to imprisonment and not merely to automatically revoke the suspended sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXk\"><em>Id. </em>at 298, 429 S.E.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Peyton\u2019s failure to finish the program resulted from a medical inability to continue and was not the result of an unwillingness or refusal to do so. This illness was not a reasonable cause to revoke Peyton\u2019s suspended sentence. Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2 allows the judge to revoke all or part of the suspended sentence if the defendant voluntarily withdraws, is removed \u201cfor intractable behavior,\u201d or violates the terms of probation. The majority, however, upholds the trial judge\u2019s decision and cites Peyton\u2019s physical illness as the event that deprived him of \u201cthe ability to conform his behavior to that necessary to complete the program.\u201d Simply put, the connection between vomiting blood and \u201cintractable behavior\u201d is tenuous and unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The majority further reasons that the trial judge\u2019s revocation was not an abuse of discretion because being \u201cphysically suited\u201d is a prerequisite for acceptance into the program. There is a clear distinction, however, between the terms of acceptance into the program and cause for removal from the program. The majority blurs the distinction and incorporates one into the other. The statute does not equate \u201cintractable behavior\u201d with a person\u2019s failure to complete the program through illness or a lack of individual fault. Code \u00a7 19.2-316.1 defines <em>\u201cIntractable behavior\u201d </em>in terms that denote willful or obstinate conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>As in <em>Duff, </em>I would reverse the trial judge\u2019s revocation of the suspended sentence and remand to consider reasonable alternatives to imprisonment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
