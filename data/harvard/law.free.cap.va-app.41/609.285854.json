He was also convicted of three counts of the use of a communications system for soliciting a minor in a sex crime in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B)(i). On appeal, he contends the evidence was insufficient to prove he committed the offenses. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">Detective Rick Meadows posed as a twelve-year-old girl named \u201cKim\u201d while conducting computer on-line investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>tions. Meadows, as \u201cKim,\u201d had three separate text message conversations with appellant via an instant message internet chat room called \u201cRomance Virginia.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 30, 2001, in his first \u201cchat\u201d with appellant, Meadows wrote that \u201cKim\u201d was twelve years old and lived in Virginia. Appellant replied that he was twenty-four years old, and he asked if \u201cKim\u201d had ever kissed \u201can older guy.\u201d Appellant also sent Meadows two photographs of himself in which his genitals were exposed. Appellant wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see and feel the real thing?\u201d Meadows replied, \u2018Yes\u201d and asked, \u201cWhat would you do with me?\u201d Appellant wrote, \u201cAnything you want me to do. Do you want to cumm [sic] in my mouth?\u201d and he referred to licking \u201cKim\u201d \u201cyou know where\u201d and \u201ceverywhere on [her] body.\u201d He asked if \u201cKim\u201d wished she lived closer to him and if she would \u201ccome over.\u201d Appellant also gave \u201cKim\u201d his home telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">On October 31, 2001, appellant and Meadows had another on-line conversation. Appellant told \u201cKim\u201d not to tell her parents about their communication. He also asked if \u201cKim\u201d wanted to see him and if she wanted him to remove his pants. Appellant removed his pants and transmitted by means of a web camera live pictures of himself, exposing his penis and holding his erect penis. Detective Meadows testified that appellant\u2019s web camera allowed Meadows to \u201csee what [appellant] was doing\u201d at that time. Detective Meadows produced snapshots of his computer screen and screen captures which were introduced into evidence. The images clearly showed appellant\u2019s penis. Appellant wrote that he wished \u201cKim\u201d was there with him and that he would \u201cmake love to\u201d her if she was there. He further stated he would \u201cbe gentle\u201d with her and \u201cteach\u201d her. Appellant and \u201cKim\u201d discussed meeting each other, and appellant said he would \u201cpick [her] up\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>somewhere, although he was \u201cnot too familiar with Richmond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">On November 26, 2001, appellant and Meadows, as \u201cKim,\u201d had a third on-line exchange. Appellant asked if \u201cKim\u201d wanted him to remove his clothes, and he activated his web camera. Appellant removed his pants and exposed his penis to the camera. He then asked if \u201cKim\u201d wanted to see him masturbate. Appellant masturbated to ejaculation in front of the web camera. Snapshots of Detective Meadows\u2019 computer screen taken during this exchange showing appellant\u2019s penis were admitted into evidence. \u201cKim\u201d asked appellant if he thought she was too young for him, and he replied, \u201cNo, but we have to be very careful.\u201d He also asked, \u201cAre you going to lose your virginity to me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Appellant admits that he made the communications with \u201cKim\u201d over the internet. However, he contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove he used a communication device to solicit a minor in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B). He argues that the evidence failed to show he intended the minor to act upon the content of the on-line conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">It shall be unlawful for any person over the age of eighteen to use a communications system, including but not limited to computers or computer networks or bulletin boards, or any other electronic means, for the purposes of soliciting any person he knows or has reason to believe is a minor for (i) any activity in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-355, 18.2-358, 18.2-361 or \u00a7 18.2-370, (ii) any activity in violation of \u00a7 18.2-374.1, or (iii) a violation of \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>\u201cCriminal solicitation involves the attempt of the accused to incite another to commit a criminal offense. \u2018It is immaterial whether the solicitation has any effect and whether the crime solicited is in fact committed.... The gist of [the] offense is incitement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Branche v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va. App. 480, 490, 489 S.E.2d 692, 697 (1997) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he act of solicitation may be completed before any attempt is made to commit the solicited crime.\u201d <em>Ford v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 224, 226, 391 S.E.2d 603, 604 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJq\">The specific intent to commit [a crime] may be inferred from the conduct of the accused if such intent flows naturally from the conduct proven. Where the conduct of the accused under the circumstances involved points with reasonable certainty to a specific intent to commit [the crime], the intent element is established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 95, 101, 452 S.E.2d 669, 674 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Appellant\u2019s actions and statements to \u201cKim\u201d were not simply \u201cwords alone.\u201d <em>See Bloom v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 364, 373, 542 S.E.2d 18, 22, <em>aff'd, </em>262 Va. 814, 554 S.E.2d 84 (2001). In the October 30, 2001 conversation, appellant discussed kissing \u201cKim,\u201d whom he believed was twelve years old, and he sent her photographs of himself in which his genitals were exposed. He inquired if she wanted to \u201csee and feel the real thing,\u201d and he discussed \u201cKim\u201d \u201ccumm[ing][sie] in his mouth.\u201d In addition, appellant expressed a desire to lick \u201cKim\u201d \u201ceverywhere on [her] body,\u201d and he asked if she would \u201ccome over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In the October 31, 2001 communication, appellant transmitted to \u201cKim\u201d images of his erect penis using a web camera allowing the recipient to view live images of him. During this communication, appellant wrote that he would have sexual intercourse with the minor if she was present, stating that he would be \u201cgentle\u201d with her. Furthermore, appellant discussed meeting \u201cKim\u201d and offered to pick her up \u201csomewhere.\u201d \u201cKim\u201d responded, \u201cI\u2019m not far,\u201d and appellant wrote back, \u201cI know. That\u2019s good, but I\u2019m not too familiar with Richmond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>During the November 26, 2001 conversation, appellant asked if \u201cKim\u201d would lose her virginity to him. He activated his web camera, removed his pants, and masturbated to ejaculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">From the content of the three conversations and from the evidence of the images appellant transmitted to the minor, the trial judge could infer that appellant intended to solicit a minor to commit illegal sexual acts in violation of the statute and via a communications device. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, on three separate occasions, appellant violated Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The fact that appellant and \u201cKim\u201d were located in different cities while they exchanged communications is of no consequence. \u201c[T]the separate crime of solicitation may be completed before an attempt is made to commit the solicited crime.\u201d <em>Pedersen v. City of Richmond, </em>219 Va. 1061, 1067-68, 254 S.E.2d 95, 99 (1979). Appellant\u2019s \u201cprincipal objective was to persuade\u201d the minor to engage in criminal sexual acts. <em>See id. </em>at 1068, 254 S.E.2d at 100. Proof of any overt act toward committing the crimes, such as meeting the minor at a specified location, was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In addition, appellant\u2019s argument that his actions constituted a single continuing offense is without merit. Evidence of separate, discrete conduct by appellant supported each of the three offenses. <em>See, e.g., Slater v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 593, 596, 425 S.E.2d 816, 817-18 (1993); <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 515, 518, 412 S.E.2d 731, 732 (1992). The offenses occurred on three different dates, involved three distinct and separate communications, and, in each conversation appellant incited the minor to commit a crime. Therefore, the evidence proved that appellant violated the statute on three separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to prove that he attempted to expose himself to a minor in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370 because the parties were located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>in separate cities at the time of the incidents. He also contends that he could not have committed these offenses because he exposed his genitals by means of the internet and not in a public location.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-370 provides, in part, that a person who knowingly and intentionally \u201c[e]xpose[s] his ... sexual or genital parts to any child\u201d under the age of fourteen years shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Expose has been defined as \u201c \u2018to put on show or display,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018to lay open to view,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018to display,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018to offer to the public view.\u2019 \u201d <em>Siquina v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 694, 698, 508 S.E.2d 350, 352 (1998) (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018Exposure of [a] person becomes indecent when it occurs at such time and place where [a] reasonable person knows or should know his act will be open to observation of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>768 (6th ed.1990)). \u201c \u2018[A]n indecent exposure must be either in the actual presence and sight of others, or in such a place or under such circumstances that the exhibition is liable to be seen by others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holley v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 158, 164, 562 S.E.2d 351, 354 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The evidence showed that appellant twice transmitted to someone, whom he believed was a minor, live images of his genital parts by means of a computer and a web camera so that the minor could see appellant\u2019s genital parts at the time of the exposure. In addition, on both occasions, prior to exposing his penis, appellant asked via instant messaging whether the minor wanted him to remove his pants or clothing. In both instances, Meadows indicated that \u201cKim\u201d wanted appellant to remove his pants. From appellant\u2019s words and conduct, the trial judge could infer that appellant knowingly and intentionally exposed his genitals to a person whom he believed to be a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Furthermore, the trial judge admitted evidence showing Meadows\u2019 computer screen at the time appellant sent the transmissions to \u201cKim.\u201d Several of the pictures received on October 31 and November 26, 2001 clearly show appellant\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>genitals. From this evidence, the trial judge could conclude that appellant knew that the exposure of his genitals in front of his activated web camera was \u201cliable to be seen\u201d by the minor at the time of the exhibition because \u201cKim\u201d was engaged in an instant message internet conversation with appellant at the time of the displays. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant violated Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-26 and 18.2-370.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-6\">. \"An instant message permits parties to connect simultaneously over the internet.
