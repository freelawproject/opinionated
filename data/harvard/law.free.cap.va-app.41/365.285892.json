Kane appeals a chancellor\u2019s order transferring custody of her two children to their father, Robert W. Szymczak, Kane\u2019s former husband. On appeal, Kane has preserved only one issue for consideration: whether the chancellor failed to comply with Code \u00a7 20-124.3\u2019s requirement that the court \u201ccommunicate to the parties the basis for the decision either orally or in writing.\u201d Szymczak cross appeals, claiming that the trial court erred by not awarding him attorney\u2019s fees and by requiring him to pay the guardian <em>ad litem </em>fee in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We find that the chancellor\u2019s letter opinion does not satisfy Code \u00a7 20-124.8, and thus, we remand the case to the trial court to comply with this statutory mandate. We also hold that the chancellor did not abuse his discretion by refusing to award Szymczak attorney\u2019s fees and by ordering Szymczak to pay the guardian\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Kane and Szymczak are the divorced parents of two sons. In October 1999, the Chesterfield Circuit Court granted Kane sole custody of the boys. In April 2001, Szymczak petitioned for a change of custody in Chesterfield Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court. The JDR court ordered joint legal custody with physical custody to Szymczak. Kane appealed the JDR decision to the Chesterfield Circuit Court in November 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">On July 26, 2002, the circuit court conducted an <em>ore terms </em>hearing and received testimony from Kane, Szymczak, and others. In addition, the parties submitted thirty-nine <em>de bene esse </em>depositions, numerous exhibits, and an extensive report from the guardian <em>ad litem. </em>A month later, the chancellor issued a written letter opinion. In it, the chancellor chastised both parents for failing to \u201cshift their priorities from self-interest to the interest of their children.\u201d The chancellor also noted that Szymczak \u201chad to be coerced\u201d into recognizing the \u201cneeds of the children.\u201d With this prodding, the chancellor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>observed, Szymczak had \u201cseen the light\u201d in the last couple of years. The court then concluded: \u201cThe Court has considered all the dictates of \u00a7 20-124.3 of the 1950 Code of Virginia (as amended). Further, the Court finds that there has been a material change of circumstances that warrant the Court considering a change in status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On the best-interests issue, the chancellor\u2019s opinion stated: \u201cBased on all the factors that the Court must consider, the Court has determined that sole legal and physical custody should be granted to the defendant, Mr. Szymczak, with visitation to Ms. Kane. The Court places particular emphasis on \u00a7 20-124.3(1), (2), (6) and (7).\u201d The chancellor\u2019s letter opinion, however, did not state the reasons why any of the statutory factors (including the four of particular importance) favored the requested change in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In her brief on appeal, Kane lists eight questions presented. The argument section of the brief, however, addresses only questions one, two, and seven. Rule 5A:20 requires appellants to brief the \u201cprinciples of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to each question presented.\u201d Questions \u201cunsupported by argument, authority, or citations to the record do not merit appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992); <em>see also Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 319, 321 n. 1, 563 S.E.2d 406, 407 n. 1 (2002); <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 442, 452, 546 S.E.2d 209, 213 (2001); <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 297 n. 1, 498 S.E.2d 451, 453 n. 1 (1998). As a result, Kane has waived appellate review of questions three, four, five, six, and eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Questions one, two, and seven redundantly contend that the chancellor violated Code \u00a7 20-124.3, which requires a trial court deciding a custody and visitation case to \u201ccommunicate to the parties the basis for the decision either orally or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>writing.\u201d The chancellor, Kane asserts, inadequately informed her of the basis for his decision. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Code \u00a7 20-124.3 lists various factors a trial court should consider when deciding the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child in a custody and visitation case. In its original form, the statute did not expressly require the trial court to elaborate on its findings or, for that matter, to provide any explanation for its decision. In 1999, however, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 20-124.3 to direct the trial court to state the \u201cbasis for the decision either orally or in writing.\u201d This statutory language came verbatim from a recommendation by the Virginia Commission on Youth in its 1999 Study on Joint Custody and Visitation. <em>See </em>House Doc. 24, at 20-21 (1999). The study commission made the recommendation after becoming \u201cacutely aware that some judges across the state may not be clearly or adequately articulating\u201d the reasons for child custody decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">To determine what level of specificity this statutory command requires, we turn to two settled principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">First, the \u201cwords of a statute should be given \u2018their common, ordinary and accepted meaning\u2019 absent a contrary intent by the legislature.\u201d <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 583, 575 S.E.2d 567, 570 (2003) (quoting <em>Germek v. Germek, </em>34 Va.App. 1, 8, 537 S.E.2d 596, 600 (2000)). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cbasis\u201d as a \u201cfundamental principle; an underlying condition.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>145 (7th ed. 1999) (definition no. 1). Non-legal dictionaries offer a similar denotation. A basis includes the \u201csupporting element,\u201d \u201cfoundation,\u201d \u201cchief component,\u201d or the \u201cessential principle.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>161 (2d col. ed. 1985). These definitions do not imply a high level of specificity. Instead, they focus on the fundamental or predominating reason or reasons underlying the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Second, we presume that the legislature \u201cchose, with care,\u201d the specific words of the statute. <em>Simon v. Forer, </em>265 Va. 483, 490, 578 S.E.2d 792, 796 (2003) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 89, 92-93, 578 S.E.2d 51, 53 (2003). The act of choosing carefully some words necessarily implies others are omitted with equal care. Here, the use of the expression \u201cbasis for the decision\u201d stands in contrast to the better-known phrase \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d This expression has been used in many statutory contexts, under both state<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and federal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> law. The latter phrase,. unlike the former, describes a comprehensive written or transcribed narrative of <em>all </em>aspects of the decisionmaking process \u2014 not just the fundamental or predominating ones. <em>See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, </em>304 U.S. 55, 56, 58 S.Ct. 768, 769, 82 L.Ed. 1146 (1938) (\u201cA discussion of portions of the evidence and the court\u2019s reasoning in its opinion do not constitute the special and formal findings by which it is the duty of the court appropriately and specifically to determine all the issues which the case presents.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Guided by these principles, we hold that the 1999 amendment to Code \u00a7 20-124.3 requires the trial court to identify the fundamental, predominating reason or reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>underlying its decision. This level of specificity does not require the chancellor to address all aspects of the decision-making process, as one would expect from comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. Nor does the 1999 amendment require the chancellor \u201cto quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Knick, </em>38 Va.App. 773, 783, 568 S.E.2d 430, 435 (2002) (citation omitted); <em>see also Goodhand, v. Kildoo, </em>37 Va.App. 591, 600, 560 S.E.2d 463, 467 (2002); <em>Joynes v. Payne, </em>36 Va.App. 401, 416, 551 S.E.2d 10, 17 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">That said, the statutory command cannot be satisfied by formulaic and generalized explanations such as \u2018Tve considered all the factors and I rule thus and such\u201d or \u201cthe best-interest test generally favors this or that party.\u201d It begs the question to say that identifying the statutory factors (either altogether or some subset of them) is the same as communicating the \u201cbasis\u201d for the decision. The statutory factors merely list topical issues for consideration. They become <em>reasons </em>for a particular decision only when one knows why the factors support the decision. To satisfy Code \u00a7 20-124.3, therefore, the trial court must provide a case-specific explanation (one that finds its contextual meaning from the evidence before the court) of the fundamental, predominating reason or reasons for the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In this case, the decision at issue involves changing a prior custody order. \u201cThe test to be met \u2018has two prongs: first, has there been a change in circumstances since the most recent custody award; second, would a change in custody be in the best interests of the children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hughes v. Hughes, </em>33 Va.App. 160, 165, 531 S.E.2d 654, 656 (2000), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>35 Va.App. 376, 545 S.E.2d 556 (2001) (quoting <em>Keel v. Keel, 225 </em>Va. 606, 611, 303 S.E.2d 917, 921 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Because the chancellor did not announce his decision from the bench, we look to his letter opinion. In it, he makes general remarks about both parties and their mutual antagonism. The only comment suggesting a change of circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>stances involves the observation that, despite Szymczak\u2019s earlier disinterested attitude, he had \u201cseen the light\u201d in recent years. The chancellor then concludes: \u201cThe Court has considered all the dictates of \u00a7 20-124.8 of the 1950 Code of Virginia (as amended). Further, the Court finds that there has been a material change of circumstances that warrant[s] the Court considering a change in status.\u201d On the best-interests issue, the chancellor\u2019s opinion repeats that he had considered \u201call the factors that the Court must consider\u201d and gave \u201cparticular emphasis\u201d to several of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Except for the metaphorical language, which we find insufficiently communicative, the chancellor\u2019s letter opinion does little more than simply state his decision. No \u201cbasis\u201d for the decision \u2014 in terms of a fundamental, predominating reason or reasons for it \u2014 was communicated to the parties. The mere mention of the statutory factors, by itself, does not communicate why the judge ruled as he did. And, for the same reason the formulaic remark about considering \u201call the factors\u201d falls short, so too does the caveat about some of them being particularly important.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Szymczak argues that parties could infer the judge\u2019s underlying reasons for his decision from the guardian\u2019s report or from counsel\u2019s closing arguments or some other contextual source. But that observation, even if true, proves too much. If the parties must infer the reasons, it is probably because the judge did not communicate them directly. An unspoken and unwritten inference \u2014 no matter how strong \u2014 cannot substitute for what the statute requires: an express <em>communication </em>to the parties of the basis for the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Consequently, we hold that the chancellor\u2019s letter opinion fails to satisfy Code \u00a7 20-124.3\u2019s requirement that the trial court \u201ccommunicate to the parties the basis for the decision either orally or in writing.\u201d We remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to provide an explanation in compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In his cross appeal, Szymczak claims the trial court erred by not awarding him attorney\u2019s fees and by requiring him to pay the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>entire fee. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Whether to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cis a matter submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 199-200, 571 S.E.2d 912, 916 (2002) (quoting <em>Graves v. Graves, 4 </em>Va.App. 326, 333, 357 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The decision to apportion guardian fees between both parties or to one party alone also involves a matter within the chancellor\u2019s discretion. <em>See, e.g., Infant C. v. Boy Scouts of America, </em>239 Va. 572, 584, 391 S.E.2d 322, 329 (1990) (noting that a chancellor \u201cmay\u201d allocate guardian fees \u201cbased upon the final result\u201d); <em>Verrocchio v. Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. 314, 322, 429 S.E.2d 482, 487 (1993) (\u201cIndivisible from the power of appointment is the associated power equitably to apportion the fees and expenses of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>as costs to the parties.\u201d). Because each case presents its own unique set of equities, principles of appellate review steer clear of inflexible rules and focus instead on \u201creasonableness under all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Joynes, </em>36 Va.App. at 429, 551 S.E.2d at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In our opinion, the chancellor did not abuse his discretion by denying Szymczak\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. The record of this case demonstrates a level of rancor and discord thankfully rare in our courts. The legal fees alone tend to show this. Szymczak spent over $90,000 at the trial court level; Kane\u2019s fees exceeded $42,000. The record contains examples of sarcastic and prolix briefs, speaking objections and coaching during depositions, protracted procedural contests, and petty discovery disputes. While Szymczak claims Kane bears all of the blame, we cannot say the chancellor abused his discretion by finding that both parties contributed to this regrettable state of affairs and by ruling that neither party should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>We also find no abuse of discretion in the chancellor\u2019s decision to assess the cost of the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>fee against Szymczak. The guardian was appointed by the JDR court to investigate Szymczak\u2019s allegations of changed circumstances and to provide a recommendation on his request that custody of both boys be transferred to him. After the guardian provided a favorable recommendation to Szymczak in the JDR court, the chancellor reappointed the guardian for the <em>de novo </em>circuit court appeal. In his letter opinion, the chancellor observed that Kane had \u201cworked hard in the early years of child rearing with almost no support from the father.\u201d The chancellor, however, found that Szymczak changed his ways and demonstrated his fitness to receive full custody. In making out his case, Szymczak relied on the guardian\u2019s extensive investigation and report. Kane, on the other hand, disputed the guardian\u2019s recommendations and claims on appeal that the guardian took an adversarial role in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The issue before us is not whether we find that the equities favor one or the other party, but whether the chancellor abused his discretion in finding that the equities favored the imposition of the guardian\u2019s fee on Szymczak. While the chancellor could have divided the guardian\u2019s fees between the parties, <em>Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. at 322, 429 S.E.2d at 487, he also had the discretion not to. Under the circumstances of this case, we find no abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We hold that the chancellor\u2019s letter opinion fails to satisfy Code \u00a7 20-124.3\u2019s requirement that the trial court \u201ccommunicate\u201d to the parties the \u201cbasis of the decision.\u201d We remand this matter to the trial court for compliance with this statutory mandate. We find no abuse of discretion in the chancellor\u2019s denial of Szymczak\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees or his assessment of the guardian\u2019s fees against Szymczak.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">.
