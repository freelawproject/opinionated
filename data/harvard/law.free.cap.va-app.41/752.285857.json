In a bench trial, she was convicted of assault on a law enforcement officer, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57, in addition to the indicted offenses of eluding and leaving the scene. A panel of this Court reversed the conviction of assault and affirmed the conviction of leaving the scene. <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, 41 </em>Va.App. 99, 581 S.E.2d 910 (2003). Thereafter, we stayed the mandate of that decision and granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Appellant contends she was improperly convicted of assault on a law enforcement officer because that offense is not a lesser-included offense of the indicted charge, attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer. She also argues the evidence was insufficient to prove she left the scene of an accident. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the trial court on both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Around 8:00 p.m. on May 4, 2001, Portsmouth Police Officer S.D. White saw a burgundy Pontiac with \u201cmusic ... playing extremely loud,\u201d traveling without its headlights illuminated. Officer White activated his lights and siren, but the Pontiac did not stop. Officer White continued to follow the vehicle, with his \u201cwigwag headlights\u201d activated and his siren engaged, for approximately one mile. The Pontiac swerved from one lane to another. A passing car was forced off the road by the Pontiac. Eventually, the vehicle crossed the Churchland Bridge, \u201cstopped suddenly,\u201d and \u201cjumped the curb.\u201d The officer swerved his car slightly to avoid hitting the Pontiac and then stopped his police unit \u201cslightly beside [appellant\u2019s] vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Officer White, who was in uniform with his badge displayed, exited his vehicle. He walked up to the Pontiac and found appellant in the driver\u2019s seat. The car was still running. Officer White reached through the driver\u2019s side window, telling appellant, \u201cTurn off the car, turn off the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The officer described what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">I reached in, there was some yelling or something from inside the car and the car drove off. When the car drove off, it pinned my arm back behind the headrest and drug me towards the front of my car at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">I was able to work myself free and I remember getting hit in the back with either a car or a mirror and the next thing I remember I was being loaded into an ambulance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Officer Peter Sykes had arrived just before appellant stopped her car. He observed Officer White reach into appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>lant\u2019s car, grab her arm, and attempt to extract her from the Pontiac. According to Officer Sykes, the car then \u201cbegan to proceed eastbound ... leaving the curb, partially dragging Officer White towards his police vehicle. Officer White eventually let go of the driver\u2019s arm.\u201d Officer Sykes testified the Pontiac was \u201ccreeping off the curb\u201d when appellant drove off with Officer White\u2019s arm in her car. He estimated the car traveled about five or six feet until Officer White \u201clet go.\u201d After the officer \u201clet go,\u201d the Pontiac struck White\u2019s vehicle and then another police ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Officer Sykes followed the car approximately a hundred feet, during which time it jumped the curb, traveled across a lawn, and stopped. The officer placed appellant under arrest. Officer White was treated for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, appellant moved to strike the evidence on the attempted capital murder count. After argument, the trial court sustained the motion. The Commonwealth then inquired if the court was \u201cstriking that down to possibly a lesser included offense?\u201d The Commonwealth suggested assault on a law enforcement officer as a lesser-included offense. Appellant argued the latter offense was not a lesser-included offense. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">MR. MEDA [appellant\u2019s counsel]: Your Honor, I think under the <em>Blockburger </em>analysis for lesser included offenses, I don\u2019t think that meets the requirement. The attempted capital murder statute does not include the element of the defendant having reason to know the person was a law enforcement officer. Assault and battery on a police officer requires that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">The elements of the statute of attempted capital murder do not include that as a requirement. The statute for assault and battery on a law enforcement officer requires the Commonwealth to prove as an element that the defendant had reason to know that the person assaulted is a law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney responded, arguing that an attempted capital murder indictment also requires the Commonwealth prove a defendant should have known the victim was a law enforcement officer. The entire focus of the argument to the trial court was whether the Commonwealth must prove the offender had reason to know the person was a law enforcement officer in order to prove attempted capital murder. The trial court ruled on this issue when it found assault on a law enforcement officer was a lesser-included offense of attempted capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">A. Lesser-included Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">On appeal, appellant contends assault and battery of a law enforcement officer is not a lesser-included offense of attempted capital murder because a battery is not an element of attempted capital murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant also argues the definitions of \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-57, the assault statute, and Code \u00a7 18.2-31(6), the murder statute, differ, which precludes a finding that assault of a law enforcement officer is a lesser-included offense of attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer. The Commonwealth concedes this second argument. However, the Commonwealth contends any argument based on these different definitions is procedurally defaulted under Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">No ruling of the trial court or the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice. A mere statement that the judgment or award is contrary to the law and the evidence is not sufficient to constitute a question to be ruled upon on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>The argument at trial focused solely on whether both offenses require proof that the assailant knew her intended victim was a law enforcement officer. Appellant argued Code \u00a7 18.2-57 includes this element and attempted capital murder does not. However, on appeal, appellant attempts to distinguish the elements of these two offenses on a different basis, i.e., the <em>statutory definition </em>of a law enforcement officer, not the <em>assailant\u2019s perception </em>of the victim\u2019s status as a law enforcement officer. Appellant did not raise the point she now asserts before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Nothing in appellant\u2019s argument before the trial court alerted the trial court to her argument before this Court. The trial court had no opportunity to consider the issue presented on appeal. <em>See Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 416, 422, 425 S.E.2d 521, 525 (1992) (\u201cThis Court has said \u2018the primary function of Rule 5A:18 is to alert the trial judge to possible error so that the judge may consider the issue intelligently and take any corrective actions necessary to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 530, 414 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1992))).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Rule 5A:18 requires an \u201cobjection [be] stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Under this rule, a specific argument must be made to the trial court at the appropriate time, or the allegation of error will not be considered on appeal. <em>See Mounce v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 433, 435, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). A general argument or an abstract reference to the law is not sufficient to preserve an issue. <em>Buck v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 449, 452-53, 443 S.E.2d 414, 416 <em>(1994); Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 461, 464-65, 524 S.E.2d 162, 164 (2000). Making one specific argument on an issue does not preserve a separate legal point on the same issue for review. <em>See Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 406, 411-12, 517 S.E.2d 260, 262 (1999) (preserving one argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>ment on sufficiency of the evidence does not allow argument on appeal regarding other sufficiency questions).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Thus, we will not consider this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>West Alexandria Prop., Inc. v. First Virginia Mortgage and Real Estate Inv. Trust, </em>221 Va. 134, 138, 267 S.E.2d 149, 151 (1980) (\u201cOn appeal, though taking the same general position as in the trial court, an appellant may not rely on reasons which could have been but were not raised for the benefit of the lower court.\u201d); <em>Floyd v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 584, 249 S.E.2d 171, 176 (1978) (holding that appellate courts will not consider an argument that differs from the specific argument presented to the trial court, even if it relates to the same general issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Although Rule 5A:18 allows exceptions for good cause or to meet the ends of justice, appellant does not argue that we should invoke these exceptions. <em>See e.g., Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997) (\u201cIn order to avail oneself of the exception, a <em>defendant must affirmatively show </em>that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred.\u201d (emphasis added)). We will not consider, <em>sua sponte, </em>a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d argument under Rule 5A:18. Further, we find nothing in the record to support such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Appellant relies on our decision in <em>Lowe v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 583, 535 S.E.2d 689 (2000), to contend that her assignment of error can be raised at any time. In <em>Lowe, </em>a defendant was indicted for statutory burglary, but convicted of trespass, without an amendment of the indictment. The conviction was reversed because trespass under Code \u00a7 18.2-219 is not a lesser-included offense of statutory burglary. At trial, Lowe did not object to the conviction of the reduced charge. The Commonwealth, as it did here, contended Rule 5A:18 barred Lowe from raising the issue on appeal. This Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">\u201c[T]he fact that the defendant did not object to ... the conviction on the ground that he was convicted for an offense with which he was not charged is of no moment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Unless an indictment is amended to conform to the proof or an accused acquiesces in being found guilty of an offense other than the one charged, a trial court lacks the authority to find an accused guilty of an offense other than the one charged or a lesser included offense.... The lack of authority of the trial Court to render the judgment that it did may be raised at any time and by this court on its own motion.\u201d <em>Fontaine v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 156, 165, 487 S.E.2d 241, 244 (1997) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 588, 535 S.E.2d at 691-92. This Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axd\">Acquiescence requires something more than a mere failure to object. <em>See [Fontaine, </em>25 Va.App. at 165, 487 S.E.2d at 244] (holding that failing to object, coupled with statement to judge clarifying that conviction was for misdemeanor rather than felony, did not constitute acquiescence).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 588, 535 S.E.2d at 692. This Court found the issue was not defaulted and proceeded to consider the merits of the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">In <em>Fontaine, </em>25 Va.App. 156, 487 S.E.2d 241, a defendant was indicted for leaving the scene of an accident in which a person was injured, a felony under Code \u00a7 46.2-900. However, he was convicted, without an amendment of the indictment, of leaving the scene of an accident involving property damage, a misdemeanor under Code \u00a7 46.2-900. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 487 S.E.2d at 242-43. Fontaine did not object to the conviction of the reduced charge. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 487 S.E.2d at 244. In the context of a sufficiency issue, the Commonwealth argued that Fontaine had \u201cconcurred\u201d in the misdemeanor conviction by asking the trial court for clarification. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 487 S.E.2d at 244. This Court held Fontaine did not \u201cacquiesce\u201d in the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth also argued the evidence was sufficient to convict Fontaine of the misdemean- or because it was a lesser-included offense of the felony, and the evidence was sufficient to convict him of the felony. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 487 S.E.2d at 244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">This Court noted, \u201c[N]ot only is [the lesser-included issue] crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s sufficiency argument, but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>more importantly it is critical to the determination of whether the trial court had jurisdiction to find the defendant guilty of an offense not directly charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 487 S.E.2d at 245. This Court, after finding \u201chit and run property damage\u201d is not a lesser-included offense of \u201chit and run personal injury,\u201d explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">By convicting the defendant of an offense that was not lesser included and that was not charged, the trial court exceeded its authority. The indictment did not charge the defendant generally with hit and run in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. Instead, it specifically charged hit and run personal injury. Thus, the Commonwealth charged the defendant with one offense and found him guilty of another. \u201cThe state may not accuse a person of one crime and convict him by proving another unless the offense is a lesser included one of that charged.\u201d <em>Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 6, 396 S.E.2d 680, 682 (1990). The fact that the defendant did not object to or appeal the conviction on the ground that he was convicted for an offense with which he was not charged is of no moment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 164-65, 487 S.E.2d at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The Commonwealth asks this Court to overturn <em>Lowe </em>and reject the analysis in <em>Fontaine. </em>The Commonwealth argues that conviction of an offense which is not a lesser-included offense cannot create a jurisdictional issue and contends appellant\u2019s arguments are subject to the usual procedural requirements for consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The Commonwealth notes both <em>Lowe, </em>33 Va.App. at 589, 535 S.E.2d at 692, and <em>Fontaine, </em>25 Va.App. at 165, 487 S.E.2d at 245, allow waiver of this issue if a defendant acquiesces in the trial court\u2019s decision. However, the Commonwealth correctly explains, jurisdictional issues by definition cannot be waived, even with acquiescence. <em>Nelson v. Warden of Keen Mountain Corr. Ctr., </em>262 Va. 276, 281, 552 S.E.2d 73, 75 (2001) (noting jurisdictional issues cannot be waived). Given this contradiction between the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>jurisdictional issues and the principles expressed in <em>Lowe </em>and <em>Fontaine, </em>we must reconsider these two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><em>Fontaine, </em>as embraced in <em>Lowe, </em>underscores the concept that a trial court \u201clack[s] authority\u201d to convict a person of an offense which is not a lesser-included offense. We do not disagree with this statement of the law. However, the <em>Fontaine </em>and <em>Lowe </em>decisions presume enthymematically that, when courts \u201clack authority,\u201d they necessarily also lack essential jurisdiction over the matter in controversy. The decisions also conclude that this lack of authority allows the issue to be raised at any time, whether preserved under Rule 5A:18 or not, a prospect reserved only for void judgments. <em>Lowe, </em>33 Va.App. at 588-89, 535 S.E.2d at 691-92; <em>Fontaine, 25 </em>Va. App. at 165, 487 S.E.2d at 245. Essentially, <em>Fontaine </em>and <em>Lowe </em>equate the \u201clack of authority\u201d to exercise jurisdiction with a jurisdictional defect. This notion was clearly rejected in <em>Nelson, </em>262 Va. at 281-84, 552 S.E.2d at 75-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Referring to its earlier decision in <em>David Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 431, 527 S.E.2d 406 (2000), the Supreme Court explained in <em>Nelson,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">[W]e made a point in <em>David Moore </em>of \u201cemphasizing the necessary distinction to be drawn ... between the power of a court to adjudicate a specified class of cases, commonly known as \u2018subject matter jurisdiction,\u2019 and the authority of a court to exercise that power in a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 527 S.E.2d at 409.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">We said that \u201c[s]ubject matter jurisdiction is granted by constitution or statute,\u201d that \u201c[i]t cannot be waived,\u201d that \u201cany judgment rendered without it is void <em>ab initio,\u201d </em>and that \u201clack of subject matter jurisdiction \u2018may be raised at any time in any manner, before any court, or by the court itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Humphreys v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 765, 772, 43 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1947)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\">After noting the Court\u2019s emphasis on the distinction between subject matter jurisdiction and the authority to exercise that jurisdiction, the Court\u2019s next step should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>to demonstrate the difference resulting from the distinction. Yet, we made a distinction without a difference for, with our very next step, we elevated the failure of a court to comply with the requirements for exercising its authority to the same level of gravity as a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae5\">262 Va. at 281, 552 S.E.2d at 75. The Supreme Court reversed the reasoning in <em>David Moore </em>and found the failure to notify Nelson\u2019s father of the charges against his son did not result in a void judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">Nelson did not preserve the error in the juvenile court\u2019s failure to give his father notice and did not raise the issue until he filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this Court. Because Nelson\u2019s convictions were merely voidable, his failure to raise the issue in a timely manner constitutes a waiver of the error and results in the dismissal of his petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 285, 552 S.E.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\"><em>Lowe </em>and <em>Fontaine </em>follow the erroneous logic of <em>David Moore </em>by equating the authority to exercise jurisdiction with basic jurisdictional requirements. These decisions cannot be reconciled with <em>Nelson. </em>Therefore, we are required to overrule those decisions to the extent that they conclude a conviction of an offense that is not a lesser-included offense of the indicted charge renders the judgment void, i.e., it can be raised at any time in any court.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">In reaching this conclusion, we remain aware of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. </em>As the Supreme Court said in <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Dean, </em>233 Va. 260, 355 S.E.2d 579 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-9\">In Virginia, the doctrine of stare decisis is more than a mere clich\u00e9. That doctrine plays a significant role in the orderly administration of justice by assuring consistent, predictable, and balanced application of legal principles. And when a court of last resort has established a precedent, after full deliberation upon the issue by the court, the precedent will not be treated lightly or ignored, in the absence of flagrant error or mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>233 Va. 260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987) (citation omitted). \u201cOur strong adherence to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>does not, however, compel us to perpetuate what we believe to be an incorrect application of the law____\u201d <em>Nunnally v. Artis, </em>254 Va. 247, 253, 492 S.E.2d 126, 129 (1997). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-402(D) (\u201cThe court [of appeals] sitting en banc shall consider and decide the case and may overrule any previous decision by any panel or of the full court.\u201d); <em>Nelson, </em>262 Va. at 280-81, 552 S.E.2d at 75 (quoting <em>Nunnally). </em>We may exercise the authority to overrule previous decisions where a \u201cdetailed inquiry\u201d demonstrates \u201c \u2018a mistake exists in our prior decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 312, 321, 549 S.E.2d 641, 645 (2001) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Further, precedent from the Supreme Court supports the distinction we now make between a void and a voidable judgment in the context of differences between the indictment and the final conviction. In <em>Cunningham v. Hayes, </em>204 Va. 851, 134 S.E.2d 271 (1964), Hayes was indicted for manslaughter, yet convicted of first-degree murder. In his petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>Cunningham asserted his conviction was illegal because he was indicted for one offense and convicted of another. <em>Id. </em>at 858, 134 S.E.2d at 276. In dismissing the petition, the Court held the judgment was voidable, not void.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\u201cThis court has repeatedly held that a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>does not lie where the judgment of conviction is merely voidable by reasons of error of law or fact, omissions, or other irregularities, no matter how numerous or flagrant they may be. The remedy in such cases is by appeal or writ of error. The underlying question in such <em>[habeas corpus </em>] proceedings is that of jurisdiction that is, whether the court had jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter and the power to render the particular judgment. If the court had jurisdiction of the person and of the subject matter of the prosecution, and if the punishment imposed is of the character prescribed by law, a 'writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>does not lie to release the prisoner from custody merely because of irregularities or defects in the sentence.\u201d (Citing cases). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number><em>Royster v.

Appellant does not contend the offense occurred outside the Commonwealth of Virginia or that the court lacked jurisdiction over her person. Thus, no jurisdictional defect renders her conviction of assault on a police officer void. Since Rule 5A:18 bars consideration of this issue, we affirm the conviction of assault on a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Appellant argues the evidence does not support the conviction for leaving the scene of an accident involving personal injury. She contends she did not deliberately drive away from the scene and, alternatively, she did not leave the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">When considering sufficiency issues, \u201cwe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, \u201cit is our duty to look to that evidence which tends to support the verdict and to permit the verdict to stand unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 1009, 1016, 121 S.E.2d 452, 457 (1961). \u201cThe judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin, 4 </em>Va.App. at 443, 358 S.E.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-894 criminalizes leaving the scene of an accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-6\">The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident in which a person is killed or injured or in which an attended vehicle or other attended property is damaged shall immediately stop as close to the scene of the accident as possible without obstructing traffic, as provided in \u00a7 46.2-888, and report his name, address, driver\u2019s license number, and vehicle registration number forthwith to the State Police or local law-enforcement agency, to the person struck and injured if such person appears to be capable of understanding and retaining the information, or to the driver or some other occupant of the vehicle collided with or to the custodian of other damaged property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Appellant claims this statute requires the Commonwealth prove an accused <em>deliberately </em>drove away from the scene of an accident, citing <em>Herchenbach v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 217, 38 S.E.2d 328 (1946), to support this interpretation of the statute. She then argues the evidence does not support an inference that she deliberately continued driving after she injured the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Herchenbach </em>is misplaced. <em>Herchenbach </em>held the Commonwealth must prove an accused knew an accident had occurred, which is not appellant\u2019s argument. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 38 S.E.2d at 329. <em>See Cottee v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 546, 558, 525 S.E.2d 25, 31 (2000). <em>Herchenbach </em>did note, however, \u201cThe duty imposed upon the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident is not passive. It requires positive, affirmative action; \u2014 that is, to stop and give the aid and information specified.\u201d 185 Va. at 220, 38 S.E.2d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Code \u00a7 46.2-894 requires a driver \u201cimmediately stop\u201d at an accident scene. This language plainly does not allow a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>person to continue driving until circumstances stop the vehicle. <em>See Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999) (statutory language should be given its plain meaning). Even if, as appellant contends, she initially could not stop the vehicle because she was \u201cyanked ... off those brakes\u201d by Officer White, she could have applied the brakes to stop the car once the officer had released her. She did not do this, but instead continued to drive the car until it hit two police vehicles and almost hit a house. This evidence is sufficient to prove appellant did not immediately stop as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Appellant also contends she did not leave the scene, contending the movement of her car did not take her away from the scene. She relies on <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 228, 527 S.E.2d 456 (2000), to support this analysis. Again, her reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\"><em>Smith </em>addressed the meaning of \u201cscene of the accident\u201d in the context of Code \u00a7 19.2-81, the statute allowing an arrest without a warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 77 S.E.2d 855, 527 S.E.2d at 458. Appellant is correct that this Court held Smith was at \u201cthe scene of any accident\u201d when she was arrested, even though she stopped her car 100 yards away from the road sign she had struck. <em>Id. </em>However, in a footnote, this Court foresaw appellant\u2019s argument here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">Appellant contends that the phrase, \u201cthe scene of any accident,\u201d in Code \u00a7 19.2-81 should be construed as coextensive with the phrase, \u201cthe scene of the accident,\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.2-894, Virginia\u2019s \u201chit-and-run\u201d statute. Because appellant\u2019s hit-and-run charge was disposed of by <em>nolle prosequi </em>and never considered by the court, we see no reason to analyze the meaning of the challenged phrase in the hit-and-run statute. We note, however, that the hit- and-run statute contains language significantly different from the statute under which appellant was convicted. Code \u00a7 46.2-894 requires a driver involved in an accident to \u201cstop as close to the scene of the accident as possible without obstructing traffic,\u201d and the purpose of the statute is to \u201cfacilitate accident investigation and to preserve public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>order.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 769, 771, 418 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1992). Code \u00a7 19.2-81, by contrast, permits an officer to make a warrantless arrest of a motor vehicle driver, under certain conditions, \u201cat the scene of any accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 234 n. 2, 527 S.E.2d at 460 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">We agree with the analysis in <em>Smith\u2019s </em>footnote. By requiring a driver to stop immediately and as close to the \u201cscene\u201d as possible, Code \u00a7 46.2-894 distinguishes and limits the area labeled \u201cthe scene\u201d in a manner that Code \u00a7 19.2-81 does not. The hit-and-run statute clearly requires drivers to stop as close to the accident, or point of impact, as safety will permit. Any other interpretation of the statute would make the word \u201cimmediately\u201d meaningless and foil the intent of the statute. <em>See Gray v. Graves Mountain Lodge, Inc., </em>26 Va.App. 350, 355-56, 494 S.E.2d 866, 869 (1998) (explaining that courts should avoid interpretations that make words within a statute meaningless and ignore legislative intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The trial court found appellant \u201cdrove fifty to a hundred feet away\u201d after injuring Officer White. The evidence supports that finding. After Officer White fell from her car, appellant hit two police cars and eventually stopped in the lawn of a private residence. Nothing in the record suggests that stopping in the lawn was an immediate stop or that the lawn was the first safe place to park the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">We find appellant was properly convicted of assault on a law enforcement officer and that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of leaving the scene of an accident involving personal injury. Thus, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">. Appellant was convicted of assault on a law enforcement officer, not assault and battery on a law enforcement officer.

U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Va. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 8.Code \u00a7 19.2-220 provides, in pertinent part, that an indictment shall be \u201ca plain, concise and definite written statement, (1) naming the accused, (2) describing the offense charged, (3) identifying the county, city or town in which the accused committed the offense, and (4) reciting that the accused committed the offense on or about a certain date.\u201d An indictment, to be sufficient, must give an accused notice of the nature and character of the charged offense so the accused can make his defense. <em>Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 231, 421 S.E.2d 821, 828 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 933, 113 S.Ct. 1319, 122 L.Ed.2d 705 (1993).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">It is firmly established, therefore, that an accused cannot be convicted of a crime that has not been charged, unless the crime is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8Q\"><em>Commonwealth v. Dalton, </em>259 Va. 249, 253, 524 S.E.2d 860, 862 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The record establishes that, after the trial judge granted the motion to strike the charge of attempted capital murder, the prosecutor inquired about whether the judge was inclined to convict Edwards of a lesser-included offense. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, with that, will you be striking that down to possibly a lesser included offense under that, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-9\">[Judge]: Well, I haven\u2019t heard any argument about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqxR\">[Prosecutor]: I didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-10\">[Judge]: What lesser included offense would you suggest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV5o\">[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, the Commonwealth would argue that under any of the homicide statutes or attempted homi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>cide statutes, Your Honor, that any of the assault and battery offenses would be lesser included which would include malicious wounding, unlawful wounding, assault and battery on a law enforcement officer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">[Judge]: So you don\u2019t have an argument then for that, just anything I want to do is okay with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">[Prosecutor]: Well, Your Honor, just articulating what the lesser included offenses would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">[Judge]: I know what all I can do. I just wanted to know if you had a position on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, the Commonwealth would argue that here, clearly, an assault on a law enforcement officer did take place....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">[Judge]: You think assault on a police officer is a lesser included offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">[Prosecutor]: In this particular case, Your Honor, given the elements\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-11\">[Judge]: Not in this particular case, in any case is assault on a police officer a lesser included offense of attempted capital murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-12\">[Prosecutor]: Under the enumerated section that makes this attempted capital murder because it was on a law enforcement officer, Your Honor, it\u2019s the Commonwealth\u2019s position that yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">The record indicates that Edwards\u2019s attorney objected. In pertinent part, he gave the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-14\">Your Honor, I think under the <em>Blockburger </em>analysis for lesser included offenses, I don\u2019t think that meets the requirement. The attempted capital murder statute does not include the element of the defendant having reason to know the person was a law enforcement officer. Assault and battery on a police officer requires that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-16\">The elements of the statute of attempted capital murder do not include that as a requirement. The statute for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>assault and battery on a law enforcement officer requires the Commonwealth to prove as an element that the defendant had reason to know that the person assaulted is a law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">Just as to the argument as to whether or not the Court could find for a lesser included offense, I don\u2019t think assault and battery on a police officer is a lesser included offense of attempted\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">i-: <em>% </em>sK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">As I stated, the element in assault and battery on a police officer requires the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant had reason to know that the person assaulted was a law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">Yes, sir, judge, but there\u2019s no element in the attempted capital murder statute that requires the Commonwealth to prove that the defendant had reason to know that the person was a law enforcement officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">The context in which the lesser offense was suggested by the prosecutor is important because these discussions indicate the prosecutor was unsure that a lesser-included offense was \u201cpossible\u201d and then suggested with some uncertainty various alternatives that the judge might consider. Only after the judge pressed for her \u201cposition\u201d did the prosecutor settle upon assault on a law enforcement officer as a lesser-included offense. Then, however, the prosecutor argued that the facts \u201c[i]n this particular case\u201d suggested that the offense of assault was a lesser-included offense. <em>See Ragsdale v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 421, 427-28, 565 S.E.2d 331, 334-35 (2002) (noting that the <em>Blockburger </em>test suggests the \u201ctwo offenses \u2018are to be examined in the abstract, rather than with reference to the facts of a particular case under review \u201d). Responding to those arguments, Edwards\u2019s attorney said, \u201cYour Honor, I think under the <em>Blockburger </em>analysis for lesser included offenses I don\u2019t think that meets the requirement.\u201d Although Edwards\u2019s attorney advanced at trial a <em>Blockburger </em>analysis different than the one now urged on appeal, I would hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the uncertainty that prevailed at the trial on this issue provides a \u201cgood cause\u201d basis to consider this issue on appeal. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 273, 280, 72 S.E.2d 693, 697 (1952) (holding that \u201cformal objection\u201d would be excused when the attorneys were \u201ctaken by surprise\u201d by the judge\u2019s actions and the attorneys \u201cwere rather depending on the court in a situation new to them\u201d); <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 988, 996, 421 S.E.2d 652, 656 (1992) (Barrow, J., concurring) (noting that \u201c \u2018[g]ood cause\u2019 relates to the reason why an objection was not stated at the time of the ruling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Because Edwards\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s objection invoked the correct legal principle, i.e. <em>Blockburger, </em>I would hold that her argument, which focused on only one of several possible analyses, does not bar our review of the appeal under the good cause prong of Rule 5A:18. Accordingly, I would reverse the conviction for assault and remand this issue to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In addition to convicting Edwards of assaulting a law enforcement officer, the trial judge convicted her of eluding a law enforcement officer after receiving a signal to bring her vehicle to a stop, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-817, driving under the influence of alcohol, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-266, driving on a suspended license, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-301, and failing to stop at the scene of an accident to give information and render assistance, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-894. Edwards contends the evidence was insufficient to prove a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The evidence proved Edwards was driving erratically, although not exceeding the speed limit, and while intoxicated. Officer White, who followed Edwards with his siren activated, testified that Edwards\u2019s \u201cmusic was playing extremely loud.\u201d When Edwards stopped her vehicle at the end of a bridge, Officer White stopped his vehicle \u201cslightly beside [Edwards\u2019s] vehicle\u201d and to the left of it. Officer White testified that he \u201cexited [his] vehicle and attempted to extract [Edwards,] the driver\u201d when the following events occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Q: Now, you said you reached in the driver\u2019s side and put your hands on the defendant to try to get that person out of the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">Q: Put both hands on the individual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">A: No, my right hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">Q: The window, was it \u2014 It was already down, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-10\">sfc # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-11\">Q: Now, was the defendant\u2019s vehicle still running at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-13\">Q: Did you make any attempts to or commands for the defendant to get out of the vehicle before you put your hands into the vehicle trying to get her out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-14\">A: I was saying, \u201cTurn off the car, turn off the car,\u201d which is what I normally do, but there were sirens\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-15\">Q: Did you attempt to open \u2014 You didn\u2019t attempt to open the door before you put your hands in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-16\">A: I couldn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t enough room between the cars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">As Officer White pulled at Edwards through the window to \u201cextract\u201d her from the vehicle, Edwards\u2019s vehicle moved forward. Officer Sykes, who had stopped his vehicle behind Edwards, testified that Edwards\u2019s vehicle began to move after Officer White \u201cgrabbed [Edwards\u2019s] arm and attempted to pull [Edwards] from the vehicle.\u201d He described the movement of Edwards\u2019s vehicle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-18\">Q: And was that \u2014 That was at a speed of about five to ten miles, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-19\">A: If that. She kind of like was creeping off the curb. It wasn\u2019t a fast acceleration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-20\">Edwards\u2019s vehicle hit Officer White\u2019s vehicle, hit another officer\u2019s vehicle, which was parked ahead of Officer White\u2019s vehicle, and then jumped the curb onto a lawn. Officer Sykes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>testified that he drove around the two damaged vehicles and \u201cpositioned [his] vehicle alongside [Edwards\u2019s] vehicle, kind of following [Edwards\u2019s] vehicle.\u201d He said Edwards\u2019s \u201cvehicle was headed toward the house but stopped before striking the house.\u201d Edwards\u2019s vehicle had traveled fifty to one hundred feet from the place where Officer White had attempted to pull Edwards from her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 46.2-894 provides that \u201c[t]he driver of any vehicle involved in an accident in which a person is ... injured or in which an attended vehicle ... is damaged shall immediately stop as close to the scene of the accident as possible without obstructing traffic ... and report [identifying information].\u201d Applying a substantially similar predecessor statute, the Supreme Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">[I]n order <em>to be guilty of violating the statute, the driver </em>must be aware that harm has been done; it must be present in his mind that there has been an injury; and then, with that in his mind, he <em>must deliberately go away </em>without making himself known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-7\"><em>Herchenbach v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 217, 220, 38 S.E.2d 328, 329 (1946) (citations and internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">The evidence failed to prove that Edwards intentionally, consciously, or deliberately drove her vehicle as Officer White attempted to pull her from the vehicle while the vehicle\u2019s engine was engaged. Indeed, the evidence fails to negate the hypothesis that the officer\u2019s actions dislodged Edwards\u2019s foot from the brake pedal, as she testified, and, thus, caused the vehicle to move without any control being exercised by Edwards. Officer Sykes\u2019s testimony that the vehicle slowly moved away and came to a halt fifty to one hundred feet away on a lawn before striking a house supports the hypothesis that Edwards momentarily lost control as a result of Officer White\u2019s attempt to pull her from the vehicle through the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">It has long been the rule that \u201c[t]he gravamen of the charge under consideration is the flight from the scene and failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>give succor or aid to the injured party.\u201d <em>Blankenship v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 495, 500, 35 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1945). <em>See also James v. Commonwealth, </em>178 Va. 28, 37, 16 S.E.2d 296, 300 (1941). Evidence that established only that the vehicle moved fifty to one hundred feet after the operator momentarily was deprived of control of the vehicle is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the element of flight or deliberately driving away as required to prove a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">For these reasons, I would reverse that conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
