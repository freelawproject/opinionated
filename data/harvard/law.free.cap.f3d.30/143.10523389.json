Gardner, Jr. for attorneys\u2019 fees he incurred during the investigation by Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh in the amount of $53,120.74 this 29th day of July, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Before: SENTELLE, Presiding; BUTZNER and SNEED, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Opinion for the Special Court filed per curiam.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\n<em>PER CURIAM:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">Pursuant to section 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 <em>et seq. </em>(1988) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), Norman H. Gardner, Jr., an aide to Central Intelligence Agency (\u201cCIA\u201d) Deputy Director for Operations Clair George from 1985 through 1987, requests reimbursement for $84,386.77 in attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as a result of the Iran/Contra investigation conducted by Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh. The Act authorizes this court to reimburse the \u201csubject\u201d of an Independent Counsel investigation against whom no in-dietment is brought for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred ... during th[e] investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of [the Act].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we find Gardner\u2019s application in large part meritorious, we allow the greater portion of the fees sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">On December 19, 1986, this court appointed Independent Counsel Walsh \u201cto investigate ... alleged violations of federal criminal laws ... in connection with the sale or shipment of military arms to Iran and the transfer or diversion of funds realized in connection with such sale or shipment.\u201d <em>In re North (Shultz Fee Application), </em>8 F.3d 847, 849 (D.C.Cir.1993) (per curiam). For purposes of this opinion, we note that Gardner served as Special Assistant to Clair George, Deputy Director of Operations of the CIA, during the time that the events constituting the substantive basis of the Iran/Contra matter took place. By virtue of his position, Gardner acted as a cooperating witness in the Independent Counsel investigation from February 1987 to April 1991. Then, in July of 1991, he received a grand jury subpoena identifying him as a \u201csubject\u201d of that investigation. Shortly thereafter, he retained counsel to represent him throughout the remainder of the investigation. This fee request follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-18\">To recover attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act, Gardner must establish that he incurred such fees while he was a \u201csubject\u201d of the Independent Counsel investigation, that he would not have incurred these fees \u201cbut for the [Act\u2019s] requirements,\u201d and that the fees were reasonable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We consider each requirement in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>A. <em>Gardner\u2019s Subject Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">For purposes of the fee reimbursement provision, a \u201csubject\u201d is a person who \u201cat the time of incurring the fees involved in the application, knew that his conduct was within th[e] scope [of an investigation] in such a fashion that \u2018the independent counsel might reasonably be expected to point the finger of accusation\u2019 at him.\u201d <em>Shultz, </em>8 F.3d at 850 (quoting <em>In re North (Dutton Fee Application), 11 F.3d </em>1075, 1078 (D.C.Cir.1993) (per curiam)). In other words, the term \u201csubject\u201d is roughly equivalent to \u201cpotential defendant\u201d, <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Gardner falls squarely within the definition of \u201csubject.\u201d He retained counsel only after the Independent Counsel issued a grand jury subpoena designating him as a subject of its investigation on July 16, 1991. At the time he retained counsel, therefore, Gardner reasonably believed \u201cthat there was a realistic possibility that he would become a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1079. His status as subject continued until December 1992, when two of his former CIA colleagues, Clair George and Duane Clarridge, received presidential pardons. Only at this time did the Independent Counsel discount the prospect of a possible future indictment against Gardner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">B. <em>\u201cBut For\u201d Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We also have no trouble concluding that Gardner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cwould not have been incurred <em>but for </em>the requirements of [the Act].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1) (emphasis added). The purpose of the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement is to ensure that individuals \u201c \u201cwho are investigated by independent counsels will be subject only to paying those attorneys\u2019 fees that would normally be paid by private citizens being investigated for the same offense by\u2019 federal executive components such as the United States Attorney.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1080 (quoting <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d 451, 452-53 (D.C.Cir.1989)). Here, Gardner incurred attorneys\u2019 fees as a consequence of the Independent Counsel\u2019s determination \u201cto treat as a criminal conspiracy efforts to circumvent the <em>Boland </em>Amendments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Boland </em>Amendments were riders to certain defense appropriations acts that proscribed the CIA from funding or participating in efforts to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. <em>See </em>Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1983, Pub.L. No. 97-377, 96 Stat. 1833, 1865 (1982). As we determined in <em>Dutton, 11 F.3d </em>at 1080, however, \u201cexecutive branch authorities never treated circumvention of the <em>Boland </em>Amendments as having criminal consequences.\u201d Nor would \u201ca politically appointed Attorney General ... have subjected such attempts to criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hence, Gardner would never have incurred attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cbut for\u201d the appointment of an independent counsel under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">\n<em>C.Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">In addition to the above requirements, we must also determine \u201cwhether [Gardner\u2019s] attorney[ ] charged a reasonable hourly rate, whether the time expended by the attorney[] on the case was reasonable, and whether the foregoing requirements are adequately documented.\u201d <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d 1192, 1201 (D.C.Cir.1990) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">We note initially that the $210 to $220 hourly rates charged by Gardner\u2019s attorney, John F. Conroy, were not unreasonable. Indeed, as attested by independent affidavit, these rates comport with \u201cprevailing community standards\u201d and are well within the realm of reasonableness. <em>See Shultz, 8 </em>F.3d at 851-52 (approving rates in excess of $300).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>However, several expense items require adjustment for reasonableness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act allows reimbursement only for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred <em>during </em>the Independent Counsel investigation, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1), that were \u201creasonably related to a defense to such investigation.\u201d <em>In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d 982, 993 (D.C.Cir.1989) (per curiam); <em>see In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d 1415, 1427 (D.C.Cir.1989) (per curiam) (holding that the Act provides recovery only for those fees \u201crendered in asserting the <em>merits </em>of the subject\u2019s defense against the criminal charges being investigated\u201d). We must therefore disallow the $3,108 in fees incurred by Gardner in connection with his attorney\u2019s efforts to secure him an appointment with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Although these efforts were undoubtedly stymied by his elevation to \u201csubject\u201d status in the Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation, they were not reasonably related to his <em>defense to </em>that investigation. <em>In re North (Gadd Fee Application), </em>12 F.3d 252, 256 (D.C.Cir.1994) (per curiam) (holding that fees incurred in representing petitioner \u201cin connection with congressional investigations rather than the Independent Counsel investigation\u201d were not reimbursable under the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Likewise, we must disallow $550 in fees billed by Gardner\u2019s attorney for discussing his case with newspaper reporters. As we have previously held, \u201c[m]edia related activity has no bearing on the operation of an independent counsel\u2019s investigation and thus is not reasonably related to a defense to such investigation.\u201d <em>In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d at 994; <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Nor can we say that the $10,141.96 fee billed for the \u201cdefensive monitoring\u201d of the ongoing prosecution of Clair George was reasonably related to Gardner\u2019s defense. Section 593(f) provides reimbursement only for fees reasonably incurred by an individual in \u201cdefense to\u201d an Independent Counsel\u2019s investigation. <em>See Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078; <em>In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d at 1427. We do not doubt that \u201cdefensive monitoring\u201d may have seemed a reasonable expense from Gardner\u2019s perspective. A more objective measure is required, however. Absent more explicit congressional guidance than the Act provides, we can not ask the taxpayers to reimburse him for this expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Gardner also requests reimbursement for $23,127.53 in attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in responding to the Independent Counsel\u2019s Final Report. Although Gardner had a statutory right to comment on the Report to protect his reputation, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 594(d)(2), we find that the number of hours expended by his attorneys in this regard (90.5) was unreasonably high. In <em>In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d at 994, this court allowed reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred responding to an Independent Counsel\u2019s Final Report. There, however, the amount billed in connection with responding to the Report ($3,650) was small in proportion to the overall amount of fees claimed ($112,-281.56) and awarded ($72,875.06). <em>See id. </em>at 983, 994, 998. Here, by contrast, the fees billed by Gardner\u2019s attorney for responding to the Final Report amount to more than one-fourth of the total fees incurred. Even so, we are cognizant of the unique circumstances of the Walsh investigation. Walsh\u2019s Final Report was lengthy and complex and cast a number of aspersions on Gardner, aspersions to which he deserved a right to respond in detail. We will therefore reduce the fees requested for responding to the Final Report only by one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">Finally, our review of Gardner\u2019s application discloses several expenses that are inadequately documented. Many of the billing entries on which the fee request is based contain highly imprecise descriptions of the work performed, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cvarious telephone conferences.\u201d Moreover, these entries are rarely itemized by task, making it impossible to determine how much time to allocate to each task. <em>In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d at 1428-29. Consequently, we are unable to meaningfully evaluate \u201cthe reasonableness of the billings, either as to the necessity of the particular service or the [total] amount of time expended on a given legal task,\u201d <em>In re Sealed Case, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>890 F.2d at 455. We therefore impose a ten percent reduction on Gardner\u2019s final fee award. <em>In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d at 1204-05 (imposing a ten percent reduction for inadequately documented billings); <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>890 F.2d at 455-56 (same); <em>cf. Gadd, </em>12 F.3d at 257 (imposing a thirty percent reduction where billings included both \u201cinadequately justified fees and the dual additional possibility of unjustifiable time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In accordance with the above analysis, the award shall reflect the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">1.Disallow $3,108 in attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection with attempts to secure Gardner\u2019s appointment with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">2. Disallow $550 in fees for media related activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">3. Disallow $10,141.96 in fees for \u201cdefensive monitoring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">4. Reduce fees for responding to the Independent Counsel\u2019s Final Report by half, or $11,563.77.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">5. After all specific deductions are made, reduce the remaining fees by ten percent to disallow billings for attorneys\u2019 services that were inadequately documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">For reasons set forth above, it is ordered that petitioner be awarded $53,120.74 in reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and exp\u00e9nses. The computation is set forth in the Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Total Fee Request Including Expenses $84,386.77</p>\n<p id=\"AA8\">Specific Deductions in Opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"A8p\">1.

In his original application for fees, Gardner sought $94,413.49 in attorneys' fees and expenses. However, as Gardner concedes, this figure was based on an erroneous computation. The new figure is accounted for by increasing the \"fees for fees\u201d deduction in the original application to $19,989.00, deducting $91.72 for attorney meals, and increasing the fees for commenting on the Final Report to $23,127.53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-20\">.
