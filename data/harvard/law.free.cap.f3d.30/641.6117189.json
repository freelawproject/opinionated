The bankruptcy court and district court said no. Following our <em>de novo </em>review, we agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-16\">Debtor, Marie Louise Brocato, sought relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. She claimed a homestead exemption for her residence in New Orleans which she owns in indivisi\u00f3n with Mary Louise Singleton. The trustee objected contending that the homestead exemption provided by Article 12 \u00a7 9 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974, and Title 20 Section 1 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes is not available for property owned in indivisi\u00f3n with another not the debtor\u2019s spouse. The bankruptcy court and district court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-18\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-19\">Article 12 Section 9 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-20\">\u201cThe Legislature shall provide by law for exemptions from seizure and sale, as well as waivers of and exclusions from such exemptions. The exemption shall extend to at least fifteen thousand dollars in value of a homestead, as provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-21\">Title 20 Section 1 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-22\">A. The Bona fide homestead, consisting of a tract of land or two or more tracts of land with a residence on the one tract or a field, pasture, or garden on the other tract or tracts, not exceeding one hundred sixty acres, buildings and appurtenances, whether rural or urban, owned, and occupied by any person, is exempt from any seizure and ale under any writ, mandate or process whatsoever, except as provided by Subsections C and D of this Section. This exemption extends to fifteen thousand dollars in value of a homestead. It shall extend to the surviving spouse or minor children of a deceased owner and shall apply when the homestead is occupied as such and title to it is in either the husband or wife but not to more than one homestead owned by the husband or the wife. The exemption shall continue to apply to a homestead otherwise eligible while owned in indivisi\u00f3n by the spouses, and occupied by either of them, when the community property regime of which the homestead is a part is dissolved by judgment which so provides, pursuant to Articles 155, 159, or 2375 of the Louisiana Civil Code. If either spouse becomes the sole owner and continues to occupy the homestead as such, the exemption as to that spouse shall be deemed to have continued uninterrupted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-23\">The Louisiana Supreme Court has not addressed the question since adoption of the 1974 Constitution. We examine and give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cproper regard\u201d to the decisions of other Louisiana courts which have. <em>Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, </em>387 U.S. 456, 465, 87 S.Ct. 1776, 1783, 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967). The Supreme Court has addressed the issue under earlier Constitution. We find an unbroken line of Louisiana appellate court decisions beginning with <em>Henderson v. Hoy, </em>26 La. Ann. 156 (1874), and ending with <em>Gulfco Finance Co. v. Browder, </em>482 So.2d 1019 (La. App. 3rd Cir.1986), squarely holding that property owned in indivisi\u00f3n with others than a spouse and children of that spouse in a community regime, cannot qualify for the homestead exemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">Appellant argues that <em>Gulfco </em>is wrongly decided because the law changed with the 1974 Constitution. It has, but not in this regard. We agree with the Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-5\">\u201c... the change in the law relates to the old requirement that a party had to be the head of a household or have persons dependent on him for support. This is no longer a requirement. Now, \u2018any person\u2019 may claim the exemption if he owns and occupies the property. In addition, the exempted value has changed.\u201d <em>Gulfco, </em>482 So.2d at 1021.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">As Appellee points out, to read the phrase \u201cany person\u201d in the statute as broadly as Appellant does renders much of the statute surplusage. Appellant argues that the words \u201cany person\u201d indicate that anyone with a degree of ownership who occupies the property as their home may claim the exemption. But that ignores the further language in the statute which extends the exemption to \u201ca homestead otherwise eligible while owned in indivisi\u00f3n by the spouses, and occupied by either of them.... \u201d If the phrase \u201cowned ... by any person ...\u201d included an owner in indivisi\u00f3n, then the specific extension to spouses and children in a community property regime would be unnecessary. Additionally, to accept Appellant\u2019s reading of \u201cany person\u201d would necessarily include juridical persons and even Appellant does not contend for that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">. Additional cases from both the Supreme and appellate courts are found collected in <em>Gulfco, </em>482 So.2d at 1020.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
