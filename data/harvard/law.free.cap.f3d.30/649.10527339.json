Hilli-ard, brought.a civil rights action against Barbara Ferguson, Superintendent of the Orleans Parish School Board, and the Orleans Parish School Board pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3). The district court entered summary judgment for the defendants. We affirm that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-26\">In early 1992, Hilliard applied for a job with Project Independence, which was part of the Adult Education Program of the Orleans Parish School System. He contends that James Raby, a coordinator at Project Independence, told him that his application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>would be denied because Board policy precluded consideration of applicants with prior felony convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hilliard acknowledges, however, that Raby also told him that, irrespective of his prior conviction, no available positions existed with the Adult Education Program. Raby recommended that Hilliard apply directly to the Orleans Parish School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Hilliard took that advice and submitted his application to the Board. In response, the Board sent him a brochure outlining Board policies. The pamphlet, \u201cApplication Procedures for a Teaching Position with the New Orleans Public Schools\u201d stated that \u201cFelony convictions will automatically eliminate an applicant from consideration.\u201d Later, the Board informed Hilliard that it hired only certified applicants (Hilliard still needed to pass the National Teacher\u2019s Exam).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">While updating his application, Hilliard wrote to the Board\u2019s personnel director. In his letter, Hilliard stated his belief that the Board\u2019s automatic elimination of convicted felons from the application process violated federal law. The personnel director informed Hilliard that his accusation was premature because no decision had yet been reached on Hilliard\u2019s application. Moreover, the letter informed Hilliard that he would nonetheless be interviewed and should, at that time, explain the details of his conviction. After the interview, a decision as to Hilliard\u2019s suitability would be reached.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Hilliard filed suit in federal court alleging that Ferguson and the Board violated his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights by denying him employment on the basis of his status as a convicted felon. He also alleged that the Board\u2019s policy on this matter constituted a conspiracy to deprive members of his class (convicted felons) of their rights to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on both claims. As to the former, the defendants argued that Board policy does not exclude all felons from employment. The Board contends (and Hilliard admitted) that the statement in the pamphlet that all convicted felons are automatically eliminated was made in error. Instead, the Board\u2019s actual and long-standing policy requires the superintendent to review the facts and circumstances of each applicant\u2019s felony conviction. Then, an individualized determination as to the suitability of the candidate is made. Factors considered include the crime, the position sought, and evidence of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">\u00d3n Hilliard\u2019s second claim, the defendants argued that they were entitled to summary judgment because a corporation cannot conspire with its own agents or employees. In this case, they contend, the alleged conspiracy involved Ferguson, an employee or agent of the board, and the Board itself. These are all factions of the same legal entity: The School Board. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion as to both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>We look to see first, whether a disputed issue of material fact exists and, second, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, to defeat the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Hilliard must have set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our examination, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to Hilliard, the non-moving party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Section 1983 provides a cause of action against \u201c[e]very person who, under color of any statute ... of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws_\u201d Moreover, section 1983 provides a cause of action against local governmental units when the allegedly improper action was taken pursuant to municipal policy or custom.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Hilliard\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim that the Board policy excluding from consideration any convicted felon violates his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights is contradicted by his own testimony. He testified at his deposition that Raby never told him that his felony conviction automatically disqualified him for a position. In fact, Hilliard acknowledged at his deposition that the actual Board policy requires a case-by-case examination into the circumstances of each felon\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, subject to special clearance from the Orleans Parish Department of Personnel, a convicted felon may be eligible for employment. This admission precludes a finding of any disputed issue of fact as to the Board\u2019s official policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Having ascertained the Board\u2019s actual policy, we must determine whether it runs afoul of the applicable legal standard. It does not. Because the \u201cright to hold public employment is not a recognized fundamental right,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and convicted felons are not a constitutionally protected suspect class,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> no heightened level of scrutiny applies. Instead, we apply the rational basis test. We examine the Board\u2019s policy to determine whether it bears \u201ca rational relationship to a legitimate end\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">The Board\u2019s policy easily satisfies that minimal threshold. Looking a little deeper into a convicted felon\u2019s background and, in particular, at the circumstances of the conviction is rationally related to serve the legitimate interest in protecting the schoolchildren within that teacher\u2019s proximity and care.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We would expect nothing less. The policy serves to ensure that the highest degree possible of educational services will be provided to the children of Orleans Parish within a safe and secure environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"Agqc\">Hilliard also alleges a conspiracy between Ferguson and the Board to deprive him of his civil rights. To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3), a plaintiff must allege: (1) a conspiracy involving two or more persons; (2) for the purpose of depriving, directly or indirectly, a person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws; and (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy; (4) which causes injury to a person or property, or a deprivation of any right or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>privilege of a citizen of the United States.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In so doing, the plaintiff must show that the conspiracy was motivated by a class-based animus.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The district court concluded that Hil-liard had failed to show that the conspiracy involved two or more persons. That conclusion is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">It is a long-standing rule in this circuit that a \u201ccorporation cannot conspire with itself any more than a private individual can, and it is the general rule that the acts of the agent are the acts of the corporation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In this case, we apply that rule to the School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In <em>Hull v. Cuyahoga Valley Joint Vocational Sch. Dist.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit did exactly that. In <em>Hull, </em>the court applied our holding in <em>Nelson </em>to a \u00a7 1985(3) claim alleging a similar conspiracy involving the Cuyahoga School Board. The plaintiff in <em>Hull </em>alleged that the Cuyahoga School Superintendent conspired with the executive director of the district and a school administrator. All were employees of the School Board. The court held that, as all were members of the same collective entity, the conspiracy did not involve two or more people.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Three district court cases in this Circuit have reached the same conclusion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We do so as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">We do not overlook the ways in which a school board is unique and distinct from a corporation. A corporation maintains a unified face in the eyes of the law. It is in that vein that we say that a corporation is a person. A school board, however, is a collection of individuals, some fill elected positions, some are salaried workers. Still, that distinction is not dispositive. All are employees of the school board. We follow the reasoning of the other courts on this question and hold that a school board and its employees constitute a single legal entity which is incapable of conspiring with itself for the purposes of \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">VL</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">We are convinced that Hilliard did not receive an offer of employment because no positions for which he was qualified and certified were available. The plaintiff is resting on \u201cmere allegations or denials\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in his effort to show that something more serious or sinister was involved. This he may not do. Judgment for the defendants was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">.
