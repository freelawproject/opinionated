We review for errors of law. <em>Koster Remodeling &amp; Construction, Inc. v. Jataka, </em>155 Or App 142, 145, 963 P2d 726 (1998) (entitlement to attorney fees is a legal question). We conclude that plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees on one of the two claims on which she sought fees. We therefore reverse and remand for a determination of reasonable fees to be awarded to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">This case arises out of an incident in which plaintiff, while patronizing defendants\u2019 store, was detained by defendants\u2019 employees and then arrested by police for suspected shoplifting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff later was prosecuted for theft and was acquitted. After the acquittal, plaintiffs attorney wrote defendants a letter demanding $4,000 to settle plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages allegedly caused by defendants\u2019 actions. Plaintiff prepared a single letter, identical in its substance, and sent it first to the store owner and then, about two weeks later, to the store\u2019s manager. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\u201cDear [Store Manager][Store Owner],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201cThis office represents Ms. Helen Beers in conjunction with an incident that occurred at your store located at 1355 NW 185th Avenue, Hillsboro, Oregon on February 23,1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">\u201cOn that dat\u00e9 Mrs. Beers was detained, and subsequently falsely arrested and imprisoned, at the instance of your employees or agents. Despite a reasonable explanation following the original detention Mrs. Beers was questioned, intimidated, humiliated and imprisoned and her liberty restrained for no just cause. As a result she suffered humiliation, embarrassment, was required to obtain counsel to defend herself and was required to appear in court and endure a trial. As a result of all of the above demand is hereby made against Craft Warehouse for compensation in the sum of $4,000. If payment is not received forthwith Mrs. Beers will file <em>a lawsuit </em>against your company seeking such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>damages, plus her attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in prosecuting such action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">\u201cPlease contact me immediately in response to this demand. I am enclosing an extra copy of this letter to be provided to your insurance representative, if coverage for this type of incident is available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">(Emphasis added.) The letter then concluded with plaintiffs attorney\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Defendants declined to settle. Plaintiff then filed two separate actions, one alleging false imprisonment and the other alleging malicious prosecution, each seeking damages of $4,000. Although the two actions began as separate proceedings, eventually they were consolidated and were submitted to mandatory arbitration. <em>See </em>ORS 36.405. The arbitrator awarded plaintiff $4,000 on each claim. Plaintiff sought attorney fees under ORS 20.080.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">In a written order denying the fee request, the arbitrator first indicated that he agreed with defendants\u2019 view of plaintiffs demand letter. Defendants had asserted that the letter, although sent to both the store manager and the store owner, was only a \u201csingle, pre-suit demand for payment of damages in the amount of $4,000\u201d and it therefore did \u201cnot satisfy the requirements of ORS 20.080 for the two lawsuits subsequently filed by plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The arbitrator further observed that, if the letters were construed as plaintiff argued they should <em>be </em>\u2014 i.e., each letter serving as a separate demand on each of plaintiffs two causes of action \u2014 then the total amount of the settlement demand was $8,000. The arbitrator determined that, under either view, plaintiff was not entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ORS 20.080(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">\u201cIn any action for damages for an injury or wrong to the person or property, or both, of another where the amount pleaded is $4,000 or less, and the plaintiff prevails in the action, there shall be taxed and allowed to the plaintiff, at trial and on appeal, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees for the prosecution of the action, if the court finds that written demand for the payment of such claim was made on the defendant not less that 10 days before the commencement of the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The statute applies in \u201cany action for damages\u201d to person or property where the amount pleaded is $4,000 or less. To be entitled to a prevailing party attorney fee award, the plaintiff, not less than 10 days before commencing the action, must make a written demand for payment of \u201csuch claim.\u201d Plaintiff contends that the demand letter in this case satisfied the statute because it \u201ceffectively was a demand indicating that <em>both causes of action </em>could be settled for a total of $4,000.00.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defendants, in response, dispute plaintiffs characterization of her pretrial demand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">\u201cEither there was one demand for $4,000 followed by two lawsuits alleging $8,000 in damages; or there were two demands each seeking $4,000 for a total of $8,000. Either way, the pre-filing demand requirement of ORS 20.080 has not been met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">\u201cIf the two letters were a single demand notifying defendants that the entire matter could be resolved for $4,000, then the demand may have complied with the statutory requirements, [but] the ultimate filing of two actions <em>each </em>seeking $4,000 runs afoul of the statute. If, however, the two letters constitute separate demands, then as the arbitrator concluded, the pre-suit demand was in reality a demand for $8,000, an amount in excess of the statutory $4,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">We agree that the most reasonable view of the demand letter is that it was a single, pre-suit demand seeking $4,000 for a single claim, not $4,000 for two claims. The identical text of the twice-mailed letter demands a sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>$4,000 as a result of plaintiff\u2019s detention, arrest, and prosecution. The letter then advises that, if the $4,000 is not paid, then plaintiff will file <em>\u201ca </em>lawsuit,\u201d not two or several, in which plaintiff will seek \u201csuch damages.\u201d No person receiving the letter reasonably would understand from it that plaintiff was asserting multiple claims for damages based on the incident, was threatening to file multiple lawsuits, and was willing to settle the multiple claims for a single $4,000 payment. Plaintiffs argument to the contrary evidently is based only on the fact that plaintiff sent the letter twice, first to the store owner and then to the store manager. The number of people served with the letter does not alter its essential substance, however. Whether it was mailed to one, two, or a dozen agents of defendants\u2019 business, it substantively provided notice of only one threatened action for damages and a demand to settle for $4,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Given the demand contained in the letter, what is the consequence for plaintiffs attorney fee request? Contrary to defendants\u2019 position and the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion, the answer is not that plaintiff has no entitlement whatsoever to an attorney fee award. Had plaintiff, after sending the letters, filed only one action (either for false imprisonment or for malicious prosecution) and obtained a judgment for $4,000 in that one action, plaintiff would be entitled under the statute to an award of attorney fees. No one contends otherwise. What, then, if plaintiff had filed two separate actions, without consolidating them as in this case? Plaintiff would be entitled to attorney fees in one of the two. If plaintiff then sought fees after prevailing in both actions, defendants would be able to resist an award in <em>one </em>\u2014 but <em>not in both </em>\u2014 on the ground that plaintiff did not make a written pre-trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>demand as to both actions. Nothing in ORS 20.080(1) suggests a different result merely because the separate actions were consolidated for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Consequently, we hold that plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees on one, but not both, of her consolidated claims. Accordingly, plaintiff on remand should designate the claim on which she seeks fees pursuant to ORS 20.080, and the trial court should award a reasonable amount of fees attributable to that claim. <em>See generally Bennett v. Baugh, </em>164 Or App 243,990 P2d 917 (1999) (discussing standards for apportionment of attorney fees requests).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> Defendants include Jeson Enterprises, dba Craft Warehouse, and its officers and shareholders. For convenience, we refer to those parties as \u201cdefendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\"> More specifically, defendants argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\u201cIn this case plaintiff made a single, pre-suit demand for payment of damages in the amount of $4,000. That demand was contained in a letter sent by plaintiffs counsel to both the manager of defendants\u2019 store on September 19, 1996, and the owner of the business on September 6,1996. Those letters, which are identical in their language, demandredl damages of $4,000. Subsequently, plaintiff filed <em>two </em>lawsuits \u2014 one alleging a claim for false imprisonment; the other claiming malicious <em>prosecution </em>\u2014 each seeking damages of $4,000 and attorney fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">(Emphasis in original.) Defendants contended that because the letter was a single pre-suit demand on a single claim, the statute was not satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\"> Judge Wollheim adopts plaintiffs characterization of the letter \u2014 that is, that the demand letter was an offer to settle <em>two </em>claims for damages for a single settlement amount. 165 Or App at 733-34 (Wollheim, J., concurring in part, dissentingin part). Given the substance of the letter, that view is particularly implausible. If, as plaintiff argues, the demand letter provided notice <em>o\u00ed both </em>the false imprisonment and malicious prosecution claims, despite the threat to file only a single lawsuit, then the twice-mailed letter necessarily also constituted a demand for a settlement of $4,000 on <em>each </em>claim, and thus sought a total settlement of $8,000 and exceeded the limit in ORS 20.080(1). Because we do not accept plaintiffs view of the demand letter, it is not necessary to decide whether the damages in plaintiffs two complaints must be aggregated for purposes of testing the amount pleaded against limit in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\"> Judge Warden, although sharing our view of the demand letter, concludes that plaintiff is not entitled to any award of attorney fees under ORS 20.080 because she inappropriately split a single cause of action into two causes of action. 165 Or App at 737 (Warden, J., dissenting). The rule against splitting a claim arises in connection with the judicially crafted claim preclusion doctrine. It requires a plaintiff to bring all claims arising from the same factual transaction or circumstance in a single action to avoid having a judgment in a first action be binding in any subsequent action. <em>See generally Peterson v. Temple, </em>323 Or 322, 327, 918 P2d 413 (1996). Here, there has never been a dispute over the separately actionable nature of plaintiffs claims. The gravamen of false imprisonment is the imposition of restraint on a person\u2019s freedom of movement without legal process; the gravamen of malicious prosecution is the wrongful initiation of unwarranted legal proceedings against a person. <em>See generally Hiber v. Creditors Collection Service, </em>154 Or App 408, 413, 418-19, 961 P2d 898, <em>rev den </em>327 Or 621 (1998). The two actions are distinct torts, involving different elements, different injuries, and potentially different damages. Depending on the facts involved, the two may be alternative theories of liability for a single tortious act <em>(i.e., </em>where the existence of legal authority for an arrest is disputed), or cumulative theories based on sequential acts by a defendant <em>(i.e., </em>first detaining someone without lawful process or authority and later playing an actionable role in initiating legal proceedings against the person earlier detained). At least on the record before us, and given the lack of any dispute over the point, we have no basis to conclude that that plaintiff improperly split a single cause of action in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b772-6\">EDMONDS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"At9\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">According to the majority, the sending of two copies of a single demand letter does not entitle plaintiff to an award of attorney fees on more than one action under ORS 20.080(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 agree. The statute is aimed at notifying putative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>defendants so they can settle when the amount sought is $4,000 or less. The majority then holds that plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees on one action under the statute even though plaintiff subsequently filed two separate actions for $4,000 each that were eventually consolidated for trial. It reasons that, even without consolidation, plaintiff would have been entitled to attorney fees under the statute on only one of the two actions because plaintiff did not make a written demand as to both actions. It follows, according to the majority, that the statute does not require a different result merely because the separate actions are consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">I agree with the majority\u2019s result in this case only because plaintiffs actions are based on discrete operative facts and plaintiff effectively sent only one notice. If plaintiffs causes of action had been based on the same set of operative facts, then I would hold that her pleading of aggregate claims of damages in excess of $4,000 would disqualify her from any entitlement to attorney fees under the statute. Under those circumstances, the pleading of multiple causes of aggregate damage claims in excess of $4,000, whether in a single complaint or multiple complaints, are subject to ORS 20.080\u2019s limitation, unless pled alternatively in an amount that complies with the statutory limit. In her complaint for false imprisonment, plaintiff alleges, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201cOn or about February 23,1995, defendants, through their agents and employees, detained plaintiff on the stated grounds that they believed plaintiff had committed theft. Following reasonable explanation of the circumstances by plaintiff, defendants\u2019 agents and employees then unreasonably continued to detain and falsely imprison plaintiff, to severely \u2018grill\u2019 or attempt to intimidate plaintiff and tried to force her to admit to a crime that she did not commit, causing plaintiff extreme humiliation, embarrassment, severe anxiety and mental anguish, and further required her to subsequently appear in court and endure a trial, at which time she was found not guilty. All of the above caused plaintiff noneconomic damages in the sum of $4,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>In her other complaint for \u201cmalicious prosecution,\u201d plaintiff alleges, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">\u201c6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">\u201cOn or about February 23,1995, plaintiff was caused to be arrested and charged with a crime by defendants\u2019 employees and agents. Based on the conduct of defendants\u2019 agents, plaintiff was formally charged, went through trial and was acquitted of all charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201c7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cDespite being informed by plaintiff of the circumstances surrounding her detention, defendants\u2019 employees and agents, without taking any additional steps to verify the truth or accuracy of plaintiffs explanation, willfully and maliciously caused plaintiff to be charged and prosecuted with the crime of\u2018Theft III[.\u2019l Plaintiff was required to hire an attorney to represent her, was compelled to attend a formal trial, obtain evidence and witnesses to confirm her testimony to prove her innocence, subjecting plaintiff to embarrassment, humiliation, interference with her normal and usual activities, and subjecting her to scorn and ridicule by acquaintances. All of the above was to her nonecon-omic damage in the sum of $4,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s false imprisonment action focuses, for the most part, on her detention for shoplifting. In contrast, her malicious prosecution claim focuses on what occurred <em>after her detention </em>at the store when defendants pursued the prosecution of her in court. In other words, defendants committed an additional tort by prosecuting her after detaining her wrongfully. Her damages resulting from the detention are discrete from the damages suffered as a result of the prosecution. That distinction is important because ORS 20.080 should not be understood to permit a plaintiff to plead multiple claims and recover amounts in excess of the statutory limit, of $4,000, but yet be entitled to attorney fees under the statute when the gravamen of the claims arise out of the same operative facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">The policy underlying ORS 20.080 \u201cis to encourage settlement of small claims, to prevent insurance companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>and tortfeasors from refusing to pay just claims, and to discourage plaintiffs from inflating their claims.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. The Holland, Inc., </em>328 Or 440, 446, 980 P2d 672 (1999). It is counter-intuitive to that policy to permit the award of attorney fees when the recovery of damages is based on liability arising out of the same set of operative facts and the recovery exceeds the $4,000 limit of the statute merely because the plaintiff has pled the claim in separate causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">When the Supreme Court interprets a statute, that interpretation becomes part of the statute as if it were written into the statute at the time of its enactment, <em>Holcomb v. Sunderland, </em>321 Or 99,105, 894 P2d 457 (1995), and we are bound by the court\u2019s interpretation. In my view, the outcome of this case is controlled by the juxtaposition of two Supreme Court cases interpreting ORS 20.080, <em>Atkinson Corp. v. Lumbermen\u2019s Cas. Co., </em>236 Or 405, 389 P2d 32 (1964), and <em>Johnson v. White, </em>249 Or 461, 439 P2d 8 (1968). <em>Atkinson </em>involved multiple actions arising out of multiple incidents of paint damage to vehicles. The damages allegedly occurred during the painting of a bridge over a several month period. The cars crossing a nearby bridge were damaged by the paint spray. The defendant was the insurer of all of the damaged vehicles. The court held that each claim of damage, if under the statutory limit, could support a claim for attorney fees under ORS 20.080, whether pled as a separate actions or pled as separate counts in a single action. <em>Atkinson, </em>236 Or at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><em>Atkinson </em>was followed by <em>Johnson, </em>in which counts for personal injury and property damage arising out of the same tortious conduct were pled in the same action. The property damage claim was under the statutory limit, but the personal injury claim exceeded the limit. The plaintiff argued, based on <em>Atkinson, </em>that the claims should not be aggregated for purposes of the limit. The court rejected that argument, suggesting that, although interpreting the statute in that manner could lead to a multiplicity of actions being filed, that potential problem was for the legislature to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">There is nothing in the language of ORS 20.080 that suggests that the legislature had multiple actions in mind when it promulgated the statute. The statute refers to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>\u201caction,\u201d not \u201cactions.\u201d Based on its plain language, the statute applies to \u201cany action * * * where the amount pleaded is $4,000 or less.\u201d The statute also contemplates the possibility that certain multiple claims can be alleged in the \u201caction.\u201d It provides for attorney fees \u201c[i]n any action * * * for an injury or wrong to the person or property, or both.\u201d The \u201cor both\u201d language evidences a recognition by the legislature that more than one claim for injury or damage may arise out of the same incident and that for purposes of the monetary limitation of the statute, they are to be treated in a combined manner. The language of the statute says nothing about pleading requirements. It focuses only on the total amounts pled in an \u201caction,\u201d and, if they exceed $4,000, then the statute eliminates the opportunity for an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Accordingly, the <em>Atkinson </em>court had it right. Each paint damage incident constituted a separate set of operative facts that could have given rise to discrete actions by the owners of the vehicles. Under the statute, attorney fees were available on each discrete damage claim, and it mattered not whether the claims were brought in a single action or multiple actions. The court\u2019s result in <em>Johnson </em>was also correct. There, a single tort gave rise to the plaintiffs claims for personal injury and property damage. The language of the statute plainly contemplates the aggregation of personal injury and property damage claims arising out of the same operative facts giving rise to liability for purposes of the monetary limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In <em>Steele v. A &amp; B Automotive &amp; Towing Services, Inc., </em>135 Or App 632, 899 P2d 1206 (1995), we extended the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Johnson </em>to an action in which the plaintiff sued the defendant in a single action with separate counts to recover the value of personal property and for damages under the Unfair Debt Collection Practices Act because of the defendant\u2019s subsequent efforts to collect towing and storage costs. Although the plaintiffs claims arose from discrete sets of operative facts, we aggregated the total amounts alleged in the separate counts for purposes of the monetary limitation of ORS 20.080. In <em>Steele, </em>we went astray by extending the rationale of <em>Johnson to </em>two sets of operative facts giving rise to separate claims. Although we acknowledged in <em>Steele </em>that <em>Johnson </em>did not address the propriety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>aggregating claims from different sets of operative facts, we reasoned that, because the <em>Johnson </em>court recognized that the wording of the statute could cause a multiplicity of actions, the legislature must have intended that the statutory limit could be avoided by pleading multiple actions. However, the language from <em>Johnson, </em>on which we relied in <em>Steele, </em>was in response to an argument made by the plaintiff based on the holding <em>in Atkinson. </em>The plaintiff in <em>Johnson </em>argued that the holding in <em>Atkinson </em>meant that each count in an action that was under the statutory limit could be the subject of an award of attorney fees if the plaintiff prevailed and that no aggregation of the total amounts plead was ever required under the statute. The <em>Johnson </em>court said that the plaintiffs interpretation of <em>Atkinson, </em>a case involving multiple sets of operative facts, was too broad. Thus, the <em>Johnson </em>court\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs interpretation <em>ofAtkinson, </em>must be understood in light of the fact that <em>Johnson </em>concerned a single set of operative facts. Accordingly, we were wrong to have applied the holding in <em>Johnson </em>in <em>Steele, </em>which, like <em>Atkinson, </em>involved separate sets of operative facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">This case is also like the facts in <em>Atkinson. </em>Plaintiff pled different operative facts in each action. The fact that her causes of action were consolidated for trial makes no difference to the analysis. Because plaintiff was making discrete claims against defendants, she was required to satisfy the statutory requirements for each cause of action as a predicate to the recovery of attorney fees under ORS 20.080. Her failure to do so defeats one of her claims for attorney fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\"> ORS 20.080(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">\u201cIn any action for damages for an injury or wrong to the person or property, or both, of another where the amount pleaded is $4,000 or less, and the plaintiff prevails in the action, there shall be taxed and allowed to the plaintiff, at trial and on appeal, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the prosecution of the action, if the court finds that written demand for the payment of such claim was made on the defendant not less than 10 days before the commencement of the action!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b777-5\">WOLLHEIM, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_q\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">I concur in that part of the majority opinion that holds that plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees under ORS 20.080.

Instead, I would hold that plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees on both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The majority interprets the \u201cpre-suit demand [as] seeking $4,000 for a single claim, not $4,000 for two claims.\u201d 165 Or App at 726.1 disagree. The pre-suit demand clearly identifies two causes of action, one for false imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>and one for malicious prosecution.

Defendants had notice that they could settle two causes of action for a total of $4,000, causes of action that could, legally, be brought in two separate lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">I concede that the pre-suit demand stated that plaintiff would file <em>a </em>lawsuit. However, plaintiffs threat to file \u201ca lawsuit\u201d does not diminish notice to defendants of their opportunity to settle two causes of action for $4,000. First, even considering plaintiffs threat of \u201ca lawsuit,\u201d the letter identifies that a lawsuit will be filed for \u201csuch damages,\u201d not for \u201call of the above.\u201d Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, there is no necessary connection between the threat to file \u201ca lawsuit\u201d and the settlement demand of $4,000 for two causes of action. It is plausible to interpret that sentence as a threat to file \u201ca lawsuit\u201d for damages resulting out of either, both, or each of the claims identified above, and it does nothing to diminish notice to defendants that they could settle \u201call of the above\u201d for a total of $4,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Second, there is no express language in ORS 20.080 requiring a separate letter for each action filed or requiring identification of the number of lawsuits in which a plaintiff intends to pursue causes of action. The statute requires only a \u201cwritten demand\u201d for \u201csuch claim.\u201d \u201cSuch claim\u201d refers to \u201cany action\u201d requesting $4,000 or less in damages. <em>Landers v. E. Texas Motor Frt. Lines, </em>266 Or 473, 476, 513 P2d 1151 (1973). I read this requirement as the court in <em>Landers </em>read the damages requirement in the demand letter: that the letter must only provide sufficient notice \u201cto give the defendant an opportunity to settle the case.\u201d Id at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Support for this reading of ORS 20.080 comes from both the text of the statute and its purpose. The statute requires only that a plaintiff make a written demand concerning her claims for <em>any </em>action. That is distinguished from a requirement that a plaintiff make a demand concerning her claims in <em>each </em>action. The former requires that a written demand explain the claims that are subsequently pursued for $4,000 or less. The latter requires that a single written demand explain the claims that are subsequently pursued for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>a <em>total </em>of $4,000 or less. Plaintiff should not be penalized where she made a good faith reasonable offer to settle <em>all </em>claims for $4,000. Here, plaintiff made such an offer to settle, thereby furthering the statutory goal to encourage settlement. Plaintiff should not lose the benefit of ORS 20.080 because her claims were identified in a single demand. There is no requirement that plaintiff must barrage defendants with multiple pre-suit demands. And nothing in ORS 20.080 or the pre-suit demand can be interpreted as foreclosing plaintiff from her legally available choice to pursue two distinct lawsuits because she offered one low settlement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Last, defendants argue that failure to aggregate the two claims for relief would be contrary to the legislative intent because it would encourage a multiplicity of lawsuits and enable plaintiffs to make exorbitant demands and receive attorney fees. I disagree. The Supreme Court interpreted ORS 20.080 in <em>Johnson v. White, </em>249 Or 461, 464, 439 P2d 8 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\u201cIf the total demand, regardless of the number of <em>causes </em>of action, is [the statutory maximum] or less, attorney fees are allowable on each <em>cause </em>of action if plaintiff recovers and other requirements are met. If the total demand is over [the statutory maximum] attorney fees may not be allowed under any <em>cause of </em>action.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the purpose of ORS 20.080 is two-fold: The first purpose is to \u201cprevent insurance companies and others having liability for torts from refusing to settle and pay just claims therefor,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 462-63, and the second purpose is \u201ca warning to plaintiffs not to inflate small claims beyond just amounts, in order that the tort-feasor may in good faith make settlement of such claims without resorting to the courts,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 464. The court went on to note \u201c[t]he fact that the wording of the statute may cause a multiplicity of actions to be filed in some * * * cases * * * may be a reason for further amendment of the statute. But, that is of legislative, not judicial, concern.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Armstrong, J., joins in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> The offer to settle two claims before trial for $4,000, but to seek $4,000 for each claim if the offer is not accepted, should not be surprising to a retailer. Basically, plaintiff was willing to settle both claims, if there was no trial, for the wholesale price of $4,000. However, if plaintiff was forced to try both claims, then plaintiff would seek the retail price of $4,000 for each claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b780-4\">WARDEN, S. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZM\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Because I conclude (as did the arbitrator) that plaintiff improperly split her causes of action into two lawsuits in order to recover attorney fees, I dissent. In arriving at this conclusion, I rely on <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 24(1) (1982); <em>Drews v. EBI Companies, </em>310 Or 134, 795 P2d 531 (1990); and <em>Whitaker v. Bank of Newport, </em>313 Or 450, 836 P2d 695 (1992); <em>see Peterson v. Temple, </em>323 Or 322, 918 P2d 413 (1996) (decided before plaintiff filed complaints in this case). \u201c[A] plaintiff ordinarily is required to bring <em>all claims arising from the same factual transaction or circumstances in a single action.\u201d Peterson, </em>323 Or at 327 (emphasis added). Those authorities make it clear that the operative facts can be \u201ceither a single transaction or a connected series of transactions,\u201d <em>Whitaker, </em>313 Or at 455 (citations omitted), \u201cout of which the action or proceedings arose.\u201d <em>Drews, </em>310 Or at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The majority and concurring judges would allow plaintiff to recover attorney fees under ORS 20.080 on the basis of their shared conclusion that her two lawsuits did not arise out of the same operative facts; but they did, and even plaintiff appears to have recognized that they did. In her \u201cException to Arbitrator\u2019s Denial of Attorney Fees,\u201d she stated the facts underlying both her lawsuits as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">\u201cOn February 23, 1995, plaintiff Helen Beers was detained by the agents and employees of defendant Craft Warehouse based on the stated grounds they believed plaintiff had committed theft. Despite a reasonable explanation by plaintiff, she was detained and was eventually forced to appear and endure a criminal trial where she was found not guilty. On September 6,1996, plaintiff by letter to Jeson Enterprises, Inc., dba Craft Warehouse, requested compensation of $4000.00 for plaintiff being falsely arrested and imprisoned. * * * On September 19,1996, the identical letter was sent to the store manager where the incident took place. * * * These letters constituted a written demand of $4000.00 pursuant to ORS 20.080.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The single fact that caused defendant to detain plaintiff and to participate in the state\u2019s prosecution of her for theft was the setting off of defendant\u2019s security alarm system by an item in plaintiffs purse. Plaintiffs claim for damages for malicious prosecution was factually based and directly connected with her claim for damages for false imprisonment, both of which resulted from the security alarm incident. They were, for purposes of claim preclusion, <em>i.e., </em>claim splitting, a connected series of transactions. Because plaintiff sought and recovered more in aggregate in the two lawsuits than the $4,000 limit for awarding attorney fees under ORS 20.080, she may not recover attorney fees too.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">As the majority states, the demand letter \u201cwas a single, pre-suit demand seeking $4,000 for a single claim.\u201d 165 Or App at 726. As stated in her demand letter, the claim was for being \u201cdetained, and subsequently falsely arrested and imprisoned, * * * questioned, intimidated, humiliated and imprisoned\u201d from which \u201cshe suffered humiliation, embarrassment, [and] was required to obtain counsel to defend herself and was required to appear in court and endure a trial. As <em>a result of all of the above </em>demand is hereby made * * * for compensation in the sum of $4000.\u201d (Emphasis added.) When she filed two lawsuits demanding more than $4,000, based on this single demand, she put herself outside the purview of ORS 20.080(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">If plaintiffs claims had been filed separately in a single lawsuit, <em>i.e., </em>as separate claims or counts, then attorney fees would not be recoverable, even if she had demanded attorney fees in only one of them. <em>Johnson v. White, </em>249 Or 461, 439 P2d 8 (1968). However, the majority would reward her for separating her claims into two lawsuits and demanding attorney fees in both, based on a single demand, by allowing her to recover attorney fees in both claims and letting her choose in which she can justify the greater amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Neither the arbitrator nor the trial judge fell for plaintiffs ploy of dividing her claim into separate lawsuits. Unfortunately, most members of this court have.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Somewhat respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
