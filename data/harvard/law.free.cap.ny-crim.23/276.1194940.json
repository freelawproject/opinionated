W. Dunbar to the order of the defendant upon the Arcadian National Bank of Newark, N. Y. It appears that the defendant, a real estate agent, had found a purchaser for Dunbar\u2019s hotel at Yewark, and the question arose between them as to the amount of commissions the defendant was entitled to. He claimed $250. Dunbar finally offered him $200. This amount was at last agreed upon, and Dunbar drew the check in question and delivered the same to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>fendant, who thereupon drew and delivered to Dunbar a receipt, dated on that day, for $200, which recited that it was \u201cin full for sale of Newark hotel.\u201d This finally closed that transaction. The check became the property of the defendant and he had the right to present it to the bank and receive the money thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\">' \u2022 Dunbar testified that, after the defendant had handed him the receipt the defendant said he would play Dunbar a game of vpoker to see who should buy the supper for the four present. ,'\u201c I said \u2018 all right/ and beat him out for the suppers and we stood there talking \u25a0 and he said \u00a3 have you got any ready money ? \u2019 I said \u2018 I guess so/ and he said <em>\u2018 </em>Gee, I have got beat for the suppers and haven\u2019t any money and I want to borrow some \u2019 and I gave him $20.00 and he said \u00a3I will draw np another check for $180, and destroy this $200 check.\u2019 And ihe picked up something and tore it up and threw it in the waste basket, so the other check was given for $180.\u201d This took place at the defendant\u2019s office. Dunbar in his testimony also stated that they had played a game of poker for the purpose of determining whether the settlement should be for $250 or $200 and that he beat the defendant on that game and that thereupon the $200 check \"was drawn and delivered. This, however, is immaterial, for the reason that it appears distinctly from the testimony of both the defendant and Dunbar that the settlement was complete upon the delivery of the check and the return of the receipt therefor. Dunbar, upon his cross-examination, stated that all the card playing was done before the checks were signed, that is, the playing for the $50, the difference between the amount of commissions claimed by the defendant and that offered by Dunbar and for the suppers, but on his redirect he again states that after the $200 check had been delivered they <em>then </em>played for the suppers. The defendant testified, in substance, that there' Was no playing of cards for the purpose of determining the amount of commissions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>le should receive, but that was settled at a meeting between them between three and four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, at which an offer was made by Dunbar which he finally accepted and that the check was then drawn and delivered and receipted for by him; that, thereafter, Dunbar went away and was gone until after five o\u2019clock, when he returned to the office with a pack of cards and that then they played a game for the purpose of determining who should buy the suppers. The defendant, in his testimony, also claimed that the $20 loan and the $180 check that was subsequently given were a loan of $200 which he procured from Dunbar pending the time that he should be able to reinvest his money in the purchase of other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Considering only the People\u2019s evidence we think there was an utter failure on the part of the district attorney to show that any larceny of the $200 check had been committed. Confessedly, it was properly given in the settlement of a claim owing by Dunbar to the defendant. It was his property and he had a perfect right to forward it to the bank upon which it was drawn and to receive payment therefor. It is said that he had pretended to tpar up the check and thus induced Dunbar to give another check for $180, which in connection with the $20 loan would make the amount of the first check. Suppose he did, the fact still existed that he did not tear it up and he did not return it to Dunbar. It may be that, if he pretended to tear it up and thus induced Dunbar by that false representation to give him another check for $180, that the procuring of that check would he larceny, but that question is not now before us. The larceny charged, and that of which he has been convicted, is of stealing the former check of $200 which was his own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u2022 Notwithstanding our conclusion that there was no larceny of the $200 check, we have searched the record in vain to find any request made to the court to advise an acquittal, or any exception to any ruling or charge which raises the question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>until after the trial had been concluded and <em>k. </em>verdict rendered, and then for the first time the defendant\u2019s counsel, in a motion for a new trial, enumerated as one of the grounds for such new trial that there was no crime committed under the evidence in the case. This motion, however, was not a part of the trial, but was one of the proceedings authorized for a reviewal of the trial and the results reached thereon. The question, therefore, arises as to whether this court has the power to review and reverse the conviction in this case. Section 527 of the Code' of Criminal Procedure pertains to the powers of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and gives to that court the power to order a new trial \u201c if it be satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner- was against the weight of evidence or against the law, or that <em>.justice requires a new trial, luhether any exception shall have been taken or not, in the court beloivP </em>Section 528 has reference to appeals to the Court of Appeals, and when the judgment is of death this court is given the same discretionary power- \"with reference to the granting of new trials as is given to the Appellate Division in other cases. This section must be read in connection with the provision of the Constitution, which is as follows: \u201c The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, except where the judgment is of death, shall be limited to the review of questions of law.\u201d Art. 6, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In the case of <em>People v. Sherlock, </em>166 N. Y. 180, 183, 15 N. Y. Crim. 413, Cullen, J., in speaking of the powers of our court in such cases, says: <em>\u201c </em>We are of opinion that the question is not properly before us, because no exception was taken on the trial to the charge of the court. By section . 527 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Appellate Division is authorized to grant a new trial in a criminal case when satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner is against the weight of evidence, against the law, or that justice requires it, whether exceptions have been taken in the court below or not. But by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>528, which regulates appeals to this court, the broad power given to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court is bestowed upon us only where the judgment is of death. In other cases we can take notice only of legal errors appearing in the record or raised by exception on the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Ordinarily, we should affirm where the record presents no exception for review, but an affirmance would be final and deprive the Supreme Court of any further power to review the judgment; the result, therefore, would be that the sentence of imprisonment would have to be executed on the defendant for a crime which he did not commit. We have concluded, therefore, to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that no exception is presented raising the question referred to, which we have the power to review. The dismissal of the appeal will thus leave the judgment of the Appellate Division in force and reinvest, that court with jurisdiction, should further application be made to it for a reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Cullen, Ch. J., Edward T. Bartlett, Vann, Willard Bartlett and Hiscocic, JJ., concur; Werner, J., concurs in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
