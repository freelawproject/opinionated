The trial court rendered judgment of guilty and sentenced the defendant to a term of ten years imprisonment. The defendant has appealed, claiming error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s arrest are not in dispute: On October 8, 1981, officers of the Berlin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>police department and the Statewide Narcotics Task Force, acting under authority of a search and seizure warrant, conducted a search of room 12 of the Plaza Motel in Berlin. The warrant authorized the seizure of, inter alia, any restricted substances and any related paraphernalia. The officers discovered and seized a quantity of cocaine, a restricted substance, in the room and arrested the defendant, who occupied the room at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The defendant was charged by information in two counts with the crimes of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell, General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 19-480 (a), and possession of a narcotic substance, General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 19-481 (a). On November 8, 1982, the defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress, inter alia, all evidence seized from room 12 of the Plaza Motel, claiming that the authorizing warrant was issued \u201cillegally and without probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">At the beginning of a hearing on that motion, assistant state\u2019s attorney Thomas P. Miano informed the court that one of the affiants, Detective Lawrence Skinner, had recently learned that the representations contained in one paragaph of the warrant affidavit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were untrue. Paragraph four of the affidavit had stated that Officer Annunziata of the Berlin police department had observed the defendant arrange a sale of drugs with another person in the Speak Easy Cafe in Berlin. Shortly before the hearing Annunziata told Skinner that he had been mistaken in his earlier allegation and that the defendant was not the man he had observed arranging the drug sale. Skinner then brought this information to the attention of assistant state\u2019s attorney Mia\u00f1o. With the full agreement of both the state and the defendant the trial court then examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>warrant excluding paragraph four. The court concluded that the remainder of the warrant reflected sufficient probable cause to justify the search and therefore denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The defendant then entered a plea of nolo contendere on the first count to the charge of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On December 17,1982, the trial court adjudged the defendant guilty on the first count of the crime of possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell, General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 19-480 (a), and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of ten years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On appeal the defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He claims that: (1) the evidence seized should have been suppressed solely because the warrant contained an intentionally or recklessly false statement, regardless of whether the remainder of the warrant demonstrated probable cause; and (2) that the warrant affidavit, with the erroneous information excluded, failed to demonstrate probable cause sufficient to justify the issuance of the warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978), the United States Supreme Court defined the protections afforded by the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>amendment to the federal constitution in circumstances where a search warrant has been issued by a magistrate in reliance on an affidavit that contains false information. The court held that if a criminal defendant who has standing to challenge the search can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant included the false information either knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth, the court must then examine the affidavit exclusive of the false information. Id., 155-56. Then, if \u201cthe affidavit\u2019s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.\u201d Id., 156;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 238, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984). The corollary to that rule is, of course, that if the affidavit\u2019s remaining content independently establishes probable cause, the warrant is valid and the evidence seized pursuant to it need not be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The rule announced in <em>Franks </em>is designed to uphold fourth amendment protections against unlawful searches and seizures. See U.S. Const., amend. IV. On appeal the defendant contends, for the first time, that article first, \u00a7 7 of the Connecticut constitution should be construed as providing a broader protection against unlawful searches, one that is not adequately sustained by the rule of <em>Franks. </em>He argues that the <em>Franks </em>rule is insufficient because it allows police officers to include false information in an affidavit at the risk only of having the false information excised if discovered and probable cause reassessed on the basis of the affidavit\u2019s accurate representations. He argues, in effect, that this leaves the police in a \u201ccan\u2019t-lose\u201d situation when deciding what information to include in an affidavit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>serves as an ineffective prophylaxis against searches that are unsupported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">However persuasive the defendant\u2019s claim might be, it is not properly before this court. The defendant\u2019s argument depends on a finding that the affiant knowingly or recklessly falsified the warrant affidavit. At the hearing on his motion to suppress, when the state admitted the error in the affidavit and offered to have the court consider the warrant\u2019s sufficiency exclusive of paragraph four, the defendant readily agreed. He thus failed to seek the opportunity to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant, Skinner, had knowingly or recklessly included false information in the affidavit. Having accepted all that was due him under <em>Franks </em>(a determination of probable cause exclusive of the false information) without objection, the defendant cannot now seek a rehearing<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Furthermore, we note that after receiving Skinner\u2019s testimony during a hearing on the motion to suppress the trial court observed that Skinner\u2019s inclusion of erroneous information in his affidavit \u201ccomes about quite honestly.\u201d Defense counsel agreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusion, stating that the information conveyed in paragraph four \u201cwas a mistake\u201d and not a deliberate falsehood. Thus, the rule for which the defendant argues is inapplicable to the facts of this case as found by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in finding that the affidavit, absent paragraph four, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>tained probable cause to justify issuance of the warrant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In reviewing a search warrant affidavit the court \u201cmust ascertain whether the facts in the affidavit are sufficient to justify an independent determination by a neutral and detached issuing judge that the necessary probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 326, 363 A.2d 72 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>168 Conn. 623, 627-28, 362 A.2d 813 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>155 Conn. 385, 391, 232 A.2d 315 (1967).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 527-28, 427 A.2d 1338 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Arpin, </em>188 Conn. 183, 193, 448 A.2d 1334 (1982). \u201cProbable cause to search exists if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the particular items sought to be seized are connected with criminal activity or will assist in a particular apprehension or conviction . . . <em>and </em>(2) there is probable cause to believe that the items sought to be seized will be found in the place to be searched.\u201d (Emphasis in original; citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>supra, 528-29; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Arpin, </em>supra. The reviewing court may consider only the information that was actually before the issuing judge at the time he or she signed the warrant. <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 109 n.1, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964); <em>Giordenello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U.S. 480, 486, 78 S. Ct. 1245, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1503 (1958); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 443, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">A fair reading of the warrant affidavit, excluding paragraph four, discloses the following facts: Two unnamed, reliable informants had stated that the defendant resided in room 12 of the Plaza Motel. The unnamed informants also stated that the defendant sold drugs, consorted with other drug dealers, and that he hosted \u201cwild parties\u201d in his room. Skinner and his co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>affiant, Officer Joseph Sazanowicz of the Berlin police department, conducted a surveillance of room 12 of the Plaza Motel at various times. Between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. on September 6, 1981, Skinner observed the defendant, accompanied by an associate known to Skinner as a drug dealer, make repeated trips from the Speak Easy Cafe to room 12. During the evening hours of September 30, 1981, Skinner observed several persons enter room 12 and leave a short time later. Through the open door Skinner saw one such visitor inject himself with a needle and leave shortly thereafter. In the late evening and early morning of October 1 and October 2, 1981, both affiants again observed the defendant and his associate move between room 12 and the Speak Easy Cafe several times; on one occasion the defendant carried a brown paper bag. Several other persons were again seen entering room 12 and departing shortly thereafter. The defendant and his associate had an extensive history of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In determining that the affidavit, excised of paragraph four, did establish probable cause to search the premises in question, the trial court applied the familiar <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. That test, which stemmed from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969), consists of two prongs: \u201cThe issuing [judge] must be informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances relied on by the person providing the information to the affiant; and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded (a) that the informant, whose identity need not even be disclosed, was credible, or (b) that his information was reliable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>On appeal the defendant claims that the affidavit in question does not satisfy the first prong of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli. </em>He argues that the affidavit does not relate sufficient facts from which a judge reasonably could conclude that the informants based their allegations of criminal activity on sufficient underlying circumstances. The defendant contends that all information provided by the two unnamed informants must therefore be excised from the warrant affidavit leaving only the affiants\u2019 personal observations as a basis for issuing the warrant. He concludes that that information, standing alone, does not establish probable cause to search the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The state concedes that the affidavit does not set forth the facts or circumstances on which the informants based their allegations. The state argues, however, that the information provided by the affiants\u2019 own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>observations, as expressed on the face of the affidavit, provides independent verification of the informants\u2019 allegations from which the issuing judge could reasonably conclude that the informants\u2019 information was based on fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The first prong of the test that grew out of the <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>decisions, requiring that the affidavit set forth the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge, serves a valuable purpose. In most circumstances probable cause to search must be found by a \u201cneutral and detached magistrate\u201d before the state\u2019s agents may search an area in which one has a reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 356-58, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S. Ct. 367, 92 L. Ed. 436 (1948). If a judge were to authorize a search based solely on allegations provided by an otherwise credible person without requiring a showing of the underlying circumstances that serve as a basis for the informant\u2019s allegations, the informant would usurp the judge\u2019s role as the finder of probable cause. The protections that a judge\u2019s involvement in the process are designed to provide would thus be erased. <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United, States, </em>supra, 416; <em>Nathanson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U.S. 41, 54 S. Ct. 11, 78 L. Ed. 159 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Even where the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is applied rigidly, however, there are certain circumstances in which a reliable or credible informant\u2019s tip that fails to satisfy the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong may be credited for the purpose of establishing probable cause. In <em>Spinelli </em>the court found that the affidavit failed to set forth the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge for his tip to the affiants. <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 418. The court then observed that the partially corroborated tip was insufficient, in and of itself, \u201cto provide the basis for a finding of probable cause.\u201d Id. It added, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ever: \u201cThis is not to say that the [defective] tip was so insubstantial that it could not properly have counted in the magistrate\u2019s determination. Rather, it needed some further support.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The <em>Spinelli </em>court thus implicitly recognized that a tip that is defective because the affidavit fails to set forth the underlying facts or circumstances on which the tip is based need not be totally excluded from the reviewing court\u2019s consideration of whether the affidavit substantiates a finding of probable cause. Even though \u201cthe suspicions engendered by the informant\u2019s report\u201d may be insufficient to justify issuance of a warrant independently, where the affiants\u2019 own observations are very incriminating, the informant\u2019s report may bridge the gap and \u201cripen into a judgment\u201d of probable cause. Id; see <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 36, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726 (1963); see also 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 3.3 (f), pp. 566-68. <em>\u201cAguilar </em>applies with full rigor only when the search warrant or the arrest depends solely on the informer\u2019s tip. When a tip not meeting the <em>Aguilar </em>test has generated police investigation and this has developed significant corroboration or other <em>\u2018probative indications of criminal activity </em>along the lines suggested by the informant,\u2019 see Rebell, The Undisclosed Informant and the Fourth Amendment: A Search for Meaningful Standards, 81 Yale L.J. 703, 715-17 (1972), the tip, even though not qualifying under <em>Aguilar, </em>may be used to give such additional color as is needed to elevate the information acquired by police observation above the floor required for probable cause. See also Note, The Informer\u2019s Tip as Probable Cause for Search or Arrest, 54 CornellL.Rev. 958, 967 (1969).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Canieso, </em>470 F.2d 1224, 1231 (2d Cir. 1972); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>101 Idaho 802, 623 P.2d 110, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 963, 102 S. Ct. 503, 70 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The observations of affiants Skinner and Sazanowicz, as related in their affidavit, raised considerable suspicion that narcotics were kept in room 12 of the Plaza Motel. During each of the surveillances, the defendant and his associate, who had previously been arrested for a narcotics offense, were seen making several trips between room 12 and the Speak Easy Cafe. On two of those occasions the affiants also observed several different persons visit room 12 and depart after a very short period of time. During one surveillance Skinner observed one such visitor to room 12 inject a hypodermic needle into his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We need not decide whether the affiants\u2019 observations, standing alone, would be sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that narcotics would be found in room 12. The activities they observed bore significant indicia of illicit narcotics trafficking in that room. When that information was combined with tips from two reliable informants, which simply confirmed the reasonable suspicions that flowed from the affiants\u2019 observations, probable cause was established. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The affidavit set forth the following information:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u201c1. That the affiants are Det. Sgt. Lawrence E. Skinner and Off. Joseph Sazanowicz, both regular members of the Berlin, Ct. Police Dept, and as such have been for periods of 11 yrs. and <em>3\u00bd </em>yrs. respectively. That during this period both affiants have participated in numerous surveillances investigations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>arrests pertaining to the illegal possession, possession with intent to sell, and/or sale of narcotics restricted substances, controlled substances and controlled drugs in violation of Ct. State Statutes. That the affiant, Sazanowicz is currently assigned to the Statewide Narcotics Task Force.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That on 8-18-81 Affiant Skinner was contacted by a credible and reliable informant who has provided information in the past that has led to no less than three felony arrests and convictions. That the informant, hereafter known as CI1, stated that an individual known as TONY D was living in room 12 at the Plaza Motel in Berlin and that he was heavily involved in the trafficking of cocaine, marijuana and \u2018what ever other drugs he can get his hands on.\u2019 That CI1 stated that the subjects real name was Anthony Delmonaco and that he drove a red Mustang. That CI1 stated that Tony D frequented the Speak Easy Cafe in Berlin and was a known associate of [name deleted]. That [name deleted] is known personally to both affiants as a drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u201c3. That on 8-19-81 CI1 called again and stated that a wild party had taken place the night before in Rm. 12 at the Plaza Motel in Berlin, Ct. and that people were laying around the room with needles sticking out of their arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u201c4. That on 8-20-81 Off. Annunziata of the Berlin Police Dept, told Affiant Skinner that he worked on a private assignment at the Speak Easy Cafe a week prior and at that time he was watching an individual known to him as Tony D. That Tony D. followed a young girl out of the cafe and they walked to the rear of the building. That Annunziata said that he followed them and from the side of the building he heard the girl trying to buy $300 worth of drugs from Tony D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>That Tony D told her that he didn\u2019t have anything that night but that he would have it the following day and that he wanted the money \u2018up front.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u201c5. That on 8-28-81 Sgt. Matta of the Berlin Police Dept, told the affiants that he had spoken to an informant of his, hereafter known as CI2, and that CI2 had told him that an individual known as Tony D was living at the Plaza Motel in Berlin and hanging around the Speak Easy Cafe that that he was \u2018doing a lot of coke.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201c6. That the affiants met with CI1 on 8-28-81 and CI1 again went over all of the information. That CI1 told the affiants that the other rooms at the Plaza Motel are occupied by Exotic Dancers and that Tony D is supplying them with cocaine and heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u201c7. That on 9-01-81 affiant Sazanowicz met with CI1 again and CI1 gave the names of Tony D, [name deleted] and [name deleted] as being heavily involved in drug traffic at the Plaza Motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u201c8. That on 9-16-81 Affiant Skinner was contacted by another Police Agency Member who stated that he had information that an individual named Delmonaco was staying at the Plaza Motel in Berlin and that he was dealing drugs to all of the Exotic Dancers on the Berlin Turnpike. That his information was that Delmonaco was an associate of [name deleted] and [name deleted], both drug dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u201c9. That on 9-6-81 Affiant Skinner surveilled the area of the Plaza Motel and the Speak Easy Cafe from 0100 hrs. to 0600 hrs. That during this period of time both Delmonaco and [name deleted] were moving continually between Rm. 12 at the motel and the Speak Easy Cafe. That after the cafe closed at 0300 hrs. both were in the room with approximately 8 other people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>and it appeared that a party was taking place. That at 0600 hrs. when the surveillance ended, the party was still in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u201c10. That on 9-28-81 CI1 called affiant Skinner and stated that a wild party had taken place again the night before at Rm. 12 of the Plaza Motel and people were all around shooting dope. That the other Police Agency Member mentioned in paragraph #8 called Affiant Skinner an hour after CI1 and stated that he had been on surveillance at the Plaza Motel the night before and that he observed a wild party in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u201c11. That on 9-30-81 Affiant Skinner surveilled Rm. #12 at the Plaza Motel from 2100 hrs. until 2300 hrs. That during this period of time the affiant observed a constant flow of persons pulling into the parking area, entering the room and leaving after a short period of time. That at 2145 hrs. the affiant observed through the open front door a white male injecting a needle into his right arm. That the white male left immediately after. That the affiant also observed a white male operating Alabama reg. HBH806 pull out at 2130 hrs. and return at 2140 hrs. That this car then left again at 2210 hrs. and the affiant followed it to the Kitchen Cafe in Newington. That the affiant called CI1 on 10-1-81 and asked about this car and CI1 said that Tony D\u2019s son sometimes drives that car and makes deliveries of narcotics to the dancers. That the Kitchen cafe employs Exotic Dancers. That CI1 also told the affiant the Tony D keeps a gun in his refrigerator for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u201c12. That the affiants surveilled Rm. 12 at the Plaza Motel from 2200 hrs. on 10-1-81 until 0230 hrs. on 10-2-81. That also present on the surveillance were Lt. William Smith, Commanding Officer of the Statewide Narcotics Task Force and Trooper Angelo Tosi, Intelligence Officer for said agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201cThat at approximately 2040 hrs. Delmonaco arrived at the room driving his red Mustang, Ct. reg. 975ASB. (That this vehicle is currently listed to a [name deleted] but previously had Ct. reg. VF4529 attached to it, listed to Anthony Delmonaco \u2014 that the affiants have checked the VIN\u2019s on both registrations and have found that they are one and the same.) That at 2330 hrs. [name deleted] was observed entering the Speak Easy Cafe carrying a brown paper bag, exiting shortly afterwards and arriving at Rm. 12, Plaza Motel at approx. 2337 hrs. That he exited his vehicle, NY reg. 889VBI and carried a brown paper bag into the room.

That the criminal history on Anthony Delmonaco shows 13 arrests with 4 felony convictions including a 10 year sentence in 1969 for bank robbery. That the criminal history on [name deleted] shows 14 arrests with 2 felony convictions for burglary and robbery. That the affiants have personal knowledge of the fact that [name deleted] was arrested in Oct. of 1980 at which time he was found to be in possession of cocaine and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u201c16. That the undersigned affiants based on their training and experience, knowledge of the crimes, information received, surveillances conducted, and facts set forth within this affidavit are of the opinion that they have established probable cause to believe that white males known as Anthony Delmonaco and [name deleted] are violating the existing laws of the State of Conn, in regard to narcotics as set forth previously in this affidavit and application on the premises of room 12 at the Plaza Motel in Berlin, Ct. and in their vehicles, a red Ford Mustang, Ct. reg. 975ASB, 1979 Cadillac, NY reg. 889VBI.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> The defendant entered his plea of nolo contendere pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a which provides: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search or seizure or motion to dismiss, the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law. The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. A plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall not constitute a waiver by the defendant of nonjurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"> The affidavit is set forth as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\"> The record fails to indicate the disposition of the second count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\"> After this case was heard at oral argument the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. , 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984), in which it held that the fourth amendment to the United States constitution does not always require exclusion of evidence seized pursuant to an invalid search warrant. Such evidence need not be excluded \u201cwhen an officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope.\u201d Id., 3420.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Because we hold that the warrant in question here was validly issued, we need not decide whether the rule announced in <em>Leon </em>would be applicable to this case. For the same reason, we need not decide whether the modification of the exclusionary rule made by <em>Leon </em>would sufficiently uphold the rights guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 7 of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\"> See footnote 4, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\"> At oral argument defense counsel conceded that because the defendant had not raised this argument before the trial court, the only relief that he could reasonably request is another hearing to determine if Skinner had acted knowingly or recklessly when he included Annunziata\u2019s information in the affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> See footnote 4, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\"> We note that after the trial court decided the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the United States Supreme Court disavowed the rigid two-pronged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>test that had evolved out of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli. </em>In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983), the court decided to \u201cabandon the \u2018two-pronged test\u2019 \u201d of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli, </em>employing instead a \u201ctotality of the circumstances analysis\u201d; <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 233; in which the informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge are \u201crelevant considerations\u201d to be weighed along with all other information in the affidavit to determine if probable cause exists. Id. \u201cThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Although the state has argued for the application of <em>Gates </em>to this case, neither party addressed the question whether <em>Gates </em>should be applied retroactively to cases decided previously but which had not yet been finally decided on appeal. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendoza, </em>727 F.2d 448 (5th Cir. 1984) (holding that <em>Gates </em>should be applied retroactively); see also <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>466 U.S. 727, 104 S. Ct. 2085, 80 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1984) (where the United States Supreme Court, although not discussing retroactivity, applied <em>Gates </em>to a case that was on appeal before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court at the time the <em>Gates </em>decision was issued). For the purposes of this appeal we will apply the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, which is unquestionably more favorable to the defendant than <em>Gates.
