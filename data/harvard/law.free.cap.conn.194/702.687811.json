The trial court denied the relief sought by the petitioner and he has appealed. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">In the trial court, the petitioner claimed that his detention was illegal because the supporting documentation tendered by the state of Florida was defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>in two respects: it allegedly failed to demonstrate that he was \u201csubstantially charged\u201d under the laws of the state of Florida and failed to set forth sufficient facts and circumstances to permit a finding of probable cause as required by the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. The trial court reviewed the various documents that had been submitted in support of the Florida requisition warrant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and found them adequate. <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>439 U.S. 282, 289-90, 99 S. Ct. 530, 58 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1978); <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Bourbeau, </em>188 Conn. 364, 368, 449 A.2d 1015 (1982). Concluding that the \u201c[petitioner has therefore failed to overcome the presumption of regularity which attaches to a judicial determination of probable cause for the issuance of an arrest warrant,\u201d the court determined that the petition for habeas corpus should not issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">After the trial court had rendered judgment in this case, this court heard and decided <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Bourbeau, </em>193 Conn. 270, 477 A.2d 636 (1984). There we concluded, on virtually identical facts, that once the demanding state submits documents that facially satisfy the requirements of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act; General Statutes \u00a7 54-157 et seq., esp. \u00a7 54-159; it is the demanding state rather than the custodial state which must determine whether an arrest is constitutionally defective for lack of probable cause. Id., 276-77. We also concluded that such documentation sufficiently establishes fugitive status for a person like the petitioner who does not challenge the fact of his physical presence in the demanding state on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>day of the alleged crime. Id., 278; see <em>Barrila </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>190 Conn. 631, 634, 636-39, 461 A.2d 1375 (1983). The petitioner in this case therefore cannot prevail on his appeal from the trial court\u2019s rulings to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The petitioner\u2019s appeal presses an additional ground for relief which is arguably distinguishable from our holding in <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Bourbeau. </em>He maintains that his extradition, even if authorized by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act and the extradition clause of the United States constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is nonetheless illegal because it violates his constitutional rights to due process. This claim was not \u201cdistinctly raised at the trial\u201d and we therefore decline to consider it.
