Schuman, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Peters, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANs\">The principal issue presented by this appeal is whether the state presented sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of burglary and attempted larceny. The defendant, Ronald A. Rutan, was charged by information with burglary in the third degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and with criminal attempt to commit larceny in the second degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found the defendant guilty on both counts and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The defendant raises three issues on appeal. He claims that the trial court erred (1) in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case; (2) in admitting evidence procured by dog tracking without a proper foundation; and (3) in failing to charge the jury that they could consider the dog tracking evidence only for purposes of corroboration. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error challenges only the sufficiency of the evidence adduced by the state in its case in chief. Although the defendant raised his claim of insufficient evidence on three separate occasions in the trial court \u2014 at the close of the state\u2019s case, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>close of all the evidence and after the jury had returned its verdict of guilty \u2014 he has appealed only from the trial court\u2019s denial of his first motion for acquittal. At oral argument the defendant expressly waived any objection to the sufficiency of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Before we can reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the state\u2019s case, we must determine whether such a claim is reviewable at all, in light of the defendant\u2019s introduction of evidence in his own behalf and his concession that the evidence as a whole was sufficient to support his conviction. The defendant urges us to reconsider the waiver rule which forecloses appellate review of the sufficiency of the state\u2019s case whenever the defendant has elected to introduce evidence of his own. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>172 Conn. 531, 532-33, 375 A.2d 1024, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 847, 98 S. Ct. 153, 54 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>L \u2019Heureux, </em>166 Conn. 312, 324, 348 A.2d 578 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>119 Conn. 436, 437, 177 A. 383 (1935); Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. (2d Ed. 1957) \u00a7 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Under the waiver rule, when a motion for acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case is denied, a defendant may not secure appellate review of the trial court\u2019s ruling without foregoing the right to put on evidence in his or her own behalf. The defendant\u2019s sole remedy is to remain silent and, if convicted, to seek reversal of the conviction because of insufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence. If the defendant elects to introduce evidence, the appellate review encompasses the evidence in toto. The defendant then runs the risk that the testimony of defense witnesses will fill an evidentiary gap in the state's case. The waiver rule, therefore, forces the defendant to choose between waiving the right to a defense and waiving the right to put the state to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>proof. It is doubtful whether a criminal defendant should be placed in such a dilemma.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Our previous cases have applied the waiver rule without any discussion of the rule\u2019s effect on the defendant\u2019s right to have the state prove his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 532-33; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>167 Conn. 408, 415 n.2, 356 A.2d 147 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dubina, </em>164 Conn. 95, 101, 318 A.2d 95 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>152 Conn. 196, 198, 205 A.2d 488 (1964); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>supra, 437. See <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 704, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). Our case law arose under former rules of practice which made no distinction between the motions for directed verdict in a civil trial and a criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In our courts, as in other jurisdictions, the waiver rule was imported from the civil to the criminal sphere along with the motion for directed verdict itself. See <em>Cephus </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 F.2d 893, 896-97 (D.C. Cir. 1963); comment, \u201cThe Motion for Acquittal: A Neglected Safeguard,\u201d 70 Yale L.J. 1151, 1151-52 (1961); Maltbie, supra. Our current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>rules of procedure,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> however, reflect a heightened awareness of the constitutional differences between civil and criminal fact finding under which the survival of the waiver rule is doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We note that courts in a number of other jurisdictions have, in recent years, questioned the validity of the waiver rule. Although the majority of the federal courts still adhere nominally to the waiver rule; <em>McGautha </em>v. <em>California, </em>402 U.S. 183, 215, 91 S. Ct. 1454, 28 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1971), reh. denied, 406 U.S. 978, 92 S. Ct. 2407, 32 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1972); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>348 U.S. 160, 164 and n.1, 75 S. Ct. 186, 99 L. Ed. 202 (1954); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Keuylian, </em>602 F.2d 1033, 1040-41 (2d Cir. 1979); 2 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure (1982) \u00a7 463; the rule has come under increasing attack as incompatible with the constitutional requirement of due process that the prosecution must introduce sufficient evidence to justify a convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tion before the defendant may be required to respond. \u201cOne of the greatest safeguards for the individual under our system of criminal justice is the requirement that the prosecution must establish a prima facie case by its own evidence before the defendant may be put to his defense. 'Ours is the accusatorial as opposed to the inquisitorial system. . . . Under our system society carries the burden of proving its charge against the accused not out of his own mouth. It must establish its case, not by interrogation of the accused even under judicial safeguards, but by evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cephas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 F.2d 893, 895 (D.C. Cir. 1963), quoting <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>338 U.S. 49, 54, 69 S. Ct. 1347, 93 L. Ed. 1801 (1949); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>576 F.2d 840, 842-43 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>519 F.2d 294, 297 (D.C. Cir. 1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>442 F.2d 790, 792 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1971); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>416 F.2d 734, 736 n.3 (7th Cir. 1969); comment, \u201cThe Motion for Acquittal: A Neglected Safeguard,\u201d 70 Yale L.J. 1151 (1961); 2 Wright, supra, \u00a7 463; but see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fearn, </em>589 F.2d 1316, 1321 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>526 F.2d 859, 863-64 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 846, 97 S. Ct. 129, 50 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The New Jersey Supreme Court has noted in rejecting the waiver rule that \u201cthe application of the civil rule to criminal trials is open to the criticism that by force of a ruling, that was wrong when made, testimony that the defendant ought not to have been required to give at all may be laid hold of to sustain the wrongful ruling by which he was required to give it. This comes perilously near compelling the accused to convict himself . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bacheller, </em>89 N.J.L. 433, 436, 98 A. 829 (1916). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>64 Hawaii 363, 370-72, 641 P.2d 320 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>15 Mass. App. 229, 240-41, 444 N.E.2d 1282 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>(1983); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>103 Idaho 892, 903, 655 P.2d 99 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>332 So. 2d 773, 775-76 (La. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Accordingly, in an appropriate case, we may well conclude that the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case may be assignable as error on appeal from a conviction, whether or not the defendant has introduced evidence in his or her own behalf. In this case, however, we need not decide that issue because, even if the defendant\u2019s claim were properly here, he could not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On its merits, the defendant\u2019s claim is a challenge to the sufficiency-of the evidence at the end of the state\u2019s case. Our review of the state\u2019s evidence is limited to an inquiry \u201c \u2018whether the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>189 Conn. 383, 387, 456 A.2d 316 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>176 Conn. 257, 262, 407 A.2d 948 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The jury might reasonably have found the following facts. On the morning of March 26,1981, State Police Trooper Robert Gavell was dispatched to a residence in Canaan in response to a silent burglar alarm. When Gavell arrived at the scene he observed a blond white male through the window. He then saw three white males run from the back of the house. The defendant, chased by Gavell, ran in a different direction from the other two men. The defendant soon escaped Gavell\u2019s chase into the woods behind the house. On inspection, Gavell found that the house had been ransacked, and a pile of valuables had been collected on the living room floor. An automobile registered to the defendant\u2019s f\u00edan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>cee was found parked on Johnson Road near the scene of the burglary. Dog tracking evidence indicated that someone had walked from the car to the house. The defendant had been in possession of his fiancee\u2019s car that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Trooper David Barger later found the defendant hitchhiking in the vicinity of the burglary, and turned the defendant over to Trooper Marjorie Kolpa. The defendant, who was wet and dirty, told Kolpa that he had been fishing and that his car had been towed or stolen. He told Trooper William Marchand that he had lost his fishing equipment when he fell in a swamp. Subsequently, in response to questioning about whom he had been with that day, the defendant told Trooper Fred Diggle that he would give the trooper two names if the trooper would release him on a promise to appear and give him a ride home to Shelton. The defendant did not expressly admit his participation in the burglary. Although Gavell could not identify the defendant as the man whom he had chased, the defendant fit the general description of the fleeing suspect. Police investigation failed to recover any lost fishing equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The state\u2019s case was sufficient to meet its evidentiary burden. The defendant was far from his home in the vicinity of the burgled residence at the time of the offense. He fit the general physical description of one of the burglars. Dog tracking evidence linked the defendant\u2019s car to the victim\u2019s house. When questioned by police, the defendant gave a highly unlikely and uncorroborated account of his activities, and he later made incriminating statements concerning his possible companions. The jury was entitled to infer that the defendant had been one of the burglars.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant cannot prevail on his first claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The defendant\u2019s remaining two claims of error challenge the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence procured by dog tracking and the court\u2019s failure to give a limiting instruction to the jury regarding the use of that evidence. Neither claim has been properly preserved for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Under Practice Book \u00a7 3063, we may review only those claims that have been clearly raised below. In the trial court, the defendant not only failed to object, but affirmatively acquiesced in the admission of the testimony of Trooper Marjorie Kolpa concerning her dog tracking investigation. When the assistant state\u2019s attorney requested a trial court ruling that the proffered testimony would be admissible, the defendant\u2019s attorney responded \u201c[o]kay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Similarly, with respect to the claimed failure to charge upon the use of the dog tracking evidence, the defense counsel submitted no written request to charge as required by Practice Book \u00a7 852 and took no exception to the charge as given. Indeed, out of the jury\u2019s presence, he requested the court to clarify its charge on this issue and then thanked the judge for repeating the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Neither of these claims implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial so as to require review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). The defendant will not be heard to object on appeal to rulings that he requested or accepted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-103. burglary in the third degree: class D felony, (a) A person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-123.
