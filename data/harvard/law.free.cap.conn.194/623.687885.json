Sometime between the afternoon of August 11, 1980, and the afternoon of August 12, 1980, a house located at 127 Hurley Road in Oxford was forcibly entered. The glass in the two windows adjacent to the back door was broken and entry gained through one of the windows. A television set, a radio, a camera, money and two calculators that were in the house were stolen. Several fingerprints found on a storm window and a single fingerprint found on a piece of broken window glass were identified as those of the defendant. The defendant offered an alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error concerns the admission into evidence of the storm window upon which his fingerprints were found.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the state failed to lay a foundation which adequately established the identity and unchanged condition of the glass from the time it was removed from the victim\u2019s house to the time it was presented at trial, and that therefore the admission of the window into evidence was error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The Connecticut state trooper who initially investigated the crime, Richard Connors, testified that he dusted the window and discovered fingerprints thereon. He then removed the window, marked it with an evidence tag, and stored it in a locked safe in his office where it remained until he brought it to the evidence locker of the Southbury state police barracks. Trooper Dennis Coyle testified that he transported the window from this evidence locker to the state forensic laboratory in Meriden; there, he gave it to Trooper Ronald Luneau. Luneau testified that he received and studied the window at the laboratory; and Trooper Thomas Guyette testified that he picked up the window from Luneau, and returned it to the evidence room at the Southbury barracks. Connors, Coyle, Luneau and Guyette each identified the window in court, and all but Luneau stated that it was in substantially the same condition as when it had been in their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">When the authenticity of an article of evidence is challenged, \u201c[t]here is no hard and fast rule that the prosecution must exclude or disprove all possibility that the article . . . has been tampered with; in each case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>trial court must satisfy itself in reasonable probability that the [article] had not been changed in important respects.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>162 Conn. 215, 232, 292 A.2d 903 (1972). Here, although there was no direct testimony describing the storage of the window while it was at the laboratory in Meriden or in transport from the Southbury barracks to the court, every other link in the chain of its custody was carefully established. There was also ample testimony establishing the window\u2019s unchanged condition as produced at trial. Given this record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the window into evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 722, 478 A.2d 227 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 696-97, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The defendant next maintains that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence that was both hearsay and prejudicial when it allowed Connors to testify that he \u201creceived a phone call from Sergeant Tucci, of the Woodbridge Police Department, in regards [sic] to Kevin Conroy being involved in burglaries.\u201d The state concedes that the admission of this testimony was error, but contends that the error was harmless. We agree that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">It is well settled that evidence of similar but unconnected crimes is generally not admissible to prove a criminal defendant\u2019s guilt. Such evidence can show no more than the defendant\u2019s bad character or an abstract disposition to commit a crime; it provides no proof of guilt of the specific offense in question. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilligan, </em>92 Conn. 526, 531, 103 A. 649 (1918); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 169, 471 A.2d 949 (1984). Given the state\u2019s concession of error, the sole issue is whether the admission of Connors\u2019 testimony prejudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>daily affected the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tropiano, </em>158 Conn. 412, 427, 262 A.2d 147 (1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 949, 90 S. Ct. 1866, 26 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1970). Because the defendant did not claim at trial that the error deprived him of a constitutional right, he bears the burden of proving its harmfulness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 174, 438 A.2d 679 (1980). Relying only on a conclusory statement of prejudice, the defendant has failed to meet this burden. The challenged testimony conveyed to the jury the general idea that the defendant was thought by another police officer to have been \u201cinvolved\u201d in other burglaries. Neither the details of the alleged involvement nor the basis for Tucci\u2019s belief were alluded to before the jury. Mention of the telephone call was made only once during the state\u2019s case and never repeated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, it was made in the course of Connors\u2019 explanation of how he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>conducted his investigation into the crime, not as part of an attack on the defendant\u2019s character. The defendant failed to request a cautionary instruction which would have emphasized to the jury the limited purpose of the testimony. This failure further weakens the defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 23 n.13, 463 A.2d 558 (1983). The admission of this testimony, even though error, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In his next claim of error, the defendant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the expert testimony of Luneau, a certified latent fingerprint examiner. The defendant argues that Luneau\u2019s conclusion that the fingerprints found on the glass removed from the scene of the burglary matched the fingerprints of the defendant was inadmissible because it was not made in response to a hypothetical question. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Luneau was qualified without objection as an expert witness. He testified that he took photographs of sixteen fingerprints found on the glass and compared the photographs with a police card bearing the defendant\u2019s fingerprints. Further, he testified that he also prepared a chart, exhibited to the jury, which made a point-by-point comparison of an enlargement of one of the fingerprints found on the glass with an enlargement of one of the defendant\u2019s fingerprints.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Luneau was then asked if he had arrived at any conclusion as a result of his examination. He answered that the fingerprints found on the glass were identical to those of the defendant. Luneau\u2019s answer was based on the personal knowledge he had acquired through observation and study of the relevant evidence. It was therefore perfectly proper to elicit his testimony through direct questioning. That many experts must rely on the observations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>of others in the formation of their ultimate opinion is no reason to require one with actual, first-hand knowledge to testify in response to a hypothetical query. See <em>Donch </em>v. <em>Kardos, </em>149 Conn. 196, 201, 177 A.2d 801 (1962); Tait &amp; LaPlante, Handbook of Conn. Evidence (1976) \u00a7 7.16 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The defendant next raises the issue of his unsuccessful attempts to introduce evidence that one Lawrence Munko had participated in the crime. First, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked Connors: \u201cNow, of your own personal knowledge, do you know of anyone else convicted of this crime of burglary and larceny, on August 12, 1980, of the property at 127 Hurley Road, in Oxford?\u201d Later, defense counsel asked the defendant: \u201cNow, at the time Lawrence Munko testified in December of 1980, in this court [at a trial of the defendant for a separate charge of burglary] did he also make admissions with regard to the crime, or did he actually make \u2014 did he give testimony with regard to the crime which was\u2014 you\u2019re being tried right now?\u201d The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objections to both questions. The defendant argues that these exclusions were error in that they prevented him from presenting exculpatory evidence. The defendant further argues that the trial court\u2019s rulings were erroneous because they precluded him from laying a foundation for a request to charge that the jury could draw an inference adverse to the state from its failure to call Lawrence Munko as a witness. Neither argument is persuasive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The defendant contends that the excluded evidence was admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule as a statement against penal interest exculpatory to the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court delineated the requirements for the admission of such a statement in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 426 A.2d 799 (1980), and again in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). A prerequisite to the use of this exception is the unavailability of the declarant, in this case Munko. <em>See State v. Gold, </em>supra, 630; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 440-42. The defendant made no allegation that Munko was unavailable to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial. The trial court was therefore correct in sustaining the state\u2019s objections to questions that would have elicited hearsay recitals of Munko\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The defendant also claims the exclusions were erroneous because they prevented him from requesting a <em>Secondino </em>charge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A jury instruction which allows the drawing of an adverse inference against a party who fails to call a witness can be given only if it is shown that that witness is available and that the witness is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>one whom the party would naturally be expected to produce. <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>180 Conn. 101, 113-14, 429 A.2d 813 (1980). Presumably, the defendant is contending that the trial court\u2019s rulings precluded him from meeting the second requirement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant made no attempt, however, to adduce proof of Munko\u2019s availability. Because there was no evidence before the trial court on this point, the defendant cannot prevail on this claim of error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the trial court erred when, in the presence of the jury, it threatened to hold his attorney in contempt of court. Defense counsel had put the defendant on the stand and had inquired extensively about other crimes of burglary charged against him. As previously described, defense counsel tried to elicit Munko\u2019s testimony in the defendant\u2019s trial on one of these earlier charges concerning the crime involved in this case. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection to such questioning, stating: \u201cthat is beyond our camera [sic] now to consider that other trial. That is not presently before this jury. We have before this jury a very specific allegation as to a crime apart from that other one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">During defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury, the following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\u201cMr. Skuret: So what are we here for? Why are we here with the trial of this case if it\u2019s so clear-cut?</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re here because my client came into the office and came in with four cases, and you\u2019ve heard about the four cases\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\u201cMiss Moch: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to anything that\u2019s outside this case that is on trial. I don\u2019t care how many burglaries he was accused of. I think that is totally improper, and normally the State would not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u201cObviously, the defendant pled not guilty and that is why we are here trying this case, and to say it\u2019s for any other reason is totally improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u201cThe Court: Counselor\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">\u201cMr. Skuret: Let me explain something, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">\u201cThe Court: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">\u201cMr. Skuret: It\u2019s a situation\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Skuret.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">\u201cMr. Skuret: I want to address the Court. I have had an objection\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Skuret. I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t need to be addressed on this, and kindly refrain from extraneous materials that have nothing to do with this case, no probative force with this case, Mr. Skuret.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">\u201cIf you dare to do that I am going to hold you in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">\u201cMr. Skuret: Well\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">\u201cThe Court: I do not need to be addressed by you about anything. I am ruling now to eliminate any talk about four cases that came into your office that have absolutely nothing to do with the proof of this trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-17\">The defendant did not object to the trial court\u2019s warning; nor did he request a jury instruction that no inference adverse to the defendant be drawn from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>incident. We need not consider any claim of error which is not distinctly raised at trial. Practice Book \u00a7 3063. Because of the understandable reluctance of an attorney to object to a threat of contempt, however, we will address the defendant\u2019s claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tirado, </em>194 Conn. 89, 95, 478 A.2d 606 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The act complained of was a single, short incident that took place during a four day trial. The defendant does not explain how the threat against his attorney prejudiced the jury against him; he merely asserts that it did so. Further, the warning was issued during final argument and thus did not hinder the defendant\u2019s presentation of evidence. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>1 Conn. App. 609, 475 A.2d 315 (1984). While the better practice would have been for the trial court to have issued its warning in the absence of the jury or to have given a curative instruction; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>171 Conn. 293, 299-300, 370 A.2d 928 (1976); the trial court\u2019s action in the circumstances here was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Healey and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">\u201c(b) Burglary in the third degree is a class D felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\"> At the time of the alleged crime, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124 provided in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of larceny in the third degree when: (1) The value of the property or service exceeds fifty dollars ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">\u201c(b) Larceny in the third degree is a class B misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\"> A sixth claim of error, relating to the obtaining and use of a card bearing the defendant\u2019s fingerprints, was withdrawn at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\"> The defendant challenges the admission of the storm window only and makes no claim regarding the admission of the small piece of broken glass which bore one of his fingerprints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b643-4\"> At trial, the defendant objected to the testimony in question on two grounds: that it was hearsay, and that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. He now raises as a third objection the claim that before the evidence of his involvement in other burglaries was admitted he had planned to exercise his fifth admendment right not to testify, but that Connors\u2019 testimony forced him to take the stand. If this constitutional argument were before this court, it would be the state\u2019s burden to prove the trial court\u2019s error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 26, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705, reh. denied, 386 U.S. 987, 87 S. Ct. 1283, 18 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1967). Although claims not raised at trial are normally not reviewable here, constitutional claims made for the first time on appeal may be properly pleaded before this court under certain exceptional circumstances. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). The exceptional circumstance relevant here is one that \u201cmay arise where the record adequately supports a claim that a litigant has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70. Because the record is silent as to the reason for the defendant\u2019s decision to testify, we do not consider the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>193 Conn. 474, 480 n.5, 479 A.2d 763 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>188 Conn. 515, 519, 467 A.2d 1237 (1982). Indeed, our comprehensive review of the record on this issue leads as easily to the conclusion that the defendant had planned to testify as to one that he had originally decided not to take the stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b643-5\"> The defendant himself later gave testimony describing his involvement in other burglaries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> The glass, the photographs, the fingerprint card and the chart were all admitted into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> The state contends that these claims were not preserved for review because the defendant did not make an offer of proof when faced with the state\u2019s objections. While the defendant failed to make an offer of proof in response to the first objection, he did make an offer when the state made its second objection. In addition, Munko\u2019s participation in the present crime was set forth in the arrest warrant application which was part of the record both at trial and here and the thrust of the questioning was hence clear. We accordingly turn to the merits of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> At least one of the state\u2019s objections was made and sustained on relevancy grounds, and the state presses the alternative argument here that evidence of Munko\u2019s role in the present crime is irrelevant since it does not necessarily exculpate the defendant. The defendant, on the other hand, addresses himself in this appeal solely to the hearsay issue. Because we decide against the defendant on this issue, we need not discuss the question of relevancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> That Munko pleaded guilty to the present crime in a separate proceeding at which Connors was present was conceded. The statement for which a hearsay recapitulation was sought by questioning Connors was hence Munko\u2019s plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b646-10\"> See <em>Secondino v. New Haven Gas Co., 147 </em>Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\"> Given the paucity of evidence linking the defendant to the crime, Munko was arguably a witness whom the state would naturally have been expected to call. We note, however, that the defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b647-10\"> It may seem inconsistent to rule against the defendant both for failing to show Munko\u2019s unavailability and for failing to show Munko\u2019s availability. The defendant, however, did not simply fail to establish either unavailability or availability; he made no allegation whatsoever on the issue. Any apparent inconsistency is thus of the defendant\u2019s own making.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b649-8\">Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AF9\">concurring. I agree with the court\u2019s opinion except for the Catch-22 that has been created by relying upon the failure of the defendant to prove the <em>unavailability </em>of Lawrence Munko as a ground for excluding his hearsay statements against penal interest and, next, upon the failure to establish Munko\u2019s <em>availability </em>as a prerequisite to a request for a \u2018missing witness\u2019 charge. <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960). It defies logic to presume that Munko was available and unavailable at the same time, as if we could have it both ways. Courts ought not to indulge in such convenient fictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>I concur with the court\u2019s disposition of the claim for admission of the statements against penal interest because of the failure to show that Munko was not available to testify. With respect to the claim of admissibility of the statements as a basis for requesting a <em>Secondino </em>charge, (1) no such ground of admissibility was raised at trial as required by Practice Book \u00a7 288;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) since an essential prerequisite for the penal interest exception to the hearsay rule was not established, the evidence was inadmissible for any purpose; and (3) even if responses to the questions relating to Munko\u2019s involvement in this crime had been permitted, the circumstance of his complicity, which they might have elicited, would not indicate that his relationship to the state was such that the state could naturally have been expected to produce his testimony. Contrary to the position taken in a footnote of the opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that \u201cMunko was a witness whom the state would naturally have been expected to call,\u201d his status as a possible accomplice would not warrant a charge that an unfavorable inference should be drawn because of the failure of the state to produce him. Unless an accomplice has turned state\u2019s evidence by implicating a defendant, the state can hardly be expected to call him as a witness. It would be closer to reality to draw an adverse inference against the defendant for failing to produce a witness who conceivably might have exculpated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Accordingly, I agree with the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 288. objections to evidence.
