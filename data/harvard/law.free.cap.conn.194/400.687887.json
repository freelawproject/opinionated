Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEl\">The principal issue in this case is whether the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>erred when it overruled the defendants\u2019 objection to the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal of his complaint. The following salient facts are not in dispute: The plaintiff, Douglas Barra, filed a complaint on April 21,1982, seeking a judicial winding up of the defendant corporation, Ridgefield Card &amp; Gift Gallery, Ltd. (Ridgefield), pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-382. The plaintiff and the defendant Loretta O\u2019Hare were shareholders and directors of Ridgefield. O\u2019Hare then filed an application for appraisal of the plaintiff\u2019s shares of stock pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-384. This application was granted after a hearing before the trial court, <em>Ford, J., </em>and at that time John P. O\u2019Byrne, a certified public accountant, was appointed as the appraiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On July 16, 1982, O\u2019Byrne filed his appraisal report with the court. This report stated that the plaintiff\u2019s shares of stock were worth $0.00 as of April 20,1982, the day preceding the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 30, 1982, O\u2019Hare, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-384 (c), filed a statement with the court electing to purchase the plaintiff\u2019s shares of stock and deposited the sum of $1 with the court clerk. Subsequently, O\u2019Hare filed a motion for order of sale of the plaintiff\u2019s shares to her pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-384 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>On September 3, 1982, the plaintiff filed a withdrawal. The withdrawal did not expressly request leave of court to do so and no such leave had previously been granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 7,1982, O\u2019Hare\u2019s motion for order of sale, filed on August 12, 1982, was granted by the court, <em>Moraghan, J. </em>At the time when Judge Moraghan heard and decided that motion, however, the plaintiffs September 3 withdrawal was not contained in the court file.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court file indicates that on September 7,1982, the defendants filed an objection to the withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Subsequently, on September 27, 1982, the plaintiff filed a motion to reargue the motion for order of sale entered on September 7,1982, and, on September 28, 1982, the plaintiff filed a motion to \u201creopen\u201d that order of sale. The gravamen of both of these motions was that the court was without jurisdiction to enter the order of sale on September 7 because the plaintiff had filed a withdrawal of his complaint on September 3. On October 14,1982, the defendants filed their motion objecting to the plaintiff\u2019s motions to \u201creopen\u201d and reargue. The trial court, <em>Moraghan, J., </em>after a hearing, granted both motions on November 1,1982. Thereafter, on December 20,1982, the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>after a hearing, overruled the defendants\u2019 objection to the withdrawal, and the defendant O\u2019Hare then appealed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in overruling her objection to the plaintiff\u2019s with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>drawal and in allowing the plaintiff to withdraw his action without his first requesting, and having been granted, leave of court in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-80.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of this claim, the defendant relies upon <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Kerars Realty Co., </em>171 Conn. 699, 372 A.2d 121 (1976). She maintains that prior to the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal, the commencement of a hearing on an issue of fact under <em>Spears </em>had occurred because the appraiser in this case had not only commenced the procedures to be followed in making his appraisal, but he had completed his appraisal and filed it with the court. She therefore asserts that under General Statutes \u00a7 52-80, the plaintiff\u2019s ability to withdraw his action as of right had terminated and that he could not withdraw his action without leave of court for cause shown. The defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to request \u201cleave of court <em>and </em>[make] a showing of \u2018cause.\u2019 \u201d She asserts that the record of the hearing before Judge Maiocco is devoid of any reference whatsoever to such cause shown, that neither of the litigants addressed this critical issue, and that the court did not inquire into it. She therefore argues that leave of court could not properly have been granted since the issue of cause was \u201cnever raised or presented to the Court by the plaintiff, nor addressed by the defendant nor by the Court itself.\u201d Accordingly, because she maintains that there was no showing of cause, she claims that the overruling by the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>of her objection to the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal cannot be considered to have the \u201csame effect\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>as the granting of leave of court to withdraw. See <em>Falk </em>v. <em>Schuster, </em>171 Conn. 5, 8, 368 A.2d 40 (1976). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Initially, we point out, as both parties now acknowledge, that a \u201chearing on an issue of fact\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-80 had \u201ccommenced\u201d in this case prior to the plaintiffs filing of his withdrawal on September 3,1982. <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Kerars Realty Co., </em>supra, 701-704. Quite clearly, the plaintiff\u2019s right to withdraw his action without leave of court terminated \u201cwith the commencement by the [court appointed] appraiser of the procedures to be followed in arriving at his appraisal.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 703. Thus, the plaintiff could properly withdraw his complaint \u201conly by leave of court for cause shown.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">At this point, we refer to the language of the memorandum of decision by the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>on the defendants\u2019 objection to the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal. We may examine the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision to understand better the basis of its decision and to determine the reasoning used by it in reaching its conclusion. <em>McGaffin </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>193 Conn. 393, 408, 479 A.2d 176 (1984). After pointing out the apparent clerical error which prevented the inclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal in the court file at the time when the trial court, <em>Moraghan, J., </em>heard and decided the defendant\u2019s motion for the sale of the plaintiffs stock,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>referred to the plaintiff\u2019s motions to \u201creopen\u201d the judgment of the order of sale and to reargue the motion for order of sale. It then noted the defendants\u2019 objection to these motions which \u201cset forth as [their] arguments that the withdrawal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>improper and of no effect as it was done without the permission of [the] court; that it was done without cause being shown; and that it was done after a hearing on the merits was held and acted upon by the court (the appointment of the appraiser), [citing General Statutes] Sec. 52-80 in support of [their] arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The trial court then stated that \u201c[t]hese arguments were all addressed and countered by the plaintiff in his memorandum in support of the motions\u201d which Judge Moraghan granted and, \u201c[i]n effect, Judge Moraghan by his ruling appears to have accepted the arguments advanced by the plaintiff and rejected those offered by the defendant.\u201d The trial court then pointed out that \u201cthe defendant [was coming] before the court a second time proposing the same objections to the with-drawl of [the] action, [that the defendant was] asking for a new ruling on the matter, [and that] [i]n effect, she is asking the court to overrule the prior decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Finally, the trial court stated that <em>\u201c[i]n addition to the above </em>consideration, i.e., the prior court ruling, this court adopted the argument advanced by the plaintiff that the appointment of an appraiser and his filing of his report did not, in and of itself, constitute a hearing ... on an issue of fact as contemplated by Sec. 52-80 ... so as to prevent the plaintiff from withdrawing his action without prior approval from the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">It is plain, in view of what we have already stated concerning the plaintiffs inability to withdraw as of right under our holding in <em>Spears </em>which interpreted \u00a7 52-80, that the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>erred in its conclusion that the plaintiff could withdraw without leave of court. It is clear, however, that its judgment was not predicated on only that conclusion but also on the independent ground relating to the previous ruling of Judge Moraghan. A trial court\u2019s judgment may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>be sustained if there exists proper grounds to support it even where, unlike the present case, the trial court\u2019s memorandum does not state a proper basis for its result. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Division of Special Revenue, </em>193 Conn. 379, 387, 477 A.2d 119 (1984); <em>Favorite </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>176 Conn. 310, 317, 407 A.2d 974 (1978); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>174 Conn. 592, 597-98, 392 A.2d 468 (1978); see <em>Perkel v. Grayson, </em>119 Conn. 465, 471-72, 177 A. 534 (1935); Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 35, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The thrust of the defendant\u2019s position on this appeal is that the issue of cause was never addressed in the proceedings before either Judge Moraghan or Judge Maiocco. We cannot accept this claim. There is no question that the defendants\u2019 objection to the plaintiff\u2019s motions to \u201creopen\u201d and reargue, as well as their objection to the plaintiff's withdrawal, were both filed with the trial court prior to the time when the court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motions to \u201creopen\u201d and reargue. Both of these objections as filed clearly stated, inter alia, the defendants\u2019 argument that the withdrawal was improper, untimely, and without leave of court for cause shown. After a hearing, Judge Moraghan granted the plaintiff\u2019s motions to \u201creopen\u201d and reargue, despite these claims, without a written memorandum of decision. As already stated, 'Judge Maiocco, in denying the defendants\u2019 objection to the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal, referred to Judge Moraghan\u2019s previous order and pointed out that all of the claims then being made before him had already been made and rejected by the court\u2019s, <em>Moraghan, J., </em>previous action. In view of this chronology, the defendant\u2019s claim essentially must center on whether Judge Maiocco erred in construing Judge Moraghan\u2019s order as having addressed, inter alia, the issue of cause and having resolved it in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">As we have noted, there is no written memorandum of decision setting forth the basis of Judge Moraghan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>decision to which Judge Maiocco referred with regard to the various objections, including the \u201ccause\u201d issue, raised by the defendants. Yet, despite the fact that there was argument before Judge Moraghan and, as defendant\u2019s counsel indicated at oral argument before us, Judge Moraghan issued his decision from the bench, the defendant has not filed a transcript of those proceedings before Judge Moraghan, the import of which proceedings is clear in light of her attack on Judge Maiocco\u2019s decision from which she has appealed. See Practice Book \u00a7 3060V. Although the defendant claimed before us that the cause issue was never argued orally before Judge Moraghan, she nevertheless conceded the possibility that Judge Moraghan had considered that issue. Yet, there was no indication whatsoever given by the defendants, either in their memorandum or oral argument before Judge Maiocco, that Judge Moraghan did not consider the cause issue despite the fact that it had been raised by their written objections. It is this position that the defendant now takes on appeal for the first time and asks this court to sustain despite having had the opportunity to make this claim before Judge Maiocco.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The significant gap in the record, i.e., the absence of a transcript of the proceedings before Judge Moraghan, before both Judge Maiocco and this court limits our review and presents obstacles to reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim of error on this appeal. See <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 713-14, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983); <em>H. B. Sanson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>187 Conn. 581, 586, 447 A.2d 12 (1982). It is the appellant\u2019s burden to ensure that we are provided with an adequate appellate record to support his claims of error. See <em>DeMilo </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>189 Conn. 671, 681, 458 A.2d 362 (1983). It is important to recognize that a claim of error cannot be predicated on an assumption that the trial court acted incorrectly. <em>Long </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>171 Conn. 291, 292-98, 370 A.2d 925 (1976); <em>Giamattei v. DiCerbo, </em>135 Conn. 159, 162, 62 A.2d 519 (1948); Maltbie, supra, \u00a7 311. Rather, it must be assumed that the trial court acted properly. <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 263, 413 A.2d 854 (1979); <em>Giamattei </em>v. <em>DiCerbo, </em>supra; Maltbie, supra. These principles apply not only to Judge Maiocco\u2019s decision but also to Judge Moraghan\u2019s decision. The issue of cause was before Judge Moraghan and, in the absence of some contrary indication in the record before us, Judge Maiocco did not err in finding that Judge Moraghan, in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motions to \u201creopen\u201d and reargue, had considered the cause issue. In the circumstances of this case, the defendant cannot now claim that the issue of cause was never considered and passed upon below. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Judge Maiocco erred in overruling the objection to the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal which, in the circumstances of this case, is to be given the \u201csame effect\u201d as the court\u2019s granting of the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal. See, e.g., <em>Falk </em>v. <em>Schuster, </em>171 Conn. 5, 368 A.2d 40 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 33-384 (b) requires valuation of a petitioner\u2019s shares as of the day prior to the date on which a petition under General Statutes \u00a7 33-382 is filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\"> The plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal stated: \u201cThe Complaint in the above entitled action is hereby withdrawn.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> In its memorandum of decision on the defendants\u2019 objection to withdrawal, the trial court, <em>Maiocco, J., </em>stated that the filing of the withdrawal \u201cwas erroneously coded on the computer printout entries for the file and appears not to have been placed in the file when the court, <em>Moraghan, J., </em>entertained [the defendants\u2019] motion for order of sale of the stock . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> Both Loretta O\u2019Hare and Ridgefield Card &amp; Gift Gallery were named as defendants in the plaintiffs complaint.
