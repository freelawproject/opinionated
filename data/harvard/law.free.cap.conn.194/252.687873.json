On appeal to this court we reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the judgment of the court below because the trial court had improperly permitted the child\u2019s foster parents to intervene as parties. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 10718), </em>188 Conn. 259, 449 A.2d 165 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The record reveals the following facts. The defendant, A, gave birth to her son J on February 7, 1974. At that time, she was a fifteen-year-old delinquent child living at Long Lane School in the custody of the commissioner of children and youth services. On March 6, 1974, the Juvenile Court, second district, found that J was \u201cuncared for\u201d because his mother was unable to provide a home for him. Consequently, J was committed to the care and custody of the commissioner of children and youth services.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">On August 8,1974, J was placed in the P foster home in New Milford where he has since remained. A has resided primarily in Waterbury, approximately thirty-five miles from New Milford, near other members of her family. A has visited her son over the years, but these visits were limited in length and number. She has tried to regain custody of J repeatedly, but each of her five motions to review commitment, brought between March 25,1975, and the 1982 termination proceeding, was denied after hearings and professional evaluations of J and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">A has had three more children since J was born. At the time of the termination hearing, one of her daughters had been removed by court order while the other two children remained in A\u2019s care. The trial court found that A had not been able to maintain a clean, warm, nutritious home for her children, as indicated by several utility shut-offs.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">J was found to have adjusted positively to the P foster home and was doing well in school. Testimony of child psychologists, adopted by the court in its factual findings, indicated that removing J from the P home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>and placing him in A\u2019s care would be emotionally destructive to J. There was also evidence that A\u2019s visits with J caused him to have bad dreams and wet his bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">On the basis of its findings of fact, the trial court concluded that A lacked \u201cthe emotional stability, the maturity, the understanding or ability to be able to be a parent to J.\u201d The court found that by clear and convincing evidence the state had proven the allegations of its petition to terminate A\u2019s parental rights in J. Consequently, the court terminated A\u2019s parental rights pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a on the following grounds: \u201c(1) The parent has abandoned the child in the sense that she has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the child\u2019s welfare. (2) Mother has failed to achieve any such degree of personal rehabilitation that should reasonably encourage the belief that at some future date she could assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life. (3) There is no on-going parent/child relationship . . . that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day to day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child, and to allow further time for the establishment of such parent/child relationship would be detrimental to the best interests] of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The defendant challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 17-43a (a) (1) and (4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by claiming a violation of her rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. These claims arise out of the first and third of the trial court\u2019s grounds for termination. She asserts that by assuming custody of J and placing him in a foster home thirty-five miles away with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>family that is linguistically and culturally foreign,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the state created or substantially caused the very conditions upon which it later grounded the termination of her parental rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">As to subsection (1), she asserts that termination of parental rights for abandonment is only proper where a parent has voluntarily deserted her child, and not in cases where the state has assumed custody against the parent\u2019s wishes. With regard to subsection (4), authorizing termination upon a showing of no ongoing parent-child relationship, the defendant argues that the state has prevented or substantially hindered the development of such a relationship between her and J, and has failed in its duty to preserve her parental ties to J.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In essence, the defendant maintains that unless the statutory criteria for termination under subsection (4) are read in the context of what is possible for the individual parent in light of the state\u2019s actions and the facts and circumstances of her particular case, that provision violates the due process clause. The defendant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>claims that the application of subsection (4) has a disparate impact on a class of poor parents in violation of the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The defendant has not attacked the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s findings of abandonment and no ongoing parent-child relationship.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She merely asserts that if the facts as found by the trial court satisfy the statutory criteria of \u00a7 17-43a (a) (1) and (4), those provisions are not constitutional. Although the defendant has raised important questions concerning the constitutionality of this statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we are constrained by the limits of her argument and cannot reach her constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The defendant has not alleged that there was insufficient evidence to find the ground of failure to rehabilitate under \u00a7 17-43a (a) (2). Nor has she attacked the constitutional validity of that provision as applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the facts as found in her case. In a petition to terminate parental rights under \u00a7 17-43a, the petitioner must list the grounds relied upon and, if any one of these grounds may be upheld, the order to terminate must stand. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-BC), </em>189 Conn. 66, 69,454 A.2d 1262 (1983) (where a mother claimed there was insufficient evidence to terminate her rights on either of two grounds under \u00a7 17-43a (a), our conclusion that one of the grounds was supported by the evidence made it unnecessary to consider whether the second ground was supported). Since the defendant leaves unchallenged one of the statutory bases on which the trial court terminated her parental rights, we do not decide the constitutional issues she has raised in connection with the other two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 17-43a. TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS of child committed to commissioner, (a) In respect to any child committed to the commissioner of children and youth services . . . the commissioner . . . may petition the court for the termination of parental rights with reference to such child .... The superior court upon hearing and notice . . . may grant such petition if it finds upon clear and convincing evidence, that over an extended period of time, which, except as hereinafter provided in this subsection, shall not be less than one year: (1) The parents have abandoned the child in the sense that they have failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the child\u2019s welfare; or (2) the parents have failed to achieve any such degree of personal rehabilitation as would reasonably encourage the belief that at some future date they could assume a responsible position in their child\u2019s life; or . . . (4) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, which means the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day to day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The statute alternatively provides for termination of parental rights if the parents consent or if the parents, because of continuing physical or mental deficiency, will be unable to provide the child with necessary care, guidance and control. Neither of these alternate grounds has been alleged against the defendant, and therefore neither is discussed in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> The father of the defendant\u2019s child is dead.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\"> The defendant raises a second ground for appeal based on an evidentiary error. She contends that testimony concerning her intelligence quotient, admitted at the hearing, was not competent evidence and should have been excluded because its prejudicial potential outweighed its probative value. At trial, the defendant neither objected to nor moved to strike this testimony, and thus failed to preserve her claim of error for appeal. Therefore, we do not consider this question as it is not properly before us. Practice Book \u00a7 3063.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> See footnote 1, supra. For the sake of convenience, we will refer to subsection (1) of General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (a) as \u201cabandonment,\u201d subsection (2) as \u201cfailure to rehabilitate,\u201d and subsection (4) as \u201cno ongoing parent-child relationship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"> The defendant is \u201cof Spanish descent and background and experiences difficulty with the English language.\u201d She required an interpreter at the termination hearing. In response to questions posed by the court, Mr. P, J\u2019s foster parent, testified that neither he nor his wife spoke Spanish, and that J lacked any conversational skills in his mother\u2019s native tongue. The defendant\u2019s equal protection claim does not include the argument that the statute is discriminatory in its application to a suspect class based on ethnic origin in violation of the equal protection clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> We have never decided whether it is constitutionally permissible to terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights when the state is largely or solely responsible for the existence of the grounds upon which the termination is based.
