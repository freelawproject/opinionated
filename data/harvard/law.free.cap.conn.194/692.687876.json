He appeals, claiming that he was improperly sentenced as a persistent felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>offender because the substantive offense of which he was convicted, first degree sexual assault, was not charged in the same indictment as the persistent felony offender violation. There is no claim of error in the jury\u2019s verdict on the sexual assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The facts relating to the defendant\u2019s appeal are not in dispute. On August 19, 1980, a grand jury issued a two part, three count indictment charging the defendant in the first part with sexual assault in the first degree and kidnapping in the first degree, and in the second part with being a persistent felony offender, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 53a-92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>(a) (2) (A), and 53a-40 (a), respectively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 28, 1981, the state withdrew count one of the indictment and substituted an information charging the defendant with first degree sexual assault under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, at a trial by jury before <em>Spada, J., </em>the defendant was acquitted of the kidnapping charge and convicted of sexual assault in the first degree. Following the jury\u2019s verdict the defendant motioned the trial court to dismiss part two of the indictment, claiming that he could not be sentenced as a persistent felony offender because he was convicted of a sexual assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>crime different from that set forth in part one of the indictment. After the court\u2019s denial of the motion, the defendant pleaded nolo contendere to the persistent felony offender charge and was accordingly sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than fifteen years to life. In this appeal we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In order properly to address the defendant\u2019s contention that failure to convict him under the indicted substantive offense precluded the trial court from sentencing him as a persistent felony offender, we must first determine whether the sexual assault charge contained in the indictment and that substituted by information constitute the same crime. If we find that these two charges are in fact the same, then logically we could not find error in the state\u2019s substitution of one for the other. Our focus naturally turns to the statute under which the defendant was indicted and convicted, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, which at the time of the crime read in pertinent part: \u201csexual assault in the first degree: class b felony, (a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or (2) by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person.\u201d The defendant\u2019s indictment under subsection (1) of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) for sexual assault \u201cby the use of force\u201d was replaced by an information charging him under subsection (2) with sexual assault \u201cby the threat of use of force.\u201d We note that, although the indictment specifically charged the defendant under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), prior to the time of the indictment, and at the time the crime occurred, the subsection numeral \u201c(1)\u201d had been removed from the statute by amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant presses the claim that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>these constitute separate offenses, an indictment for one cannot be replaced by an information charging the other, but can be changed only by reindictment for the substituted offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The issue before us is whether \u00a7 53a-70 (a) describes two separate crimes or one crime that can be committed in two separate ways. We agree with the defendant that if sexual assault by the \u201cuse of force\u201d and sexual assault by the \u201cthreat of use of force\u201d as set out in \u00a7 53a-70 (a) are separate offenses, then clearly an information for one cannot be substituted for an indictment for the other. The principle that any offense carrying a life sentence must be charged by indictment is well settled in this state. See Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 8 (\u201cNo person shall be held to answer for any offense, punishable by death or life imprisonment, unless on a presentment or an indictment of a grand jury . . . .\u201d);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 54-45 (b) (\u201cNo person shall be put to plea or held to trial for any crime the punishment of which may be death or imprisonment for life unless an indictment has been found against him for such crime by a grand jury . . . .\u201d);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 605 (grand jury must indict for any offense punishable by death) and 616 (\u201cA felony punishable by death or life imprisonment shall be prosecuted by indictment.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. Lewis, 176 Conn. 270, 272, 407 A.2d 955 (1978) (robbery conviction raised to possible life sentence by persistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>offender conviction must be charged by indictment); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>144 Conn. 295, 302, 130 A.2d 562 (1957) (indictment by grand jury required in all cases in which penalty may be life imprisonment). Since a conviction for sexual assault under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) by either the \u201cuse of force\u201d or the \u201cthreat of use of force\u201d in conjunction with a persistent felony offender violation carries a possible life sentence, each must be independently charged by indictment. In the present case the defendant makes no claim that he was erroneously indicted for sexual assault \u201cby the use of force,\u201d but argues that the substitute information charging sexual assault \u201cby the threat of use of force\u201d was improper. We find, however, that the language of \u00a7 53a-70 divides the statute, not into two crimes, but into two methods of committing the same crime; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>181 Conn. 237, 239, 435 A.2d 20 (1980); and that the indictment substitution made by the state in this case involved a matter of form, not substance. We conclude, therefore, that both the indictment and the substitute information charge the defendant with only one crime, sexual assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Despite our conclusion that \u00a7 53a-70 (a) charges only one crime, we must still address the defendant\u2019s additional, procedural claim that the substantive offense, sexual assault, and the persistent felony offender violation must be charged in the <em>same </em>indictment. The defendant argues that by charging the substantive offense in an information, the persistent felony offender and substantive violations were no longer in the same indictment and that therefore the defendant cannot be given an enhanced sentence under the persistent felony offender statute. In support of his claim the defendant relies on Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 605 and 616,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and several of our decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>We do not disagree with the defendant that an allegation that a person is a persistent felony offender must be included in the same indictment as a specific substantive criminal charge. \u201cA person cannot be charged as a persistent offender under \u00a7 53a-40 in a separate . . . indictment. If the allegation of prior offenses is not included in an . . . indictment charging a specific crime, it is ineffective.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Lewis, supra, 272-73; see <em>State </em>v. <em>LaSelva, </em>163 Conn. 229, 232, 303 A.2d 721 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delmonto, </em>110 Conn. 298, 300, 147 A. 825 (1929); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 175, 113 A. 452 (1921). That principle, however, must be read in conjunction with Practice Book \u00a7 622, which allows a minor defect in an indictment to be corrected at any time. It is an established rule of procedure that, prior to trial, nonsubstantive changes may be made in an indictment. Practice Book \u00a7 622 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe judicial authority may order at any time such relief as is required to remedy any defect, imperfection or omission in the indictment, information, or complaint, including the following: (1) [a]ny matter of form; (2) [a]ny miswriting, misspelling, or improper English; (3) [a]ny misuse of a sign, symbol, figure, or abbreviation; or (4) [a]ny omission of the true name or any misspelling of the name of the defendant.\u201d This court has held that the state may properly amend an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>information to correct the date of commission of an offense, when the date is not a material ingredient of the crime charged; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>176 Conn. 275, 277, 407 A.2d 952 (1978); and may change the signature of the charging state\u2019s attorney, and remove parentheses around a drug name. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>166 Conn. 620, 629, 353 A.2d 764 (1974). In the present case the substantive charge and the persistent offender allegation were initially contained in the same indictment. Just before the start of trial the state made a nonsubstantive substitution by information of the language describing the charged violation. If the state had substituted by information a wholly different crime, then the defendant would obviously have to be reindicted for the new crime and the persistent felony offender violation. Here, however, the state acted within the bounds of \u00a7 622 by amending by information only the language of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The defendant\u2019s contentions under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 605 and 616<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appear to be that because these sections require that felonies punishable by death or life imprisonment be charged by indictment, the state cannot change such indictments by information. In light of our previous conclusion that the state properly amended the indictment, we find the defendant\u2019s argument unpersuasive. We are equally unconvinced by the defendant\u2019s citation of two state cases, <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>144 Conn. 295, 130 A.2d 562 (1957), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>176 Conn. 270, 407 A.2d 955 (1978), for the proposition that the state cannot amend by substitution an indictment charging a substantive offense and a persistent felony offender violation. In <em>Holloway, </em>this court addressed whether convictions occurring prior to the enactment of a persistent felony offender statute should be considered prior offenses for the purpose of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 297-98. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>We noted the constitutional and statutory requirement of \u201can indictment by a grand jury in all cases in which the penalty to be imposed may be life imprisonment.\u201d Id., 302. In <em>Lewis, </em>this court faced a situation in which the defendant was never indicted for either the substantive or persistent offender violations, even though together the charges could have resulted in a life sentence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 271-73. We held that the combination of a substantive offense and a persistent offender violation that results in the possibility of a life sentence conviction must be charged by indictment. Id., 272-73. Neither of these cases support the proposition that an indictment charging both a substantive and persistent felony offender violation, once properly issued, cannot be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The purpose of the rule requiring that the substantive and persistent felony offender violations be contained in the same indictment is to give the defendant adequate notice of the charges against him so that he may properly prepare his defense. See <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>385 U.S. 554, 567, 87 S. Ct. 648,17 L. Ed. 2d 606, reh. denied, 386 U.S. 969, 87 S. Ct. 1015, 18 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delmonto, </em>supra, 300. The defendant in the case before us concedes that he received notice of the charges and makes no claim that he was prejudiced or unfairly surprised by the amended information. Furthermore, we can find no substantive right of the defendant that has been infringed by the substituted information. We therefore hold that the trial court properly allowed the state to amend by information the indictment against the defendant, and correctly sentenced the defendant under the persistent dangerous felony offender statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1979)] Sec. 53a-70. sexual assault in the first degree: class B felony, (a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or (2) by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The defendant was indicted in 1980 under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) for first degree sexual assault committed by the use of force. We note that, at the time of the indictment, \u00a7 53a-70 did not contain a subsection (a) (1), and that by charging the defendant under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) the state\u2019s indictment read inconsistently with the statute. An investigation into the legislative history of the statute reveals the following: In 1975 the legislature amended \u00a7 53a-70. Prior to this amendment the subsection \u00a7 53a-70 (a) had been divided into two parts, (a) (1) and (a) (2). As a result of this amendment the legislature removed the subsection (1) designation, but left the designation (2) in the statute. Because it would be illogical for a statute divided into subsections to contain a subsection (2) but not a subsection (1), it is apparent that the legislature, in amending the statute, mistakenly either eliminated the numeral (1), or retained the numeral (2). We conclude from our investigation that the 1975 amendment should have removed both subsection numbers (1) and (2). Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that in 1981 the legislature removed the numeral (2) from \u00a7 53a-70 (a) by the technical amendment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Although the state incorrectly inserted the subsection numeral (1) in the defendant\u2019s indictment in the position it logically would have occupied in the statute prior to the 1975 amendment, we note that this error has technical significance only. Since the charge in the indictment coincided exactly with the language of the statute, the accidental inclusion of the (1) did not prejudice the defendant or deprive him of notice of the charges against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1979)] Sec. 53a-92. kidnapping in the first degree, (a) A person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and when: (1) His intent is to compel a third person to pay or deliver money or property as ransom, or to engage in other particular conduct or to refrain from engaging in particular conduct; or (2) he restrains the person abducted with intent to (A) inflict physical injury upon him or violate or abuse him sexually . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1979)] Sec. 53a-40. persistent offenders: definitions; defense; authorized sentences, (a) A persistent dangerous felony offender is a person who (1) stands convicted of manslaughter, arson, kidnapping, sexual assault, in the first or third degree, sexual assault in the first or third degree with a firearm, robbery in the first or second degree, or assault in the first degree; and (2) has been, prior to the commission of the present crime, convicted of and imprisoned, under a sentence to a term of imprisonment of more than one year or of death, in this state or in any other state or in a federal correctional institution for any of the following crimes: (A) The crimes enumerated in subdivision (1), the crime of murder, or an attempt to commit any of said crimes or murder; or (B) prior to October 1, 1975, any of the crimes enumerated in sections 53a-72, 53a-75 or 53a-78 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1975, or prior to October 1, 1971, in this state, assault with intent to kill under section 54-117, or any of the crimes enumerated in sections 53-9, 53-10, 53-11, 53-12 to 53-16, inclusive, 53-19, 53-21, 53-69, 53-78 to 53-80, inclusive, 53-82, 53-83, 53-86, 53-238 and 53-239 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to 1968, or any predecessor statutes in this state, or an attempt to commit any of said crimes; or (C) in any other state, any crimes the essential elements of which are substantially the same as any of the crimes enumerated in subdivision (1) or (2).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> The indictment under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) charged the defendant with first degree sexual assault by the use of force.
