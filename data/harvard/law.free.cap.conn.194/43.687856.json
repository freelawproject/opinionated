Thereafter the defendant filed a motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 572<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the case to the regular docket. The trial court denied the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A motion to reargue the motion to transfer was denied and a default judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was rendered against the defendant in the amount sought in the complaint. The defendant then filed a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Before addressing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we must first decide whether this court has jurisdiction to entertain the writ of error. Our jurisdiction is arguably impaired because (1) the defendant may not be sufficiently aggrieved by a default judgment to be entitled to bring a writ of error; and (2) the defendant may be precluded from bringing the writ of error by the language of General Statutes \u00a7 51-197a, as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 3 forbidding appeals from Small Claims judgments. We conclude that we have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-272<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides in part: \u201cWrits of error for errors in matters of law only may be brought from the judgments of the superior court to the supreme court . . . .\u2019\u2019In <em>Taff v. State, </em>39 Conn. 82, 83 (1872), and <em>Alling </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>16 Conn. 436, 442 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>(1844), we construed predecessors of this statute to require that the litigant bringing the writ of error be aggrieved. See also Practice Book \u00a7 3090.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, in <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 217, 175 A. 582 (1934), we acknowledged that \u201c[i]t may be that ordinarily a defendant who suffers a judgment by default is precluded from attacking that judgment by appeal or writ of error\u201d; Id., 221, citing 3 C.J. 604; but went on to find a limited exception for a trustee, where the default judgment adversely affected a beneficiary\u2019s interest in a trust res. Id. See also Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 237; cf. <em>Sidney Novelty Co. </em>v. <em>Hanlon, </em>79 Conn. 79, 63 A. 727 (1906). The rationale underlying this general rule concerning writs of error brought from default judgments was that by failing to appear and contest the action, the defendant implicitly consented to the judgment and, therefore, was not aggrieved. See 3 C.J. \u00a7 449, cited in <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra. See also Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc., supra.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Upon reconsideration we now hold that a party suffering from a default judgment may bring a writ of error where no statutory right of appeal exists.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We reach this conclusion relying upon our test, now well established, for determining when a party is aggrieved: \u201cThe fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, \u2018the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u2019 . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>FOIC, </em>191 Conn. 173,176, 463 A.2d 613 (1983).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>SeeKulmacz </em>v. <em>Kulmacz, </em>177 Conn. 410, 418 A.2d 76 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">There can be no question that the defendant has a personal and legal interest in the subject matter of this default judgment, i.e., whether she is liable for services rendered by the plaintiff. Nor can it be successfully maintained that her legal interest has not been \u201cinjuriously affected.\u201d A default judgment establishes the defendant\u2019s liability, and like any other judgment, may be executed according to statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-347 et seq. It makes no difference for purposes of aggrievement that the judgment was rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>because the defendant was defaulted rather than after the conclusion of a trial. We have recognized that a defendant may directly appeal from a default judgment where a statutory right of appeal exists. See, e.g., <em>Meinket </em>v. <em>Levinson, </em>193 Conn. 110, 112-14, 474 A.2d 454 (1984). It would be inconsistent to preclude a party suffering a default judgment from bringing a writ of error where no statutory right of appeal exists. Such a decision would result in insulating the judgment from all appellate review. We decline to construe our requirement of aggrievement in this manner where to do so would deprive a litigant of all appellate review. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>173 Conn. 104, 106, 376 A.2d 1091 (1977) (statute construed as not abrogating common law right of appellate review by writ of error).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Nor does the fact that the writ lies from the Small Claims division of the Superior Court, where no statutory right of appeal exists; General Statutes \u00a7 51-197a as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 3; preclude a more limited appellate review by writ of error. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-272. Certainly, the General Assembly could conclude that limited appellate review was all that was necessary for Small Claims cases. Construing our statutes as one consistent body of law, as we must; <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 472 A.2d 336 (1984); we conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 51-197a as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 3 does not preclude us from entertaining a writ of error pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-272 from the Small Claims division of the Superior Court and that we therefore have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim of error concerns the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant her motion to transfer the case to the regular docket. That motion was filed on July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>15, 1983, and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 572, was accompanied by an affidavit stating that a good defense to the claim existed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 572<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was adopted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-15,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which provides in part that \u201cthe judges of the superior court shall make such orders and rules as they deem necessary or advisable concerning . . . the hearing and determination of small claims . . . .\u2019\u2019At that time the Small Claims Court was a legislative court to which the general rulemaking authority of the Superior Court would not apply in the absence of such a statutory provision. Although the incorporation of the Small Claims Court into the Superior Court by the court unification act; General Statutes \u00a7 51-164s; now makes the rulemaking power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the Superior Court applicable to Small Claims matters, it should be noted that the General Assembly clearly anticipated that the right to transfer would exist. Section 51-15 states that \u201c[i]f a motion is granted to transfer a small claims matter to the regular docket in the court, the moving party shall pay the same fee as is paid for entering a civil action in the court.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-259 (establishing the fee for transfer).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The defendant claims that she satisfied one of the grounds for transfer set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 572, by filing an affidavit that a good defense exists and specifying its nature. We agree and conclude that the court should, therefore, have granted her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>We note at the outset that the language of Practice Book \u00a7 572, \u201cshall transfer,\u201d is generally construed as mandatory rather than permissive. See <em>Hossan </em>v. <em>Hudiakoff, </em>178 Conn. 381, 383, 423 A.2d 108 (1979). A trial court passing upon a motion made pursuant to a mandatory Practice Book rule can exercise no discretion other than in determining whether there is compliance with the rule. Moreover, Practice Book \u00a7 572 serves as a means for defendants to avoid the informal procedure of Small Claims Court and to opt for the more structured procedure of the regular docket, including the right of jury trial and appeal. Compare Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 547 through 591 to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a763 through 394. A Practice Book rule that protects important rights such as the right of jury trial and of appeal is generally construed as mandatory not directory. See <em>State </em>v. Cook, 183 Conn. 520, 441 A.2d 41 (1981); <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>1 Conn. App. 260, 470 A.2d 1234 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We hold, therefore, that where a defendant satisfies one of the conditions for a transfer set out in Practice Book \u00a7 572, his motion to transfer must be granted. In the present case the defendant alleged by affidavit that a good defense existed and requested a transfer. We find no deficiency in that affidavit which would render it insufficient to satisfy the requirement of Practice Book \u00a7 572 (2) (b) that the affidavit accompanying a motion to transfer state \u201cthat a good defense exists to the claim and [set] forth with specificity the nature of the defense . . . .\u2019\u2019Under these circumstances, the trial court had no discretion to deny the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\"> The only errors reviewable by a writ of error are those that appear on the face of the record. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 51, 454 A.2d 266 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-10\"> At the time the motion was filed, Practice Book \u00a7 572 provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">\u201cA case duly entered on the small claims docket of a geographical area court location shall be transferred to the regular docket of the superior court if the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">'\u201c(1) The defendant, or the plaintiff if the defendant has filed a counterclaim, shall file a motion to transfer the case to the regular docket.

Former Chief Justice Swift had opined, however, that the writ would lie from a default judgment: \u201cError will lie in all cases where there is error in law, apparent on the record, and in certain cases where there is error in fact, not apparent on the record. Whenever the pleadings terminate in a demurrer, so that the question appears upon the record, or where the court render an improper judgment on a verdict, motion in arrest, on default or on <em>nihil dicit, </em>a writ of error will lie. So where an issue in fact is tried by the court or jury, though no motion in arrest is made, yet if the declaration or any part of the pleadings is defective, or when judgment is rendered on default, if the declaration is bad, advantage can be taken by writ of error . ...\u201d 1 Swift, Digest p. 789.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 3090 provides in part that \u201c[a]n aggrieved party may file a writ of error in the supreme court only to review the final judgment of a judge or court in a case <em>where no unqualified statutory right of appeal has been provided.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\"> In <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v.
