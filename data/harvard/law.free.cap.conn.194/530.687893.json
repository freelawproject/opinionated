In his appeal the defendant claims that his conviction was vitiated by (1) the denial of his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to suppress certain evidence seized in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment; (2) the composition of the grand jury and the conduct of its proceedings; (3) the court\u2019s unauthorized amendment of the indictment; and (4) the prejudicial summation of the prosecutor. The defendant also claims that the consecutive sentences which the court imposed were illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the early morning of April 16,1979, the police were called to the Purolator Armored Car garage in Waterbury where three guards, Leslie Clark, Edward Cody and William West, were found shot to death. Each body suffered multiple gunshot wounds, and the exterior and interior of the garage were littered with 24 expended 30 caliber shell casings fired from two M-l semi-automatic carbines. The truck which Cody and West had driven from Hartford early that morning into the Waterbury garage where Clark was working alone was riddled with bullet holes, and its contents, a shipment of approximately 1.8 million dollars in cash, checks, food stamps and jewelry, were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Late in the afternoon of April 16, 1979, Patricia Dolphin came to the police with information that she had purchased an Iver Johnson M-1 carbine, serial number AA05518, at the request of Evelyn Vega for Lawrence Pelletier of Waterbury. Mrs. Dolphin related that Pelletier had been recently planning an armed robbery of the Purolator garage with a \u201cDonald\u201d whom Pelletier would talk to on the telephone. Mrs. Dolphin did not then know Donald\u2019s last name, but at the trial Mrs. Dolphin later identified Donald Couture as \u201cDonald.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Acting on this information, the police sought a search warrant for the Waterbury home of Lawrence Pelletier to search for the murder weapons, other tools and the stolen armored car shipment. They also sought a war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>rant for Lawrence Pelletier\u2019s telephone toll records. The search warrants were issued very early on the morning of April 17 and they were executed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Found at Pelletier\u2019s home where Pelletier and Evelyn Vega lived were an attache case containing money, literature for a 30 caliber M-l carbine and two expended shell casings ejected from the same M-l carbine fired at the murder scene. The weapon itself and the robbery loot were not, however, at the Pelletier home.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The telephone toll record search revealed that Lawrence Pelletier often called a Donald Couture of Wallingford. On the basis of this and other information, during the early morning hours of April 17,1979, the police sought a search warrant for Couture\u2019s premises in Wallingford. The search warrant was issued, and before dawn on the 17th the police entered the home of Donald Couture. There they found Donald Couture hiding under his bed. In the basement of that home were located the stolen armored car shipment, consisting of approximately $1,800,000 in cash, checks, food stamps, jewelry, empty deposit bags, and deposit slips made out by Purolator customers and a gun locker containing two 30 caliber M-l carbines. Couture was later found to have the key to the gun cabinet on his key chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The two M-1\u2019s, one an Inland Marine model and the other the Iver Johnson, serial number AA05518, bought for Pelletier, were examined and compared with expended cartridge cases and bullets found at the Purolator garage and with bullets recovered from the bodies and clothing of the slain guards. These latter bullets did not, as did other bullets, pass through the guards\u2019 bodies. Ten of the ejected cartridge cases at the murder scene came from the Iver Johnson carbine and fourteen had been ejected from the Inland Marine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>carbine. Bullets from the bodies of all three victims had been fired from the Iver Johnson carbine and bullets from the bodies of Leslie Clark and Edward Cody had been fired from the Inland Marine weapon. Six bullet jacket fragments and one bullet fired from the Inland Marine weapon were also found at the Purolator garage, as well as two such fragments fired from the Iver Johnson carbine. These bullets and fragments were bloody.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">On April 12,1979, the Inland Marine M-1 carbine had been purchased under a fictitious name from the North Haven Gun Company by Donna Couture as a gift for her husband, the defendant. On April 13, Pelletier and Donald Couture were seen going into the woods near Wallingford and a great number of shots were heard in those woods. A bullet and seven expended cartridge cases recovered from the woods were found to have been fired from the Iver Johnson and one such expended cartridge case was found to have been ejected from the Inland Marine M-1 carbine.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">A pair of Hit 800 bolt cutters was also found in the defendant\u2019s gun locker. These cutters had been used to cut a Page metal fence surrounding the Purolator garage to allow entry into the area. These same cutters had previously been borrowed from a Waterbury neighbor of Lawrence Pelletier by Pelletier\u2019s son. Found in Couture\u2019s basement gun locker were also two ski masks with the eye openings narrowed by thread which Pelletier\u2019s girlfriend, Evelyn Vega, had prepared for the robbery, as well as trousers recognized as Pelletier\u2019s. In Couture\u2019s gun locker the police also found an attache case, of the same type as the one found in Pelletier\u2019s house, filled with money. A footlocker was also found in Couture\u2019s basement together with store boxes for the two attache cases. All three pieces of luggage had been purchased by Pelletier and Vega on April 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The jury heard evidence that when the police found the money in Couture\u2019s home one officer stated: \u201cWe found the money,\u201d at which time the defendant stated: \u201cAnybody could have put it in the basement,\u2019\u2019although no one had stated where the money had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Donald Couture\u2019s defense consisted of cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses and the presentation of three defense witnesses. One defense witness was Hurlburt Dolphin, a brother-in-law of Patricia Dolphin, who attacked the credibility of Patricia Dolphin and stated Mrs. Dolphin once asked him for firearms. A second defense witness was Barbara Ranando of the Colonial Bank and Trust Company who identified a bank deposit bag found with the robbery loot as a Colonial Bank deposit bag given in 1975 to Richard Demonte, the last Couture witness. Demonte testified he had been a partner of the defendant, Donald Couture in a luncheonette business which closed in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Seizure of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">On April 16, 1979, three guards of Purolator Security, Inc., were murdered and over 1.7 million dollars worth of U.S. currency, jewelry and other items were stolen in an armed robbery at the Purolator Security (Purolator) building at 20 Dunbar Lane, Waterbury. On April 17,1979, pursuant to a search warrant issued by Judge Henebry, law enforcement authorities entered the defendant\u2019s residence at 227 Hall Avenue in Wallingford and seized, inter alia, two M-1 carbine rifles and seven bags of currency containing more than $800,000. The defendant challenges the seizure on the grounds that (1) there was insufficient probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant and (2) the currency was not properly seized under the plain view doctrine. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">PROBABLE CAUSE TO SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u201cUnder existing law, valid warrants may be issued to search <em>any </em>property ... at which there is probable cause to believe that fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of a crime will be found.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Zurcher </em>v. <em>Stanford Daily, </em>436 U.S. 547, 554, 98 S. Ct. 1970, 56 L. Ed. 2d 525, reh. denied, 439 U.S. 885, 99 S. Ct. 231, 58 L. Ed. 2d 200 (1978). Whether there is probable cause is to be determined upon facts stated in the affidavit purporting to establish grounds for issuing the warrant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 579, 91 S. Ct. 2075, 29 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 530, 427 A.2d 1338 (1980). In considering the sufficiency of the affidavit we confine ourselves to the facts which appear on the face of the affidavit or which properly may be inferred therefrom; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>170 Conn. 618, 629, 368 A.2d 140, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 865, 97 S. Ct. 174, 50 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1976); testing those facts with common sense and reality; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1965); and with great deference to the fact that the issuing magistrate did determine that probable cause existed. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 270-71, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1960). The limited issue in the present case is whether it was reasonable to infer from the facts appearing in the affidavit that the weapons which were used in the robbery and murder at Purolator would be found at the defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">When a warrant is sought to search specific premises for certain objects the information appearing in the affidavit should demonstrate a nexus between the objects to be seized and the premises to be searched. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Charest, </em>602 F.2d 1015, 1017 (1st Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>1979). That nexus \u201c[does] not have to rest on direct observation, but can be inferred from the type of crime, the nature of the items sought, the extent of an opportunity for concealment and normal inferences as to where a criminal would hide a [weapon] used in the commission of a murder.\u201d Id.; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lucarz, </em>430 F.2d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir. 1970); <em>Mills </em>v. <em>State, </em>278 Md. 262, 363 A.2d 491 (1976); <em>Bollinger </em>v. <em>State, </em>556 P.2d 1035 (Okla. Crim. App. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The affidavit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stated that on April 16, 1979, a murder and robbery occurred at the Purolator Security office in Waterbury and about 1.7 million dollars and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>other items were stolen. It further stated that on that same day Patricia Dolphin, a friend of Eyelyn Pelletier, the live-in girl friend of Lawrence Pelletier, related to the affiant in specific detail that the defendant and Lawrence Pelletier planned, cased and participated in the Purolator robbery, that they had gained access to the Purolator garage building using wire and bolt cutters, and that Pelletier borrowed the wire cutters from a neighbor and stated to Dolphin that the cutters were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>needed to cut the wires on the fence for the \u201cjob.\u201d It also stated that the type of weapon used in the murder of the three Purolator guards was an M-l carbine rifle, that on April 7, 1979, Dolphin, at Evelyn Pelletier\u2019s request, purchased an M-l carbine rifle which, according to a forensic ballistics expert had been used in the murder, and that spent shell casings from such rifle were found at the scene of the crime and matching casings were found, pursuant to a search warrant, at Pelletier\u2019s residence but that no carbine rifle was found there. The affidavit did not mention the recovery of any of the stolen money, but it did further state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>that Pelletier, according to Dolphin, customarily uses a 1970 green Dodge with a black top, that this vehicle was observed by Detective Bouley at the Pelletier premises on the evening of April 16, 1979, and that the defendant, who had according to Dolphin participated with Pelletier in numerous crimes in the past, had no police record. The issuing magistrate, <em>Henebry, J., </em>found that there was probable cause to believe that the items referred to in the affidavit would be found either on the person of the defendant or at his residence in Wallingford.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The crime occurred on April 16, 1979. The application and affidavit were submitted to the issuing magistrate in the very early hours of the next day. Included in the items stolen from Purolator were almost two million dollars of U.S. currency. With that huge amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of money to secrete, the magistrate could infer that the perpetrators were faced with the elephant dilemma (where do you hide an elephant?). An earlier search of the Pelletier residence uncovered neither the weapon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>nor the huge amount of stolen money. That the search warrant, for whatever reason, did not authorize a search for the money does not mean that the magistrate could not utilize the information and inferences respecting the money in drawing an inference concerning the likely location of the murder weapon. In these circumstances it was reasonable for the issuing magistrate to infer that the money, because of its bulk and because of the time constraints, would likely be stored at a convenient \u201csafe\u201d house. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lucarz, </em>supra. It is also a logical inference that a criminal who believes his identity is concealed would utilize his residence as such a safe place; <em>Bollinger </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 1039; not only for storage of the loot but also as a temporary depository for the weapon used in the crime. The magistrate could consider that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>no reason to suspect that, at that early stage, the investigative probe would move in his direction. He had participated with Pelletier in other crimes in the past and had remained unscathed. Although with the passage of time the situation might change; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Charest, </em>supra, 1018; at the time of the issuance of the warrant it was reasonable for the magistrate to infer that the defendant\u2019s residence was the logical place to conceal not only the fruits but also the instrumentalities of the crime. 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 3.7, p. 709. \u201cIn considering the situation realistically, the logical inference is that a criminal, who believes his identity has been concealed, would return [the weapon] and property to his home. Such an inference is not certainty, but a certainty is not required. And, we are of the opinion that, at the least, a probability existed that the property sought was indeed at the residence of the defendant.\u201d <em>Bollinger </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>supra, does not require a different result. In that case, we held that the affidavit was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause that marihuana was located in the defendant\u2019s apartment. There the affidavit revealed that a drug transaction was arranged over the phone located in the apartment. The police then observed the defendant leave the building in which the apartment was located, enter a car parked near the building, drive directly to the designated meeting place and consummate the transaction. Id., 524-25. The affidavit did not state whether, when the defendant left the apartment building, he was carrying a package. Id., 532. We concluded that these observations of activity around the building did not sufficiently support the conclusion that there was probable cause to believe that there was marihuana in the apartment. Id., 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>In <em>DeChamplain </em>there was not enough evidence connecting the marihuana with the apartment. In the present case the affidavit contained substantial facts from which the magistrate could conclude that there was probable cause to believe the weapon was located in the defendant\u2019s house. The magistrate knew from the affidavit that a search of Pelletier\u2019s house had not revealed the money or the weapon. He also knew that the amount of money was substantial and hence not easily disposed of. Further, the magistrate knew that the defendant had no criminal record. From this the magistrate could reasonably infer that the defendant believed his identity was unknown and that his house was at least temporarily a secure place in which to store the money. These reasonable inferences would have sufficed to establish probable cause to believe that the money would be found at the defendant\u2019s home. In contradistinction to <em>DeChamplain, </em>therefore, the defendant\u2019s residence was factually implicated in the defendant\u2019s criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The affidavit also disclosed that the murder weapon was recently purchased and bore a serial number which made it easily traceable to Pelletier. The magistrate could reasonably infer that the defendant would have an interest in secreting this weapon or dismantling it, before it could be associated with the defendant. The magistrate was aware that all of this had to be accomplished in the relatively short period of time that had elapsed since the crime, and in a safe place. It was reasonable for the magistrate to conclude that, if the defendant believed that his house was a safe place for the money, it was also a safe place temporarily to hide the weapon. \u201cWhere the object of the search is a weapon used in the crime . . . the inference that the items are at the offender\u2019s residence is especially compelling, at least in those cases where the perpetrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>is unaware that the victim has been able to identify him to the police.\u201d 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In reviewing the sufficiency of an affidavit for a search warrant we do not conduct a de novo review. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1237, 104 S. Ct. 33, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1453 (1983). Rather, the traditional standard of review is whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing. Id. In considering the quantum of certainty required, it is only a probability, and not a prima facie showing of criminal activity, that is the standard of probable cause. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Travisano, </em>724 F.2d 341, 346 (2d Cir. 1983). If there is a fair probability that the premises to be searched will yield the objects specified in the search warrant, the fourth amendment has been satisfied even where many localities were available to the guilty parties to secrete the fruits and instrumentalities of the crime. Id. Applying these standards, we agree with the trial court that there was a substantial basis for the issuing magistrate to conclude that the weapon used in the murder would be found at the defendant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">SEIZURE OF MONEY - PLAIN VIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Given the lawful entry of the police into the defendant\u2019s residence pursuant to a valid search warrant the next question is whether they were justified in seizing the money which was observed in a number of trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>parent bags. The defendant argues that under <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564, reh. denied, 404 U.S. 874, 92 S. Ct. 26, 30 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1971), the police could seize under the plain view doctrine only articles which they came upon inadvertently and that the money was not in that category, since in their application they sought permission to search for the money but that the warrant contained no such authority. While it is true that seizure of items in plain view is limited to those items which police come upon inadvertently, inadvertence is not required if the items seized fall under the category of contraband, stolen property or objects dangerous in themselves. See <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>supra, 466; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Liberti, </em>616 F.2d 34, 38 (2d Cir. 1980) (Newman, J., concurring); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 649, 431 A.2d 501, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). The seizure of the seven bags of U.S. currency was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">On August 29,1979, the defendant filed an omnibus motion to dismiss the indictment which challenged, inter alia, (1) the underrepresentation of certain groups on Waterbury grand juries;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) the presence and par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ticipation of unauthorized persons in the grand jury proceedings; and (3) the withholding of allegedly exculpatory evidence from the grand jury. The trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>denied the motion and the defendant assigns this as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">CHALLENGE TO GRAND JURY ARRAY</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The defendant claims that the underrepresentation of Hispanics<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on grand juries in the judicial district of Waterbury violated his rights to equal protection and due process as provided by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and as a result the indictment should have been dismissed. In support of his claim the defendant presented the following relevant evidence. During the period of January 1, 1973, until June 6, 1979, the date of the defendant\u2019s indictment, there were thirty-four grand juries in the judicial district of Waterbury. Of the 612 grand jurors composing the array, only six or .98 percent were Hispanic. The Hispanic population during the relevant period constituted 4.5 percent of the population of the judicial district of Waterbury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The trial court, in an exhaustive memorandum of decision, held that since the defendant was not Hispanic he had no standing to raise an equal protection challenge. It further concluded that the defendant could not raise a due process challenge because the sixth amendment requirement that state juries reflect a fair cross-section of the community was inapplicable to state grand juries. The court reasoned that unlike the sixth amendment, the grand jury provisions of the fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>amendment have not been made applicable to the states by the due process clause; <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884); and therefore any right to a representative grand jury applies only to federal grand juries. Consequently, the court did not reach the issue of whether the disparity between the percentage of Hispanics in the population and their representation on the array was constitutionally significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We agree with the trial court that the defendant\u2019s equal protection claim is not cognizable. It is well settled that in order to bring such a challenge, the defendant must be a member of the underrepresented class. <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 494, 97 S. Ct. 1272, 51 L. Ed. 2d 498 (1977). We do not agree, however, that the defendant is precluded from raising a due process challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Although a state is not required to utilize a grand jury as part of its criminal justice system, when it chooses to do so it must \u201chew to federal constitutional criteria.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Jury Commission of Greene County, Alabama, </em>396 U.S. 320, 330, 90 S. Ct. 518, 24 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1970); <em>Cobbs </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>528 F.2d 1331, 1334 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 947, 96 S. Ct. 1419, 47 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>164 Conn. 402, 407, 324 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 861, 94 S. Ct. 77, 38 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1973). In <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Kiff </em>407 U.S. 493, 502, 92 S. Ct. 2163, 33 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1972) (plurality opinion), the court recognized a due process challenge to a state grand jury, without requiring the defendant to be a member of the underrepresented class. \u201c[A] [sjtate cannot, consistent with due process, subject a defendant to indictment or trial by a jury that has been selected in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States. Illegal and unconstitutional jury selection procedures cast doubt on the integrity of the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>judicial process.\u201d Though this holding commanded only three votes,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it has never been overruled. Indeed, its vitality has most recently been affirmed in <em>Hobby </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. , 104 S. Ct. 3093, 3097, 82 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">This court has implicitly acknowledged the applicability of the due process clause to the selection of the grand jury. Just this term in <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 481 A.2d 56 (1984), we exhaustively considered the defendant\u2019s due process challenge to the composition of the grand jury. Previously, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>supra, 407-11, we discussed the defendant\u2019s claim that the grand jury was not drawn from a fair cross-section of the community. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Reinosa, </em>29 Conn. Sup. 117, 274 A.2d 452 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">We recognize that there is some authority for the trial court\u2019s position. See, e.g., <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Partida, </em>supra, 509 (Powell, J., dissenting); <em>Villafane </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>504 F. Sup. 78, 82 n.6 (D. Conn.), aff d without opinion, 639 F.2d 770 (2d Cir. 1980);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>125 Ariz. 146, 608 P.2d 83 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>414 N.E.2d 984 (Mass. 1980). The clear weight of authority is, however, to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>Obregon </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>United States, </em>423 A.2d 200 (D.C. App. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 918, 101 S. Ct. 3054, 69 L. Ed. 2d 422 (1981); <em>Colvin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>570 S.W.2d 281 (Ky. 1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>351 So. 2d 493 (La. 1977); <em>Adler </em>v. <em>State, </em>594 P.2d 725 (Nev. 1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>158 N.J. Super. 269, 385 A.2d 1258 (1978); <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, </em>60 N.Y.2d 403, 409 n.3, 457 N.E.2d 1143, 469 N.Y.S.2d 916 (1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 951, 104 S. Ct. 2155, 80 L.

App. 17, 607 P.2d 218 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenison, </em>405 A.2d 3 (R.I. 1979); <em>Post </em>v. <em>State, </em>580 S.W.2d 801 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1979). We hold that the defendant\u2019s due process challenge to the composition of the grand jury is cognizable. Accordingly, we will consider the merits of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 421-22, 481 A.2d 56 (1984), we set out the proper analysis for a fair cross-section challenge: \u201c \u2018In order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, the defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\u2019 <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>[439 U.S. 357], 364, [99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1979)]. Once the defendant has established this prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the state to prove that the selection system resulting in a nonrepresentative array furthers a significant state interest. Id., 367.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">It is beyond dispute that Hispanics constitute a distinct group in the community. Id., 424; <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>164 Conn. 637, 325 A.2d 251 (1973). The defendant has satisfied this element of his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>It is in the second element, proof of substantial under-representation; <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>supra, 425-26; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 440, 450 A.2d 828 (1982); that the defendant fails. In <em>Castonguay, </em>supra, 427-30, we examined various methods used to describe and evaluate underrepresentation. We concluded that in a due process challenge where the distinct group constitutes a small percentage of the population in the community, the most accurate method is the substantial impact test. \u201cIts focus is not on numbers and percentages but rather on whether the underrepresentation substantially affects the composition of the grand jury.\u201d Id., 430. When we apply that method to this case, the defendant cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The grand jury array during the relevant period was composed of 612 grand jurors. If the array reflected the number of Hispanics in the judicial district (4.5 percent), it should have included approximately twenty-eight Hispanics (4.5 percent of 612). The array included six Hispanics. Hispanics were therefore underrepresented by almost twenty-two grand jurors. In substantial impact terms, slightly more than one Hispanic should have been included on every other grand jury. Since \u201conly \u2018gross\u2019 or \u2018marked\u2019 disparities or \u2018substantial\u2019 departures from a \u2018fair cross section\u2019 require judicial intervention\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Test, </em>550 F.2d 577, 590 (10th Cir. 1976); we cannot conclude that this underrepresentation is constitutionally significant. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>supra, 430-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">PRESENCE AND CONDUCT OF UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS BEFORE THE GRAND JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">During the course of the grand jury proceedings, counsel for the defendant and counsel for his codefendant Lawrence Pelletier requested the trial court\u2019s permission to accompany their clients in the grand jury room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>during the taking of testimony. The court ruled that any of the accused called as a witness had the right to an attorney\u2019s presence during the time he or she was testifying, but none of the defendant\u2019s attorneys would otherwise be permitted to attend the proceedings. The court explicitly instructed the grand jury: \u201cIn the event that any of the accused is called as a witness, your foreman or forelady shall instruct that person that he or she has a right to remain silent, right to consult and have an attorney present and a right to stop answering any questions at any time without giving any reason .... If an attorney is present, he shall not participate in the questioning but rather be present for the sole purpose of conferring with his or her client. When the witness has finished testifying counsel shall be excused from the Grand Jury room.\u201d The defendant did not object to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Since the defendant did not testify, his counsel was not present in the grand jury room at any time. His codefendants Evelyn Vega and Donna Couture did testify, however, and their respective attorneys, David Rosen and Hugh Keefe, were permitted by the court to be present during their testimony. The defendant, whose counsel was present when permission was granted, did not object. In disregard of the trial court\u2019s express instructions, both counsel participated in the questioning of their clients. The defendant claims that the attorneys\u2019 presence and conduct require dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The first aspect of the defendant\u2019s claim is addressed to the trial court\u2019s action in authorizing the attorneys\u2019 presence. The defendant urges us to adopt a per se rule similar to that in the federal courts; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>435 F. Sup. 610, 618 (N.D. Okla. 1977), and cases cited therein; and hold that the presence of any unauthorized person in the grand jury room vitiates the indictment. The defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>failed to preserve properly this claim for appeal. Though he had ample opportunity to do so, at no time did the defendant object to the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the attorneys\u2019 presence. Practice Book \u00a7 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The issue of who is authorized to be present in the grand jury room is a matter of practice embodied in Practice Book \u00a7 609.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It does not implicate a fundamental constitutional right. Consequently, the defendant, having failed to object below, cannot claim error on appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 3063.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Nor can we consider the second aspect of the defendant\u2019s claim, that the attorneys, in disregard of the trial court\u2019s instructions, elicited testimony from their clients. In support of his claim that he was prejudiced by this questioning the defendant relied on the transcript of the grand jury proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This he cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">At the time of the offense, General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 54-45a limited the evidentiary use of the grand jury transcript in any proceeding against the accused to \u201cimpeaching a witness, attacking the credibility of a witness or proving inconsistent statements of a witness. Such transcript may also be used as evidence in a prosecution for perjury committed by a witness while giving such testimony.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Canady, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>187 Conn. 281, 287, 445 A.2d 895 (1982), we construed the substance<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of this statute strictly and concluded that a defendant may not prevail on claims of error that depend on the unauthorized use of the grand jury transcript. Because the defendant\u2019s use of the grand jury transcript is not authorized by the statute we cannot consider this claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">EVIDENCE NOT PRESENTED TO THE GRAND JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The state and the defendant have stipulated that certain information<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was withheld from the grand jury. The defendant claims that it was exculpatory and that because it was withheld from the grand jury his indictment should be dismissed. There is no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Since the grand jury does not consider the guilt or innocence of the accused but only determines whether he or she should stand trial, the accused \u201cis not allowed to testify or to introduce evidence tending to prove his innocence except insofar as his questioning of the state\u2019s witnesses may disclose the weakness of the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>159 Conn. 264, 274-75, 268 A.2d 667 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>181 Conn. 268, 274, 435 A.2d 701 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1077, 101 S. Ct. 856, 66 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1981). The purpose of the grand jury is not to duplicate the trial but rather to satisfy itself that \u201cthere is probable cause to believe that the accused is in danger of conviction of [the crime charged].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>supra, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The Connecticut grand jury system is almost unique in that the state\u2019s role in the proceedings is minimal. The state\u2019s attorney is not permitted in the grand jury room and his task is confined to submitting to the grand jury a list of witnesses who he believes will testify in support of the indictment. The grand jury is not at all bound by this list. Id., 276; see <em>Lung\u2019s Case, </em>1 Conn. 428 (1815); Practice Book \u00a7 614. The defendant, with the court\u2019s permission, is allowed in the room during the presentation of evidence; Practice Book \u00a7 609; and can question the witnesses. Thus, unlike in the federal system and in other states, the grand jury is not dependent on the state\u2019s attorney for both advice and information. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ciambrone, </em>601 F.2d 616, 622 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>Frink </em>v. <em>State, </em>597 P.2d 154 (Alaska 1979). Consequently, in the absence of a request by the grand jury, the state is not obligated to present the grand jury with every piece of relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We do believe, however, that since the state has no interest in accusing the wrong person, it is obliged to present the grand jury with any substantial evidence that would negate the accused\u2019s guilt, that is evidence which \u201cmight reasonably be expected to lead the jury not to indict.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ciambrone, </em>supra, 623. It is unnecessary for us to discuss each piece of information contained in the stipulation. Suffice it to say that we have examined the information and conclude that none of it would have precluded a finding of probable cause. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\u201cAmendment\u201d to Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The defendant asserts that the trial court impermissibly amended the indictments contained in counts five and six and therefore the defendant\u2019s convictions on these counts should be reversed and these indictments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>should be dismissed. Count five<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> initially charged the defendant both with intentional and felony murder of guard Edward Cody. Because the indictment did not contain an allegation that the defendant intended to cause Cody\u2019s death, at an earlier stage of the proceedings, that part of the indictment was dismissed. Count six<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> charged the defendant both with intentional and felony murder of William West. The jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder in counts five and six and not guilty of intentional murder in count six.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in subsection (a) defines intentional murder. Section 53a-54c<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> defines felony murder. Subsection (c) of \u00a7 53a-54a prescribes the punishment for both intentional and felony murder. It is, therefore, proper in an indictment for felony murder to allege violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54c and 53a-54a (c). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 153, 434 A.2d 356, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>2d 607 (1980). The fact that the indictment alleged violation of \u00a7 53a-54a without specifically alluding to subsection (c) is of no consequence. \u201cThe language of an indictment serves two primary purposes: it informs the accused of the nature of the crime charged and it acts as a bar to future criminal proceedings on the same cause.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 167, 319 A.2d 381 (1972). An indictment charging an accused with intentional and felony murder of a particular victim charges a single offense, committed conjunctively in two different ways. Id., 166; <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>163 Conn. 527, 532, 316 A.2d 387 (1972). Counts five and six initially charged both intentional and felony murder. Under such counts the jury may convict if it finds that the murder was committed in either or both of the ways alleged. When the first part of count five was dismissed the second part charging the defendant with felony murder remained. The defendant was on proper notice of the offense with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The court quite properly instructed the jury to disregard \u00a7 53a-54a in its consideration of the felony murder indictments. The jury is concerned only with the elements of the crime charged. The defendant does not claim nor is there a basis for a claim that the jury was not properly instructed on the elements of the crime of felony murder. The penalty provisions of \u00a7 53a-54a were not matters for the jury\u2019s consideration since it is not the jury\u2019s duty to pass upon the punishment of the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>96 Conn. 238, 243, 113 A. 458 (1921); <em>State </em>v. <em>Main, </em>75 Conn. 55, 63, 52 A. 257 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Prosecutor\u2019s Summation</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">During the opening summation, Walter Scanlon, chief assistant state\u2019s attorney, reading from a prepared text, made a number of disparaging comments about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>defendant and his codefendant, characterizing them, inter alia, as \u201cmurderous fiends,\u201d \u201crats,\u201d \u201cutterly merciless killers\u201d and \u201cinhumane, unfeeling and reprehensible creatures.\u201d The defendant\u2019s repeated objections to these remarks on the defendant\u2019s character were overruled and his requests for curative instructions were denied. At the conclusion of this opening summation, the defendant moved in the alternative for a mistrial or for the court to strike Scanlon\u2019s entire summation or those portions which the defendant recited on the record,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> together with \u201cthe strongest possible instructions to the jury to disregard all such comments.\u201d The trial court denied the motion but at the conclusion of its instructions to the jury stated the following: \u201cI specifically charge you not to be inflamed by the passionate nature of State\u2019s Attorney Scanlon\u2019s argument or by his repeated personal comments on the defendants. The defendants\u2019 character is not in issue. With respect to Mr. Scanlon\u2019s argument before you, I specifically charge you that you are not to consider any personal observations of his as to the guilt or innocence of the defendants, or as to the credibility of any witness.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 458, 470, 374 A.2d 1107 (1977), we stated \u201cthat a prosecutor should avoid arguments which are calculated to influence the passions or prejudices of the jury, or which would have the effect of diverting the jury\u2019s attention from their duty to decide the case on the evidence.\u201d Measured against this standard Scanlon\u2019s argument was improper. \u201cIt is no part of a district attorney\u2019s duty, and it is not his right, to stigmatize a defendant. He has a right to <em>argue </em>that <em>the evidence </em>proves the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment, but for the <em>district attorney himself to characterize </em>the defendant as \u2018a cold-blooded killer\u2019 is something quite different. No man on trial for murder can be officially characterized as a murderer or as \u2018a cold-blooded killer,\u2019 until he is adjudged guilty of murder or pleads guilty to that charge.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Capalla, </em>322 Pa. 200, 204, 185 A. 203 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">But that is not the end of the inquiry. Because the right implicated is the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial, we proceed next to an examination of the remarks to determine their likely impact. \u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>186 Conn. 476, 489, 442 A.2d 1320 (1982). \u201cThe question before us on this appeal is not, primarily, whether the remarks in question were proper or improper, but it is whether the action of the trial court in refusing to grant a new trial on account of them, in the exercise of its discretion, so far exceeded or abused the discretion committed to it in a matter of this kind as to warrant us in granting a new trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Laudano, </em>74 Conn. 638, 646, 51 A. 860 (1902). The question then is whether the remarks of the prosecution were so egregious that no curative instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>could remove their prejudicial impact. If the characterization of the defendant consisted of an isolated remark we would conclude that the potential prejudicial impact on the jury could be obviated by a curative instruction. But here, where the prosecutor persisted in his invective and the defendant\u2019s repeated objections were overruled, the jury could only be left with the impression that the comments were proper. To suggest that an instruction would neutralize the prejudicial impact is to defy reality. \u201cNot even appellate judges can be so naive as really to believe that all twelve jurors succeeded in performing what Judge L. Hand aptly called \u2018a mental gymnastic which is beyond, not only their powers, but anybody\u2019s else.\u2019 <em>Nash </em>v. <em>United States, </em>54 F.2d 1006, 1007 (2d Cir. 1932).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bozza, </em>365 F.2d 206, 215 (2d Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">When a defendant has been convicted of committing a number of heinous crimes on a record that does not permit serious doubt of his guilt, it is painful to reverse his conviction. Our constitution, however, does not condition constitutional rights on guilt or innocence. \u201cIndeed, it is \u2018well established that serious prosecutorial misconduct, regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s intentions, may so pollute a criminal prosecution as to require a new trial, even without regard to the prejudice to the defendant.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>[168 Conn. 230,] 251, [362 A.2d 925, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S. Ct. 95, 46 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1975)]. Crucial considerations in appellate adjudication of such questions are not only the need, where demonstrated, to discipline prosecutors where reprehensible conduct is present but to assure ultimate fairness to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>supra, 252; see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>192 Conn. 618, 629, 473 A.2d 1200 (1984). Each case necessarily depends on its own facts and circumstances. If the challenged remarks occurred in the heat of a sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>mation, if they were only isolated or brief episodes in a lengthy summation and if they were followed by a curative instruction, the weight of the evidence against the defendant could be a significant factor in upholding his conviction. See annot., 40 L. Ed. 2d 886, Due Process-Prosecutor\u2019s Statements. But here the prosecutor\u2019s prepared remarks were deliberate, facially improper, persistent and pronounced. In these circumstances the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that because of the strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt his remarks should be found harmless has a hollow ring. \u201c[A]ppeals to passion and prejudice may so poison the minds of jurors even in a strong case that an accused may be deprived of a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U.S. 150, 240, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129, reh. denied, 310 U.S. 658, 60 S. Ct. 1091, 84 L. Ed. 1421 (1940). The prosecutor cannot pollute the waters and then claim that we should ignore his actions because the fish are not worth saving. Given the egregious nature of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, a failure on our part to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction would suggest that in a strong case the defendant is not entitled to a fair trial and therefore anything goes. We conclude that in his opening summation the prosecutor\u2019s character assassination of the defendant so tainted the trial as to deny the defendant due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of . . . liberty . . . without due process of law . . . .\u2019\u2019It is the prosecutor\u2019s duty to ensure that a defendant\u2019s conviction comports with this provision. As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 168-69, 113 A. 452 (1921) \u201c[b]y reason of his office, [the prosecutor] usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment.\u201d Because the prosecutor\u2019s remarks denied the defendant a fair trial in violation of both the federal and state constitutions, the trial court erred not only in overruling the defendant\u2019s objections to the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks but also in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Consecutive Sentences \u2014 Felony Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The defendant was convicted of both the intentional and the felony murder of Leslie Clark and of the felony murders of Edward Cody and William West. He received separate sentences for the murder of each guard, the term (twenty-five years to life) of each sentence to be served consecutively. The defendant challenges the legality of these consecutive sentences both as a matter of statutory construction and as a violation of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s position in either respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Felony murder is a crime against the person. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, which proscribes felony murder, provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits . . . robbery . . . and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime ... he, or another participant . . . causes the death of a person other than one of the participants . . . .\u201d Death caused in the course of and in furtherance of the underlying felony is an essential element of the crime of felony murder. <em>State </em>v. <em>MacFarlane, </em>188 Conn. 542, 550, 450 A.2d 374 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 605, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The statute refers to the death of \u201ca person\u201d in the singular. A fundamental purpose of the criminal law is to protect individual citizens from the criminal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>duct of another. People are neither fungible nor amorphous. Where crimes against persons are involved, a separate interest of society has been invaded for each violation. Therefore when two or more persons are the victims of a single episode there are as many offenses as there are victims. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>132 Ariz. 64, 70, 643 P.2d 1034 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Irvin, </em>603 S.W.2d 121 (Tenn. 1980); <em>Vigil </em>v. <em>State, </em>563 P.2d 1344, 1351 (Wyo. 1977). As the Wyoming Court so aptly stated in <em>Vigil, </em>(p. 1351): \u201cIt must be noted that \u2018any human being\u2019 is in the singular and there is no indication that the defendant can get a bargain rate if he assaults a group of human beings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">There are no double jeopardy obstacles to our construction of the felony murder statute. The double jeopardy clause of the United States constitution protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). \u201cWith respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.\u201d <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S. Ct. 673, 74 L. Ed. 2d 535 (1983). It does not prevent either multiple convictions or multiple punishment for multiple offenses. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>631 P.2d 854, 855-56 (Utah 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In this opinion Peters, Grillo and Ment, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> \u201cAFFIDAVIT AND APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT</p>\n<p id=\"Ax2H\">TO: A JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">\u201cThe undersigned, being duly sworn, complains on oath that the undersigned has probable cause to believe that certain property, to wit: .30 caliber Ml carbine rifle Serial # AAo5518 or bearing another or no serial #, magazines for said Ml carbine rifle, ammunition for said Ml Carbine rifle, spent cartridge case or cases for said Ml Carbine rifle, spent projectiles for said Ml carbine rifle, hacksaws, wrenches, wire cutters and fingerprints of Donald Couture. 1973 Cadillac HT color grey, Ct.

A vehicle being green with black top was observed by Det. Bouley at the premises on 4-16-79. It was used by Pelletier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">\u201c4. That Mrs. Dolphin stated that she (Mrs. Dolphin) purchased an Ml carbine rifle bearing S.N.AA05518, in Meriden for said Pelletier on April 7, 1979, at Evelyn Pelletier aka Evelyn Vega\u2019s request. Such a weapon according to James E. McDonald, a forensic criminalistics and ballistic expert, who examined the crime scene and removed spent cartridge cases therefrom on April 16, 1979, was fired over 30 times at the scene where the three guards were victims of multiple and deadly gunshot wounds and the armored car was fired upon many times in said robbery. This information was given to said affiants by said McDonald.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">\u201c5. That within the past two weeks said Pelletier discussed with Evelyn Pelletier aka Evelyn Vega in the presence of Mrs. Dolphin that he was going to do a big job.

Mrs. Dolphin so informed the affiants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">\u201c6. That Mrs. Dolphin saw Pelletier also borrow a pair of wire cutters through his son from his neighbor to use in the job. At this time, Pelletier, stated in Mrs. Dolphin\u2019s presence that the cutters were needed to cut the fence for the job as they could not be seen climbing over the fence. Before Thursday, April 12,1979, said Pelletier took said cutters out of the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>at night and left with a loud sounding track owned by Donald (last name unknown) and then returned to the house with the clippers where Mrs. Dolphin saw them on Saturday, April 14, 1979.

Mrs. Dolphin purchased two clips for the weapon and ammunition for the same on April 7,1979 in Meriden. She purchased one box of ammunition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">\u201c11. That in the course of said robbery according to James E.

According to Mrs. Dolphin, as told to the affiants, Pellitier was actively engaged with Donald, last name unknown, a white male about 25 years old in planning the job and using Donald\u2019s truck to case the job. Donald, who had no record, according to Pelliteier to Mrs. Dolphin, had done many other crimes with Pellitier. Both would call each other over Pellitier\u2019s telephone, whose number, often called by Mrs. Dolphin, is Waterbury, 756-7335. Donald, Mrs. Dolphin related would often meet Pellitier in Cheshire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201c15.

The toll records of Pelletier\u2019s telephone number 756-7335 were examined under search warrant in the possession of S.N.E.T.

Healey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmQx\">dissenting. I agree with the majority except for their resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim concerning the prosecutor\u2019s summation. At the outset, it must be made clear that I consider the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>cutor\u2019s remarks to be improper and unbecoming a representative of the state who, by virtue of his office, has the privilege of addressing the jury. \u201cCases brought on behalf of the [state of Connecticut] should be conducted with a dignity worthy of the client.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sober, </em>281 F.2d 244, 251 (3d Cir.) (Biggs, C.J., and Hastie, J., concurring), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 879, 81 S. Ct. 167, 5 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1960); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Benter, </em>457 F.2d 1174, 1177 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 842, 93 S. Ct. 41, 34 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1972). Further, I believe that the trial court, in view of the plaintiff\u2019s objections, should have ruled the prosecutor\u2019s remarks improper and should have given an immediate curative instruction. The analysis of whether a defendant in such circumstances is denied a fair trial, however, does not stop with these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim is unquestionably aimed at a denial of his right to due process and a fair trial. Just last year in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916,104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983), we declared that \u201c[t]he general rule in Connecticut is that a mistrial is granted only where it is apparent to the court that as a result of some occurrence during trial a party has been deprived of the opportunity for a fair trial. . . . When a mistrial is sought on the ground that a prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law the same standard applies. . . . The burden on the defendant is to show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial in light of the entire proceeding. . . . The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. ...\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The dispositive issue in <em>Ubaldi </em>was \u201cwhether we should grant a new trial in order to deter prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>misconduct <em>which deliberately circumvents trial court rulings. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 569. Significantly, although we concluded that the prosecutorial misconduct in <em>Ubaldi </em>required a new trial in the absence of the showing of prejudice to the defendant, we reached that conclusion through the invocation of our supervisory powers. It is only in the context of circumstances such as those presented in <em>Ubaldi </em>which demand the exercise of our supervisory power that prosecutorial misconduct may require a new trial without a showing of prejudice to the defendant. Indeed, we expressly stated in <em>Ubaldi </em>that \u201c[w]e are not . . . abandoning the due process analysis we have consistently applied to constitutional claims of prosecutorial misconduct <em>not involving purposeful disregard of a ruling, which requires the defendant to prove that he was deprived of a fair trial as the result of the misconduct in order to secure a new trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">It cannot fairly be said that there was any purposeful disregard of a trial court ruling in this case such as there was in <em>Ubaldi </em>where we recognized that \u201cupsetting a criminal conviction is a drastic step, but it is the only feasible deterrent to flagrant prosecutorial misconduct <em>in defiance of a trial court ruling. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 571. Although the prosecutor in this case \u201cpersisted\u201d in his remarks despite repeated objections by defense counsel, these objections were overruled and, therefore, his persistence was hardly in defiance of a trial court ruling. The issue of the prosecutor\u2019s summation should, therefore, be decided under the due process analysis which we have \u201cconsistently applied.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra. In my view, the majority has unnecessarily departed from our well established and consistently applied due process analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The majority in this case has determined that certain improper remarks of the prosecutor were so egre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>gious that no curative instruction could remove their prejudicial impact and, therefore, the defendant was denied a fair trial. This is so, according to the majority, because the prosecutor persisted in his improper remarks and the defense counsel\u2019s objections were overruled, thus leaving the jury with the impression that the remarks were proper despite the trial court\u2019s subsequent forceful curative instruction. In doing so, the majority has taken a quantum leap from the impropriety of the remarks to the conclusion that the defendant is entitled to a new trial without any meaningful analysis as to how the defendant was prejudiced to such a degree that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial. \u201cThe law is not indifferent to considerations of degree.\u201d <em>Schechter Poultry Corporation </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 495, 554, 55 S. Ct. 837, 79 L. Ed. 1570 (1935) (Cardozo, J., concurring.) A conclusion that a prosecutor\u2019s remarks are egregiously improper does not, a fortiori, mean that a defendant is ipso facto entitled to a new trial where the trial court did not consider the remarks to be improper or calling for immediate action by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In taking their giant step from the impropriety of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and the concomitant overruling of the defendant\u2019s objections to the conclusion that the defendant was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial, the majority, without any meaningful analysis of how the defendant has established that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks denied him a fair trial, invokes Judge Learned Hand\u2019s chilling regard of a jury\u2019s ability to perform the \u201cmental gymnastic\u201d of actually disregarding certain matters when instructed to do so by the court. <em>See Nash </em>v. <em>United States, </em>54 F.2d 1006, 1007 (2d Cir. 1932). The majority states that \u201c[t]o suggest that an instruction would neutralize the prejudicial impact [of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks] is to defy reality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>In the context of this case, I cannot subscribe to the majority\u2019s \u201cdefy reality\u201d rationale and I dissociate myself from their cynical view of the ability of the jury in this case to winnow the wheat that constitutes the evidence from the chaff that comes from the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks. Indeed, even Judge Hand, in the very case in which he indulged in his \u201cmental gymnastic\u201d characterization of the inability of jurors to follow certain instructions, conceded that a direction to the jury to disregard certain matters \u201cprobably furthers, rather than impedes, the search for truth . . . .\u201d <em>Nash </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; see <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968). Moreover, this court has taken the position that \u201c[i]t is essential to any orderly trial that the jury be presumed, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary, to have followed the instructions of the court as to the law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bausman, </em>162 Conn. 308, 314, 294 A.2d 312 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 157, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>167 Conn. 260, 268, 355 A.2d 11 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>156 Conn. 378, 383, 242 A.2d 763 (1968). The majority does not point to anything in the record to show that this well settled principle should not apply in this case where a forceful curative instruction was given to the jury before it began its deliberations. It must be remembered that \u201c[u]nless we proceed on the basis that the jury will follow the court\u2019s instructions where those instructions are clear and the circumstances are such that the jury can reasonably be expected to follow them, the jury system makes little sense.\u201d <em>Delli Paoli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>352 U.S. 232, 242, 77 S. Ct. 294,1 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1957); <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra. That makes good sense to me here particularly where the record shows nothing to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">I cannot conclude on this record that the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks were so prejudicial that they \u201cgrani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tized\u201d the jury into a fixed position against the defendant leaving it unable to render a true verdict on the law and the evidence in keeping with the juror\u2019s oath. Reasonably viewed, even the human and practical limitations of the jury system does not justify the majority\u2019s cautious silence that this jury just could not and did not follow the trial court\u2019s instructions and decide this case solely on the law and the evidence. In <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 657, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961), the United States Supreme Court said that \u201c[t]here is no war between the Constitution and common sense.\u201d I have grave concerns when I place that statement alongside the majority\u2019s view that this judgment must be set aside and a new trial ordered. It must not be overlooked that this case was not a \u201cthin case\u201d such as that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>192 Conn. 618, 473 A.2d 1200 (1984). This case was one where the jury was presented with overwhelming evidence of guilt. While this does not and should not, in and of itself, operate to erase the impropriety of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, it does \u201cdefy reality\u201d for the majority aggressively to dilute the significance of that factor in assessing whether those remarks were so prejudicial that the defendant was denied a fair trial in the light of the entire proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The question then comes down to this: In this case of overwhelming evidence of guilt did the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks cause substantial prejudice to the defendant so as to deprive him of his constitutional right to a fair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982); see <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>186 Conn. 476, 488-89, 442 A.2d 1320 (1982). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The aim of due process \u201cis not punishment of society for the misdeeds of the prosecutor but avoidance of an unfair trial to the accused.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>supra, 219, quoting <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra. \u201cAs applied to a criminal trial, denial of due process is the failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice. In order to declare a denial of it we must find that the absence of that fairness fatally infected the trial; the acts complained of must be of such quality as necessarily prevent a fair trial.\u201d <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>People of the State of California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S. Ct. 280, 86 L. Ed. 166 (1941), reh. denied, 315 U.S. 826, 62 S. Ct. 620, 85 L. Ed. 1222 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s remarks, as already pointed out, were not in defiance of the trial court\u2019s rulings. The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning the prosecutor\u2019s argument, although not given immediately, were forceful and clear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record provides no basis and the majority offers no reasoning which could demonstrate that the jury could not and did not follow these instructions. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks at issue are the only prosecutorial misconduct complained of during this long trial. Significantly, the state\u2019s case against the defendant was so overwhelming that the jury in all probability would have returned a verdict of guilty on the law and the evidence even if the prosecutor had not made his improper remarks. It seems to me that it is proper to ask what effect the improper remarks had or may reasonably be taken to have had upon the jury and its decision; that is the effect on the minds of twelve other people, not ours, viewed in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572A\">*572A</page-number>of the entire trial and not in isolation. Even weighing how others might react, we still cannot weigh our appellate reaction without at least conceding, absent some definite contrary indication, that this jury was capable of acting reasonably. I believe they were so capable. I must therefore conclude that this record does not demonstrate that prejudice which would enable me to conclude that this defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial under either the United States or Connecticut<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572B\">*572B</page-number>constitutions. I would find no error on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\"> At the conclusion of the charge, before the exceptions were taken, the trial court told the jury, inter alia: \u201cLet me explain about exceptions. Counsel, all of them, have been most cooperative, and we have been over the charge together at length ahead of time so that many of what might have now been taken as objections or exceptions to my charge have been ironed out. And, I have accepted his, or his, or his recommendation. ... So, we sat down together and went over all of this.\u201d Thereafter, the jury was excused and the exceptions taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><em>I am now </em>constrained, on December 18, 1984, to write the following addendum to my dissenting opinion, originally released on October 2,1984, because I note that the amendment now made to the majority opinion, at page 565, inserts the language: \u201cBecause the prosecutor\u2019s remarks denied the defendant a fair trial in violation of both the federal and state constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Without analyzing whether the apparent ambiguity of the exact basis of the majority\u2019s disposition of this issue is augmented by this amendment, I readily admit that I, like the majority, overlooked one significant matter in originally writing my dissent. I refer to the ground of the defendant\u2019s claim as stated in his brief on the issue of the prosecutor\u2019s summation. His appellate brief, at pages ii and 32, frames this claim as follows: \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s improper and inflammatory summation deprived the appellant of his fourteenth amendment right to due process of law.\u201d There is nothing ambiguous about this claim as stated; it is specifically made, not under the Connecticut constitution, but rather under the United States constitution. Moreover, the defendant's brief on this issue does not disclose a single reference to our state constitution. The state\u2019s appellate brief on the summation issue, which argues that the prosecutor\u2019s summation was proper, responds to the defendant\u2019s due process claim that was asserted under the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">We have often said that a claim of error not briefed is considered to have been abandoned. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>183 Conn. 225, 228 n.3, 439 A.2d 305 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 265, 368 A.2d 222 (1976). We have pointed out that where a violation of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution was not claimed in the appellant\u2019s preliminary statement of issues, in addition to not being briefed, that claim was not part of the appeal. <em>Bencivenga </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>183 Conn. 168, 176 n.10, 438 A.2d 1174 (1981). This court has also determined that \u201c[a]ssignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court . . . [and] [t]his also applies to constitutional claims.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Mallory Battery Co., </em>188 Conn. 145, 149, 448 A.2d 829 (1982). Several months ago we invoked this well established practice in refus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572B\">*572B</page-number>ing to review an appellant\u2019s due process claim made under the Connecticut constitution. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 66, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). None of these circumstances even approaches this suggested \u201cclaim\u201d under the Connecticut constitution in this case for the simple reason no such \u201cclaim\u201d has been made, briefed, or argued before us. It is only now, some time after the decision in this case was released on October 2, 1984, that the majority is \u201camending\u201d its opinion apparently to place its resolution of the summation issue on both federal and state constitutional grounds. As already pointed out, the state constitutional ground has never even been presented to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">There can be no question about a state court\u2019s independent responsibility for its state constitutional law. Recently the United States Supreme Court reiterated: \u201cIt is fundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by us in interpreting their state constitutions.\u201d <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1041, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983), quoting <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>National Tea Co., </em>309 U.S. 551, 557, 60 S. Ct. 676, 84 L. Ed. 920 (1940). The statement that independent interpretation of state constitutional provisions is now well established does not require citation of authority. On the other hand, the determination by the majority that our state constitution has been violated without any such claim having been made not only subserves our well established appellate practice, but also in this case impermissibly exceeds any recognized right of independent interpretation of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In view of the fact that the majority has now amended its opinion, I maintain the position that this defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was not violated under either the federal or the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
