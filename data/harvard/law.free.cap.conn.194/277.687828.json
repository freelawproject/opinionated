Her appeal was dismissed. She then petitioned the Appellate Court for certification for review. The Appellate Court denied her petition, and she now petitions this court for certification, alleging that she is aggrieved by the decision of the Superior Court and by the decision of the Appellate Court denying her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Appeals from zoning commissions and planning commissions may be taken to the Superior Court, and, upon certification only, to the Appellate Court. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 8-28, as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 59. The Supreme Court\u2019s authority to grant petitions for certification from the Appellate Court is found in General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f, as amended by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 7. That statute provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[u]pon <em>final determination of any appeal </em>by the appellate court, there shall be no right to further review except . . . [t]he supreme court shall have the power to certify cases for its review upon petition by an aggrieved party . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also Practice Book \u00a7 3135.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue before us here is whether \u00a7 51-197f permits us to consider a petition for certification following the denial of certification by the Appellate Court in a zoning or planning matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Because, under \u00a7 8-28, as amended, the plaintiff could not appeal to the Appellate Court in the absence of that Court\u2019s certification; see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 2000, 3154 (matter deemed \u201cpending on appeal\u201d and entered upon the docket after granting of certification); we hold that the decision of the Appellate Court denying the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification was not a \u201cfinal determination of [an] appeal by the appellate court\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 51-197f. We have no jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff\u2019s petition, and it is therefore dismissed sua sponte.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 3135. right of APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU7\">\u201cAppeals may be taken to the supreme court in causes determined in the appellate court where the supreme court, upon petition of an aggrieved party or request of the appellate panel which heard the case, certifies the case for review.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
