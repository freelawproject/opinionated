Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANn\">This case is an appeal by the plaintiff from the financial portions of a judgment rendered by the trial court dissolving his marriage to the defendant, Sandra M. Holley. Although the defendant initially opposed the dissolution, the trial court found that the marriage had broken down irretrievably; that ruling has not been contested by the parties. This appeal thus concerns only the trial court\u2019s award of alimony and counsel fees to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision discloses the following: The parties were married on August 14, 1966, and had one minor child who was born in 1974.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of trial, the plaintiff husband was a forty-six-year-old physician, having practiced as an obstetrician and gynecologist in the New Haven area since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>1965. Through his professional corporation, the plaintiffs annual income was approximately $100,000, a figure which included both his salary and contributions to various pension and profit-sharing plans. The defendant wife, who holds a Ph.D. in speech pathology, was earning approximately $23,000 per year as an associate professor of communication disorders at Southern Connecticut State College.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The financial affidavits of the parties disclose the following: The parties jointly owned a family home in New Haven valued at approximately $90,000. In addition to his one-half interest in the equity of their residence, valued at approximately $22,000, and his income, the plaintiff had accumulated substantial assets totaling approximately $280,000. The defendant\u2019s sole asset was her one-half interest, valued at approximately $22,000, in the equity of their residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The trial court concluded that the marriage had broken down irretrievably and awarded joint legal custody of the minor child with sole physical custody in the defendant. Reasonable visitation rights were granted to the plaintiff. The court further awarded the defendant the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the family residence; $15,000 in lump sum alimony and $10,000 to purchase an automobile; $35,000 annually in unallocated alimony and child support until the minor child reached the age of eighteen years, which would be reduced to $20,000 per year thereafter; and counsel fees of $7500.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Following the entry of judgment, the plaintiff filed a motion to reargue and set aside the judgment. The only portion of that motion relevant to this appeal is the plaintiffs claim that the court\u2019s award represented \u201can unreasonably disproportionate division of assets.\u201d At the hearing on this motion, the trial court heard the claims of the parties, including the effect of the existence of a custodial fund established for the minor child\u2019s education. Although the parties had failed through inadvertence to disclose the fund\u2019s existence during the earlier dissolution proceedings, this post-judgment motion was denied by the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in awarding the defendant: lump sum and periodic alimony, which allegedly represented an unreasonably high proportion of the plaintiff\u2019s income and assets; permanent and continuing alimony in the annual amount of $20,000 after the minor child reaches the age of eighteen; and counsel fees, in view of the award of lump sum and periodic alimony. The plaintiff further claims that the trial court erred in refusing to alter the award of alimony and support after the existence of the custodial fund, established for the minor child\u2019s future educational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>needs, was disclosed to the court in the postjudgment hearing on the plaintiffs motion to reargue. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u201cAs has been repeatedly stated by this court, judicial review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of its broad discretion in domestic relations cases is limited to the questions of whether the [trial] court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have concluded as it did.\u201d <em>Beede </em>v. <em>Beede, </em>186 Conn. 191, 194, 440 A.2d 283 (1982); see also <em>Volante </em>v. <em>Volante, </em>180 Conn. 528, 530, 429 A.2d 964 (1980); <em>Posada </em>v. <em>Posada, </em>179 Conn. 568, 572, 427 A.2d 406 (1980); <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>172 Conn. 316, 321-22, 374 A.2d 233 (1977). \u201c \u2018With respect to the financial awards in a dissolution action, great weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of its opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 50, 440 A.2d 782 (1981); <em>Fattibene </em>v. <em>Fattibene, </em>183 Conn. 433, 442, 441 A.2d 3 (1981); <em>deCossy </em>v. <em>deCossy, </em>172 Conn. 202, 204, 374 A.2d 182 (1977).\u2019 <em>Venuti </em>v. <em>Venuti, </em>185 Conn. 156, 161, 440 A.2d 878 (1981). Moreover, \u2018the power to act equitably is the keystone to the court\u2019s ability to fashion relief in the infinite variety of circumstances which arise out of the dissolution of a marriage.\u2019 <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Pasquariello, </em>168 Conn. 579, 585, 362 A.2d 835 (1975); see <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>187 Conn. 70, 72, 444 A.2d 234 (1982).\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>191 Conn. 46, 57, 463 A.2d 578 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">We begin by addressing the plaintiffs claims challenging the trial court\u2019s alimony award. The plaintiff claims that \u201c[t]he combination of the $35,000.00 unallocated alimony and support, the future $20,000.00 alimony order and the amount of lump sum alimony awarded, in view of the award of the husband\u2019s interest in the family home to the wife, was an abuse of discretion and unwarranted by the evidence.\u201d The plaintiff contends that the trial court miscalculated the amount of funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>available to the plaintiff as present income and erroneously considered certain investment funds both as present available income and as assets \u201cinvested for the purpose of obtaining future income.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He claims that the trial court\u2019s award of permanent and continuing alimony in the amount of $20,000 per year (to be payable on a monthly basis) after the parties\u2019 minor child attains the age of eighteen would, in effect, deprive him of any retirement income. The plaintiff also claims that physicians who rely on manual skills typically lose some of those essential professional skills with increasing age, thereby rendering them unable to practice and causing them to suffer an attendant loss of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The defendant maintains, however, that through his professional medical corporation, the plaintiff had the ability to establish the salary drawn and any contributions made on his behalf to the pension and profit-sharing plans. She claims that the plaintiff thus possessed a substantial degree of control over the annual income immediately available to him. The favorable tax consequences flowing from the deferred compensation arrangements and the periodic, unallocated alimony, the defendant argues, would allow the plaintiff to maintain, without reduction, his current level of personal contributions to the pension and profit-sharing plans while still enjoying a net annual pretax income of $47,200. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering the alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Initially, we note that the plaintiff offered no documentation at trial, or at the postjudgment hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>his motion, to substantiate his claim concerning the economic and professional impact of aging upon physicians in his specialty. Nor did the plaintiff offer any special circumstance wherein he as an individual would be unable to retain a significant earning capacity in future years. See <em>Volante </em>v. <em>Volante, </em>supra, 531. The trial court, therefore, simply did not have before it sufficient evidence to accept these claims of the plaintiff. Moreover, it must be recognized that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 provides for modification of a court\u2019s permanent alimony award in the absence of a dissolution decree precluding any modification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the order in the present case does not preclude any future modification, the plaintiff, upon \u201ca substantial change\u201d in either party\u2019s circumstances, may then move the trial court for such modification. See, e.g., <em>Lupien </em>v. <em>Lupien, </em>192 Conn. 443, 444, 472 A.2d 18 (1984); <em>Bilosz </em>v. <em>Bilosz, </em>184 Conn. 90, 93, 441 A.2d 59 (1981); <em>Milot </em>v. <em>Milot, </em>174 Conn. 3, 5, 381 A.2d 528 (1977). The memorandum of decision indicates that the trial court properly considered and weighed the factors set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 in determining the duration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>amount of the alimony award.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Weiman </em>v. <em>Weiman, </em>188 Conn. 232, 234, 449 A.2d 151 (1982); <em>Posada </em>v. <em>Posada, </em>supra, 572-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We next turn to the plaintiff\u2019s claim concerning the custodial fund set aside to ensure the availability of adequate financial resources for the future educational needs of the parties\u2019 child. Apparently, both parties unintentionally failed to disclose at trial the existence of the custodial fund valued at approximately $42,000. The fund, therefore, was not considered by the trial court in its initial dissolution judgment and award. At the postjudgment hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion to reargue and set aside the original judgment, the parties were accorded full opportunity to present their positions on the significance of the custodial fund to the previously entered decree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The plaintiff contends that if the trial referee had been made aware of the fund\u2019s existence during the trial, the award to the defendant would have been adjusted accordingly. He claims that the defendant will not be compelled to put any of the monies contributed by him aside in order to provide for the minor child. The plaintiff attempts to buttress his argument here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>through reference to certain remarks of the trial referee made during the postjudgment motion hearing concerning the possible impact that this custodial fund might have had upon his previous awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In its postjudgment memorandum denying the plaintiffs motion to reargue and to set aside the judgment, the trial court stated \u201cthat the facts presented do not diminish the need of the defendant for support of herself and child in the amounts originally ordered.\u201d It is clear that the court\u2019s reference to \u201cfacts presented\u201d relates to the facts and arguments presented in the postjudgment hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion. Moreover, the conclusion that such facts \u201cdo not diminish\u201d the defendant\u2019s needs substantiates the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial referee did consider the plaintiff\u2019s claims regarding the materiality of the custodial fund to the judgment. We conclude that this was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Finally, the plaintiff challenges the award in the original dissolution judgment of $7500 counsel fees to the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Counsel fees were unwarranted, he argues, when considered in light of the totality of the award of lump sum and periodic alimony. The essence of his argument is that the plaintiff should not be required to pay the defendant\u2019s counsel fees as she had more than \u201cample means\u201d to pay for her own attorney. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The trial court based its decision regarding counsel fees upon the same testimony and financial affidavits that supported the other financial aspects of the decree. \u201c \u2018Whether to allow counsel fees, and if so in what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>amount, calls for the exercise of judicial discretion.\u2019 <em>El Idrissi </em>v. <em>El Idrissi, </em>173 Conn. 295, 301-302, 377 A.2d 330 (1977) (counsel fees on appeal); <em>Krasnow </em>v. <em>Krasnow, </em>140 Conn. 254, 262, 99 A.2d 104 (1953) (counsel fees on appeal). \u2018 \u201cCourts ordinarily award counsel fees in divorce cases so that a party (usually the wife) may not be deprived of her rights because of lack of funds.\u201d \u2019 <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>190 Conn. 26, 30, 459 A.2d 498 (1983), quoting <em>Koizim </em>v. <em>Koizim, </em>181 Conn. 492, 500-501, 435 A.2d 1030 (1980). In making its determination regarding attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, we deem it appropriate for the court in the exercise of its broad judicial discretion to consider the statutory criteria set out in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82 and the respective financial abilities of the parties. <em>Koizim </em>v. <em>Koizim, </em>supra, 501; see <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>180 Conn. 376, 380, 429 A.2d 897 (1980). Recently, <em>in Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>supra, we pointed out that, in the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion concerning an award of counsel fees, \u2018the availability of \u201csufficient cash\u201d to pay one\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees is not an absolute litmus test for making an award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82. . . . This is because a trial court\u2019s discretion should be guided so that its decision regarding attorney\u2019s fees does not undermine its puipose in making any other financial award.\u2019 <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>supra, 33-34; see <em>Devino </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>190 Conn. 36, 38-39, 458 A.2d 692 (1983).\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>191 Conn. 46, 58-59, 463 A.2d 578 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We agree with the defendant that the counsel fee award in this case is remedial in nature and is intended to restore her as nearly as possible to the position she was in prior to the dissolution of the marriage. Moreover, the trial court could have reasonably found that if an award of counsel fees were denied, the defendant would have been required to forego a portion of the alimony award in order to satisfy her obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>to her attorney, thereby undermining its other orders. See, e.g., <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-15\"> Although the trial court\u2019s memorandum and the judgment state that the parties\u2019 minor child was born August 11,1977, the parties testified that he was seven years old at the time of trial and was born September 19, 1974. We also note that the original complaint alleges that the child was born on September 19, 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\"> The following are the financial and property aspects of the trial court's judgment in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff shall convey to the defendant all his right, title and interest to the real estate at 215 Stimson Road, New Haven.
