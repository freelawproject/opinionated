Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIx\">This action to determine paternity was brought by verified petition dated February 26,1982, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-160.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff, June M. Hayes, alleged that she had been a single woman for more than one year prior to the action; that on January 28, 1982, she had given birth to a child, Perry Allyn Hayes, who was conceived on or about April 17,1981, fathered by Gary Ernest Smith, who has since died; and that on December 15, 1981, Lillian M. Smith qualified as administratrix of his estate in the Probate Court for the district of New London.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The administratrix filed a motion to dismiss the action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 142 and 143 (1), main-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>taming that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction because the paternity action was brought against the defendant as the administratrix of the alleged father\u2019s estate and, since a paternity action does not survive the death of the alleged father, it cannot he against the personal representative of his estate. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff sought to amend her prayers for relief to seek only an establishment of paternity and the issuance of \u201csuch orders as will charge the Estate with the legal rights of [the] child . . . .\u201d The court granted the motion to dismiss and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In its decision on the motion to dismiss, the trial court described the issues to be whether Connecticut statutes require a determination of paternity during the lifetime of the putative father, and if such a determination is required, whether that requirement passes constitutional muster. In concluding affirmatively in each instance, it found the language of \u00a7 46b-160 plain and unambiguous in providing that a summons be issued to the \u201cputative father\u201d to appear in court to show cause why the prayer of the plaintiff\u2019s petition should not be granted. The court decided that because this statute was in derogation of the common law, it was therefore required to be strictly construed. It also noted that \u00a7 46b-160 contained no express provision for survival of the action after the death of the putative father. The trial court pointed out that courts in other jurisdictions have held that where the putative father dies before a paternity action is brought, the action does not survive even where there is a general statute providing for the survival of actions. In that regard, it observed that our general survival of actions statute; General Statutes \u00a7 52-599;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contained no clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>that could arguably \u201csave\u201d this action. The trial court stated that some other courts have held that a general statute for survival of actions does not affect a statutory right of action because the saving clause that permits survival must be contained in the statute itself. Eschewing what it regarded as the plaintiffs invitation to legislate judicially, it found that under Connecticut law, \u201can action to determine paternity does not survive the death of the putative father and that such an action may not be maintained against his estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The plaintiff claimed below that it was necessary to construe \u00a7 46b-160 to allow commencement of the paternity suit against the putative father\u2019s estate in order for her to establish paternity under \u00a7 45-274 (b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that to construe the statute otherwise denied her child equal protection of the laws. In rejecting this claim, the trial court referred to the recent United States Supreme Court cases of <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>439 U.S. 259, 99 S. Ct. 518, 58 L. Ed. 2d 503 (1978), and <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762, 97 S. Ct. 1459, 52 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1977), and concluded that the Connecticut statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tory requirement that paternity actions be commenced before the death of the putative father passed constitutional muster because the statutory classification was substantially related to legitimate state interests. The court determined that such state purposes included \u201cits interest in the reliability of the fact-finding process, in preventing spurious claims and in preventing the decedents\u2019 estates from being placed at an unreasonable disadvantage in defending paternity claims.\u201d We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the \u201conly method\u201d of establishing paternity by a court of competent jurisdiction is that \u201cmandated\u201d by \u00a7 46b-160.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff seems to argue that while the first part of \u00a7 46b-160, which requires that a paternity action must be insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tuted by verified petition, is substantive, the balance of that statute is procedural and will not bar the action in this case. She maintains that by virtue of the 1978 amendment to \u00a7 45-274<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cthe means of establishing paternity have been enlarged to include proceedings in the Estate of the deceased [alleged] father that are now IN REM . . .\u201d and not in personam proceedings. She asserts that her paternity claim in this case \u201cimpinge[d] upon [a] \u2018court of competent jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 45-274 (b). Additionally, she claims that the issue of paternity survives the putative father\u2019s death and does not come within the exception in the survival statute, i.e., \u00a7 52-599. To hold that the death of the putative father bars the paternity action would, she asserts, deprive the child of the right of establishing paternity through this mother, thus contravening the child\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws and due process of law under both the United States and Connecticut constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In turning to the plaintiff\u2019s claims on statutory construction, we recognize certain settled tenets of statutory construction. \u201cA cardinal rule of statutory construction is to construe statutes in a manner which gives effect to the apparent intention of the legislature. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980) (citations omitted). \u2018It has often been said that the legislative intent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>170 Conn. 567, 581, 368 A.2d 103 (1976); <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975); <em>Sillman </em>v. <em>Sillman, </em>168 Conn. 144, 148, 358 A.2d 150 (1975).\u2019 <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980). Where the language used is clear and unambiguous, we will not speculate as to some supposed intention. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>supra. . . . Further, in construing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 20, 404 A.2d 873 (1978); <em>Catino </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>174 Conn. 414, 418, 389 A.2d 754 (1978).\u201d <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., Inc., </em>193 Conn. 208, 231-32, 477 A.2d 988 (1984). \u201c[I]n the absence of ambiguity, courts cannot read into statutes, by construction, provisions which are not clearly stated; <em>Point O\u2019Woods Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>178 Conn. 364, 366, 423 A.2d 90 (1979); but must ascribe plain and ordinary meaning to the language used. <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118, 441 A.2d 65 (1981); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 509, 400 A.2d 721 (1978). A legislative act must be read as a whole and \u2018construed to give effect and to harmonize all of its parts.\u2019 <em>Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>176 Conn. 43, 50, 404 A.2d 898 (1978).\u201d <em>Finkenstein </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>192 Conn. 104, 110, 470 A.2d 1196 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">An examination of \u00a7 46b-160 demonstrates that the paternity action must be instituted by service of a verified petition, summons and order upon the putative father himself. This statute provides in part: \u201cProceedings to establish paternity of a child born or conceived out of lawful wedlock, including one born to, or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ceived by, a married woman but begotten by a man other than her husband, <em>shall </em>be instituted by a verified petition of the mother or expectant mother, with summons and order, filed in the superior court for the geographical area in which either she or the putative father resides. . . . Upon the filing of such petition, said court or any judge assigned to said court <em>shall </em>cause a summons, signed by him or by the clerk or assistant clerk of said court, to be issued, requiring the putative father to appear in court at a time and place named therein to show cause, if any he has, why the prayer of such petition should not be granted.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201cshall\u201d refers not only to the method of instituting the action, but also to the summons to be served on the putative father concerning his required court appearance to answer the petition. That the ordinary mandatory meaning to be given to the term \u201cshall\u201d was intended is amply supported by the fact that the term \u201cmay,\u201d which is ordinarily directory, is also used several times in the same statute. The use of such terms, which \u201cevidences [an] affirmative selectivity of terms with [the] specific intent to be distinctive in meaning . . . must then be assumed to have been used with discrimination and a full awareness of the difference in their ordinary meanings.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 509, 400 A.2d 721 (1978), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 46b-160 provides that the verified petition which may be brought by either \u201cthe mother or expectant mother\u201d shall be filed in the Superior Court for the geographical area in which either \u201cshe or the putative father <em>resides.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The mandate that the putative father shall be summoned <em>\u201cto appear\u201d </em>to answer the petition further indicates the legislative intent that he be alive. There is nothing in this statute or, for that matter, in the statutory scheme in which it appears, which is expressive of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>legislative intent. Indeed, \u00a7 46b-160 appears in chapter 815y of the General Statutes which is entitled \u201cPaternity Matters,\u201d and certain other statutes in that chapter demonstrate the requirement that the putative father be <em>in esse </em>when the paternity suit is instituted. Section 46b-161 concerns the procedure where the petition is brought prior to the birth of the child and refers to a hearing to determine probable cause. If probable cause is found, this statute provides that \u201cthe court shall order the <em>defendant </em>to become bound to the complainant, with surety. ...\u201d Section 46b-164 provides that \u201cthe trial of the question of fact as to the guilt or innocence of the <em>defendant </em>shall, at the desire of either party, be by a jury of six.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46b-166 provides that a putative father \u201cshall not be excused from testifying because <em>his </em>evidence may tend to disgrace or incriminate <em>him\u201d </em>and grants him immunity from prosecution for any criminal act \u201cabout which (1) <em>he </em>testifies in connection with such proceedings or (2) <em>he </em>makes any statement prior to such proceedings with respect to the issue of paternity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We also note that \u00a7 46b-162 permits the state or any town interested in the support of a child born out of wedlock to \u201cinstitute such [paternity] proceedings <em>against the person accused of begetting the child . . \u201d </em>if the mother neglects to do so. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Although the plaintiff can point to nothing in the statutory scheme of \u00a7 46b-160 that belies the plain legislative intent that \u00a7 46b-160 requires that a paternity action must be instituted during the lifetime of the putative father, she seems to argue, recognizing that the action must be instituted by verified petition, that the balance of the statute is procedural and not substantive. The plaintiff claims that while the \u201cprocedural method\u201d might be \u201cflawed\u201d by the death of the putative father, that will not destroy the action. To support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>this claim, she argues that the 1978 amendment to \u00a7 45-274<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cenlarged\u201d the means of establishing paternity to include in rem proceedings against the estate of the deceased \u201cfather\u201d and that the issue of paternity does not fall within the exception to the general survival statute in \u00a7 52-599. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We first point out that because \u00a7 46b-160 is in derogation of the common law, it is to be strictly construed. <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>169 Conn. 630, 633, 363 A.2d 1031 (1975).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Recognizing that \u00a7 46b-160 contains no saving clause, the plaintiff, nevertheless, claims that the action survives even though it was not instituted during the lifetime of the putative father. In doing so she depends upon \u00a7\u00a7 52-599 and 45-274 of the General Statutes. Neither of these statutes, alone or in combination, establishes her claim of survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u201cAt common law all causes of action by or against a person terminated and abated upon such person\u2019s death. Survival of causes of action arise only through the medium of so-called \u2018survival statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Peoples First National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>394 Pa. 116, 123, 145 A.2d 716 (1958); see <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Giacomo Costa Fu Andrea, </em>282 F. Sup. 525, 526 (E.D. Pa. 1968). Section 52-599, which is entitled \u201cSurvival of actions and causes of actions,\u201d provides, inter alia: \u201c(a) A cause or right of action shall not be lost or destroyed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>death of any person, but shall survive in favor of or against the executor or administrator of the deceased person. . . .(c) The provisions of this section shall not apply ... (2) to any civil action or proceeding whose prosecution or defense depends upon the continued existence of the persons who are plaintiffs or defendants. . . \u201c \u2018A cause of action is that single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff and which entitles the plaintiff to relief. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>139 Conn. 186, 197, 91 A.2d 778 [1952]; <em>Veits </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>134 Conn. 428, 434, 58 A.2d 389 [1948]. \u201cA right of action at law arises from the existence of a primary right in the plaintiff, and an invasion of that right by some delict on the part of the defendant. The facts which establish the existence of that right and that delict constitute the cause of action.\u201d <em>Pavelka </em>v. <em>St. Albert Society, </em>82 Conn. 146, 147, 72 A. 725 [1909]. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>180 Conn. 230, 239, 429 A.2d 486 (1980), quoting <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>148 Conn. 327, 330, 170 A.2d 724 (1961). \u201cThe phrase \u2018right of action\u2019 includes the right to commence and maintain an action.\u201d <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Ruickoldt, </em>91 Conn. 680, 683, 101 A. 82 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The plaintiff seeks only the determination of \u201cpaternity\u201d which is defined as \u201cthe quality or state of being a father.\u201d Webster, Third New International Dictionary. \u201cA paternity proceeding is a proceeding instituted to determine a relationship or status between individuals and, as such, it is purely personal to the parties.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Mary Ellen C. </em>v. <em>Joseph William C., </em>79 App. Div. 2d 1024, 1025, 435 N.Y.S.2d 738 (1981). Section 52-599 is also in derogation of the common law. The paternity proceeding authorized by \u00a7 46b-160, which was not instituted prior to the death of the putative father, does not survive, as claimed, under \u00a7 52-599.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>In a number of other jurisdictions where a general statute for survival of actions was relied on as barring abatement of an action under a bastardy statute by reason of the death of a putative father, it has been held that such a statute did not have that effect but, rather, that for such an action to survive his death, it was necessary that there be legislation so providing. See, e.g., <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>267 So. 2d 370, 372 (Fla. App. 1972). Courts are in substantial agreement that, absent a statute expressly providing for the survival of a cause of action or of an action to establish paternity and support of an illegitimate child, no right of action survives the death of the putative father. See <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>supra; <em>Toms </em>v. <em>Lohrentz, </em>37 Ill. App. 2d 414, 417-18, 185 N.E.2d 708 (1962); <em>K. K. </em>v. <em>Estate of M. F., </em>145 N. J. Super. 250, 253-56, 367 A.2d 466 (1976); <em>In the Matter of Mary Ellen C. </em>v. <em>Joseph William C., </em>supra; see generally, note, 58 A.L.R.3d 188; see <em>Gross </em>v. <em>VanLerberg, </em>231 Kan. 401, 403, 646 P.2d 471 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Further support for our determination that the paternity proceeding does not survive is found in our survival statute itself. The nature of this paternity action or proceeding is one in which, at the very least, the \u201cdefense depends upon the continued existence of the . . . defendants] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-599 (c) (2). We are aware that the plaintiff seeks only the determination of paternity, but another statute bearing on her claim of survival is \u00a7 46b-171 which provides that after a \u201cdefendant is found guilty,\u201d the court may impose certain financial orders, together with a surety bond to perform such orders, and his failure to comply with any of these may result in his incarceration until he complies. If, as claimed, a paternity proceeding could be instituted against the administratrix of the putative father\u2019s estate, \u201c[t]he incongruities that would beset such a proceeding are obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>enough. It would be a strange sight to see an [administratrix] arrested, required to give a bond, be put on trial, and perhaps imprisoned for an act of bastardy committed by the party officially represented by [her].\u201d <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Lombard, </em>85 Me. 224, 224-25, 27 A. 110 (1892). It is also apparent that because of the privacy surrounding the circumstances giving rise to the charge of paternity, the defendant\u2019s presence to defend properly is quite necessary. Because the question of paternity is one of fact and not of law; <em>Holub </em>v. <em>King, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 118, 120, 163 A.2d 800 (1960); the decedent\u2019s continued availability would be a substantial factor in contributing to the reliability of the factfinding process on this question. <em>See Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The final branch of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of survival concerns \u00a7 45-274 (b) (2) which, she maintains, \u201cenlarged\u201d the means of establishing paternity to include in rem proceedings against the decedent\u2019s estate. This claim is without merit. She is the party who has invoked \u00a7 46b-160 as the predicate for this paternity proceeding to determine the relationship between individuals which is \u201cpurely personal to the parties.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Mary Ellen C. </em>v. <em>Joseph William C., </em>supra. \u201cA proceeding in rem is essentially a proceeding to determine the right in specific property, against all the world, equally binding on everyone.\u201d 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Actions \u00a7 40. Conceptually, \u201cin rem\u201d jurisdiction is based upon a court\u2019s control over a \u201cres\u201d rather than a defendant as a person. Unlike a valid marriage which creates a legal status between the parties and has been said to be the marital res capable of furnishing the basis for jurisdiction of a court, the birth of a child out of wedlock does not, per se, create any legal status between the child and a putative father. Generally, the legitimatization of such a child vis-a-vis his \u201cfather\u201d is a matter of statute. The plaintiff, therefore, assumes a false premise when she argues that the jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the court of her \u201cin rem claim\u201d can be predicated upon the existence of a status or res which she expressly concedes is presently nonexistent because she is bringing this action solely to establish that very status or res, i.e., the paternity of the child. See <em>Mazzei </em>v. <em>Cantales, </em>142 Conn. 173, 178-79, 112 A.2d 205 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">While it is true that the 1978 amendment to \u00a7 45-274 \u201cenlarged\u201d the ability of an illegitimate child to inherit from his or her father,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the amendment speaks only to the right to inherit <em>after </em>adjudication or acknowledgement of paternity. It does not at all address the means of <em>establishing </em>paternity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reject the claimed linkage of both \u00a7\u00a7 52-599 and 45-274 (b) (2) to <em>$ </em>46b-160 that is argued as the jurisdictional basis for this paternity action. Although we are sensitive to what the plaintiff is endeavoring to accomplish, the result which she asks us to reach would require this court to legislate. This we cannot do. Other jurisdictions have also declined to do so. See, e.g., <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>supra, 372; <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Bartels, </em>143 Neb. 680, 686,10 N.W.2d 671 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">With this construction of the statutory scheme for the establishment of paternity in mind, we now turn to the plaintiffs constitutional claims. The plaintiff also appears to claim, in effect, that a construction of this statutory scheme to prevent her institution of a paternity action prevents her from establishing her child\u2019s ability to inherit under \u00a7 45-274 (b) (2) from the decedent\u2019s estate. She argues that the death of the putative father cannot be used to defeat the right of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>to establish paternity as granted by statute and that to do so now when our statutes give a child born out of wedlock \u201cequal rights with legitimate children to share in the estate of their deceased father\u201d deprives such children of equal protection of the laws and due process of law under the United States and Connecticut constitutions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not agree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">At the outset, we must note that absent from the plaintiff\u2019s brief is any reference to two significant United States Supreme Court decisions. They <em>are Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, and <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Trimble, </em>the court struck down on equal protection grounds an Illinois statute that limited an illegitimate child\u2019s right to inherit from her natural father in an intestacy to a situation where the natural parents had married <em>and </em>the father had acknowledged the child as his.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Lalli, </em>the court upheld against an equal protection challenge a New York statute that limited an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>illegitimate child\u2019s right to inherit from her natural father by intestacy to where \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>court of competent jurisdiction has, <em>during the lifetime </em>of the father, made an order of filiation declaring paternity in a proceeding instituted during the pregnancy of the mother or within two years from the birth of the child.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 261-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In <em>Lalli, </em>the court observed that it had reaffirmed what it said in <em>Trimble, </em>supra, 767, that while \u201cclassifications based on illegitimacy are not subject to \u2018strict scrutiny,\u2019 they nevertheless are invalid [on equal protection grounds] under the Fourteenth Amendment if they are not substantially related to permissible state interests.\u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 265. The New York statute in <em>Lalli, </em>like \u00a7 45-274 (b) (2), renders the marital status of the \u201cparents\u201d irrelevant. The <em>Lalli </em>court said that \u201c[t]he single requirement [under the New York statute] at issue here is an evidentiary one - that the paternity of the father be declared in a judicial proceeding sometime before his death.\u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The primary state objective of the challenged aspect<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the statute in <em>Lalli </em>was to provide for the just and orderly disposition of property at death which, the court acknowledged, was an area \u201cwith which the States have an interest of considerable magnitude.\u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Lalli, </em>supra, 268. That interest, it recognized, was \u201cdirectly implicated in paternal inheritance by illegitimate children because of the peculiar problems of proof that are involved\u201d whereas \u201c[establishing maternity is seldom difficult.\u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 268. Thus, problems arise, said the court, that \u201ccounsel against treating illegitimate children identically to all other heirs of an intestate father.\u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">After alluding to problems concerning the administration of estates in this context such as spurious claims that might be difficult to expose, harassing litigation, the need to facilitate administration of estates and the like, the <em>Lalli </em>court concluded that the state\u2019s interests were \u201csubstantial.\u201d In finding no equal protection violation, the court considered the means adopted by New York, embodied in its statute, to further its substantial interests. The court opined that the placing of paternity disputes in a judicial forum during the putative father\u2019s lifetime enhanced \u201caccuracy\u201d in resolving such disputes. Indeed, it referred with approval to the observations of the New York Court of Appeals that \u201cthe \u2018availability [of the putative father] should be a substantial factor contributing to the reliability of the fact-finding process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 271. It also said that requiring that the order of paternity be issued during the putative father\u2019s lifetime permits a man to defend his reputation against \u201cunjust accusations in paternity claims<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> . . .\u201d and, further, that the administration of estates would be facilitated and \u201c[fraudulent assertions of paternity will be much less likely to succeed, or even to arise, where the proof is put before a court of law at a time when the putative father is available to respond, rather than first brought to light when the distribution of the assets of an estate is in the offing.\u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 271-72. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>recognizing that some illegitimate children could establish the necessary relationship without seriously disrupting estate administration, the court brushed aside the view that the statute excluded significant categories of illegitimate children who could be allowed to inherit without jeopardizing the orderly settlement of their intestate fathers\u2019 estates. In doing so, the court admitted that few statutory classifications are \u201centirely free from the criticism that they sometimes produce inequitable results.\u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 273. Pointedly, it noted that the equal protection inquiry \u201cdoes not focus on the abstract \u2018fairness\u2019 of a state law, but on whether the statute\u2019s relation to the state interests it is intended to promote is so tenuous that it lacks the rationality contemplated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id. In upholding the New York statute, the <em>Lalli </em>court said of it that \u201c[inheritance is barred <em>only </em>where there has been a failure to secure evidence of paternity <em>during the father\u2019s lifetime in the manner prescribed by the State\u201d </em>and that the statute did not \u201cinevitably disqualify] an unnecessarily large number of children born out of wedlock.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. It concluded that the statutory requirement imposed on illegitimate children was \u201csubstantially related to the important state interests the statute is intended to promote.\u201d <em>Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>supra, 275-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Our in-depth discussion of <em>Lalli </em>brings into focus the striking similarities of the plaintiff\u2019s equal protection constitutional claims. Parsed to basics, \u00a7 46b-160 requires that the paternity proceeding be instituted during the lifetime of the putative father and \u00a7 45-274 (b) (2) permits inheritance where paternity has been adjudicated or acknowledged as that statute sets out. The substantial state interests effectuated by the Connecticut statutory framework, which we find are similar to those explicated in <em>Lalli, </em>cause us to reject the plaintiff\u2019s equal protection claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In this opinion Speziale, C.

Although this survival statute is in derogation of the common law, it is also remedial and should be interpreted broadly to achieve the purposes intended by the legislature.
