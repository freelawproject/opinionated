Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVRh\">The defendant, Darnell Tatem, was convicted after a trial to the jury of two counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tatem did not testify at the trial. On appeal, the defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[u]nless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. ...\u201d Because we find error in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, we need not discuss the facts except as they may relate to the jury instruction in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Initially, we note that the defendant did not file a request to charge on the statute nor did he take an exception to the court\u2019s instructions on the statute. We will, nevertheless, exercise our discretion to review the defendant\u2019s claim. Practice Book \u00a7 3063; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>182 Conn. 580, 581, 438 A.2d 778 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Boulware, </em>183 Conn. 444, 446, 441 A.2d 1 (1981). It must be pointed out that the legislature, in enacting the \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d statute embodied in \u00a7 54-84 (b), \u201c \u2018has chosen specific means to effectuate a fundamental right . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 581; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 Conn. 330, 331-32, 438 A.2d 93 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrione, </em>188 Conn. 681, 685 n.3, 453 A.2d 1137 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1084, 103 S. Ct. 1775, 76 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1983). In <em>Carrione </em>we said that, \u201c[i]n <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>182 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Conn. 330, 438 A.2d 93 (1980), this court held that it was plain error for a trial judge not to comply with the mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b) to \u2018instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrione, </em>supra, 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The trial court\u2019s instructions specifically challenged here by the defendant were the following: \u201cThe defendant did not testify in this matter. It is his Constitutional right not to testify. He has this right under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and it is also contained in the Constitution of the State of Connecticut. He has the absolute right to remain silent. As we said earlier, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is upon the State. Therefore, you may draw no <em>unreasonable </em>inference from the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The defendant claims that the use of the very language of \u00a7 54-84 (b) is mandatory, arguing that the legislature has chosen specific language to effectuate a fundamental right. Honing in on the trial court\u2019s use of the term \u201cno unreasonable inference\u201d as opposed to the statutory provision dictating \u201cno unfavorable inferences,\u201d he argues that harmful error resulted from the instruction as given because it was \u201creasonable that the jury could have been misled into believing that [it] could draw an unfavorable inference of guilt relative to his failure to testify if it was not unreasonable to do so taking into consideration the evidence against [him].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, he maintains that the jury \u201ccould have felt\u201d that the term \u201cunreasonable meant that they were not to draw an inference of guilt <em>solely </em>from [his] desire not to testify but that they could take the silence into consideration.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) There is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>he also urges, even after examining the jury charge as a whole, nothing that renders harmless the trial court\u2019s instructions on this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The state, on the other hand, claims that it is not \u201creasonably possible\u201d that the challenged instructions, when viewed in the light of the charge as a whole, misled the jury. In so arguing, it points out that, not only did the trial court instruct the jury, inter alia, that the defendant \u201chas the absolute right to remain silent,\u201d but also that this court\u2019s failure to apply \u201ca ritualistic standard to this instruction\u201d requires a conclusion of no error after an examination of the entire charge. The state also claims that, in instructing the jury that the state had the burden of proof, the trial court was in effect telling the jury, \u201cdo not consider the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, it has no part in this case.\u201d Moreover, it maintains that a reasonable juror hearing the challenged instruction within the context of the entire charge would naturally assume that the defendant\u2019s silence formed no part of the case. The state\u2019s claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In construing \u00a7 54-84 (b) in <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra, 333-34, we said that \u201c[t]he present statute <em>clearly requires </em>that the court instruct the jury that no unfavorable inferences may be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-10), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 583, 421 A.2d 872 (1980). We hold today that this charge must be given unless the defendant requests otherwise. In so holding, we do no more than reaffirm the clear intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b); 20 H. R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1977 Sess., pp. 4543-45; 20 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1977 Sess., pp. 2067-69.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We recognized in <em>Burke </em>that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 54-84 (b), had \u201cstatutorily established a new procedure concerning the rights of accused per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>sons who choose to exercise their fifth amendment right not to testify.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra, 331; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Turning to the trial court\u2019s instructions, we focus initially on the language: \u201cTherefore, you may draw no <em>unreasonable </em>inference from the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the word \u201cunreasonable\u201d instead of \u201cunfavorable\u201d as specified by the legislature in the statute is error. It requires no elaborate syllogistic analysis to demonstrate that an unfavorable inference may not necessarily be an unreasonable inference. The trier of fact is entitled to draw any reasonable and logical inference based upon the facts found proven; <em>State </em>v. <em>Englehart, </em>158 Conn. 117, 121, 256 A.2d 231 (1969); and any such inference cannot be based on possibilities, surmise or conjecture. <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Hennessey, </em>145 Conn. 211, 214-15, 140 A.2d 473 (1958). In short, \u201c[t]he only kind of an inference recognized by the law is a <em>reasonable </em>one.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>146 F. Sup. 871, 873 (N.D. Ind. 1956). \u201cThis process of inference is peculiarly a jury function, the raison d\u2019etre of the jury system.\u201d <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Albanese, </em>144 Conn. 241, 256, 129 A.2d 606, appeal dismissed, 355 U.S. 15, 78 S. Ct. 36, 2 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Long before the legislature enacted \u00a7 54-84 (b), we said, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>109 Conn. 490, 499, 146 A. 828 (1929), that \u201c[t]he fact that an accused has chosen not to take the stand is a fact in the case which the jury are entitled to treat as they treat any fact established by the evidence, giving it more or less weight as the circumstances may justify.\u201d This case demonstrates that it is not inherently unreasonable to draw an inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Constitutional law and our decisional law since the enactment of \u00a7 54-84 (b) now afford protection to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>defendant who chooses not to testify in his criminal trial. The United States Supreme Court has recently pointed out that \u201c[n]o judge can prevent jurors from speculating about why a defendant stands mute in the face of a criminal accusation, but a judge can, and must . . . use the unique power of the jury instruction to reduce that speculation to a minimum.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 303, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981). The trial judge has \u201ca powerful tool . . . to protect the constitutional privilege\u201d; id.; in the use of this jury instruction, the purpose of which is \u201cto remove from the jury\u2019s deliberations any influence of unspoken adverse inferences.\u201d Id., 298, quoting <em>Lakeside </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>435 U.S. 333, 339, 98 S. Ct. 1091, 55 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1978). Just as the adverse comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify proscribed in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106, reh. denied, 381 U.S. 957, 85 S. Ct. 1797, 14 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1965), \u201ccuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly,\u201d the <em>Carter </em>court emphasized that \u201cthe failure to limit the jurors\u2019 speculation on the meaning of that silence . . . exacts an impermissible toll on the full and free exercise of the privilege.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 305. That rationale is fully appropriate to the application of the mandate of \u00a7 54-84 (b) to this case. There is merit to the defendant\u2019s claims that the challenged instruction clearly permitted the jury to draw an unfavorable inference which was also a reasonable inference and, therefore, one in violation of his rights under \u00a7 54-84 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Even though we find the instruction erroneous, this, however, does not end our analysis. \u201cAn erroneous instruction, even of constitutional dimension, is harmless if, viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 209, 445 A.2d 314 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrione, </em>supra, 685. After an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>examination of the charge as a whole, we conclude that there was such a reasonable possibility. In doing so, we accept the state\u2019s position that \u201c[w]hether a charge is possibly misleading depends on the substance rather than the form of what is said.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 565, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The state points out that the trial court\u2019s statement that the defendant \u201chas the absolute right to remain silent\u201d just preceded its statement that the prosecution has the burden of proving the defendant guilty. It argues that these statements, taken together, serve to cure the instruction to draw \u201cno unreasonable inference\u201d from the failure to testify. We do not agree. Rather, the license given by the instruction to draw a reasonable inference, much more consistent with guilt than innocence, impermissibly dilutes \u201cthe absolute right to remain silent\u201d language by serving to adulterate that language, thus subverting the clear purpose of \u00a7 54-84 (b). The \u201cno unfavorable inferences\u201d instruction \u201cis also an explanation to a jury of laymen of the reason why a defendant may not be called [upon] to testify in a criminal case. We cannot assume that lay jurors know what lawyers and judges know.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>52 Mich. App. 739, 741, 218 N.W.2d 150 (1974). Long before <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, the United States Supreme Court said: \u201cWe need not close our eyes to the fact that every person accused of crime is under some pressure to testify, lest the jury, despite carefully framed instructions, draw an <em>unfavorable </em>inference from his silence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Raffel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>271 U.S. 494, 499, 46 S. Ct. 566, 70 L. Ed. 1054 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We cannot accept the state\u2019s claim made under <em>State </em>v. <em>Boulware, </em>supra, 447-48, that \u201ca reasonable juror hearing this instruction within the context of the entire charge would naturally assume that the defendant\u2019s silence formed no part of the case.\u201d Our examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>of the charge as a whole demands a contrary conclusion. <em>State </em>v. Wilkinson, 176 Conn. 451, 454, 408 A.2d 232 (1979). The statute clearly requires the use of the word \u201cunfavorable\u201d as opposed to \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Certainly the silence of the defendant without explanation or contradiction by him is perceived by the jury, \u201cwhich perceiving they can no more disregard than one can the light of the sun, when shining with full blaze on the open eye.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cleaves, </em>59 Me. 298, 301 (1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\"> The state had been given permission, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 to appeal.
