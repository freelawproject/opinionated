HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b533-27\">Plaintiff-Appellant Landry Dixon appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-28\">FACTS &amp; PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b533-29\">In August 2012, Dixon, proceeding pro se, filed a complaint against Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (\u201cTMCC\u201d) and Troy Campise, the Sales Manager of Lakeside Toyota (\u201cLakeside\u201d), an automobile dealership. He alleged that TMCC and Campise defrauded him by leading him to believe that a lease for a Toyota Corolla automobile would be tax exempt because the co-lessee, DELF, Inc., was a non-profit organization for which Dixon is the registered agent and chief executive officer. Dixon alleged that he signed a lease that set the monthly payments at $312.91, but he was later informed that the payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>would be $341.07 because TMCC did not recognize DELF as a tax-exempt corporate customer. Each month, Dixon paid the lower amount, which led to TMCC\u2019s efforts to collect the difference and adverse entries on Dixon\u2019s credit reports. Dixon\u2019s original complaint cited no federal cause of action; construed liberally, it sounded in common law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">On July 17, 2013, after ruling on several dispositive motions, the district court sua' sponte dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court held that Dixon did not establish diversity jurisdiction because he did not plead the citizenship of any party and the amount in controversy was less than $75,000. The district court further held that Dixon had not established federal question jurisdiction because his complaint did not raise an issue of federal law, and a post-dismissal motion\u2014 which the district court construed as an attempt to amend the complaint \u2014 did not raise a substantial federal question. Dixon filed various motions to reconsider and for leave to amend his complaint, all of which were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">On January 6, 2014, Dixon filed another action against TMCC, bringing a claim under the Consumer Leasing Act (\u201cCLA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1667-1667\u00cd. After consolidating this new action with the existing one, the district court granted TMCC\u2019s motion to dismiss on April 10, 2014. The district court held that the CLA applies only to \u201cconsumer leases\u201d \u2014 those by natural people for the use of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes \u2014 and the lease at issue was to an organization and was not for personal, family, or household use. Dixon timely appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his second complaint and was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. A panel of this court granted Cam-pise\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as to him and denied as unnecessary Lakeside\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal because Lakeside was never a party to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">We begin by narrowing the issues on appeal. Dixon did not timely appeal the dismissal of his original complaint. The district court entered judgment against Dixon on his first complaint on July 19, 2013 and Dixon did not file this appeal until April 30, 2014, well beyond the thirty days permitted under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), even accounting for the time during which the district court was considering Dixon\u2019s various post-judgment motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, our review is limited to the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dixon\u2019s second complaint. Further, Dixon contends, in his reply brief only, that this court erred in dismissing the appeal as to Campise and failing to consider his claims against Lakeside. Arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are waived. <em>See Unida v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., </em>986 F.2d 970, 976 n. 4 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cBy failing to raise this argument until their reply brief, the Plaintiffs have waived it.\u201d). Regardless, neither Campise nor Lakeside were named as defendants in the second complaint, which is the only complaint properly appealed from. Therefore, we review only the dismissal of Dixon\u2019s CLA claim. Our review is de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>novo. <em>Frame v. City of Arlington, </em>657 F.3d 215, 222 (5th Cir.2011) (en banc). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Dixon argues that the district court erred in determining that, because the lease at issue was to an organization, Dixon\u2019s complaint failed to state a CLA claim against TMCC. The CLA, as its name suggests, regulates <em>consumer </em>leases\u2014 those made to natural persons primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667(1). The CLA does not apply to a lease that is (1) to an organization; or (2) for agricultural, business, or commercial purposes. <em>Id.; see also </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.2(e)(l)-(2). The CLA extended the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), which similarly applies only to applications for <em>consumer </em>credit. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(1) (stating that TILA provisions do not apply to credit transactions \u201cprimarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes ... or to organizations\u201d); <em>Am. Express Co. v. Koerner, </em>452 U.S. 233, 241, 101 S.Ct. 2281, 68 L.Ed.2d 803 (1981) (\u201cTwo elements thus must be present in every \u2018consumer credit\u2019 transaction: the party to whom the credit is extended must be a natural person, <em>and </em>the money, property, or services received by that person must be primarily for [consumer purposes].\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The district court reasoned that the CLA did not apply because the lease was made to DELF, Inc., an \u201corganization\u201d within the meaning of the statute. There is no reasonable dispute that DELF is a lessee and that DELF is an organization under the meaning of the CLA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(d) (defining \u201corganization\u201d to include a \u201ccorporation\u201d); <em>K/O Ranch, Inc. by Olson v. Norwest Bank of Black Hills, </em>748 F.2d 1246, 1248 (8th Cir.1984) (exempting, from TILA, loans made to a corporation); <em>Katz v. Am. Express Co., </em>No. 14-CV-00084, 2014 WL 6470595, at *13 (D.Haw. Nov. 18, 2014) (holding that plaintiff did not state a TILA claim because credit was extended to a business entity); <em>No Straw, LLC v. Stout St. Funding, LLC, </em>No. 2:12-CV-0182, 2013 WL 2951064, at *3-4 (N.D.Ga. June 14, 2013) (rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument that TILA applied because a limited liability company was an individual\u2019s alter ego, finding that \u201cTILA\u2019s language exempting credit transactions to organizations is unambiguous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The fact that Dixon, a natural person, was co-lessee on the lease at issue does not convert it into a consumer lease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The CLA\u2019s text forecloses the possibility that a CLA claim can stand where one lessee is a natural person but a co-lessee is an organization. The CLA\u2019s substantive provisions contemplate the possibility that a consum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>er lease can have multiple lessees. <em>See, e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667a (\u201cEach lessor shall give <em>a </em>lessee ... a dated written statement....\u201d (emphasis added)). For the lease to be a consumer lease, however, all lessees must be natural persons. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667(2) (defining \u201clessee\u201d as \u201ca natural person who leases or is offered a consumer lease\u201d). Moreover, a consumer lease expressly \u201cdoes not include a lease ... to an organization.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1667(1). Because this lease was made to an organization (DELF) as well as to a natural person (Dixon) it cannot be a consumer lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Dixon\u2019s remaining arguments criticize the district court\u2019s conclusion that the lease at issue was not a consumer lease because it was not for personal, family, or household purposes. Because the CLA does not apply to a lease that is made to an organization, we need not determine wh\u00e9ther the complaint plausibly alleged that the lease was for personal use, rather than for agricultural, business, or commercial purposes. Dixon has failed to state a claim for relief under the CLA. We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\">. Because the district court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction, it voided its prior orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">. Moreover, Dixon\u2019s Notice of Appeal states that he is appealing the April 10, 2014 district court judgment and the April 24, 2014 denial of his motion to reconsider that judgment. It does not mention the July 2013 judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (\"The notice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\">. Dixon argues that he was the only lessee and that the use of DELF, Inc. on the lease documents \"was purely and exclusively to receive an excise tax credit.\u201d Regardless of the questionable legality of naming a nonprofit in order to receive a tax credit on a personal vehicle, both the lease and Dixon\u2019s own complaint state that Dixon and DELF were co-lessees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">. DELF and Dixon are listed separately as \"lessee\u201d and \"co-lessee\u201d on both the lease attached to the original complaint and the lease attached to TMCC's answer, which TMCC contends is the valid lease. The lease that TMCC contends is valid was signed by Dixon personally and by \"DELF, Inc., by [Dixon].\u201d The operative complaint itself alleges that \"[pjlaintiff and plaintiffs nonprofit entered into a closed-end automotive lease agreement\u201d and that \u201c[p]laintiff and plaintiff's nonprofit signed this agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
