Her complaint alleges that her federal due process rights were violated when the warden of the prison where she was housed ordered the prison staff not to speak with Gissendaner\u2019s legal team as they were gathering evidence in support of her application for clemency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-17\">Gissendaner was convicted of malice murder and sentenced to death for masterminding the brutal murder of her husband. <em>See Gissendaner v. State, </em>272 Ga. 704, 532 S.E.2d 677, 681-83 (2000). She tried (and failed) in state and federal court to challenge her conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 9, 2015, the Superior Court of. Gwinnett County issued an order directing the Georgia Department of Corrections to execute Gissendaner. The order created a seven-day window for the execution, lasting from February 25 to March 4, 2015. <em>See </em>Ga.Code \u00a7 17-10-40(b). The original execution date was set for February 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-18\">Anticipating that an execution date would be set in early 2015, Gissendaner\u2019s legal team (which included both her attorneys and an investigator working on her behalf) had begun in late 2014 to prepare an application for state clemency. Her application would be heard by the State Board of Pardons and Paroles, which has the power to grant executive clemency to the State\u2019s prisoners. Ga. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 2(2); <em>see </em>Ga.Code \u00a7 42-9-1 <em>et seq. </em>As part of their preparations, Gissendaner\u2019s legal team interviewed a number of -the staff working at Lee Arrendale State Prison and Metro State Prison. Arrendale is the prison where Gissendaner is currently housed, and Metro is the prison where Gissendaner was previously housed. Early on, four Arrendale staff members provided her legal team with written statements in support of Gissendaner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-19\">Eight other staff members at Arrendale and Metro expressed a willingness to support Gissendaner \u2014 either through written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>statements or testimony at the' clemency hearing. Those eight staff members, however, changed their mind after the warden at Arrendale, Kathleen Kennedy, issued a memo in January 2015 to all prison staff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The memo was titled \u201cPublic Information / Media Contact\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-4\">An execution date might be scheduled in the immediate future for our inmate under death sentence. This action will likely bring a lot of publicity to [Arren-dale].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-5\">Be advised that if ANYONE calls you with questions regarding this issue, you are to refer them to the DOC Public Affairs office....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-6\">Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside this institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed. If you have questions or concerns, please contact Warden Kennedy or Deputy Warden Tatum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">After receiving the memo, the eight'staff members withdrew their commitments to offer statements or testimony supporting Gissendaner. And when Gissendaner\u2019s legal team approached other staff members at the prisons about her clemency proceedings, the staff members refused to testify or provide written statements. Some of the staff members told Gissendaner\u2019s investigator that \u201cthey could not help based on a [Department of Corrections] directive and, further, that they feared that if they did, their jobs would be at stake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Adl\">Gissendaner filed her application for clemency on February 20, 2015, and the Board notified her that it would hold a hearing on her application on February 24. At the hearing, Gissendaner\u2019s attorneys appeared on her behalf and presented testimony from fifteen witnesses plus thirteen written statements of support from current and former staff members at Arren-dale and Metro, as well as other evidence. Of the fifteen witnesses to actually testify on her behalf at the hearing, the only one who was a staff member at the time of the hearing was Chaplain Susan Bishop of Ar-rendale. The four Arrendale staff members who had submitted written statements before Warden Kennedy issued her memo did not withdraw their statements, and those four written statements were presented to the Board at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">The morning after the hearing, the Board denied Gissendaner\u2019s application for clemency. At the time, her execution was still scheduled for that evening. A few hours after the Board\u2019s decision, however, predictions of inclement weather led the State to postpone the execution until 7:00 p.m. ET on March 2, 2015, which was five days away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">The day before her rescheduled execution was to take place, Gissendaner obtained a copy of Warden Kennedy\u2019s memo. The next day, the day she was rescheduled to be executed, Gissendaner filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit claiming that her due process rights had been violated because the warden\u2019s memo\" had interfered with her ability to obtain and present evidence in support of her application for clemency. Because her rescheduled execution was only hours away, she also filed motions for a preliminary injunction and for a stay of execution. That same day, the State moved to dismiss Gissendaner\u2019s complaint, and the district court held a hearing on the various motions. After the hearing, the district court issued an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>denying Gissendaner\u2019s motions and granting the State\u2019s motion to dismiss her complaint. Even though it denied her motions for an indefinite stay and an injunction, the court granted Gissendaner a 24-hour stay so that this Court could hear her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">That evening both parties filed notices of appeal. Gissendaner\u2019s appeal challenged the dismissal of her complaint and the denial of her motions for a stay and a preliminary injunction. The State\u2019s appeal challenged the district court\u2019s 24-hour stay. This Court issued an order in the State\u2019s appeal dissolving the 24-hour stay because, based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 submissions, we did not need any more time to conclude that Gis-sendaner had not demonstrated the substantial likelihood of success on the merits required to justify a stay. Our order allowed the State to proceed with the execution, but around 10:20 p.m. the State postponed the execution because of concerns about the condition of the drugs that were to be used in the execution. Two days later, we ordered that the State\u2019s appeal be closed because it had already received the relief it sought in that appeal\u2014vacatur of the 24-hour stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">This is Gissendaner\u2019s appeal from the order dismissing her complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Arthur, </em>500 F.3d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">Gissendaner contends that her complaint states a claim for relief under the Due Process Clause. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. In her view, the Clause \u201cdemands that a prisoner seeking clemency must receive the process that the state has established for all clemency petitioners.\u201d She points to the version of Georgia Code \u00a7 42-9-43 in force at the time of her hearing, which instructs the Board to \u201ccause to be brought before it all pertinent information on the person in question\u201d when considering an application for clemency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Ga.Code \u00a7 42-9-43(a). From there, she argues that Warden Kennedy\u2019s memo interfered with the procedure created by \u00a7 42-9-43\u2014and thereby violated her due process rights\u2014because the memo prevented her from obtaining pertinent evidence and presenting it to the Board. But the procedural component of the Due Process Clause does not require the States to comply with state-created procedural rules. Instead, it requires them to adhere to a certain minimal level of process when seeking to deprive an individual of a substantive interest protected by the Clause\u2014 namely, \u201clife, liberty, or property.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-13\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>523 U.S. 272, 118 S.Ct. 1244, 140 L.Ed.2d 387 (1998), did recognize a due process interest in the context of state clemency proceedings for death row inmates. The holding in that case was provided by Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion. <em>Wellons v. Comm\u2019r, Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>754 F.3d 1268, 1269 n. 2 (11th Cir.2014) (recognizing Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion as \u201cset[ting] binding precedent\u201d). Her opinion acknowledges that the \u201clife\u201d interest protected by the Due Process Clause itself guarantees \u201csome <em>minimal </em>procedural safeguards\u201d for state clemency proceedings involving death row inmates. <em>Woodard, </em>523 U.S. at 289, 118 S.Ct. at 1254 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">The key word here is \u201cminimal.\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion concludes that the prisoner in <em>Woodard </em>had received adequate process despite the fact that he was given only a few days notice of his hearing, that he was interviewed by the parole board without his attorney present, that his attorney was \u201cpermitted to participate in the hearing only at the discretion of the parole board chair,\u201d and that the prisoner \u201cwas precluded from testifying or submitting documentary evidence at the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 118 S.Ct. at 1254. That procedure, it was held, satisfied <em>\u201cwhatever </em>limitations the Due Process Clause <em>may </em>impose on clemency proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 290, 118 S.Ct. at 1254 (emphasis added). The only circumstances that Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion identifies in which due process would be offended are truly outrageous ones, such as (1) \u201ca scheme whereby a state official flipped a coin to determine whether to grant clemency,\u201d or (2) \u201ca case where the State arbitrarily denied a prisoner <em>any </em>access to its clemency process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 118 S.Ct. at 1254 (emphasis added).. Outside of similarly \u201cextreme situations,\u201d the federal Due Process Clause does not justify judicial intervention into state clemency proceedings. <em>Faulder v. Tex. Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>178 F.3d 343, 344 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">The process that Gissendaner received was at least equal to the process that passed constitutional muster in <em>Woodard. </em>The Board gave her notice of the hearing, permitted her to present favorable testimony from some fifteen witnesses, and allowed her to submit thirteen written statements from prison staff supporting her application. That clearly satisfies \u201cwhatever limitations the Due Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings.\u201d <em>Woodard, </em>523 U.S. at 290, 118 S.Ct. at 1254 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (holding that \u201cnotice of the hearing and an opportunity to participate in an interview\u201d was enough).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">Gissendaner latches onto a single phrase in Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion to support the argument that her clemency proceeding was inadequate under <em>Woodard. </em>That phrase is \u201ccomports with Ohio\u2019s regulations,\u201d which is found in the following statement: \u201cThe process respondent received, including notice of the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>and an opportunity to participate in an interview, comports with Ohio\u2019s regulations and observes whatever limitations the Due Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gissendaner argues that, because Warden Kennedy\u2019s memo did not, in her view, comport with Georgia Code \u00a7 42-9-43, her clemency proceeding did not meet the standard set by <em>Woodard. </em>Even assuming that the memo violated Georgia law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> however, her argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">For starters, Gissendaner\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Wellons, </em>754 F.3d at 1269. <em>Wellons </em>involved another Georgia death row inmate\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of his clemency proceedings. <em>See id. </em>The prisoner asserted that, because of actions taken by Georgia prison officials, \u201cat least one corrections officer employed at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison, who was previously willing to provide a statement in' support of clemency on Wellons\u2019s behalf, now refuses to do so for fear of losing his or her job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying <em>Woodard, </em>we held that, given the \u201cvery limited due process interest in clemency proceedings,\u201d the prisoner \u201cha[d] failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on his claim that he enjoys a due process or other Constitutional right with respect to his petition for clemency.\u201d <em>Wellons, </em>754 F.3d at 1269 (citing <em>Woodard, </em>523 U.S. at 283-85, 118 S.Ct. at 1251 (opinion of Rehnquist, C.J.); <em>id. </em>at 288-89, 118 S.Ct. at 1253 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)). In other words, the Due Process Clause does not guarantee state prisoners a right to acquire and present testimony from prison staff in support of an application for clemency, nor does it bar state officials from limiting prisoners\u2019 access to such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">Gissendaner\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Wellons </em>is unavailing. She points out that the prisoner in <em>Wellons </em>had presented \u201clittle evidence of interference beyond one employee\u2019s independent recollection,\u201d whereas she has presented a copy of Warden Kennedy\u2019s memo and an affidavit showing that \u201cseveral\u201d prison staff members had understood the memo to mean that \u201cspeaking out on behalf of Ms. Gissen-daner would place their jobs in peril.\u201d That is a distinction, but it makes no difference. <em>Wellons\u2019 </em>holding rested on the \u201cvery limited\u201d nature of the \u201cdue process interest in clemency proceedings,\u201d not on the factual support accompanying the prisoner\u2019s complaint. 754 F.3d at 1269. And \u201cthe holding of the first panel to address an issue is the law of this Circuit, thereby binding all subsequent panels unless and until the first panel\u2019s holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001). <em>Wellons </em>therefore controls the outcome here and dictates that we affirm the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-4\">Even if <em>Wellons </em>were distinguishable, we would still reject Gissendaner\u2019s reading of <em>Woodard. </em>Nothing in Justice O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s concurring opinion suggests that a clemency board\u2019s compliance with state laws or procedures is part of the <em>\u201cminimal </em>procedural safeguards\u201d protected by the Due Process Clause. <em>See Woodard, </em>523 U.S. at 288-90, 118 S.Ct. at 1253-54 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). It is a far cry from the denial of access circumstance the opinion describes where a due process violation \u201cmight\u201d occur, which is \u201cwhere the State arbitrarily denied a prisoner <em>any </em>access to its clemency process.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 289, 118 S.Ct. at 1254 (emphasis added). Adopting Gissendaner\u2019s reading of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion would conflict with a long line of Supreme Court decisions holding that a violation of state procedural law does not itself give rise to a due process claim. <em>See, e.g., Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 482, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 2299, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (decrying the notion that a violation of state prison regulations provides a basis for a procedural due process claim because it \u201ccreates disincentives for States to codify prison management procedures\u201d); <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 250-51, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 1748, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983) (explaining that \u201c[p]ro-cess is not an end in itself\u2019 and holding that a State\u2019s creation of administrative procedures \u201cdoes not create an independent substantive right\u201d under the Due Process Clause); <em>cf. Snowden v. Hughes, </em>321 U.S. 1, 11, 64 S.Ct. 397, 402, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1944) (\u201cMere violation of a state statute does not infringe the federal Constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">Finally, Gissendaner points us to a line of Eighth Circuit decisions, which interpreted Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Woodard </em>to mean that \u201c[t]he Constitution of the United States does not require that a state have a clemency procedure, but ... it does require that, if such a procedure is created, the state\u2019s own officials refrain from frustrating it by threatening the job of a witness.\u201d <em>Young v. Hayes, </em>218 F.3d 850, 853 (8th Cir.2000); <em>see Noel v. Norris, </em>336 F.3d 648, 649 (8th Cir.2003) (\u201c[I]f the state actively interferes with a prisoner\u2019s access to the very system that it has itself established for considering clemency petitions, due process is violated.\u201d). <em>But see Winfield v. Steele, </em>755 F.3d 629, 631-32 (8th Cir.2014) (en banc) (Gruender, J., concurring) (arguing for the overruling of <em>Young </em>because it misinterpreted <em>Woodard </em>and \u201cruns counter to the weight of authority from other courts\u201d). That is essentially the same reading of <em>Woodard </em>that Gissendaner adopts. And like her reading, it cannot be squared with what Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion actually says or with the great run of Supreme Court decisions refusing to transform violations of state law into federal due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1354-12\">. Those challenges are set out in <em>Gissendaner </em>v. <em>Seaboldt, </em>735 F.3d 1311 (11th Cir.2013); <em>Gissendaner v. State, </em>272 Ga. 704, 532 S.E.2d 677 (2000); and <em>Gissendaner v. State, </em>269 Ga. 495, 500 S.E.2d 577 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">. It is not clear whether the memo went to just Arrendale staff members or to Metro staff members as well. We will assume it went to both. <em>See Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1339 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that, in an appeal from a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we must \u201caccept[ ] the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and constru[e] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">. Though her notice of appeal refers to the denial of her motions for a stay and for a preliminary injunction, Gissendaner's brief challenges only the dismissal of her complaint. In any event, our decision that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief moots any issues regarding a stay or a preliminary injunction. <em>See Arthur, </em>500 F.3d at 1344.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">. Since the Board\u2019s decision on Gissendaner\u2019s application, Georgia Code \u00a7 42-9-43 has been amended to include two additional categories of \u201cpertinent information\u201d that the Board must \u201ccause to be brought before it.\" <em>Compare </em>2015 Ga. Laws Act 43, \u00a7 4 (eff. July 1, 2015) (identifying eight categories of \"pertinent information\u201d), <em>with </em>2013 Ga. Laws 222, 242 \u00a7 19 (identifying six categories of \"pertinent information\u201d). We discuss the version in force at the time of the Board's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">. As a general rule, the two basic requirements of the Due Process Clause are notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. <em>See Texaco, Inc. v. Short, </em>454 U.S. 516, 534, 102 S.Ct. 781, 795, 70 L.Ed.2d 738 (1982) (\"Many controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause but there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing, appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d) (quoting <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 656-57, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)); <em>see generally </em>Hon. Henry J. Friendly, <em>\"Some Kind of Hearing\", </em>123 U. Pa. L.Rev. 1267 (1975). But Justice O\u2019Connor's opinion in <em>Woodard </em>does not state that either of those requirements applies to state clemency proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">. It is not at all clear that Gissendaner\u2019s clemency proceeding violated Georgia Code \u00a7 42-9-43 since the statute: (1) does not give a prisoner the right to interview prison staff and present their testimony to the Board; and (2) does not require the Board to interview prison staff members. The statute states: \"The board, in considering any case within its power, shall cause to be brought before it all pertinent\u2019information on the person in question.\" Ga.Code \u00a7 42-9-43(a). But none of the six sources of \u201cpertinent information\u201d listed in \u00a7 42-9-43(a) at the time of Gissendaner's clemency hearing include direct testimony or written statements from prison staff. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 42-9-43(a)(l)-(6). The statute grants discretion to the Board \u2014 not a right to the prisoner \u2014 to supplement those six sources of information \"as it may deem necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 42-9-43(c). So limiting Gissendaner\u2019s access to prison staff does not appear to violate any of the statute\u2019s requirements.

But we never held that the Due Process Clause requires Florida to comply with its own clemency procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1359-8\">JORDAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AT8\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">I join all but Part II.C of the majority opinion and concur in the judgment.
