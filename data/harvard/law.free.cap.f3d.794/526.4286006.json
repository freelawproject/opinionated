DENNIS, Circuit Judge, in chambers:</author>\n<p id=\"b553-25\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has recognized that courts o'f appeals have an inherent power to recall their mandates.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. Johnson, </em>224 F.3d 450, 459 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 549, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998)). \u201cOur authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>recall our mandate is clear.\u201d . <em>United States v. Tolliver, </em>116 F.3d 120, 123 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cNonetheless, the Supreme Court has instructed that we may exercise that power only upon a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Fraser, </em>407 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <em>Calderon, </em>523 U.S. at 550, 118 S.Ct. 1489). In this circuit, the court\u2019s mandate \u201cwill not be recalled except to prevent injustice.\u201d 5th CiR. R. 41.2. Under these standards, I conclude that the mandate in this criminal appeal of Bennie D. Emeary, Jr. shall be recalled. As I will explain, Emeary\u2019s appointed attorney and this court both committed plain error in reviewing Emeary\u2019s sentence and failing to notice that he was condemned to five more years of incarceration than the law allows. In my view, this plain error can and should be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">On February 9, 2005, Emeary was indicted for illegally possessing firearms after having been convicted of a felony, which is generally punishable by a <em>maximum </em>term of ten years of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, if the defendant has previously been convicted of three \u201cviolent felonies\u201d within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), then the <em>minimum </em>term of imprisonment is fifteen years. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Under the ACCA, the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d includes, in pertinent part, crimes that \u201c[are] burglary, arson, or extortion, involve! ] use of explosives, or otherwise involve!] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Emeary\u2019s indictment alleged that he had been convicted of three prior \u201cviolent felonies,\u201d including, pertinent here, a 1998 conviction in Texas for \u201cburglary of a building.\u201d The bill of information for the 1998 conviction reveals that it was under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) of the Texas Penal Code, for \u201centering] a building\u201d \u201cwithout the effective consent of the owner\u201d and \u201ccommitting] or attempting] to commit a felony or theft.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">On May 25, 2005, pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, Emeary pleaded guilty to the illegal-possession-of-firearms charge. The district court sentenced Emeary on December 7, 2005. The court classified Emeary as subject to the ACCA\u2019s fifteen-year minimum sentence because, including the 1998 conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), he had been convicted of three \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d The court sentenced Emeary to fifteen years of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Emeary filed a notice of appeal on May 13, 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 14, 2009, Emeary\u2019s appointed attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that he had reviewed the case and concluded that there were no nonfrivo-lous arguments to present on Emeary\u2019s behalf. (In fact, he went further and represented that there was \u201cno reversible error in this case.\u201d <em>Anders </em>Br., at 24.) He therefore requested the court\u2019s leave to withdraw as Emeary\u2019s attorney. Under <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>triggered this court\u2019s obligation to conduct \u201ca full examination of all the proceedings [and] to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d On February 12, 2010, we concluded that there were no nonfrivolous issues presented and dismissed the appeal. <em>United States v. Emeary, </em>365 Fed.Appx. 552, 553 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished). The court\u2019s mandate issued on March 8, 2010. Both Emeary\u2019s attorney and we made a serious omission, as I will explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Neither Emeary\u2019s attorney in his <em>Anders </em>brief nor this court in our opinion dismissing Emeary\u2019s appeal referenced <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584 (5th Cir.2008), which issued on October 6, 2008 and was thus established circuit precedent at the time of Emeary\u2019s appeal. In <em>Constante, </em>544 F.3d at 587, this court held that convictions under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) do not constitute \u201cviolent felony\u201d convictions under the ACCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Em-eary, of course, was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment based on his Texas Penal Code \u00a7 302.03(a)(3) conviction\u2019s classification as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">On November 10, 2014, Emeary filed a motion with this court to recall the mandate in this appeal. He pointed to <em>Con-stante </em>and claimed that under it, his sentence was excessive and plainly erroneous. On December 8, 2014,1 denied the motion, <em>United States v. Emeary, </em>773 F.3d 619 (5th Cir.2014), principally because I believed that it was unclear whether Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) offenses may be deemed \u201cviolent felonies\u201d by dint of falling under the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition, an issue upon which <em>Constante </em>was not, in my estimation, crystal clear. (See <em>supra, </em>note 3 for a full explanation of the issue.) On June 26, 2015, however, the Supreme Court held in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), that the residual clause of the \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition is vague, unconstitutional, and unenforceable. <em>Post-Johnson, </em>it is now clear without any room for doubt that Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>offenses are not \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA, period. (And, there is reason to think that such conclusion was \u201cplain\u201d before <em>Johnson, </em>too, under <em>Constante </em>alone. <em>See United States v. St Clair, </em>No. 14-50287, 608 Fed.Appx. 192, 195 n. 2, 2015 WL 1611666, at *2 n. 2 (5th Cir. Apr. 13, 2015) (unpublished).) On July 6, 2015, Emeary filed the present renewed motion to recall the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">To summarize, Emeary was sentenced to fifteen years of incarceration because the district court erroneously classified his prior Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) conviction as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d conviction under the ACCA. Emeary should not have been sentenced to more than ten years of incarceration, the correct statutory maximum. His attorney should have appealed the erroneous sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">To be fair and complete, Emeary\u2019s plea agreement did include an appeal waiver. There are, however, recognized exceptions to appeal waivers. <em>See United States v. Batamula, </em>788 F.3d 166, 169 n. 5 (5th Cir.2015) (government forfeited the right to enforce the appeal waiver); <em>United States v. Powell, </em>574 Fed.Appx. 390, 394 (5th Cir.2014) (unpublished) (explaining that other circuits have created a \u201cmiscarriage-of-justice\u201d exception to the enforceability of appeal waivers but this circuit has not yet decided whether to join them); <em>United States v. De Cay, </em>359 Fed.Appx. 514, 516 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished) (same). Emeary\u2019s attorney, under his duty to act \u201czealous[ly] for the indigent\u2019s interests,\u201d <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 278 n. 10, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000), should have pressed to avoid the appeal waiver, but he failed to do so. <em>See also Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396 (\u201c[Counsel\u2019s] role as advocate requires that he support his client\u2019s appeal to the best of his ability.\u201d). At the very least, the potential for avoiding the appeal waiver barring Emeary from appealing his plainly erroneous sentence is a \u201cpossibly important issue\u201d that should have been, but was not, identified in the <em>Anders </em>brief. <em>See United States v. Garland, </em>632 F.3d 877, 879 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>527 F.2d. 1328, 1329 (5th Cir.1976)). In fact, in <em>Garland, </em>632 F.3d at 880, we faulted the attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief in that case for failing to \u201cprovide! ] ... facts about [the defendant\u2019s] prior convictions [and an] assessment of the validity of [a] challenge to [how those prior convictions affected the defendant\u2019s sentence].\u201d Nor did the deficient <em>Anders </em>brief address the defendant\u2019s \u201ccharacterization as a career offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>So too here. By Garland\u2019s standards, the <em>Anders </em>brief in this case was inadequate. But, we accepted it, erroneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Simply stated, the district court committed plain error by sentencing Em-eary to fifteen years of incarceration when the statutory maximum was ten, and this court committed plain error when we deemed Emeary\u2019s appeal frivolous and dismissed it without any notice of the issue. The Supreme Court has recognized that, while the <em>Anders </em>process is intended \u201cto ensure that rights are not forgone and that substantial legal and factual arguments are not inadvertently passed over,\u201d <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 85, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), the process is imperfect and cannot \u201celiminate all risk of error,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>528 U.S. at 277 n. 8, 120 S.Ct. 746. That acknowledgment demands a concomitant willingness of courts to correct plain errors that escaped notice, at least in some circumstances. In my view, those circumstances are present here. A criminal defendant should not be unlawfully condemned to five excessive years in prison \u2014 a \u201cdrastic loss of liberty,\u201d <em>Penson, </em>488 U.S. at 85, 109 S.Ct. 346 \u2014 based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>sort of clear and obvious error we made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The renewed motion to recall the mandate is GRANTED, the court\u2019s mandate is RECALLED, the appeal is REINSTATED and EXPEDITED, and the defendant is APPOINTED counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. The Texas statute has been amended since Emeary's conviction and now prohibits entering a building or habitation without consent and committing or attempting to commit \"a felony, theft, or <em>an assault.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) The amendment is immaterial here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">. The appeal was delayed because Emeary\u2019s appointed attorney failed to timely initiate it, which the district court held amounted to unconstitutional ineffective assistance of counsel. To remedy the attorney\u2019s failure and afford Emeary an appeal, the district court entered a \u201creinstated\u201d judgment on May 1, 2009. Emeary\u2019s May 13 notice of appeal is from the May 1 judgment. <em>See United States v. Tapp, </em>491 F.3d 263 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. West, </em>240 F.3d 456 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\">. I must note that the precise scope of <em>Con-stante 's </em>holding is reasonably debatable. The ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d includes crimes that \u201c[are] burglary, arson, or extortion, involve! ] use of explosives, or otherwise involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Constante's express analysis addresses whether Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) offenses constitute \"burglaries\u201d under the \"violent felony\u201d definition, and <em>Constante </em>clearly answers \"no.\u201d But did <em>Constante </em>also decide whether such offenses constitute ACCA \"violent felonies\u201d because they fall under the so-called \"residual clause\u201d of the \u201cviolent felony\u201d <em>definition </em>\u2014 i.e., because they \"otherwise involve!] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d? Theoretically, a state offense may constitute a \"violent felony\u201d because it falls under the residual clause even though it doesn't constitute a \u201cburglary.\u201d <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 212, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (the residual clause \"can cover conduct that is outside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary\u201d). In <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>507 Fed.Appx. 353, 354 (5th Cir.2013) (unpublished), this court read <em>Constante </em>narrowly and construed it as holding only that the Texas offense does not constitute a \"burglary,\u201d thus leaving as an open question whether it falls under the residual clause. Subsequently, though, in <em>United States v. St. Clair, </em>No. 14-50287, 608 Fed.Appx. 192, 195 n. 2, 2015 WL 1611666, at *3 n. 2 (5th Cir. Apr. 13, 2015) (unpublished), this court rejected <em>Ramirez </em>and read <em>Constante </em>more broadly as \"clearly\u201d holding that the Texas offense is neither a \"burglary\u201d nor encompassed within the residual clause. In any event, the scope of <em>Constante </em>is academic now that the Supreme Court has held that the residual clause is unconstitutional and unenforceable. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Per <em>Constante, </em>the offense is not a \"burglary.\u201d Per <em>Johnson, </em>the residual clause is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\">. In addition to any other issues Emeary\u2019s counsel will deem pertinent, the attorney should address the following questions. First, does the government intend to enforce the appeal waiver in Emeary's plea agreement? <em>See United States v. Acquaye, </em>452 F.3d 380, 381-82 (5th Cir.2006) (defense counsel has the duty to determine such). If so, second, is the appeal waiver enforceable in the circumstances of this case? <em>See Powell, </em>574 Fed. Appx. at 394 (discussing \"miscarriage-of-justice\u201d exception to the enforceability of appeal waivers); <em>De Cay, </em>359 Fed.Appx. at 516 (same). Third, does <em>Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 554, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998) (even when the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act is inapplicable, \"a court of appeals must exercise its discretion in a manner consistent with the objects of the statute\u201d), preclude this court from granting relief to Emeary? <em>See Emeary, 773 </em>F.3d at 621-22 (discussing the issue). The government, in its response, should address whether the arguments it offers were forfeited when it failed to substantively respond to Emeary\u2019s motions to recall the mandate. <em>See Perez v. Stephens, </em>784 F.3d 276, 282-83 (5th Cir.2015) (forfeiture by failure to timely raise an issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
