On the evening of January 4, 1982, at about 10 p.m., the defendant and Oczkowski drove to South Main Street in Waterbury to obtain drugs. Oczkowski was operating an automobile owned by his father-in-law, while the defendant occupied the front passenger seat. When Oczkowski parked the car on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>South Main Street near its intersection with West Liberty Street, the defendant was approached by the victim, Jose Rodriguez, and two other hispanic males. A conversation ensued between the defendant and Rodriguez during which Rodriguez handed the defendant a small glassine bag containing heroin from a bundle of similar bags that he was holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The defendant tasted the heroin, found it satisfactory, kept the bag, and asked Rodriguez for the additional bags. Rodriguez refused to comply with the defendant\u2019s request until he received payment. The defendant thereupon produced a handgun, pointed it out the passenger side window of the car, and told Rodriguez that he was going to \u201ctake it all.\u201d At the sight of the gun, Rodriguez turned and ran toward West Liberty Street. The defendant then leaned from the car window, aimed and fired one shot, striking Rodriguez in the back and killing him. Immediately, the automobile \u201cpeeled out,\u201d rapidly leaving the scene. Later that same evening, the defendant and Oczkowski were apprehended at the home of Oczkowski\u2019s in-laws in Waterbury.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Oczkowski<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified at the defendant\u2019s trial, as did other witnesses, that the defendant had shot the victim under circumstances similar to those outlined above. The defendant, on the other hand, testified that Oczkowski, after exchanging heated words with Rodriguez, had leaned from the driver\u2019s side of the automobile across the front seat, shooting Rodriguez from the passenger window of the car. The defendant testified, in effect, that no robbery had occurred and that he had merely been a spectator to an altercation between Oczkowski and the victim that had resulted in the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court unconstitutionally expanded the offense with which he was charged, when it instructed the jury that it could convict him of felony murder if it found that he or another participant in the alleged robbery caused the death of the victim \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of [the robbery] <em>or of flight therefrom. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The governing statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, creates criminal liability under both theories; the indictment by which the defendant was charged, however, contained only an allegation that the accused had violated the statute by causing the death of the victim \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u201d the robbery. There was no reference in the indictment to <em>flight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s instruction allowed the jury to convict him on a theory of liability for which he was not indicted. He argues, therefore, that he had no notice of the charges against him in violation of his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. The defendant failed to raise this claim at trial or to except to the trial court\u2019s charge. Moreover, he filed a written request that the trial court charge the jury on <em>flight.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He contends, nevertheless, that this claim is reviewable on appeal because he has been denied a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We find no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201cThe sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to be informed of the nature of the charge against him \u2018with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise, and ... to enable him to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecution for the same offense . . . . ' <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 168, 422 A.2d 299 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 154, 460 A.2d 26 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 490, 508 A.2d 22 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 560, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). The killing of a nonparticipant \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of [a robbery] or of flight therefrom\u201d are simply two methods of committing the same crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Secore, </em>194 Conn. 692, 697-98, 485 A.2d 1280 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>181 Conn. 237, 239, 435 A.2d 20 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 166, 319 A.2d 381 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>163 Conn. 527, 532, 316 A.2d 387 (1972). The defendant\u2019s conviction under either theory would consequently bar a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra. \u201cTherefore, for the defendant to establish an infringement of these constitutional rights, he must demonstrate that the court\u2019s charge caused him unfair surprise or prejudiced the preparation of his defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra, 156.\u201d <em>State v. Franko, </em>supra. We conclude that it did neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">There is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant would have altered his defense in any way if a theory of liability based on the killing of the victim \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of . . . <em>flight\u201d </em>(emphasis added) from the robbery had been included in the allegations of the indictment. His defense was predicated on his assertion that he had not been a participant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>in the robbery. He testified that he had been at the scene only because he had accompanied Oczkowski to buy drugs, and that he was merely a passenger in the automobile, an innocent bystander, when Oczkowski shot the victim and fled from the scene. We are, therefore, unable to discern any way in which the defense of the accused was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s instruction concerning the flight theory of liability. Under either theory on which the jury was instructed, if the defendant did not participate in the robbery, or facilitate the getaway, as he had testified, he would have been acquitted had he been believed by the jury. Further, the affirmative action of the defendant in submitting a written request that the trial court instruct the jury on the flight theory of liability negates any claim that he was unfairly surprised by the inclusion of such an instruction in the court\u2019s charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra, 490-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">For similar reasons, we find no violation of the defendant\u2019s fourteenth amendment right to due process. \u201cDue process requires that a criminal defendant be given notice of the specific charge against him and an opportunity to defend against that charge. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>333 U.S. 196, 201, 68 S. Ct. 514, 92 L. Ed. 644 (1948).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra, 491-92. We have already determined that the defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s expansion of the indictment, and it is impossible to find lack of notice when the defendant himself requested an instruction concerning <em>flight, </em>the very portion of the statute which he claims on appeal should not have been charged. The record simply does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that his due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The defendant concedes, indeed argues forcefully in his brief, which was filed before our decision in <em>Franko, </em>that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>that it was reasonably possible that the jury could have convicted him of felony murder under the <em>flight </em>theory of liability as well as the theory charged in the indictment. We agree. Therefore, as we held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra, 493, \u201cthe error of which the defendant complains is tantamount to a variance between the pleadings and the proof. In the absence of an exception, when sufficient evidence of the uncharged issue has been presented to justify its submission to the jury, such a variance does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation unless the record establishes a lack of proper notice or prejudice to the defendant. Since the defendant suffered neither lack of notice nor prejudice in preparing his defense, he cannot prevail on this claim of error.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dahlgren, </em>200 Conn. 586, 595, 512 A.2d 906 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The defendant contends that, even if <em>Franko </em>is fatal to his claim that he was unconstitutionally convicted on an uncharged theory of liability, the trial court was without jurisdiction to try him under the flight theory of liability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">At the time the defendant was prosecuted, it was necessary that crimes punishable by death or life imprisonment be charged by indictment. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; General Statutes \u00a7 54-45 (b). Therefore, if causing the death of a nonparticipant \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u201d flight from a robbery is a different crime than causing the death \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u2019 a robbery, the crime for which the defendant was indicted, the trial court would have been precluded from amending the indictment unless the defendant expressly consented. Practice Book \u00a7 624. We have already decided, however, that the language of \u00a7 53a-54c divides the statute not into two crimes, but into two methods of committing the same crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Secore, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The trial court had jurisdiction, therefore, of the offense of felony murder and could amend the indictment if no substantive rights of the defendant were prejudiced. We have already determined both that the expansion of the indictment did not prejudice the defendant\u2019s substantive rights because he had adequate notice of the alternate theory of liability charged by the court and that his ability to present a defense was not impaired. The trial court could, therefore, amend the indictment to conform the pleadings to the proof. <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Moreover, the trial court may amend an indictment, even to the extent of charging a different or additional offense, with the express consent of the defendant. Practice Book \u00a7 624. In this case, the defendant filed a written request that the trial court instruct the jury on the flight theory of liability. The defendant\u2019s request is tantamount to his express consent to amend the indictment and charge on that ground. It seems a bit disingenuous for the defendant to claim the trial court committed error by instructing the jury on <em>flight </em>when he requested an instruction on that very issue. At least, where no constitutional rights are violated, when an accused requests in writing that an issue be submitted to the jury, he cannot, on appeal, claim error in its submission. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 81 n.2, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). Action induced by an appellant cannot ordinarily be a ground of error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 47, 454 A.2d 266 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 769, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>164 Conn. 402, 424, 324 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 861, 94 S. Ct. 77, 38 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in its initial jury charge and a subsequently requested recharge by instructing the jury on three occasions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>it could find the defendant guilty of felony murder if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that he or another participant caused the death of the victim \u201cin the course of <em>or </em>in furtherance of the robbery or of flight therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In order for the defendant to have been convicted of felony murder, it must have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he or another participant in the robbery caused the death of the victim \u201cin the course of <em>and </em>in furtherance of [the robbery] or of flight therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. The language last quoted constitutes but a single element of the crime of felony murder; it does not create alternative theories of criminal liability. It was error therefore for the trial court to charge in the disjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">At the trial, however, the defendant neither requested an instruction on this aspect of the felony murder statute, nor did he take an exception to the misstatements in the court\u2019s charge concerning it. He claims on appeal, however, that the error was of constitutional dimension and requires reversal because it is reasonably possible that the challenged instruction misled the jury and allowed it to convict him without finding all the required elements of felony murder proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). Because the defendant claims that he was deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial, we will review his claim to determine whether it is adequately supported by the record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">There is no question that the trial court\u2019s use of the disjunctive, rather than the conjunctive, in its discussion of the element of felony murder in question, was erroneous. The court, however, correctly instructed the jury concerning the same element on four occasions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>using the conjunctive each time. In its initial instructions to the jury at the close of the evidence the trial court, in both its first and final explanations of the elements of felony murder, tracked the statute correctly using the conjunctive. It did, on one occasion during the course of the initial charge, use the disjunctive. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d on that occasion, however, was followed immediately by, \u201cNow in the course of, well, it has its ordinary meaning, was it during the robbery, was it part of the robbery. <em>And </em>in the furtherance of the robbery, well, that means advancing or promoting an objective, help bring the robbery about.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) While ambiguous, the use of the conjunctive in connecting the definitions of \u201cin the course of\u201d and \u201cin furtherance of\u201d reduced the chance that the jury would misconstrue the preceding use of the disjunctive as creating alternate elements rather than an additional element for the crime of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The day following its initial instructions, the trial court, at the jury\u2019s request, again explained the elements of the crimes involved in the two indictments. During its discussion of felony murder, the court tracked the statute correctly and again used the conjunctive in its first and final explanations of the elements of that crime. It did, however, between those two explanations, use the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d on two occasions when explaining the element in question. On one of those occasions, the disjunctive was followed by the definitions of \u201cin the course of\u201d and \u201cin furtherance of\u201d previously noted wherein the conjunctive was inserted between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We do not examine a challenged portion of a jury instruction in artificial isolation from the overall charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 132, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>195 Conn. 444, 451, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 206, 445 A.2d 314 (1982). \u201cRather, we review the entire charge to determine if, taken as a whole, the charge adequately guided the jury to a correct verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>supra. An error in the charge requires reversal only if, in the context of the whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 268-69, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Keeping in mind the number of correct explanations of the disputed element of felony murder, the ameliorating circumstances surrounding the incorrect references to the disjunctive, the placement of the correct explanation at the beginning and end of both the initial charge and the recharge, and the failure of the defendant to take an exception; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 67; we are satisfied that the jury was adequately instructed on the elements of felony murder. We conclude that in the context of the entire charge there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54c. felony murder.
