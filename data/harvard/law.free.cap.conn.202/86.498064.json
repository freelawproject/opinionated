The applicable statute of limitations for a felony is five years. General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The information alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>that the offense had occurred between April, 1976, and May, 1978. The defendant was arrested pursuant to the warrant on May 25, 1985, five years and nine months after the warrant had been issued and some seven years after the date of the last alleged violation of General Statutes \u00a7 17-83\u00cd. The defendant was arraigned on June 17, 1985, and subsequently filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the trial court lacked jurisdiction of the crime alleged in the information because of the expiration of the five year period of limitation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b). Without hearing evidence, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion on the basis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Cordova, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 377, 448 A.2d 848 (1982),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the defendant appealed from the denial to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">After the defendant had filed her brief, the state filed a motion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal on the ground that the Appellate Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion was not a final judgment. After a hearing, the Appellate Court dismissed the appeal without opinion. We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification limited to the narrow issue of whether the denial of a motion to dismiss grounded on General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b) is an appealable final judgment. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201cIn Connecticut an appeal is purely a statutory privilege accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met. <em>State </em>v. <em>Audet, </em>170 Conn. 337, 341-42, 365 A.2d 1082 (1976); <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>135 Conn. 262, 266, 63 A.2d 589 (1948), aff'd, 337 U.S. 901, 69 S. Ct. 1046, 93 L. Ed. 1715 (1949).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>192 Conn. 85, 87-88, 469 A.2d 1220 (1984). Practice Book \u00a7 4000<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (formerly \u00a7 3000) and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-263<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 51-197a<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provide that a party aggrieved by a decision of the trial court may appeal from the court\u2019s final judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curdo, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). The final judgment in a criminal case is the imposition of sentence. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>195 Conn. 303, 306, 488 A.2d 778 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>194 Conn. 650, 652, 485 A.2d 139 (1984). Since the imposition of sentence has not occurred in this case, the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss cannot be deemed a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>judgment. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>supra, 307. It is appealable, therefore, only if it \u201cfalls within one of the narrowly defined exceptions to the general prohibition against appeals from interlocutory rulings.\u201d Id. \u201cAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The first prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test is obviously not satisfied here. General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b) is not a jurisdictional bar to prosecution, but an affirmative defense which must be proved by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>199 Conn. 631, 640, 508 A.2d 1376 (1986); see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Karlin, </em>785 F.2d 90, 92 (3d Cir. 1986). As a defense, it is inextricably bound up with the question of criminal liability. It is not an issue \u201cseparate and distinct from the guilt determining process\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31; and hence severable from it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>supra, 654. Rather, the defense of the statute of limitations impacts directly on the prosecution of the crime charged. See id., 653. The trial court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, therefore, was \u201cmerely a step along the road to final judgment\u201d; id; and did not constitute a \u201cseparate and distinct proceeding\u201d within the meaning of <em>Curcio. State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>supra, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The defendant, however, claims that her case fits within the second prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test. She contends that \u00a7 54-193 (b) confers upon her a statutory right not to be prosecuted, and that if the criminal proceedings against her are allowed to continue, she will lose that right forever. She argues, therefore, that she has a right not to be tried and that she is entitled to immediate appellate review of the denial of her motion to dismiss. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>As previously noted, \u00a7 54-193 (b) is an affirmative defense, not a jurisdictional bar to prosecution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>supra, 640. An affirmative defense is presented in the orderly course of a criminal trial after the prosecution has presented its case-in-chief. Practice Book \u00a7 874; C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 4, p. 7; C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 3.2. The penal code establishes a number of affirmative defenses,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> none of which shields the defendant from trial. To say that General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b) is an affirmative defense that affords the defendant a right not to be tried is a contradiction in terms. The rules governing the orderly progress of criminal trials would be cast into disarray if an accused were allowed to present a defense prior to the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief and to obtain interlocutory appellate review if it were rejected. The fact that the trial court, in its discretion, entertained the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss prior to trial does not automatically convert an affirmative defense into a right to be free of the trial itself. As an affirmative defense, the statute of limitations provides the defendant with a shield, not against prosecution itself, but against successful prosecution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>supra, 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Further, the rights afforded the defendant, via the remedy of the statute of limitations, were not concluded by the denial of her motion. Those rights, if they exist in this case, are still intact and may be enforced on trial or on appeal from a final judgment. \u201cLimitations statutes ... are intended to foreclose the potential for <em>inaccuracy </em>and <em>unfairness </em>that stale evidence and dull memories may occasion in an unduly delayed trial.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>658 F.2d 113, 127 (3d Cir. 1981). It is not the trial, but the danger to an accused of an unfair conviction because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of delay prior to the initiation of criminal proceedings against which limitations statutes are designed to safeguard. Id. \u201cThe protection afforded against delay <em>before </em>trial is neither undercut nor compounded by the trial itself, and the right is as adequately respected by an acquittal as it would be by a successful pretrial motion.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The rights protected by \u00a7 54-193 (b), if they are available to the defendant, therefore, were not irretrievably lost. Those rights can be vindicated at trial or by an appeal from a final judgment. Unlike a double jeopardy claim, where the right of an accused not to be tried is irretrievably lost if interlocutory appellate review is denied; <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>supra, 91; here, the defendant has no right to avoid trial, and her right to prevent an unfair conviction caused by pretrial delay remains viable. She is not entitled to interlocutory appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The adoption of a rule to the contrary would encourage piecemeal appeals, which are inimical to the effective and fair administration of the criminal law. <em>Cobbledick </em>v. <em>United States, </em>309 U.S. 323, 325-26, 60 S. Ct. 540, 84 L. Ed. 783 (1940); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 30. Such a rule would only increase the delay before trial and exacerbate the very problem of memory loss and stale evidence which statutes of limitation are designed to minimize. As this court previously indicated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 440, 497 A.2d 974 (1985), the denial of a motion to dismiss based upon \u00a7 54-193 (b) grounds is not a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1977)] Sec. 17-83\u00cd. fraud in obtaining aid or receiving payment, larceny penalty, (a) Any sums paid to or on behalf of any person under the provisions of this chapter as a result of any false statement, misrepresentation or concealment of or failure to disclose assets by him, or by any person legally liable for his support, may be recovered in an action brought by the state against such person or persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u201c(b) Any person who, by means of an intentionally false statement or misrepresentation or by impersonation or other fraudulent act or device, obtains, or attempts to obtain, or aids or abets any person to obtain, any monetary award under this chapter to which he is not entitled; and any person who, with intent to defraud, buys or aids or abets in buying or in any way disposing of the property of a person receiving an award, without the consent of the commissioner, and any person who violates the provisions of section 17-82j or any other provision of this chapter shall be subject to the penalties for larceny under sections 53a-122 to 53a-125, inclusive, depending on the amount involved.
