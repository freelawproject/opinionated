On September 8, 1983, at approximately 1:30 a.m., the victim was asleep in her basement apartment on Dell Avenue in New London. She had fallen asleep without turning off the 19 inch television set in the room. She was awakened by someone touching her arm and saw a black man standing over her. He told her to lie still and then he started to remove her underwear. Her assailant was interrupted by a buzzing sound from the television, the screen of which was \u201call white snow.\u201d He then turned the volume down on the television. Although she tried to get up, he held her arm and he told her to get back into bed. During this time she observed his face. After informing her that he knew that her boyfriend, now her husband, was at work and would not be home until later that morning, the assailant forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. Shortly thereafter, the police were contacted and came to the scene, as did some of the victim\u2019s family members. Upon checking her apartment, the victim found that her pocketbook had been taken; among other items in it was her driver\u2019s license. An examination of the apartment disclosed that the assailant had apparently entered through a window where the screen had been broken. The police took the victim to the hospital where certain postrape tests were undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>On the day of this incident, the victim told the police, family members and friends that her assailant was a light skinned black man in his early twenties, that he weighed between 160 and 180 pounds, had a kind of muscular build and possessed a deep voice. She said further that he had a small or short afro, had no facial hair and was wearing a light colored tan tank top and cut-off blue jeans. She also noted an odor about him like aftershave or cologne.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The police had the victim view \u201cmaybe one hundred slides.\u201d Although some of the slides depicted persons with characteristics similar to those of her assailant, she was unable to make a positive identification. Sergeant William C. Gavitt, a New London detective, told the jury that as a result of the investigation of this crime, \u201cone of the Bryants, not specifically Logeno, could be a suspect.\u201d The victim later identified the defendant as her assailant from an array of eight photos, although she told Gavitt at that time that she was not 100 percent certain of her identification. A few days later, Gavitt had the victim come to police headquarters because he had received information that the defendant had an appointment in a nearby building on that day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon her arrival, Gavitt told the victim that he wanted her to take a walk with him to see if she saw anybody she recognized. She did not recognize any black males that they had passed as they walked along the street. She did, however, identify the defendant as her assailant as he exited the lobby of the building, recognizing him by his deep voice and the distinct odor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>of his aftershave. During the trial, she also identified the defendant as her assailant when he was sitting not at the defense table but in the audience among several other black males he had chosen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">At the time of the crimes involved, the Bryant family lived at 57 Henry Street in New London. The family consisted of Audrey Bryant and her three sons, Eugene, the defendant and Timothy. The Bryant residence is between 110 and 130 yards away from the victim\u2019s apartment building on Dell Avenue. In August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>1984, shortly before trial, another tenant at 57 Henry Street found the victim's driver\u2019s license in his garage on the premises. It was turned over to the New London police on August 18, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Those additional circumstances relevant to the defendant\u2019s claims of error will be set out below as they become necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s claims involving his third party culprit defense. At trial, the defendant presented an alibi defense and claimed that his brother, Eugene Bryant, in fact committed the crime with which he was charged. He therefore claims that the trial court erred in denying him the right to call Eugene Bryant to the witness stand and have him invoke his privilege against self-incrimination in the presence of the jury. In making this claim, he acknowledges that he does so against the majority view as set out in the leading case of <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>United States, </em>439 F.2d 536 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 995, 91 S. Ct. 1240, 28 L. Ed. 2d 533 (1971). He also argues that the general rule against prosecutorial use of a privilege-invoking witness against the defendant \u201csimply\u201d does not apply when it is the defendant who wishes to call such a witness. While recognizing that the jury could draw \u201ca variety of . . . inferences\u201d from the alleged third party culprit\u2019s invocation of the privilege, he maintains that, given his constitutional right to call witnesses and present a defense, he had the right to have the jury determine which inference to draw. He is aware that basic to the majority position, as set out in <em>Bowles, </em>is that the defense should not be permitted to do this because such evidence would have a prejudicial impact on the prosecution\u2019s case. He maintains that the probative value of the witness\u2019 invocation outweighs its prejudicial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>Bowles </em>identifies two forms of prejudice: (1) the defense is permitted to use evidence not subject to cross-examination by the state; and (2) the invocation of the privilege would have a \u201cdisproportionate impact\u201d on the jury. <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 541-42. This claimed prejudice, the defendant claims, is \u201cvastly overstated.\u201d In the event that no right of the defendant to require a witness to invoke his self-incrimination privilege in the presence of a jury is found, his alternative position is that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow him to call Eugene to have him answer, in the presence of the jury, those questions that he willingly answered on the voir dire<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> so that the jury could at least observe him.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The rule of <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, rests on the conclusion that to allow the defense to call such a witness permits the party calling the witness to bolster its case out of inferences arising from the use of the privilege. See also <em>Namet </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 179, 180, 83 S. Ct. 1151, 10 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1963). One court put it this way: \u201cNeither side has the right to benefit from any inferences the jury may draw simply from the witness\u2019 assertion of the privilege either alone or in conjunction with questions that have been put to him.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lacouture, </em>495 F.2d 1237, 1240 (5th Cir.), reh. denied, 503 F.2d 568 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1053, 95 S. Ct. 631, 42 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1974); <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 541. \u201cThe rule is grounded not only in the constitutional notion that guilt may not be inferred from the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege but also in the danger that a witness\u2019s invoking the Fifth Amendment in the presence of the jury will have a disproportionate impact on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>their deliberations. ... In reality the probative value of the event [invoking the privilege] is almost entirely undercut by the absence of any requirement that the witness justify<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> his fear of incrimination and by the fact that it is a form of evidence not subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 541-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We do not agree with the defendant in this case that the prejudice claimed by permitting a witness to be called by the defendant to invoke the fifth amendment before the jury is \u201cvastly overstated.\u201d Neither side has the right to benefit from inferences capable of being drawn by the jury where the privilege is invoked by the witness. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 909 n.10 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 920, 99 S. Ct. 1244, 59 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1979). Reason and human experience indicate that inferences are certainly suggested by such a tactic; the danger inherent in this circumstance is that the inference or inferences drawn may have little, if any, juristic relation to the issues before the jury. More important, however, is the fact that the inference, whatever it may be, cannot be attacked effectively by cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The defendant counters the state\u2019s argument by claiming in this case the primacy of his sixth amendment rights to bring witnesses before the jury, to present a defense and to compulsory process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>not agree. It is true that \u201c[t]he right to offer the testimony of witnesses . . . is in plain terms the right to present a defense, [and] the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts . . . <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967). While this sixth amendment right is binding upon the state through the fourteenth amendment, it is also established that \u201cthe right to confront and to cross-examine [witnesses] is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 295, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination is one of those interests. See, e.g., <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 320, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>Alford </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 U.S. 687, 694, 51 S. Ct. 218, 75 L. Ed. 624 (1931); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>503 F.2d 598, 600 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1113, 95 S. Ct. 791, 42 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>375 Mass. 211, 214-15, 375 N.E.2d 1221, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 872, 99 S. Ct. 205, 58 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In addition to the reasons set out in <em>Bowles </em>prohibiting the defendant from calling a witness for the sole purpose of having him invoke his privilege against self-incrimination before the jury, the sixth amendment right to call a witness must be considered in the light of its purpose, namely, to produce testimony for the defendant. See <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra. Calling a witness who will refuse to testify does not satisfy that purpose. The defendant had the right to elicit only <em>nonprivileged </em>tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>timony from Eugene. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arnott, </em>704 F.2d 322, 325 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 948, 104 S. Ct. 364, 78 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">While we can imagine a case in which a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to call witnesses on his behalf might arguably require that a witness who refuses to testify be called, this is not such a case. The evidence that was before the jury at the time the defendant attempted to call Eugene strongly suggested the applicability of the <em>Bowles </em>rationale. Despite the defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, a careful review of the transcript discloses that at the time the defendant sought to call Eugene to the witness stand for the purpose of having him invoke his privilege the jury had before it little evidence implicating Eugene as the third party culprit. The jury had heard Gavitt testify that as a result of the investigation, \u201cone of the Bryants, not specifically Logeno, could be a suspect.\u201d The jury also had heard Roy L. McDaniel, the F.B.I. fingerprint expert, testify that the New London police had furnished him with certain latent prints from the scene of the crime as well as known prints of both the defendant and Eugene. His comparison, he said, disclosed that none of these latent prints were those of the defendant or Eugene. While there had been evidence that the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license was found in a garage where the Bryants lived, it had not been tied specifically to Eugene. The evidence which tended to implicate Eugene in the Dell Avenue incident, including his \u201cinculpatory\u201d statement to Audrey Bryant, his absence from his home at or about the time of the crimes charged against the defendant and his possession of the victim\u2019s purse in the presence of witnesses later offered by the defendant, which was excluded in large measure by the trial court, was offered <em>after </em>the defendant\u2019s attempt to have Eugene testify before the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The trial court, therefore, did not err in refusing to allow the defendant to call Eugene simply to have him invoke his fifth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The trial court did, however, commit harmful error in refusing to permit the defendant to have Eugene testify before the jury to answer those questions that he willingly answered on the voir dire without any invocation of the privilege.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After the court had refused to permit the defendant to call Eugene for the purpose of having him invoke the privilege in the presence of the jury, the defendant sought to call him to testify as to those questions that he willingly had answered on the voir dire. The state objected, claiming that the evidence was irrelevant. The court sustained the objection but pointed out that the defendant could, if he wished, recall Eugene if relevancy were to be established thereafter. The defendant argued that relevancy already had been demonstrated. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\u201c \u2018No precise and universal test of relevancy is furnished by the law, and the question must be determined in each case according to the teachings of reason and judicial experience. <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 589, 591, 363 A.2d 1090 [1975]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Towles, </em>155 Conn. 516, 523, 235 A.2d 639 [1967].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Runkles, </em>174 Conn. 405, 413, 389 A.2d 730, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 859, 99 S. Ct. 177, 58 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1978). We have noted that \u2018 \u201c[e]vidence is admissible when it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. One fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>nection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable. Unless excluded by some rule or principle of law, any fact may be proved which logically tends to aid the trier in the determination of the issue. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Towles, </em>[supra]; <em>Pope Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>106 Conn. 423, 435, 138 A. 444 [1927].\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 674-75, 372 A.2d 82 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 645-46, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Although a court has wide discretion in its rulings on the relevancy of evidence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 659, 491 A.2d 345 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeForge, </em>194 Conn. 392, 396, 480 A.2d 547 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Runkles, </em>supra; \u201c \u2018 \u201c[i]t is always competent for a [defendant] to [present] evidence tending to show that another committed the crime [with] which he is charged . . . . \u201d\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>166 Conn. 593, 601, 353 A.2d 756 (1974).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 646. The trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the questions which Eugene had voluntarily answered on the voir dire without invoking his privilege were irrelevant. That evidence was clearly relevant. Significantly, Eugene\u2019s self-description was consistent with that given by the victim and several state witnesses to whom she had described her assailant. He knew where the victim\u2019s home was located and at the time of the crimes, both the defendant and Eugene lived at 57 Henry Street, the same address where the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license was later found. Additionally, he was one of the two Bryant brothers who Gavitt had said were suspects during the police investigation. His appearance before the jury would have given the jurors the opportunity to evaluate that answer as well as to observe him and determine whether the victim may have mistakenly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>identified<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the defendant as the actual culprit. The exclusion of this evidence was erroneous. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Runkles, </em>supra. Given the significance of the identity of the actual assailant, we conclude that, under the circumstances, the exclusion of the proffered testimony was also harmful; a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to call five witnesses who could testify to declarations against penal interest by Eugene Bryant that were exculpatory to the defendant and inculpatory to Eugene. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">To analyze this claim of error, certain additional background circumstances should be set out. In moving for the admissibility of this testimony, the defendant made a long offer of proof in the absence of the jury, at which time the five witnesses testified. This hearing took place after the trial court had refused to permit Eugene to testify before the jury and after Joanne Mounts and her husband, Donald, had testified before the jury. The Mounts lived at 43 Henry Street in New London and were friends of the Bryant family. On the night of September 7, 1983, they both attended a get-together at the Bryants\u2019 home because it was Audrey\u2019s birthday. Joanne Mounts testified that she had arrived there about 6:30 p.m. that evening and stayed until she and her husband left<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> between 1:30 and 1:45 a.m. on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>morning of September 8, 1983. She also said that the defendant had been there all the time and that she had never seen him leave the house. She said that she did not see Eugene \u201call evening\u201d and that she did see a young man named \u201cEddie\u201d there but was not sure if he was there when she left. Donald Mounts said that he saw the defendant there and never saw him leave the house. He did see the defendant go into an adjoining bedroom and saw him for the last time \u201cprobably around 12:30 [a.m.].\u201d In addition, he saw \u201cShawn\u201d and a young woman named \u201cSheri,\u201d but recalled nobody else being there.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Thereafter,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a hearing was held in the absence of the jury at which the following witnesses testified: New London detective Terry K. Brown, the defendant, Audrey Bryant, Shawn Guess and Keith Perry. Brown testified that in approximately May, 1984, after the crime and before the trial, Eugene approached him, and after being advised of his constitutional rights, told Brown that he had burglarized the apartment on Dell Avenue and had taken the woman\u2019s pocketbook. He did not, however, indicate that he had assaulted her. The defendant testified that in the early morning of September 8, 1983, he was in his room accompanied by Shawn Guess and Eddie Johnson<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> when Eugene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>arrived carrying a purse. At that time, Eugene went through the purse, and the defendant saw the driver\u2019s license. In addition, Eugene told them that he had just broken into a house on Dell Avenue, that the woman \u201cwas laying there [and that he] could have raped her.\u201d The defendant testified that Eugene made this statement \u201cmore than five times.\u201d Guess said that he was at the Bryant home on the night of Audrey\u2019s birthday party and that he saw Eugene with a pocketbook. Guess also said that Eugene had just come from an apartment down the street where he had taken the pocketbook. Perry, who knew both Eugene and the defendant, indicated that more or less toward the end of the summer in 1983 Eugene asked him if he wanted to break into an apartment on Dell Avenue. Eugene, however, did not subsequently say anything to Perry about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Audrey Bryant said that on the night the defendant was arrested, her son Eugene told her that the defendant did not go into the Dell Avenue house but that he had done so. He told her that he went in through the window and took the woman\u2019s purse but that \u201che never touched her.\u201d She testified that he also said that \u201che would tell the truth when the time came.\u201d She went on, however, to say that since the trial \u201c[had] been going on,\u201d Eugene said that he would not tell the truth. He also said, she related, that he would lie in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">It is with this background that the defendant claims the trial court committed reversible error both as a matter of evidentiary law and as a deprivation of his federal and state constitutional rights to present a defense including a third party culprit defense. Citing <em>Chambers </em>v. Mississippi, supra, he argues initially that exclusion of this evidence contravened the exception to the hearsay rule that we adopted in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 450, 426 A.2d 799 (1980), which provides for the admissibility of trustworthy declarations against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>penal interest where the declarant is unavailable. The state counters, arguing that the trial court correctly-determined that the testimony of the defendant\u2019s witnesses did not establish the threshold showing of trustworthiness, a prerequisite to admissibility. In claiming that this ruling was correct, the state refers to the testimony of the five witnesses, pointing out such things as \u201clikely\u201d fabrication, lack of corroboration, the fact that the witnesses are close acquaintances of the defendant, serious credibility problems and the timing of the declarations. It also argues that the conflicting testimony of these witnesses, as well as the \u201cselective\u201d declarations of Eugene, where he allegedly only admitted the burglary of the apartment on Dell Avenue but not the sexual assault on the victim, obviously concerned the trial court. We agree with the defendant that it was error not to have admitted the evidence proffered as declarations against Eugene\u2019s penal interest under <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 450-51, we adopted a rule, consistent with <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, and in accord with rule 804 (b) (3)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides that trustworthy third party statements against penal interest which are exculpatory to the defendant are admissible if the declarant is unavailable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 630; \u201cA statement exculpatory to a defendant is one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>either exonerates or which might reduce the degree of punishment to which the defendant might be exposed even if the remark does not completely exonerate the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 630 n.5. In this case, the excluded evidence clearly was exculpatory to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Our rule requires, as does the federal rule, that the trustworthiness of such proffered statements be examined carefully. Id., 630. Rule 804 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence \u201crequires that \u2018corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement\u2019 before the statement is admissible to exculpate the accused.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 630-31. In determining whether \u201cthe threshold level of trustworthiness [is] satisfied\u201d; id., 630; the trial court does not have to find it to be \u201cabsolutely trustworthy\u201d because if this were so, \u201cthe province of the jury as the finder of fact and weigher of credibility would be entirely invaded.\u201d Id., 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\u201cCourts have extracted from <em>Chambers </em>four general considerations relevant to an investigation of the trustworthiness of a third party confession: \u2018(1) the time of the declaration and the party to whom the declaration was made; (2) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case; (3) the extent to which the declaration is really against the declarant\u2019s penal interest; [and] (4) the availability of the declarant as a witness.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guillette, </em>547 F.2d 743, 754 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 839, 98 S.

App. 3d 292, 294, 383 N.E.2d 788 (1978). We have recognized that while there can be \u2018no precise formulation of the proof which would con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>stitute sufficient evidence of the trustworthiness of a third party declaration against penal interest, the considerations derived from <em>Chambers </em>indicate the nature of the appropriate inquiry for a trial court faced with the proffer of such a declaration.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 451.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>182 Conn. 476, 479-80, 438 A.2d 735 (1980). No single factor for determining trustworthiness, however, is \u201cnecessarily conclusive.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 454 n.ll; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 633-34. The determination whether a third party declaration against penal interest is trustworthy lies in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 452, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">It is necessary to the use of the penal interest exception that the declarant be unavailable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>194 Conn. 623, 630, 484 A.2d 448 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 480-81; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 630; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 440-42. As in <em>Frye, </em>we employ the definition set out in rule 804 (a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence in determining the availability of the declarant as a witness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 481-82. It needs no elaboration to conclude that Eugene was \u201cunavailable\u201d under rule 804 (a) (1) which defines \u201cunavailability as a witness\u201d to include situations where the declarant \u201cis exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of his statement.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>415 A.2d 553, 559 (Me. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Next, we must determine the extent to which the proffered declarations<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> are really against the penal interest of the declarant. Preliminarily, we note one argument advanced by the state against this claim. The trial court held, and the state on appeal argued that, given the charges against the defendant of burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and sexual assault, Eugene\u2019s \u201cadmission\u201d of the burglary alone is a \u201ckind of selective declaration against penal interest . . . [that] casts doubt upon the offense [of sexual assault] as to which there is no admission against penal interest.\u201d This \u201cselective declaration\u201d view undoubtedly concerned the court in its ruling. It should not have in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 642, we stated that \u201c[w]e are persuaded of the logic and soundness of [federal rule 804 (b) (3)] and the trend to reject a narrow and inflexible definition of a statement against penal interest in favor of a definition which includes not only confessions, but other remarks which would tend to incriminate the declarant were he or she the individual charged with the crime.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 451. The \u201cagainst interest\u201d exception is not limited to a defendant\u2019s direct confession of guilt. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>584 F.2d 694, 699-700 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>539 F.2d 244, 251 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keizer, </em>377 Mass. 264, 270, 385 N.E.2d 1001 (1979). It applies as well to statements that \u201ctend\u201d to subject the speaker to criminal liability. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palumbo, </em>639 F.2d 123, 127-28 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 819, 102 S. Ct. 100, 70 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>supra, 700. The rule \u201cencompasses disserving statements by a declarant that would have probative value in a trial against the declarant.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>571 F.2d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 1978). Considered in context, the term \u201ctend\u201d in rule 804 (b) (3) reaches in a proper case as \u201cagainst interest\u201d remarks that strengthen the impression that the declarant had an insider\u2019s knowledge of the crimes. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palumbo, </em>supra, 132; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 252. This is quite compatible with McCormick\u2019s statement: \u201cAs to what is against penal interest, quite obviously the essential characteristic is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the exposure to risk of punishment for a crime.\u201d C. McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed. 1978 Sup.) \u00a7 278, p. 83; see <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra. 447 n.6. Moreover, \u201cit is not the fact that the declaration is against interest but the awareness of that fact by the declarant which gives the statement significance.\u201d B. Jefferson, \u201cDeclarations against Interest: An Exception to the Hearsay Rule,\u201d 58 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 17 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In this case, there were at least four direct statements by Eugene that he had committed the burglary with which the defendant had been charged. These were \u201cin a very real sense self-incriminatory and unquestionably against interest.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 301. Although there was no direct statement, let alone a direct confession, to the sexual assault charge, the context in which he had made the statements concerning the burglary, as disclosed by the voir dire, fairly viewed, indicates that he had an insider\u2019s knowledge of the crimes and implied his personal participation. The victim had already testified that her assailant had taken her pocketbook <em>after </em>he had assaulted her sexually, that both the burglary and sexual assault had been committed by the same man and that only <em>one </em>person had been present in her apartment when these crimes were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In vacuo, one might contend that Eugene\u2019s silence as to the latter charge after direct admissions to the former has self-interest connotations and thus any statement short of a complete confession to both crimes should not be admitted into evidence. Any such claim, however, lacks merit in this case. We are aware that the dilemma posed by statements that contain components that are both disserving, \u201cagainst interest,\u201d and self-serving to the declarant has not always been resolved in the same manner.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Our view is that where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the disserving parts of a statement are intertwined with self-serving parts, it is more prudential to admit the entire statement and let the trier of fact assess its evidentiary quality in the complete context. See 2 F. Wharton, Criminal Evidence (14th Ed. 1986) \u00a7 295. There are cases, and this is one, where allowing such latitude to contextual statements may give real meaning to the declaration that is disserving. In any event, Eugene\u2019s declaration included an admission that he had been in the victim\u2019s apartment when she was in bed and that he had the opportunity to rape her. These statements were consistent with other excluded evidence that he was away from his home at the time of the offense. The argument that his direct confessions to the burglary and his neutrality as to the sexual assault suggest an improper motive to involve himself just enough to help the defendant but not enough to inculpate himself on the sexual assault, under the circumstances of this case, is no bar to admissibility. The claim that the declarations were selective bears on the appropriate weight to be given the evidence and not its admissibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>140 N. J. Super. 232, 356 A.2d 26 (1976), aff\u2019d, 72 N.J. 342, 370 A.2d 852 (1977); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1974) \u00a7 1464, p. 338 and n.3. The declarations of Eugene Bryant were against his penal interest. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 641; C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 278, p. 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The next of the four considerations from <em>Chambers </em>for determining trustworthiness is the time of the declaration and the party to whom the declaration was made. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 633. The statement to Guess was claimed to have been made in the early morning hours of September 8,1983, within an hour or two after the burglary of the apartment on Dell Avenue after Eugene had returned to his home with the stolen pocketbook which contained, inter alia, the victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license. The statement to his mother was made on the very day that the defendant was arrested for the crimes charged. His oral declaration to Brown was made both in the courthouse and in the police station in May, 1984, on the day of a court hearing involving this case and after the police had advised him of his constitutional rights. Eugene\u2019s statement to Perry soliciting Perry\u2019s willingness to join him in a possible break-in of the victim\u2019s apartment on Dell Avenue was made in the summer of <em>1983just preceding </em>the actual burglary of that apartment. With reference to the timing of the statement to Perry, the fact that the statement was made prior in time to the incident involved tends to show that the declarant \u201chad no probable motive to falsify or misstate the fact declared, which is generally shown by proof that it was made ante litem motam [before the controversy].\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>34 Utah 171, 175, 96 P. 1087 (1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The statements made by Eugene to each of these five persons are temporally significant. On each occasion, they appear to be spontaneous and unsolicited. At the time he made the statements to his mother, the defendant, Guess and Brown, he stood to gain nothing and he must have been aware that such disclosure might lead to criminal prosecution against him. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra. His earlier importuning of Perry, evidencing his predisposition to commit the crime, is also not without significance, given the actual burglary of the apartment on Dell Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>We recognize that the focus on time appears to arise from the belief that declarations made soon after the crime suggest more reliability than those made after a lapse of time where a declarant has a more ample opportunity for reflection and contrivance. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guillette, </em>547 F.2d 743 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 839, 98 S. Ct. 132, 54 L. Ed. 2d 102 (1977) (declaration made four months later too attenuated and remote to assure reliability). In <em>Chambers, </em>assurances of reliability were found in the circumstance that the defendant\u2019s confessions were made \u201cspontaneously to a close acquaintance shortly after the [crime] had occurred.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 300. In this case, unlike many others, in which such a declaration was made only to one other person, the defendant offered, the state opposed and the trial court relied on the excluded evidence as a whole\u2014evidence which identified a time continuum from a time apparently shortly before the crime involved to the night of the crime on September 8,1983, to the date of the defendant\u2019s arrest on October 14,1983, and to the May, 1984 date of the defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing. It is appropriate that we do the same. In context, this time span does not attenuate the temporal aspect of our inquiry into trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The persons to whom Eugene made the statements also serve to contribute to their reliability. \u201cAcknowledgement of criminal activity is generally made only to confidants or to persons in whom the declarant imposes trust.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goins, </em>593 F.2d 88, 91 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 827, 100 S. Ct. 52, 62 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1979); see <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 634; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 453. It is fair to say that Eugene\u2019s mother, the defendant, Guess and Perry come within this category. As to his statement to Brown, one recalls the statement of Chief Justice Warren Burger in <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 583, 91 S. Ct. 2075, 29 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1971): \u201cPeople do not lightly admit a crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their own admissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Our inquiry concerning trustworthiness next requires that we determine whether there existed \u201c \u2018corroborating circumstances [which] clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 452 n.8, quoting Fed. R. Evid. 804 (b) (3); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 637. Federal and state courts have recognized that the requisite of rule 804 (b) (3) that \u201ccorroborating circumstances clearly indicate . . . trustworthiness . . . .\u201d was so promulgated because \u201c\u2018statements of this type tending to exculpate the accused are more suspect and so should have their admissibility conditioned upon some further provisions insuring trustworthiness.\u2019 House Committee on the Judiciary, Proposed Federal Rules of Procedure, H.R. Doc. 650, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 15-16 (1973).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>415 A.2d 553, 560 (Me. 1980); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zirpolo, </em>704 F.2d 23, 26 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 822, 104 S. Ct. 87, 78 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 253. This \u201c \u2018requirement of corroboration [in rule 804 (b) (3)] should be construed in such a manner [so] as to effectuate its purpose of circumventing fabrication.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>688 F.2d 224, 233 (4th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1103, 103 S. Ct. 726, 74 L. Ed. 2d 951 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; see generally 4 J. Weinstein, Evidence (1985) pp. 804-123 through 804-157. Courts have therefore construed the corroboration requirement as \u201csignificant\u201d and one that \u201cgoes beyond minimal corroboration.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zirpolo, </em>supra, 25; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>573 F.2d 1111, 1115 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Laumer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 A.2d 190, 200 (D.C. 1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barden, </em>432 A.2d 404, 409 (Me.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1088, 102 S. Ct. 648, 70 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>It is evident that there was significant evidence of the corroborative quality required. Shortly after the crime, at the time of Eugene\u2019s declaration to the defendant and Guess, each of those witnesses saw the victim\u2019s stolen pocketbook. The victim\u2019s driver\u2019s license, which she reported was in her stolen pocketbook, was also observed at that time. That license was later found in a garage on the premises where the Bryants resided. Eugene, who met the general description of the assailant, admittedly knew where her apartment was located. Testimony from witnesses not only put the defendant in his home at about the reported time of the crimes but also indicated that Eugene was not there at this time. Significantly, the latter\u2019s declaration to his mother included the actual means of entry into the victim\u2019s apartment by way of the window. His statement to Brown, directly admitting the break-in, furnished additional corroboration. In addition, his statements to his mother during the trial, contrary to his earlier admissions to her, that he would lie in court if called to testify strengthened the quality of the corroborative evidence adduced. This latter posture tends to confirm the defendant\u2019s claim that if Eugene would say this, then logically, he had something relevant to lie about. Moreover, the number of independent declarations provides additional corroboration for each.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In sum, the excluded evidence was clearly trustworthy under the relevant criteria. It has been said that \u201cthe ultimate question [under rule 804 (b) (3) is] whether \u2018a reasonable man in [the declarant\u2019s] position would not have made the statements] unless he believed [them] to be true.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goins, </em>supra; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brainard, </em>690 F.2d 1117, 1124 (4th Cir. 1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>supra, 232-33; <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Gold, </em>supra, 642, 643. Rule 804 (b) (3) \u201creflects [an] attempt to strike a fair balance between the exclusion of trustworthy evidence . . . and indiscriminate admission of less trustworthy evidence which, because of lack of opportunity for cross-examination and the [unavailability] of the declarant, is open to easy fabrication.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 631; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 440. The trial court erred in excluding the proffered evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 640; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Sorbo, </em>174 Conn. 253, 257, 386 A.2d 221 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">With reference to other matters that may recur at the new trial, we will address the defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of his constitutional rights to due process, a fair trial and to present a defense by the state\u2019s \u201crepeated attempts\u201d to impeach his alibi witnesses by \u201cmultiple references\u201d to the claimed pretrial silence of those witnesses. We address this claim for the purpose of laying down certain guidelines for trial courts and counsel to be applied in future criminal trials, including the new trial we have ordered in this case. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>50 N.Y.2d 311, 406 N.E.2d 771, 428 N.Y.S.2d 914 (1980). A criminal defendant can adduce evidence at his trial in support of an alibi. \u201cAlthough an alibi is sometimes spoken of as a defense, it operates, in this state, to entitle an accused to an acquittal when he has so far proved the alibi that a reasonable doubt of his guilt is raised upon all the evidence.\u2019-\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>155 Conn. 122, 123, 230 A.2d 18 (1967); see <em>State </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>191 Conn. 564, 584, 469 A.2d 397 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>178 Conn. 704, 708 n.2, 425 A.2d 108 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">For his claim of alibi, the defendant presented five witnesses: the defendant,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> his mother, Joanne Mounts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>her husband Donald, and Shawn Guess. None of these witnesses approached the police to inform them, as the state\u2019s cross-examination of four of them repeatedly suggested each should have, that the defendant was at home at the approximate time of the charged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Initially, it would seem that our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghere, </em>201 Conn. 289, 513 A.2d 1226 (1986), would summarily dispose of this claim in favor of the state. The issue in <em>Ghere, </em>however, was \u201crelatively narrow: whether the failure of the witnesses to approach the police with their alibi story was relevant on the issue of credibility or, more specifically, the issue of fabrication.\u201d Id., 303-304. In that case, we pointed out that \u201c[although we do not believe that an alibi witness has a duty to report an alibi story to the police or, for that matter, to any other person, a witness in many instances naturally may be expected to convey such information, especially when the witness is friendly with the accused. Failure of the witness to do so would, under these circumstances, constitute grounds for impeachment.\u201d Id., 304; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>supra, 322. We went on to say that the alibi witnesses there \u201cwere shown to be friends or acquaintances of the defendant and it would only have been natural for them to exculpate the defendant of any wrongdoing by approaching the police\u201d and, therefore, the trial court correctly allowed the state to impeach them by questioning their failure to relate their stories to the police. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghere, </em>supra, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The defendant does not attack our holding in <em>Ghere. </em>Recognizing that it is permissible to cross-examine family members and friends for impeachment purposes, he argues before us that his claim was left open in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>footnote in <em>Ghere </em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant\u2019s claim, which was not decided in <em>Ghere, </em>is whether the impeachment of his alibi witnesses, because of their \u201csilence\u201d up to trial, violated his sixth amendment right to present a defense. Id., 301 n.9. Referring to <em>People </em>v. <em>Maschi, </em>76 App. Div. 2d 808, 429 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1980), he argues that the manner in which the state was permitted to impeach his alibi witnesses violated his constitutional right to due process. His claim includes the assertion that no proper foundation was laid for the impeachment. He argues that the state should have had to establish such facts as whether the alibi witnesses knew that they had information that was exculpatory to the defendant. In this case, he also contends that the state insisted on yes or no answers to questions that merited elaboration. He also points out that although he had filed his notice of alibi witnesses in court nearly eight weeks prior to the trial, the state never approached any of the alibi witnesses before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The defendant\u2019s \u201cright to present his own witnesses to establish a defense . . . is a fundamental element of due process of law.\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 660, 453 A.2d 427 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 83, 355 A.2d 6 (1974). This includes the right to present alibi witnesses, but there are few, if any, per se prohibitions on questioning such a witness. It can fairly be said that an alibi witness, like any other witness, may be cross-examined with a view to demonstrating the improbability or even fabrication of his testimony. Where, however, such a witness is cast in the posture of having been silent as to claimed exculpatory testimony and is not given a real opportunity to explain that silence, some courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>suggested salutary responses in an effort to insure basic fairness. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. 288, 416 N.E.2d 218 (1981); <em>People </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Some courts have, therefore, required that the state lay a \u201cproper foundation\u201d for this type of cross-examination. In <em>Dawson, </em>the court said: \u201cIn most cases, the District Attorney may lay a \u2018proper foundation\u2019 for this type of cross-examination by first demonstrating that the witness was aware of the nature of the charges pending against the defendant, had reason to recognize that he possessed exculpatory information, had a reasonable motive for acting to exonerate the defendant and, finally, was familiar with the means to make such information available to law enforcement authorities.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>supra, 321 n.4; see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra. A \u201cproper foundation\u201d may better aid the trier of fact in determining whether the testimony of such a defense witness \u201cis an accurate reflection of the truth or is, instead, a \u2018recent fabrication.\u2019 \u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>supra, 321. Common sense and human experience may indicate, in a given case, that there may be explanations for a witness\u2019 pretrial silence that are entirely consistent with that witness\u2019 posture at trial. As <em>Dawson </em>points out, some persons \u201cmay routinely avoid contact with law enforcement authorities out of an ingrained sense of fear or mistrust of officialdom. . . . Others may refrain from volunteering information to the police or [prosecuting attorney] because they believe that their efforts to exonerate the suspect would be futile . . . [and] some may remain silent because they were explicitly instructed to do so by the defendant\u2019s attorney.\u201d Id., 321-22. These examples are, however, hardly exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">It may be prudential for the trial court to have a bench conference to ascertain \u201cwhether [a] witness refrained from speaking under the advice of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>counsel, for in such a case examination on the issue of the witness\u2019 postconsultation silence would be improper and could well result in a mistrial.\u201d Id., 323. In a given case, other circumstances might properly suggest a bench conference, initiated by either counsel or the trial court. Consistent with a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the prosecution, in accord with the high standards of that office, must act in good faith in cross-examining such a defense witness about his prior failure to have come forward. Whether the interests of justice reasonably suggest a curative instruction or an instruction at the end of all the evidence must await each particular case. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>supra, 322-23; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>104 App. Div. 2d 383, 384, 478 N.Y.S.2d 711 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We have discussed this issue with the view toward anticipating a smoother presentation of this issue at the new trial. In the context of this case, had the trial court and the state been alerted more distinctly, specifically by an exception or exceptions, to matters now urged upon us on this issue, the state\u2019s presentation might well have taken a somewhat different course.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The remaining claims of error need not be discussed as they should not recur.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 provides in part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of burglary in the second degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a dwelling at night with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b689-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 provides in part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree when he restrains another person under circumstances which expose the latter to a substantial risk of physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\"> At a prior hearing held in the absence of the jury, Gavitt had testified that he had learned from Elizabeth Schafer, the defendant\u2019s probation officer, that the defendant had an appointment with her at her office in downtown New London. It was arranged that, upon the completion of that appointment, the probation officer would proceed downstairs in her office building to the lobby with the defendant. Schafer and the defendant, who was with another black man, came down into the lobby. The defendant was speaking at the time the victim recognized him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion seeking a lineup in anticipation of the probability that the victim would be asked to identify her assailant in court. During argument on this motion, the defense asked that the lineup requested be conducted outside the presence of the jury. The court denied that request. Defense counsel then asked the court to permit a lineup in the presence of the jury or as a \u201clast alternative . . . other than a lineup,\u201d he asked that the identification process be conducted with \u201cthe defendant [being] allowed to be seated away from [the counsel] table with individuals of similar characteristics.\u201d The court granted this request. The court permitted the defendant to select \u201c[n]o more than four\u201d individuals and permitted him to have his brother Eugene in that group. Defense counsel informed the court that Eugene was not present but that he would immediately attempt to subpoena him to obtain his presence for the proposed in-court identification procedure. A recess was taken to permit the defendant to procure those he wished to sit with him during this procedure. When court reconvened, the state, in the presence of the jury, called the victim as its first witness. During its direct examination, she was shown an array from which she had selected the defendant\u2019s photo. She identified the photo of the defendant which she had previously selected from that array. After the state further examined the victim, the state then asked her if she saw her assailant in the courtroom. Thereupon, defense counsel asked that the jury be excused and the trial court so ordered. In its absence, counsel objected to the photo array arguing, inter alia, that the proposed in-court identification would be \u201cunduly suggestive and unreliable\u201d because the victim had had the \u201copportunity while on the witness stand to just view the photo display approximately fifteen minutes ago.\u201d The court overruled the objection. The jury returned and the victim was escorted around the courtroom. When she returned to the witness stand, the state asked her, \u201cbased solely on [her] recollection of the events that occurred on September 8, 1983,\u201d if she could identify her assailant. The victim then identified the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">We note that the transcript of the trial does not expressly indicate whether Eugene Bryant was in the courtroom at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b694-5\"> After the state had rested, the defendant indicated to the trial court that he intended to call Eugene to the witness stand, although he had good reason to believe that Eugene would invoke his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Arguing that the jury had heard about him in the state's case, he wanted the jury to \u201cat least see [Eugene],\u201d saying that that did not come under his fifth amendment right and that he \u201cwant[ed the jury] to have the opportunity to view Eugene Bryant as far as similarities.\u201d The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objections to these proposals. Immediately thereafter, Eugene, who had the services of an assistant public defender who was present, testified on the voir dire in the absence of the jury. Although he invoked his fifth amendment privilege on at least nine questions, he did answer the following questions placed by defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\u201cQ. Mr. Bryant, can you tell us if you are related to Logeno Bryant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u201cA. No\u2014oh, my brother, yes.

I don\u2019t know\u2014I don\u2019t think I know him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">The trial court then stated that it would allow Eugene to answer, in the presence of the jury, those questions to which he did not invoke his fifth amendment privilege. The state objected to this on the ground of relevancy. The defendant claimed it was \u201cvery relevant\u201d to let him answer these questions. The court sustained the state\u2019s objection. At that point in the trial, the defendant had not yet made his claim on the issue of Eugene\u2019s declarations against penal interest which, as indicated below, adduced additional evidence of his alleged involvement in the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\"> We believe this to be correct, keeping in mind that it is the duty of the judge, and not the witness or counsel, to determine whether a witness can properly assert the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United, States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951). Despite this obligation of the judge, there are limitations, both prudential and practical, beyond which we realize that a judge in a given case may not go if for no other reason than that the privilege is to be accorded liberal construction in favor of the right it is intended to secure. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\"> While the defendant suggests that the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue violated his state, as well as his federal, constitutional rights, we need not address the claim under our state constitution for the reasons cited in <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 45 n.7, 519 A.2d 1175 (1986).

We do not agree. This argument appears to contend that a criminal defendant\u2019s right to introduce evidence that a person other than himself committed the crime; see <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.

Ed. 2d 297 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 646, 431 A.2d 501 (1980); is diminished, if not eliminated, where the state\u2019s case has adduced strong identification evidence. This simply is not so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\"> Donald Mounts testified that he was at the Bryants\u2019 house until \u201c[n]o later than 1:30 [a.m. on September 8, 1973].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\"> Just prior to this hearing and after the Mounts\u2019 testimony, the defendant again attempted to have Eugene testify before the jury. He sought his testimony not only on his penal interest claim but, barring that, he again asked the trial court to permit at least his testimony before the jury on those questions to which earlier he had not invoked his privilege against' self-incrimination. On the voir dire at that time, the defendant asked questions on this penal interest claim for which Eugene did claim the privilege. The defendant then renewed his claim that Eugene be permitted to answer, before the jury, those questions to which he had not earlier claimed the privilege. The trial court then noted that it would withhold its ruling until after the defendant\u2019s offer of proof on the declarations against penal interest and its ruling on that offer. The trial court did not, thereafter, permit Eugene to testify or appear before the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\"> He also said that Eddie Johnson was there when Eugene came in with the purse but that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say [Eddie Johnson] was in the [defendant\u2019s] room\u201d when he actually made the inculpatory statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\"> Because we dispose of this claim on evidentiary grounds, we need not address this claim on federal or state constitutional grounds.
