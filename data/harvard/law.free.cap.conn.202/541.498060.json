J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Y\">The issue in this appeal is whether the 1985 reform of the procedures governing investigatory grand juries terminated the authority of grand juries that had been duly constituted before the effective date of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611. Because the continuing validity of a number of preexisting grand juries is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>affected by our resolution of this issue, this is an unusual case demanding expedited resolution. Accordingly, on January 27,1987, we announced our decision that Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611, as clarified by Public Acts 1986, No. 86-317, did not revoke the authority of or alter the procedures governing investigatory grand juries that had been properly authorized before October 1, 1985. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 189, 520 A.2d 207 (1987). We indicated then that a full opinion would follow in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">This case arises out of an information, dated December 12,1985, charging the defendant, George Blasko, with two counts of sale of cocaine, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 19-480 (a) (now \u00a7 21a-277 [a]), and two counts of sale of marihuana, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 19-480 (b) (now \u00a7 21a-277 [b]). The trial court granted, in part, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence arising out of an investigation by a grand jury whose authority allegedly had been revoked by the enactment of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611 (hereinafter P.A. No. 85-611), effective October 1,1985. When the legislature thereafter enacted Public Acts 1986, No. 86-317 (hereinafter P.A. No. 86-317), the state filed a motion to reargue the dismissal, but the trial court, after a hearing, affirmed its earlier ruling in favor of the defendant. On the state\u2019s motion, the trial court dismissed the charges against the defendant with prejudice, and the state has appealed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 49-51, 454 A.2d 266 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The state does not contest the facts that underlie the trial court\u2019s ruling. On October 12, 1984, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-47,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the chief court adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>trator appointed Superior Court Judge Anthony V. DeMayo to investigate professional gambling and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>related criminal activity in Torrington.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After completing part of this inquiry, Judge DeMayo on December 12, 1985, filed with the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford a report entitled \u201cfirst interim report.\u201d That same day, the defendant was arrested on the criminal charges described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">While the grand jury investigation was pending, and prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest, the legislature enacted P.A. No. 85-611, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning The Investigatory Grand Jury System,\u201d which became effective October 1, 1985.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That act repealed General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 54-47, under which grand juror DeMayo had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>been authorized to pursue his inquiry, and instituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>far-reaching procedural reforms of the investigatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>grand jury system.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The new act substituted, as authority for the appointment of a grand jury, the approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of a panel of three Superior Court judges, whereas under the prior law an applicant could obtain the requisite permission from the Superior Court or from the chief court administrator. Under the new act, but not under the old, an applicant requesting the appointment of an investigatory grand jury must demonstrate a reasonable belief that there is probable cause to believe that crimes have been committed. Furthermore, the new act describes in detail the information that must be furnished in the application, including the identity of the applicant and his authority to make the application, the facts and circumstances that justify his reasonable belief that an investigation will lead to a finding of probable cause, and any additional facts and evidence the panel may require to evaluate the application. The act also limits the duration of authorized grand juries to six months, subject to express but limited extension, to avoid the continuation of protracted and indefinite grand jury investigations. The grand jury investigation conducted by Judge DeMayo complied with none of these procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Because of the enactment of P.A. No. 85-611, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>information obtained by the grand jury after October 1, 1985. The trial court relied on the legislative history of the new act, the absence of a grandfather clause that would preserve the authority of preexisting grand juries, and the explicit repeal of \u00a7 54-47, for its conclusion that investigatory grand juries appointed under the prior statute were not authorized to conduct further inquiry after the effective date of the new act. Accordingly, the court ordered the suppression of any information obtained by the grand jury after October 1, 1985, but declined to invalidate the grand jury\u2019s interim report or to dismiss the charges pending against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Subsequent to the trial court\u2019s ruling, the legislature enacted P.A. No. 86-317, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Investigatory Grand Juries,\u201d which became effective as of May 8,1986.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That act provides, in relevant part, that the authority of any investigatory grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>to conduct an inquiry initiated under \u00a7 54-47 \u201cshall continue until the conclusion of the inquiry and [until] a final report has been filed.\" General Statutes \u00a7 54-47\u00cd (a). The act further validates \u201cany action taken\u201d and \u201cany evidence obtained,\" on or after October 1,1985, pursuant to the authority previously conferred upon a grand jury under \u00a7 54-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Armed with this new statute, the state filed a motion to reargue the trial court\u2019s earlier ruling. It maintained that the 1986 statute had clarified the legislature\u2019s original intention, in P.A. No. 85-611, to preserve the validity of grand juries duly constituted under \u00a7 54-47 prior to October 1,1985. The trial court, after a hearing, reaffirmed its prior decision. The court concluded that the retroactive application of P.A. No. 86-317 to its earlier ruling would deprive the defendant of substantive rights conferred upon him by P.A. No. 85-611, in violation of the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In its appeal from that ruling, the state claims that: (1) the legislature\u2019s enactment of P.A. No. 85-611 did not terminate the authority of investigatory grand juries properly appointed under \u00a7 54-47; (2) the legislature\u2019s enactment of P.A. No. 86-317 clarified that it had not intended to terminate the authority of duly constituted grand juries when it enacted P.A. No. 85-611; (3) the defendant has no standing to challenge the admissibility of grand jury evidence at his trial; and (4) the defendant may not rely on the exclusionary rule to challenge the admissibility of evidence at his trial. We will address jointly the state\u2019s first two claims. Because we resolve those claims in favor of the state, we need not consider its remaining two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In determining the effect of P.A. No. 85-611 on the authority of preexisting investigatory grand juries, we are guided by well defined principles of statutory interpretation that require us to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986); <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Silverberg, </em>200 Conn. 367, 370-71, 511 A.2d 336 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05. If the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute because we assume that the language expresses the intention of the legislature. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 316, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986); <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981). When we are faced with ambiguity in a statute, however, we turn for interpretive guidance to its legislative history, the circumstances surrounding its enactment, and the purpose the statute is to serve. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 445, 497 A.2d 974 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The defendant contends that the plain language of P.A. No. 85-611 explicitly evidences the legislature\u2019s intent to revoke, as of October 1, 1985, the authority of investigatory grand juries appointed under \u00a7 54-47. His argument relies exclusively on \u00a7 9 of the act, which provides: \u201cSection 54-47 of the general statute is <em>repealed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In his view, the use of the word \u201crepeal\u201d not only signifies the repeal of \u00a7 54-47 as authority for the impaneling of future grand juries, but also mandates the immediate termination of the authority of preexisting grand juries duly appointed under \u00a7 54-47. To ascribe so definitive a meaning to the term \u201crepeal\u201d is, however, inconsistent with well understood patterns of legislative usage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>We recently noted, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 675, that use of the word \u201crepeal\u201d reflects no more than the characteristic practice of the legislature of \u201ccasting] acts which alter language within existing statutory subsections in the form of repeal and substitution,\u201d and \u201creserving the label of amendment for acts which add entirely new subsections.\u201d Standing by itself, the fact that the legislature \u201crepealed\u201d \u00a7 54-47 does not persuade us that the legislature intended the revocation of the authority of preexisting grand juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">None of the other express terms of P.A. No. 85-611 supports the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute plainly terminates the authority of grand juries duly constituted before October 1,1985. It bears emphasis that the question of the effect of the 1985 enactment is a matter of statutory construction and not of legislative power. The legislature undoubtedly had plenary power to apply the procedural reforms of the 1985 act retroactively. We have frequently recognized \u201cthe right of the legislature retroactively to make legal and regular that which was previously illegal and irregular, provided that vested rights are not unjustly abrogated.\u201d <em>Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>184 Conn. 569, 572, 440 A.2d 220 (1981); <em>C.S.E.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Policy Board, </em>165 Conn. 448, 454-55, 334 A.2d 909 (1973); <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Marion Power Shovel Co., </em>157 Conn. 92, 95-96, 249 A.2d 58 (1968). The problem posed by the 1985 act is that the statute is conspicuously silent about whether the legislature intended to exercise its power to invalidate preexisting grand juries. Confronted with this latent ambiguity, we must look beyond the words of the statute to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 674; <em>Tramontano </em>v. <em>Dilieto, </em>192 Conn. 426, 433-34, 472 A.2d 768 (1984); see 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 46.07, p. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The state urges us to rely on General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (u) in interpreting the scope of the 1985 act. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (u), commonly referred to as the saving clause for newly enacted legislation, provides that \u201c[t]he passage or repeal of an act shall not affect any <em>action </em>then pending.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The state argues that the legislature assumed, because of this statutory saving clause, that it did not need to make explicit its intent that the act would have no impact on pending grand jury investigations. As the defendant correctly points out, however, the statutory saving clause is inapplicable in the present circumstances because the proceedings of an investigatory grand jury do not fall within the definition of an \u201caction\u201d under \u00a7 1-1 (u). This court has defined the term \u201caction\u201d as the lawful demand of one\u2019s right in a court of justice for the purpose of obtaining whatever redress the law provides. <em>In re Investigation of the Grand Juror, </em>188 Conn. 601, 606, 452 A.2d 935 (1982); <em>Waterbury Blank Book Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Hurlburt, </em>73 Conn. 715, 717, 49 A. 198 (1901). An investigatory grand jury proceeding does not provide a forum for the assertion of a legal right. It is not an adversary proceeding in which the parties present their respective positions and have an opportunity to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Furthermore, an investigatory grand jury has no authority to try, condemn or accuse parties under investigation. <em>In re Investigation of the Grand Juror, </em>supra, 604-605; <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 565, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973). Because the sole function of such a grand jury is to inquire into criminal activity and report its findings to the court, its proceedings do not constitute an \u201caction\u201d within \u00a7 1-1 (u). <em>In re Investigation of the Grand Juror, </em>supra, 604. The statutory saving clause therefore cannot be read to preserve the authority of preexisting grand juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Given the inapplicability of the statutory saving clause, we would face an arduous interpretative task if we were confronted only with the absence of express terms, in the text of P.A. No. 85-611, either validating or invalidating the continuing authority of preexisting grand juries. Our inquiry into the legislative intent of P.A. No. 85-611 is, however, facilitated by unequivocal legislative action in 1986. The terms of P.A. No. 86-317 explicitly provide that the inquiry of an investigatory grand jury \u201cordered prior to October 1,1985, in accordance with section 54-47 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1,1985, shall continue until the conclusion of such inquiry and a final report has been filed with the court . . . .\u201d P.A. No. 86-317 poses no great difficulty of interpretation. It is clear what the legislature intended, in 1986, to do. What is debatable is whether the legislature then had the power to effectuate its intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The state argues that P.A. No. 86-317 serves to clarify the legislature\u2019s original intention in enacting P.A. No. 85-611, and that it was well within the prerogative of the legislature to enact such a clarifying act. The defendant maintains, to the contrary, that P.A. No. 86-317 is a curative act that unconstitutionally attempts to revitalize the authority of grand juries that were divested, by P.A. No. 85-611, of their power to pursue further investigations. We agree with the state that P.A. No. 86-317 is clarifying rather than curative legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Our cases have drawn a clear distinction between curative and clarifying legislation. Although a curative act may validate any past action that the legislature might originally have authorized, we have held that \u201c[cjurative acts cannot cure a want of authority to act at all.\u201d <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>107 Conn. 697, 705, 142 A.2d 574 (1928); <em>McAdams </em>v. <em>Barbieri, </em>143 Conn. 405, 420, 123 A.2d 182 (1956); 2 J. Sutherland, supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u00a7 41.11. By contrast, a clarifying act, which \u201cin effect construes and clarifies a prior statute must be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the original act.\u201d <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>173 Conn. 232, 246, 377 A.2d 305 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1977 Buick Automobile, </em>196 Conn. 471, 479, 493 A.2d 874 (1985); <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>195 Conn. 534, 540, 489 A.2d 363 (1985); <em>Neyland </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 174, 180, 487 A.2d 181 (1985); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 75, 434 A.2d 333 (1980); see 1A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 22.31, 22.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">To the extent that legislative history can illuminate whether an act is curative or clarifying legislation, the legislative history of P. A. No. 86-317 demonstrates that the legislature intended that act to clarify its original intent that grand juries duly constituted before October 1,1985, would be authorized to finish their inquiries without having to comply with the 1985 act. Senator Richard B. Johnston, cochairman of the Judiciary Committee and cosponsor of the act, explained: \u201cLast year, the general assembly, effective October 1,1985, passed Public Act 85-611 . . . [i]t was not at that time our intent to terminate through the passage of that legislation any then initiated and ongoing grand jury investigations.\u201d 29 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1986 Sess., p. 2400. Senator Johnston added: \u201c[T]his legislation before us really, in essence, provides a clarification to that legislative intent, that is that those grand juries that were initiated prior to the passage of the Public Act last year were lawfully constituted after the passage of that legislation and legitimately ongoing. It was\u2014when Judge Pickett speaks in his ruling on the motion, he speaks of that there was no grandfathering of any then initiated grand jury investigations. Well, I recall thinking . . . that the grandfathering of any already instituted actions [was] provided in other passages of the Connecticut general statutes . . . .\u201d Id., 2400-2401. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Nothing in the reported legislative history indicates that the legislature intended in 1986 to revive grand juries whose authority had been terminated by the 1985 act. The legislature intended instead to exercise its ongoing power to clarify the law as it existed under the 1985 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The legislature could not, even by extensive protestations of legislative intent, convert an act that is truly curative into one that is effectively clarifying. In this case, however, there is no reason not to accept the legislative history of P.A. No. 86-317 at face value. In enacting P.A. No. 85-611, the legislature failed to address its effect on preexisting grand juries. Once litigation brought that ambiguity to light, the legislature acted to remove any doubt about its earlier intentions. Its action in 1986 therefore invokes the principle of statutory construction that \u201c[i]f the amendment was enacted soon after controversies arose as to the interpretation of the original act, it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original act . . . .\u201d 1A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 22.31. Even though the legislative clarification was prompted by a judicial decision that the legislature deemed mistaken, such a clarification does not constitute an invasion of judicial authority. Like legislators, judges are fallible. The legislature has the power to make evident to us that it never intended to provide a litigant with the rights that we had previously interpreted a statute to confer. <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>supra, 540-41; <em>Neyland </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 180-81; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 75; <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>supra, 245.</p>\n<p id=\"A6vd\">Our conclusion that P.A. No. 86-317 is to be given effect as clarifying legislation finds support in the presumption that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result, rather than the \u201cdifficult and possibly bizarre\u201d result of terminating sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>eral ongoing grand jury investigations sub silentio. <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 152, 480 A.2d 519 (1984); <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 523, 441 A.2d 158 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 563, 429 A.2d 960 (1980). The legislature was of course empowered to decide, in 1985, that in light of the wide perception of serious abuses in the previous investigatory grand jury system, it was urgent to implement reform measures immediately, even at the cost of disrupting the ongoing proceedings of preexisting grand juries. The legislature might have determined that public policy required the dismantling of all ongoing grand juries, despite the risk of resultant delay in the completion of their assignments and the possible disruption of investigative inquiries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is, however, highly unlikely that the legislature would have undertaken so troubling a choice\u2014between the benefits of reform and the costs of premature termination of preexisting investigations\u2014Avithout making that decision expressly. We conclude that legislative silence on this matter is indicative of legislative intent that P.A. No. 85-611 should operate to safeguard against abuses in the appointment and operation of future investigatory grand juries without terminating the authority of preexisting grand juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Having concluded that P.A. No. 86-317 is clarifying legislation, we have removed the necessary predicate for the defendant\u2019s claim that the. 1986 act retroactively and hence unconstitutionally deprived him of vested rights. The defendant\u2019s argument is that P.A. No. 85-611 conferred substantive rights upon him that the legislature could not revoke in 1986 without violating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>his constitutional rights to due process and to protection against ex post facto laws.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These substantive rights arose, according to the defendant, because the effect of P.A. No. 85-611 was to terminate the investigatory authority of Judge DeMayo\u2019s grand jury. It is essential to this argument that we agree with the defendant\u2019s assertion that the 1985 act conferred upon him the right to have further grand jury investigations conducted according to the ground rules therein established for future grand juries. In light of the 1986 act, we have concluded to the contrary. Since P.A.
