Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">The issue in this marital dissolution case is whether the defendant husband, Dinis DeTeves, has taken a timely appeal. The procedural background of the case is as follows. This case was originally tried in 1982. In 1984, the Appellate Court found error in the award of alimony and in the property disposition and remanded the case for a rehearing. Upon the rehearing, the court, <em>Schaller, J., </em>awarded the plaintiff the entire interest in a multifamily house in Pawcatuck, $1 per year alimony and attorney\u2019s fees for the rehearing. This decision was filed on May 29, 1985. By motion filed on June 13, 1985, counsel for the defendant requested an extension of time until July 18,1985, within which to file an appeal of the decision of May 29,1985. The reason advanced for the motion was that the defendant resided in the Azores, that he could only be reached by mail and that past experience had shown that four to five weeks were needed for the defendant to receive information from his attorney and to reply. The court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>granted this motion on June 17, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">On July 12, 1985, counsel for the defendant filed a second motion for extension of time until August 19, 1985, within -which to file an appeal. The reasons advanced for this second request for an extension were that counsel had been informed by a relative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>defendant that the defendant was ill and wanted the relative to speak personally to counsel when that relative arrived in the United States in early August, 1985. This motion also indicated that at that time counsel would \u201cthen move to file an appeal if it is [the] Defendant\u2019s wishes.\u201d The court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>granted this motion on July 15, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">On July 18, 1985, the plaintiff filed an objection<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the second requested extension and asked that a hearing be held on the matter. With copies to counsel dated July 18,1985, the court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>revoked its order of July 15, 1985, granting the defendant\u2019s motion. In addition, the court ordered that the motion for extension of time to file the appeal and the objection filed July 18, 1985, were to be heard before the court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>on July 29,1985. On August 15,1985, the court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s request for the second extension.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The defendant filed an appeal to the Appellate Court on August 14,1985. On August 23,1985, the plaintiff filed a motion, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3110,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>dismiss the appeal as \u201cuntimely filed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a hearing on this motion, including the defendant\u2019s objections, the Appellate Court granted the motion to dismiss on October 10, 1985. On December 3, 1985, we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The defendant claims that the Appellate Court erred in: (1) finding that his appeal was \u201cuntimely filed\u201d given the factual pattern of this case; (2) not finding that he was \u201centitled\u201d to notice of the denial of his second motion for extension of time before the appeal \u201ccould be dismissed as \u2018untimely filed\u2019 \u201d; and (3) not providing for a time period in which to perfect his appeal following the unfavorable ruling on his second motion for extension of time. We affirm the action of the Appellate Court dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u201c \u2018The right of appeal is purely statutory and is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prevedini </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corporation, </em>164 Conn. 287, 293, 320 A.2d 797 (1973), quoting <em>Howarth </em>v. <em>Northcott, </em>152 Conn. 460, 462, 208 A.2d 540 (1965). Practice Book \u00a7 3007 (now \u00a7 4009) sets forth a clear and specific timetable for the filing of an appeal from a judgment of the trial court. Section 3007 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he party appealing shall, within twenty days, except where a different period is provided by statute, from the issuance of notice of the ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>dition of the judgment or decision from which the appeal is taken, file an appeal in the manner prescribed by Sec. 3011 [now \u00a7 4012] <em>. . , </em>See also Practice Book \u00a7 2000. \u201cThe meaning of \u2018within\u2019 is \u2018 \u201cnot longer in time than\u201d; Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.); \u201cnot later than\u201d; 69 C.J. 1315; 45 Words &amp; Phrases (Perm. Ed.), p. 378. The word \u201cwithin\u201d is almost universally used as a word of limitation, unless there are other controlling words in the context showing that a different meaning was intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>177 Conn. 584, 586, 418 A.2d 939 (1979). Section 3097 (a) (now \u00a7 4040) provides for an extension of this twenty day appeal period. Section 3097 (a) provides in relevant part that <em>\u201c[i]n no event </em>shall the trial judge extend the time for filing the appeal to a date which is more than twenty days from the expiration of the original appeal period.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The maximum time within which an appeal can be filed, therefore, is forty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The judgment in this case was rendered on May 29, 1985.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s appeal, therefore, absent a proper extension of time to file an appeal, should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>been filed on or before June 18,1985.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No appeal was filed within the original twenty day period, but on June 17,1985, the trial court, <em>Hendel, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s timely motion, to which the plaintiff did not object, to extend the time to file an appeal until July 18, 1985.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion, on its face, stated that it was \u201cfiled under the provisions of Sec. 3097, Connecticut Practice Book.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The extension to July 18,1985, extended the appeal period beyond that allowed by Practice Book \u00a7 3097 (a). Not only was the date of July 18, 1985, well beyond a date \u201cwhich [was] more than twenty days from the expiration of the original appeal period,\u201d but so were a number of the days immediately preceding that date. The trial court did not have power to grant a motion extending the appeal period beyond July 8, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The language of \u00a7 3097 (a) is clear and unambiguous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>183 Conn. 520, 522-23, 441 A.2d 41 (1981); see <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717, 513 A.2d 43 (1986). Significantly, the relevant sentence of \u00a7 3097 (a) was added by amendment effective October 1, 1982. Prior to that amendment, \u00a7 3097 (a) consisted of one sentence which simply provided: \u201cIf an appeal has not yet been filed, the judge who tried the case <em>may, </em>for good cause shown, extend the time provided for filing the appeal, except as <em>may </em>be otherwise provided in these rules.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The 1982 amendment, in addition to the \u201cno event\u201d language, also inserted the word \u201cshall\u201d into \u00a7 3097 (a) where previously the word \u201cmay\u201d appeared in delineating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>trial judge\u2019s authority. This underscores our interpretation that \u201cshall\u201d in the 1982 amendment is mandatory. The rules of statutory construction are \u201cclearly applicable\u201d to the construction of our rules of practice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 521. Thus, the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d as used in \u00a7 3097 (a), and indeed throughout \u00a7 3097, are to be accorded their plain and ordinary meanings. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1; <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 203, 440 A.2d 286 (1982). The use of \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 3097 (a), \u201ccommonly mandatory and directory in connotation, [is] a factor that evidences affirmative selectivity of terms with specific intent to be distinctive in meaning.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 509, 400 A.2d 721 (1978); <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>supra. The plain language of \u00a7 3097 (a) does not provide the trial court with power to extend the time period for filing an appeal more than twenty days from the expiration date of the original appeal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The absence of power in the trial court is dispositive of this case. The appeal should have been filed at the latest on July 8, 1985. It in fact was not filed until August 14, 1985. The Appellate Court correctly granted the plaintiff\u2019s timely motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The defendant next argues that the filing of a motion to extend the time period for filing an appeal tolls the expiration of the time period for filing an appeal until the court rules on the motion to extend. In support of this argument, the defendant points to his ability to file for an extension at any time before the expiration date of the original appeal period and the plaintiff\u2019s ability to object to that request. The defendant maintains that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>this procedure presents the possibility that the initial time period will expire before the court rules on the motion and the objection thereto. The defendant maintains that fairness dictates that, in such situations, the appellant be given an additional time, after the denial of his request to extend, to perfect his appeal. In effect, the defendant is urging this court to permit an automatic extension of the appeal period whenever a trial judge denies a request for an extension made at or near the expiration of the appeal period. The defendant contends that to hold otherwise would \u201cthwart\u201d the purpose of allowing requests for extensions and require the filing of an appeal or risk dismissal for untimely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We need not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument because the defendant\u2019s second motion for extension of time was filed July 12,1985, a date which was after the expiration of the time limit sought to be extended. Moreover, the Practice Book rules do not confer discretion upon the trial judge to enlarge the appeal period more than twenty days from the expiration of the original appeal period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\"> That objection stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201cobjection to motion to extend</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">TIME FOR FILING APPEAL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">Counsel for the Plaintiff objects to the Defendant\u2019s motion to extend the time for filing an appeal and respectfully requests the court to set a date for a hearing on the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">This request is filed under the provision of \u00a7 3097 (c) (2) of the Connecticut Practice Book.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-12\"> The defendant\u2019s brief states that on August 17,1985, he received from the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office a copy of this denial on which the date of denial \u201cappears to be August 5,1985, but it is stamped \u2018Filed August 15, 1985 Superior Court\u2019 and \u2018copies to counsel 8-15-85.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">The defendant\u2019s counsel, who is a member of the Connecticut and Rhode Island bars, maintained her office in Westerly, Rhode Island, at the time of these proceedings in 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b306-14\"> Practice Book \u00a7 3110 (now \u00a7 4056) provides: \u201cAny claim that an appeal or writ of error should be dismissed, whether based on lack of jurisdiction, failure to file papers within the time allowed or other defect, shall be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>by a motion to dismiss the appeal or writ. Any such motion must be filed in accordance with Secs. 3098 [now \u00a7 4041] and 3099 [now \u00a7 4042] within ten days after the filing of the appeal or the return day of the writ, or if the ground alleged subsequently occurs, within ten days after it has arisen, provided that a motion based on lack of jurisdiction may be filed at any time.
