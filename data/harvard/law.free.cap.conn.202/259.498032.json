He was sentenced to consecutive terms of twenty-five years on the charge of kidnapping, twenty years on the charge of attempted murder, twenty years on the charge of sexual assault, ten years on the charge of robbery, and a concurrent term of ten years on the charge of assault, for a total effective sentence of seventy-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court erred (1) in summarily quashing a subpoena, (2) in ordering the defendant to produce statements of certain alibi witnesses, and (3) in imposing a total effective sentence greater than that which could be imposed for murder. Though finding no error on the third issue, we agree that the trial court erred in quashing the subpoena and in ordering the production of the witnesses\u2019 statements. We therefore reverse this case and remand it for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">A review of the evidence adduced at trial reveals that on February 8,1983, at about 2:30 p.m., the victim left her apartment and walked to a bus stop in front of Cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tral High School in Bridgeport. She intended to take a bus downtown to pay an electric bill and carried $120 in her purse for that purpose. While she was awaiting the bus, a light-skinned black man approached her and asked where she was heading. The man was directly facing her when he asked the question, and was wearing a green army coat, gray dress pants and a beige and blue sock hat. When she replied \u201cdowntown,\u201d the man said he had a gun in his pocket, and if she screamed or tried to run away he would shoot her. He displayed what looked like a gun, ordered her to walk a short distance with him and told her he would take her money and let her go. The victim offered her pocketbook to the man, telling him to \u201c[t]ake it and just go.\u201d The man then grabbed her arm and dragged her across the school parking lot, through a hole in a fence and down a hill. Several times he threatened her and displayed what appeared to be a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The man took the money in the victim\u2019s purse and ordered her to take off her clothes. When she refused and started to cry, he told her to \u201cshut up.\u201d He then struck her in the mouth, removed her coat and pants, and pushed her to the ground as she struggled. He then sexually assaulted her. After the sexual assault, he told her that he could not release her because she could identify him. He began to strangle her, first with his hands and then with a piece of wire which he had removed from his pocket. Eventually, the victim lost consciousness. She awakened to find herself under the steps of the school\u2019s stadium, her face lying in a pool of blood. She could not see out of one eye and injuries to her entire face caused her great pain. She managed to crawl to the school\u2019s parking lot, where a passerby summoned an ambulance. It was later determined that the victim had been beaten in the face with two boulders. Testimony heard by the jury also revealed that as a result of the injuries, she had required extensive surgery on her jaw and eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>While confined to a hospital undergoing intensive care, the victim was shown a number of police photographs. The victim identified one of the photographs, a picture of the defendant, as portraying her assailant. On February 9, 1983, the police searched the defendant\u2019s home pursuant to a warrant and seized some wire, a hat, coat and pants resembling those described by the victim, and a replica of a .45 Colt automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Prosecutorial Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">We will first address the defendant\u2019s claim of error wherein he asserts that the trial court erred in ordering the production of certain statements made by defense witnesses to his investigator. This issue arose at trial while the defendant was presenting evidence of an alibi defense. The defendant testified that on the afternoon of February 8,1983, he had boarded city bus No. 12 at the Trumbull Shopping Park at about 2:35 p.m. About ten to fifteen minutes later, he claims, he got off the bus and walked to his home in Bridgeport. According to the defendant, he remained at home for the rest of the afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Various defense witnesses were called to verify the defendant\u2019s explanation of his whereabouts on the afternoon in question. One witness, Marion Johnson, testified that she was a friend of the mother of the defendant\u2019s girlfriend. She claimed that she had seen the defendant on bus No. 12 at approximately 2:40 p.m. on February 8,1983. According to Johnson, the defendant got off the bus near his home in Bridgeport. On recross-examination, she was asked whether she had given a written statement to anyone from the office of the defendant\u2019s attorney. Defense counsel objected, and a hearing occurred outside the presence of the jury. The state argued that it was entitled to such a statement if it existed. The defendant maintained that nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ther the Practice Book nor the federal or state constitution requires a defendant to produce such statements. The court overruled the objection and ordered the defendant to produce the witness\u2019s statement. Apparently these statements did not contain any relevant evidence to impeach the witness, as the remainder of the cross-examination was uneventful.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">When the same situation occurred during the testimony of another witness, however, the statement that the defendant was ordered to produce did in fact contain relevant impeaching information. Delores Jackson, the driver of bus No. 12, testified that the defendant was on board her bus when it departed from the Trumbull Shopping Park at about 2:30 p.m. on February 8, 1983. She stated that he got off the bus about five to six minutes later near Old Towne Road in Bridgeport. Jackson was asked on cross-examination if she had given a statement to anyone regarding this subject. When she replied that she had spoken to a defense investigator and that he had tape recorded her statement, the prosecutor requested access to the tape. The defendant objected again and argued that the statement did not have to be produced. His objection was overruled. The trial court ordered production of the tape, stating to defense counsel \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t you have to produce it just as [the prosecutor] has to produce any statement of any witness that he . . . has taken? ... I think that rule extends both ways.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The tape recorded conversation between the investigator and Jackson revealed that Jackson had been shown a picture of the defendant and that she had been unable to identify the male in the photograph as the person she had seen on her bus. The state confronted Jackson with this fact on cross-examination. Although Jackson later positively identified the defendant in court as the man on the bus, the state pointed out that the statement made to the investigator was taken shortly after the incident in question. Moreover, during his closing argument, the prosecutor again referred to Jackson\u2019s failure to identify the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s order violated the Practice Book, article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the state and federal guarantees of effective assistance of counsel, and the work product doctrine. He claims that this sort of mutual discovery in criminal cases has never been allowed in Connecticut and that traditionally, the state does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>have the power \u201cto probe the files of defense counsel.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cocheo, </em>1 Conn. Cir. Ct. 610, 614, 190 A.2d 916 (1963). We agree with the defendant that the trial court should not have ordered the production of the statements of either witness. Our holding is based on the general structure of the Practice Book\u2019s discovery provisions and on specific language contained in \u00a7\u00a7 752 and 763. We find it unnecessary, therefore, to decide whether the court\u2019s ruling also violated the state and federal constitutions or the work product doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Chapter 26 of our Practice Book regulates discovery in criminal proceedings. Sections 740 through 747 relate specifically to disclosure of information by the <em>prosecution. </em>Under these provisions, the defendant is allowed access to a wide range of information in the possession of the state. Certain types of information are discoverable by the defendant as a matter of right; see Practice Book \u00a7 741; other types are discoverable at the trial court\u2019s discretion; see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 743, 744; and some material is simply not discoverable under the rules at all. See Practice Book \u00a7 746. Under one provision, entitled \u201cAdditional Disclosure,\u201d the court may order disclosure to the defendant of other information not covered by the rules as the interests of justice may require. See Practice Book \u00a7 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The rules governing disclosure of statements of a witness are found in \u00a7\u00a7 751 through 755. After a <em>state\u2019s </em>witness has testified on direct examination, \u00a7 752 provides that on the defendant\u2019s motion the court \u201cshall . . . order the state to produce any statement of the witness in the possession of the state or its agents . . . which . . . relates to the subject matter about which the witness has testified.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b. By its plain wording this provision applies only to statements made by <em>prosecution </em>witnesses; it clearly does not allow for disclosure of statements made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>by <em>defense </em>witnesses. The trial court\u2019s order in this case to produce statements made by the two alibi witnesses, therefore, cannot be sustained under this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">It has been recognized that discovery is not a \u201cone-way street\u201d; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 233, 95 S. Ct. 2160, 45 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975); and that some degree of mutual discovery is essential to the truth-seeking process. Our Practice Book provisions relating to defense disclosure, however, are of a more limited nature than the prosecutorial disclosure provisions. They relate mainly to certain defenses, such as alibi or mental disease or defect, upon which the defendant intends to rely at trial. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7756 through 768. The alibi provisions only require the defendant to file, a notice of his intention to rely on the alibi defense and to \u201cstate the specific place or places at which the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense and the <em>names </em>and <em>addresses </em>of witnesses upon whom he intends to rely to establish such alibi.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 763. Significantly, this section does not mention disclosure of <em>statements </em>made by an alibi witness. Thus, the court\u2019s order requiring disclosure of the statements made by the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses cannot be justified under the Practice Book provisions relating <em>to </em>the alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Finally, the provisions contain no section analogous to \u00a7 745 which would allow the disclosure to the prosecution of additional information if the trial court deemed disclosure to be in the interests of justice. In short, our nales of practice neither explicitly nor implicitly support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that disclosure of a witness\u2019s statement \u201cextends both ways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">A number of courts facing prosecutorial discovery issues like the one at bar have declined to adopt a rule of mutual disclosure of witness statements in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>absence of some previous authorization by statute or rule of practice. See, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Ariz. 510, 513, 467 P.2d 904 (1970); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>632 P.2d 595, 599 (Colo. 1981); <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 A.2d 109, 115 (D.C. App. 1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandstrom, 225 </em>Kan. 717, 728, 595 P.2d 324, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 942, 100 S. Ct. 296, 62 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1979); see generally annot., 23 A.L.R.4th 799. These courts point out that underlying the imbalance between prosecutorial and defense discovery are constitutional and general societal concerns. In <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 116 n.ll, the court explained that criminal discovery is strongly influenced by concerns that \u201cthe accused be secure from condemnations resting upon his coerced testimony or the improper annexation of his counsel\u2019s labors, and that the safety of the community not be jeopardized by unrestrained access to its prosecutor\u2019s files. These concerns, as well as proper deference to the constitutional principles which burden the state alone with proof of criminal charges, and considerations of fairness in light of the normal superiority of the government\u2019s investigatory resources, necessarily will frustrate the evolution of a parity of access similar to that embodied in the rules applicable to civil proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We recognize that some jurisdictions, as well as the federal rules of criminal procedure, allow for mutual disclosure of witness statements. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; <em>State </em>v. <em>Montague, 55 </em>N. J. 387, 399, 262 A.2d 398 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>14 Wash. App. 658, 664, 545 P.2d 36 (1975); see generally annot., 23 A.L.R.4th 799. Nevertheless, we agree with the <em>Middleton </em>court that \u201c[hjowever appealing the notion of full disclosure may be in the abstract, important constitutional and societal interests affected by the criminal discovery process counsel against casual acceptance of such a major revision of the established statutory schemes.\u201d <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The trial court\u2019s order allowing access to the statements of the defense witnesses in this case cannot be considered harmless. The statement made by Delores Jackson\u2019to the investigator contained information which the state used to impeach her credibility. Jackson was a crucial alibi witness because unlike the other alibi witnesses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> she had no ties to the defendant and arguably no reason to lie on his behalf. The jury could reasonably have discredited the defendant\u2019s alibi because of the information erroneously ordered disclosed by the trial court. A new trial is therefore required.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Motion to Quash</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Although our finding of error requires us to order a new trial, we will also consider one of the remaining issues raised by the defendant, as it is likely to arise on retrial of this matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>196 Conn. 122, 131, 491 A.2d 382 (1985). The defendant\u2019s second contention on appeal involves the quashing of a subpoena duces tecum which the defendant had served on the coordinator of the YWCA rape crisis service in Bridgeport. The subpoena commanded the coordinator to appear in court on January 25,1985, and to bring with her any records concerning the victim. On the designated day, counsel appeared for the coordinator and filed a motion to quash based on General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the provisions of that statute, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>munications between a \u201csexual assault counselor\u201d and a \u201cvictim\u201d are confidential and may not be disclosed absent a waiver by the victim. The motion to quash alleged that the coordinator was a \u201csexual assault coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>selor\u201d and that the victim was a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The motion also alleged that the coordinator had no knowledge that the victim had offered perjured testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">At a hearing on the motion, the defendant asserted his state and federal constitutional rights to compulsory process and confrontation. He also requested an opportunity to make the threshold showing outlined in <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 179, 471 A.2d 949 (1984), that the records would be relevant to cross-examination and, therefore, to his right of confrontation. Ruling that \u00a7 52-146k was \u201cvery clear and unequivocal,\u201d the court refused the defendant\u2019s request and ordered the subpoena quashed. The defendant then attempted to make an offer of proof requesting production of the records on the issue of the identification of the assailant. The court, interrupting the defendant as he attempted to explicate the offer of proof, stated that although it had granted the motion to quash it would note the defendant\u2019s exception.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s request that the records be marked for identification and sealed pending appellate review. Finally, during trial, the defendant attempted on cross-examination to question the victim about her consultation with the rape crisis counselor. The court disallowed the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The crux of the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is that his right to search for truth in defending himself should supersede the interest of the rape crisis service and the victim in maintaining confidentiality. We addressed this very issue in <em>In re Robert H., </em>199 Conn. 693, 509 A.2d 475 (1986), which was published subsequent to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the present motion to quash. In that case, we particularized a procedure, developed in our prior decisions; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>197 Conn. 326, 497 A.2d 758 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra; which protects a victim\u2019s statutory right to confidentiality while simultaneously safeguarding a defendant\u2019s constitutional right effectively to cross-examine the victim. <em>In re Robert H., </em>supra, 708-709. Under that procedure, a claim of privilege may be countered by a showing that \u201c \u2018there is reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the information is likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation such that the witness\u2019 direct testimony should be stricken.\u2019 \u201d Id., 708. If such a showing is made and the consent of the witness is secured, the court may conduct an in camera inspection of the information. This inspection, in the context of the sexual assault counselor privilege, is not limited to merely \u201crelevant material.\u201d The court may also look for \u201cany inconsistent and relevant statements of the victim in the records when compared with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the victim\u2019s direct examination.\u201d Id., 709. In the event the inspection does not reveal such material, the record shall be sealed and/made available for appellate review. If the court finds relevant material, however, the witness must choose between consenting to the release of the material or having her testimony stricken. See id., 708-10; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, 329; <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">This procedure clearly was not followed in the present case. The trial judge summarily quashed the subpoena, denying the defendant even the opportunity to make a preliminary showing of an impairment of his right to confrontation. The state, although acknowledging that <em>In re Robert H., </em>supra, and the present case raise identical issues of law, attempts to distinguish the two cases on their facts. The proffered distinction is that in the former case, counsel sought the records to demonstrate \u201csubstantial inconsistencies\u201d in the victim\u2019s statements and to show that her testimony \u201cwas coached\u201d; id., 698-99; while in the present case, such precise factual allegations were not presented to the court. Precise factual allegations were not made in this case, however, because the defendant was simply not given the opportunity to make them. His every attempt to make the threshold showing, to present the offer of proof, and to cross-examine the victim regarding her consultation with the counselor was squelched by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We are not persuaded by the state\u2019s assertion that the granting of the motion to quash was harmless. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra. \u201cWhether the defendant was prejudiced by not having access to [the records] cannot be determined by speculation about what [the records] contain.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>186 Conn. 426, 435, 441 A.2d 852 (1982). We also cannot say with certainty, as we did in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, 335-36, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, absent the testimony of the victim, was so overwhelming as to render the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We have already ordered a new trial based on the erroneous order concerning the witness statements. A remand, pursuant to <em>In re Robert H. </em>on the issue of the motion to quash is therefore not required. At the new trial, we direct the court to apply the procedures outlined in <em>In re Robert H., </em>supra, should the defendant again seek to subpoena the records of the rape crisis service. Thus, to obtain the records, the defendant must make the requisite threshold showing which, assuming the victim consents, would enable him to obtain an in camera review of the records. If the court\u2019s review reveals relevant material, the victim faces the choice of either waiving her privilege or having her testimony stricken. If the court\u2019s inspection fails to uncover any significant material, the records must be sealed for possible review on appeal. See id., 710-11.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Because of our holding in this case, we need not consider the defendant\u2019s contentions concerning his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>tence. We merely note that the defendant did not object to the length of the sentence at the time it was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In this opinion, Peters, C. J., and Healey, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-5\"> The pertinent portion of the cross-examination by the state is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cQ.

The question suggests that if some of the communications were made prior to October 1,1983, the effective date of the amendment to General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k, the privilege afforded by that provision may be inapplicable. The defendant reasons that prior to the enactment of Public Acts 1985, No. 85-112, which made the privilege applicable to communications made \u201cat any time\u201d; see footnote 4, supra; the privilege did not apply to communications made prior to October 1, 1983. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>200 Conn. 734, 738-40, 517 A.2d 610 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">We need not discuss this issue, however, because at the new trial we have ordered, the court must apply General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k as amended by Public Acts 1985, No. 85-112. Since Public Acts 1985, No. 85-112, makes the privilege applicable to communications regardless of when they were made, the communications in this case would be privileged even if some were made prior to October 1, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b286-7\">Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2y\">with whom Cioffi, J., joined, dissenting in part. I agree with part II and part III of the majority opinion, but disagree with part I, which gives a defendant a privilege to withhold prior statements of a defense witness that contradict his testimony in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The order of the trial court found erroneous by the majority was not issued at any pretrial disclosure proceeding but during trial after the defendant\u2019s witness Delores Jackson had testified in support of his alibi. It was an order for discovery of evidence then in court in the possession of the defendant. Such orders have commonly been used in the courts of this state for the purpose of disclosing to a cross-examiner any prior inconsistent statements of a witness after completion of his direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u201cAn order to produce can be entered by the court in the course of a trial as to any document then in court and in the possession of the party against whom the order to produce is entered . . . . \u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>145 Conn. 290, 295, 141 A.2d 634 (1958). An order to produce does not make the document automatically available for inspection by opposing counsel, because the court must first ascertain whether it contains irrelevant or privileged material that could not properly be used at trial. <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ry. &amp; Lighting Co., </em>79 Conn. 116, 118-19, 64 A. 14 (1906). Where the document contains prior inconsistent statements of a witness, the court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>permit counsel to examine the statement, except for irrelevant or privileged matters. <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>118 Conn. 276, 284, 172 A. 86 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Before the advent of Practice Book \u00a7 752, requiring statements of a prosecution witness to be disclosed after he has testified on direct examination, the rule developed in <em>Brown </em>and <em>Hurley </em>had been deemed applicable to both civil and criminal cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>166 Conn. 501, 511-16, 353 A.2d 723 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 202, 187 A.2d 442 (1962); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pambianchi, </em>139 Conn. 543, 548, 95 A.2d 695 (1953); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>127 Conn. 543, 601-602, 18 A.2d 895 (1941). In all of these cases statements of prosecution witnesses in the possession of the state\u2019s attorney were required to be produced for examination by the court for the purpose of ascertaining whether they contained inconsistencies with the testimony of a witness. Although this case appears to be the first criminal case in this state involving the production of statements of defense witnesses in the possession of the defendant, the clear implication of these authorities is that the <em>Brown-Hurley </em>rule is applicable to witnesses for the defense as well as the prosecution in both criminal and civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 752 modifies our previous procedure with respect to disclosure of prosecution witness statements by removing the trial judge\u2019s preliminary inspection of the statement for inconsistencies as a prerequisite to making the statement available to the defendant. The rule leaves no room for the exercise of trial judge discretion, but mandates delivery of the statement after the prosecution witness has testified on direct examination. The <em>Brown-Hurley </em>rule, as applied to the statements of defense witnesses, would entitle a defendant to the exercise of such discretion before being compelled to surrender such statements. In this case it does not appear that the trial judge did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>conduct a preliminary examination of the statement of the defense witness Delores Jackson before ordering it to be delivered to the prosecutor. This deviation from the <em>Brown-Hurley </em>rule, however, was harmless because it is undisputed that her statement contained a glaring and significant inconsistency with her testimony. We need not be concerned in any event, since there must be a retrial because of the rulings concerning the testimony of the rape crisis counselor. At the new trial another judge should not be foreclosed from exercising his discretion to permit disclosure of this highly material inconsistency in the event that Jackson should again be called as a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The majority does not address the claim of the defendant that to allow access to statements of -witnesses given to investigators employed by the defense may infringe upon the right against self-incrimination, the right to effective assistance of counsel or upon the work product privilege. I think these concerns have been largely set to rest by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 95 S. Ct. 2160, 45 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975). \u201c[T he Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, being personal to the defendant, does not extend to the testimony or statements of third parties called as witnesses at trial.\u201d Id., 234. With respect to the work product doctrine and related assistance of counsel claims, the <em>Nobles </em>court held that the work product privilege was qualified and that by presenting his investigator as a witness a defendant waived the privilege with respect to matters covered by such testimony; the investigator\u2019s report to the defense attorney, therefore, was accessible to the prosecutor. Id., 238-40. \u201cRespondent can no more advance the work-product doctrine to sustain a unilateral testimonial use of work-product materials than he could elect to testify in his own behalf and thereafter assert his Fifth Amendment privilege to resist cross-examination on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>matters reasonably related to those brought out in direct examination.\u201d Id., 239-40. As the opinion notes, the federal courts since 1980, pursuant to rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, permit disclosure of the statements of witnesses who have testified for the defense as well as those who have testified for the prosecution without distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The cause of truth is ill served by imposing a restriction upon the <em>Brown-Hurley </em>rule that heretofore has been understood to apply to both prosecution and defense witnesses. In doing so the majority opinion has created a novel privilege, unwarranted by any constitutional provision, for a defendant to withhold material unquestionably significant in ascertaining whether a witness has testified falsely. In uncovering false testimony of witnesses at a trial a prosecutor should not be placed under a greater handicap than defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Accordingly, I dissent from part I of the opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
