The respondent has appealed from the judgment of the trial court ordering that the petitioner\u2019s time spent in custody under a sentence later vacated and declared void be credited as presentence time rather than as time served on a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. On June 22,1979, the petitioner was arrested and committed to the custody of the commissioner of correction in lieu of bond in connection with the rape of a fourteen year old Wallingford girl. In a substitute information, he was charged with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> kidnapping in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petitioner pleaded guilty under the Alford<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> doctrine. On August 14,1981, he was sentenced to three concurrent sentences: seven to twelve years on the first two counts, and one year on the third count, for a total effective sentence of not less than seven years nor more than twelve years.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Subsequently, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Docket No. 266428 (November 30,1981), claiming that the sentences were imposed illegally in violation of the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35 (c) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 28,1982, the trial court concluded that the petitioner\u2019s sentences were void. The petitioner was allowed to withdraw his prior guilty pleas, and he entered pleas of not guilty to each of the three counts included in the substitute information, electing to be tried by a jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>197 Conn. 485, 487-94, 498 A.2d 65 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1073, 106 S. Ct. 833, 88 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1986). On October 4, 1982, the petitioner was found guilty on each of the three counts included in the substitute information. The trial court sentenced the petitioner to three consecutive sentences: seven and one-half years to fifteen years on each of the first two counts, and one year on the third count, for a total effective sentence of not less than sixteen years nor more than thirty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The petitioner has remained in the custody of the respondent from June 22,1979, the date of his arrest, to the present. The relevant periods of the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>confinement have been summarized by the parties as follows: (1) June 22,1979, to August 14,1981, confinement from date of arrest to date of first sentence; (2) August 14,1981, to May 11,1982, time served under first sentence to the date the sentence was vacated;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3) May 11,1982, to October 5,1982, confinement prior to imposition of second sentence; (4) October 5,1982, to September 10,1985, confinement under second sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequent to the October 5, 1982 sentences, the respondent recalculated the petitioner\u2019s sentence credits to reflect the new sentences. On March 26, 1984, the petitioner filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the respondent\u2019s method of computing the petitioner\u2019s sentence credits with respect to the second time period outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The principal issue before the habeas court, and now before this court, is what type of statutory sentence credit is appropriate for time spent in custody serving a sentence that was later vacated and declared void. The petitioner argues that the time served on the vacated sentence is presentence confinement and that General Statutes \u00a7 18-97<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> should apply for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the time calculation. General Statutes \u00a7 18-97, which governs pretrial confinement credit for offenses committed prior to July 1, 1981, permits multiple crediting of presentence time in certain cases. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 18-97d. Under this provision, therefore, since the petitioner is presently serving an effective sentence of thirty-one years on three separate consecutive sentences, he would receive multiple credit on his new sentence. See <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 439, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981). The respondent, however, argues that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> applies and that it provides that only \u201ctime served\u201d on the vacated sentence be credited against the new sentence. Under this latter section, the credit would be calculated on a one for one basis since the new sentence would be calculated as having begun to run on the date of the commencement of the vacated sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The trial court, relying on our decision in <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 127-28, 440 A.2d 848 (1981), rejected the respondent\u2019s interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c). It ordered the respondent to allow the petitioner presentence credit for the period June 22, 1979, the date of the petitioner\u2019s arrest, to October 5, 1982, the date the second sentence was imposed. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c) provides: \u201cWhen a sentence of imprisonment that has been imposed on a person is vacated and a new sentence is imposed on such a person for the same offense or for an offense based on the same act, the new sentence shall be calculated as if it had commenced at the time the vacated sentence commenced, and all time served under or credited against the vacated sentence shall be credited against the new sentence.\u201d It is well established that \u201c[cjredit for time previously served is constitutionally mandated by the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment of the United States constitution which is enforceable in state courts through the fourteenth amendment. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 718-19, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969); <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794-96, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969).\u201d <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 126-27. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c), in keeping with the mandate of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, is a general statutory provision which requires that a prisoner be given full credit for time served on a vacated sentence. <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 131. It \u201cdoes not specify what type of \u2018credit\u2019 it refers to.\u201d Id., 133 <em>(Healey, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Although we did not directly address in <em>Moscone </em>whether time spent in custody pursuant to a sentence which is later vacated is subject to \u201ctime served\u201d credit or \u201cpresentence credit,\u201d we did indicate that the plain language of \u00a7 53a-38 (c) requires only that some form of credit for time served be awarded, and that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>irrelevant to any other statutory credit. <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 131-32. Therefore, as the trial court correctly concluded, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (c) does not bar crediting the time period in question as presentence confinement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This conclusion is supported by the constitutional mandate of <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra, 721, which rests \u201c \u2018upon the premise that the original conviction has, at the defendant\u2019s behest, been <em>wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean. . . . \u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 131. Viewed from this perspective, we cannot say that the trial court erred in concluding that any confinement prior to the time a sentence is vacated and declared void should be characterized as presentence confinement and credited pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-97. See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>supra; cf <em>.King </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 F.2d 291, 293-94 (D.C. Cir. 1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1979)] Sec. 53a-70. sexual assault in the first degree: class b felony, (a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or (2) by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-94. kidnapping in the second degree: class B felony, (a) A person is guilty of kidnapping in the second degree when he abducts another person. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-62. threatening: class a misdemeanor.
