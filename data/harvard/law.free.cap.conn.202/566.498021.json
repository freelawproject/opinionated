J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aca\">The sole issue in this case, on certification from the United States District Court, is whether certain mortgages, which fail to state the maximum term of the obligation they secure, are invalid against subsequent lien creditors under Connecticut law. The plaintiff, Dart &amp; Bogue Company, Inc., is a debtor-in-possession under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. Exercising the powers of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>trustee in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff brought an adversary proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Connecticut, seeking to invalidate two mortgages on its real property held by the defendant, Milton O. Slosberg. The plaintiff moved for summary judgment on its complaint alleging that the mortgages were unenforceable, under General Statutes \u00a7 49-31b (a), because they failed to \u201cfurnish information from which there can be determined the maximum term\u201d of the note they purported to secure. In its ruling on that motion, the bankruptcy court determined that the plaintiffs claim involved an \u201cunsettled issue of state law.\u201d Accordingly, with the consent of the parties, the proceeding was removed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the district court, which certified to this court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the question of the validity of the defendant\u2019s mortgages under Connecticut law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The certified question requires us to consider the impact of General Statutes \u00a7 49-31b (a) upon the mortgages held by the defendant. The statute provides: <em>\u201cA </em>mortgage deed given to secure payment of a promissory note, which furnishes information from which there can be determined the date, principal amount and maximum term of the note, shall be deemed to give sufficient notice of the nature and amount of the obligation to constitute a valid lien securing payment of all sums owed under the terms of such note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The following facts underlie the certified question. The defendant\u2019s two mortgages secure a $1.45 million <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>promissory note that the plaintiff<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> executed in the defendant\u2019s favor on November 13, 1980. In the first mortgage, which the plaintiff executed on the same day as the note, the plaintiff granted the defendant an interest in certain real property located in the town of Waterford. On March 11,1981, the plaintiff executed a supplemental mortgage to the defendant. This mortgage purported to encumber an additional tract of land inadvertently omitted from the first mortgage. Each mortgage stated the mortgagee\u2019s name and address, the principal amount of the promissory note, and the applicable interest rate, but neither stated the maximum term of the note.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The mortgages, unaccompanied by the note, were recorded in the Waterford land records.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Under the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544, the plaintiff is entitled to assert the legal rights of a subsequent lien creditor with respect to the defendant. The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 49-31b (a) sets forth minimum information that mortgages must contain in order to be valid against subsequent lien creditors. Alleging that the failure to state a maximum term in the mortgages constitutes noncom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>pliance with this statutory standard, the plaintiff claims that the mortgages are unenforceable against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The plaintiffs argument raises two principal issues. The first issue is whether \u00a7 49-31b (a) is properly interpreted as setting minimum standards or should instead be construed as a \u201csafe harbor,\u201d setting forth adequate, but nonexclusive, means of notifying third parties of the essential elements of a secured obligation. The amicus curiae, the Connecticut Attorneys Title Insurance Company, urges us to view \u00a7 49-3lb (a) as a \u201csafe harbor,\u201d and to hold that the mortgages presently before us satisfy common law standards of validity. The second issue is whether, even accepting the plaintiffs position that \u00a7 49-31b (a) imposes mandatory standards, the terms of the mortgages in this case meet the requirements of the statute. The defendant claims that the mortgages do, in fact, comply with the statute. Because we agree that \u00a7 49-3 lb (a) supplements but does not supplant relevant common law standards, and that the mortgages in this case meet common law standards, we need not address the validity of the mortgages under the criteria set out in \u00a7 49-31b (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Whether \u00a7 49-31b (a) sets minimum standards, as the plaintiff maintains, or provides a \u201csafe harbor,\u201d as the amicus contends, is an issue that this court has not previously addressed. It has, however, been considered in various Superior Court cases. Epitomizing the disagreement manifested in the Superior Court are the opinions of Judge Borden in <em>Roisman &amp; Rosenberg, P.C. </em>v. <em>N.M.I., Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 282051 (September 12,1983), and Judge Loiselle in <em>Resnick </em>v. <em>Berkowitz, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Windham, Docket No. 800022436 (October 4,1982). In <em>Roisman &amp; Rosenberg, P.C., </em>the court held that \u00a7 49-31b (a) \u201csets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the minimum measure of the validity of a mortgage as against subsequent encumbrancers.\u201d In <em>Resnick, </em>by contrast, the court interpreted \u00a7 49-3 lb (a) as a nonexclusive route to assuring the validity of a mortgage, and held that \u201ccommon law principles . . . would still apply in the event any one of the elements recited in the statute was missing.\u201d Under the <em>Resnick </em>court\u2019s construction, \u00a7 49-31b (a) is a \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision setting forth sufficient, but not necessary, conditions for giving notice of a secured obligation to subsequent lien creditors. We agree with Judge Loiselle and the amicus curiae that \u00a7 49-3lb (a) creates a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for real property mortgages and does not not supersede common law criteria of validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We acknowledge, at the outset, that the legislature had the authority to supplant common law notice-giving standards when it enacted \u00a7 49-31b (a). The issue, however, is not what the legislature had the power to do but what it manifested its intent to do. The relevant language in \u00a7 49-3 lb (a) is the provision that a mortgage deed containing, inter alia, \u201cinformation from which there can be determined the . . . maximum term\u201d of the note secured by the mortgage, \u201cshall be deemed to give sufficient notice of the nature and amount of the obligation . . . .\u201d The plaintiff maintains that the words \u201cshall be deemed to give sufficient notice\u201d impose a mandatory obligation to furnish the information specified in the statute in order to provide the notice prescribed by the statute. We find this reading unpersuasive for a number of reasons, which can be summarized as follows: (1) the customary presumption in favor of retaining common law standards; (2) the absence from \u00a7 49-3 lb (a) of language elsewhere employed by the legislature when specific information is made a statutory requirement; and (3) the use in \u00a7 49-31b (a) of the phrase \u201cshall be deemed,\u201d a phrase often associated with \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions in other regulatory contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Because the meaning of \u00a7 49-31b (a) is not evident on its face, our construction of the statute begins with the presumption that statutory and common law should, where possible, be read in harmony. \u201cA statute should not be construed as altering the common law rule, farther than the words of the statute import, and should not be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which the statute does not fairly express.\u201d <em>Skorpios Properties, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Waage, </em>172 Conn. 152, 156, 374 A.2d 165 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 764, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 50.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In our search for an expression of legislative intent, it is helpful to compare \u00a7 49-31b (a) with other statutes governing the validity of mortgages that are contained in chapter 846 of the General Statutes. A particularly illuminating model for comparison is General Statutes \u00a7 49-5b, entitled \u201cRequired information in a mortgage contingency clause,\u201d which sets forth minimum standards for satisfaction of the requirements of the statute of frauds, General Statutes \u00a7 52-550. See <em>Maturo </em>v. <em>Scranton, </em>177 Conn. 569, 571 n.l, 418 A.2d 928 (1979). Section 49-5b provides that such a clause \u201cshall satisfy\u201d \u00a7 52-550 \u201cif such mortgage contingency clause contains at least the following: (1) The principal amount in dollars of the loan the purchaser must obtain to fulfill such contingency; (2) the limit of the time period within which a commitment for such loan must be obtained, and (3) the term of the mortgage expressed in years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Section 49-31b (a) differs from \u00a7 49-5b in several significant respects. One obvious difference is that the title of \u00a7 49-3 lb contains no language to indicate that the information described in the statute is \u201crequired.\u201d Section 49-5b\u2019s title explicitly makes reference to \u201c[Required information.\u201d Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 49-4b <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>(title makes reference to \u201cMortgage deed requirements\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 49-10 (\u201cRequirements for assignments of obligations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Section 49-31b (a) also lacks the mandatory language of \u00a7 49-5b. Section 49-31b (a) states that a mortgage deed \u201cshall be deemed to give <em>sufficient </em>notice\u201d if it provides the information enumerated therein. (Emphasis added.) Similar language is contained in General Statutes \u00a7 49-3, which validates mortgages to secure future advances when they contain stipulated clauses that the statute describes as \u201csufficiently definite and certain.\u201d We have construed \u00a7 49-3 to preserve alternate common law rules governing the validity of such mortgages. <em>Sadd </em>v. Heim, 143 Conn. 582, 589, 124 A.2d 522 (1956).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 49-5b, by contrast, contains no qualifying language, providing directly that a mortgage contingency clause \u201cshall satisfy\u201d the statute of frauds if it contains the specified provisions. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 49-4b (\u201cIf an open-end mortgage meets the requirements of this section, [it] shall secure the obligation of any person who is secondarily liable for an open-end loan . . .\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 49-16 (\u201cThe certificate [of foreclosure] shall be recorded in the records of the town where the premises are situated and shall be substantially in the form following . . .\u201d); see generally General Statutes \u00a7 49-2 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Section 49-3 lb (a) describes its standards in words of general rather than specific instruction when it states that a mortgage deed satisfies notice requirements if it \u201cfurnishes information from which can be determined\u201d the date, principal amount and maximum term of the underlying obligation. Such open-ended phraseology is inconsistent with legislative intent to supplant the common law. \u201c[G]eneral and comprehensive legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>tion, where course of conduct, parties, things affected, limitations and exceptions are minutely described, indicates a legislative intent that the statute should totally supersede and replace the common law dealing with the subject matter.\u201d 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 50.05, pp. 440-41; <em>State </em>v. Salafia, 29 Conn. Sup. 305, 313, 284 A.2d 576 (1971). Again, the contrast with \u00a7 49-5b is significant. While \u00a7 49-3 lb (a) describes a general duty to \u201c[furnish] information,\u201d \u00a7 49-5b specifically enumerates the information that a mortgage contingency clause must contain in order to satisfy the statute of frauds. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 49-4a (b) (requirements of open-ended mortgages held by United States or its instrumentalities); \u00a7 49-4b (b), (c) and (d) (requirements for open-end mortgages as security for guaranty of open-end loans).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Because the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law, the proper construction of any statute must take into account the mandates of related statutes governing the same general subject matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>192 Conn. 488, 494, 472 A.2d 775 (1984); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 422, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980). Comparing the language of \u00a7 49-31b (a) with that of other statutes governing real property mortgages, we conclude that \u00a7 49-3 lb (a) was not intended to supersede established common law principles regarding minimum notice requirements for the validity of mortgages challenged by third party creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">This conclusion is reinforced by a comparison of the text of \u00a7 49-31b (a), not with statutes imposing mandatory minimum requirements, but rather with regulations that have been been interpreted to furnish a \u201csafe harbor.\u201d Section 49-31b (a) provides that mortgage deeds containing certain information \u201cshall be deemed\u201d to give sufficient notice of the obligations they secure. \u201c[S]hall be deemed\u201d is the operative phrase in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>several federal regulations that have been interpreted as stipulating conditions that are sufficient but not necessary for compliance with legally imposed standards. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation D, for example, which provides an exemption from securities registration requirements for certain types of securities offers and sales, provides in part: \u201cOffers and sales of securities by an issuer that satisfy [enumerated conditions] <em>shall be deemed </em>to be transactions not involving any public offering . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.506 (a) (1986); see <em>Securities Industry Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Governors, </em>807 F.2d 1052, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (construing Regulation D as \u201csafe harbor\u201d). Similarly, a United States department of labor regulation governing employers\u2019 reporting and disclosure of information relating to employee pension plans provides: \u201cThe administrator of a pension plan . . . <em>shall be deemed </em>to satisfy [such provisions]\u201d by complying with the conditions enumerated in the regulation. (Emphasis added.) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2520.104-23 (b) (1986); see <em>Barrowclough </em>v. <em>Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., </em>752 F.2d 923, 932 (3d Cir. 1985) (construing regulation as a \u201csafe harbor\u201d). These regulatory analogies support a construction of \u00a7 49-31b (a) as a \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision. See generally 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 53.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The plaintiff cites the legislative history of \u00a7 49-3 lb (a) as evidence that the legislature intended the statute to replace applicable common law standards. In the legislative debate on House Bill No. 5630, now designated as \u00a7 49-3 lb (a), it was noted that the bill was intended to have no effect on mortgages executed and recorded before the bill became law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>argument, that \u201c[o]nly if the legislature had thought that it was setting new standards\u201d would legislators have been concerned about the effect of the bill on pre-existing mortgages, is speculative at best. While the floor debate does evince a legislative intent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u00a7 49-3 lb (a) have only prospective application, it does not aid our resolution of the question of whether the statute was intended to supplant the common law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We conclude that \u00a7 49-3lb (a) is a \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision that does not preempt common law standards governing the validity of mortgages against subsequent lien creditors. Accordingly, we now address the validity of the defendant\u2019s mortgages in light of these common law standards. In our consideration of this question, we acknowledge the substantial assistance furnished to the court by the comprehensive and well reasoned brief of the amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In order for a mortgagee to prevail over the claim of a third party lien creditor, our case law has consistently affirmed the principle that the mortgage deed must provide, on its face, \u201creasonable notice\u201d of the obligation it purports to secure. <em>Sadd </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>supra, 585; <em>Bridgeport Land &amp; Title Co. </em>v. <em>Orlove Co., </em>91 Conn. 496, 498-99, 100 A. 30 (1917); <em>Pettibone </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>4 Conn. 158, 162 (1822). The purpose of the notice requirement is to prevent subsequent third parties from being defrauded or otherwise misled by inaccuracies and omissions in the record that conceal the true nature of the secured obligation. <em>Sadd </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>supra; <em>Bridgeport Land &amp; Title Co. </em>v. <em>Orlove Co., </em>supra, 499; <em>Matz </em>v. <em>Arick, </em>76 Conn. 388, 391, 56 A. 630 (1904); see 2 M. Merrill, Notice (1952) \u00a7 1067. It is not necessary, however, that a mortgage deed recite with par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ticularity all of the details of the underlying transaction. \u201cThe object of the [mortgage] is to identify the note or debt secured by the mortgage and give reasonable notice of the extent of the encumbrance. All the terms of the note are not essential to that object; hence all need not be stated.\u201d <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>54 Conn. 24, 27, 5 A. 354 (1886); <em>Peoples Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Corvado, </em>151 Conn. 388, 391, 198 A.2d 209 (1964); <em>Lampson Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Chiarelli, </em>100 Conn. 301, 309, 123 A. 909 (1924). Errors and omissions in the recorded mortgage that would not mislead a title searcher as to the true nature of the secured obligation do not affect the validity of the mortgage against third parties. 2 M. Merrill, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The \u201creasonable notice\u201d necessary to prevent the misleading of subsequent lienors includes, at minimum, notice of the \u201cnature and amount of the encumbrance which the mortgagor intends to place upon the land.\u201d <em>Sadd </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>supra; <em>Peoples Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Corrado, </em>supra; <em>Bridgeport Land &amp; Title Co. </em>v. <em>Orlove Co., </em>supra, 497; <em>Merrills </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>18 Conn. 257, 265 (1847). The \u201cnature\u201d of a secured debt includes such fundamental characteristics as whether the debt is absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or whether it is given to secure an existing liability or future advances. <em>Sadd </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>supra, 585-86; <em>Merrills </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>supra. The \u201camount\u201d of the debt is the dollar value of the obligation secured, to the extent that it can be ascertained at the time the mortgage is executed. If the debt cannot be definitively ascertained at that time, \u201csuch data must be set out with respect to that debt as will put anyone interested in the inquiry upon a track leading to discovery. . . .\u201d <em>Sadd </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>supra, 586; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Nutt, </em>34 Conn. 501, 504 (1868); 1 L. Jones, Mortgages (8th Ed. 1928) \u00a7 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the defendant\u2019s mortgages are invalid is based on the mistaken premise that \u201c[o]ur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>recording system is predicated upon the principle that one searching the land records can learn <em>all he needs to know </em>about the ownership of the land and its encumbrances from the records themselves.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This argument overstates the purpose of record notice. The record need not recapitulate all the particulars of a secured obligation, provided it includes enough information to allow subsequent creditors, \u201cby common prudence and by the exercise of ordinary diligence, [to] ascertain the extent of the incumbrance.\u201d <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>National Grain Corporation, </em>103 Conn. 657, 663, 131 A. 404 (1925). A creditor who wants to know all of the terms of a secured obligation may inquire of the parties themselves, or examine the note or other instrument evidencing the obligation. <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>supra, 30-31; see <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>National Grain Corporation, </em>supra; <em>Pettibone </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>supra. In modern secured lending, such inquiry is prudent as a matter of course. A potential secured creditor may wish to know, for example, whether a mortgagee has exercised rights under an acceleration clause, or whether contemplated future advances have in fact been made, or whether a mortgagor has exercised rights to extend or renew a promissory note. No creditor can expect to glean all of this information from the record alone. The record is the starting point for inquiry, not, as the plaintiff claims, the starting and ending point.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Our case law elucidates the circumstances in which a subsequent lien creditor can legitimately complain that a mortgage has failed to provide reasonable notice of the nature and amount of the secured obligation. Mortgages have been held invalid for: (1) misidentifying a future obligation as a debt currently due; <em>Sadd </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>supra; <em>Matz </em>v. <em>Arick, </em>supra; (2) misidentifying a contingent obligation as an absolute obligation; <em>North </em>v. <em>Belden, </em>13 Conn. 376 (1840); <em>Sanford </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Wheeler, </em>13 Conn. 165 (1839); (3) misidentifying a promise to perform future services as a promissory note for a sum certain; <em>Bramhall </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>41 Conn. 68 (1874); (4) failing to state the amount of the secured debt when the debt could be definitively ascertained; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Chalker, </em>14 Conn. 77 (1840); (5) failing to define the nature and maximum amount of future advances purportedly secured; <em>Bridgeport Land &amp; Title Co. </em>v. <em>Orlove Co., </em>supra; and (6) claiming security in an amount in excess of the actual amount due. <em>McKnight </em>v. <em>Gizze, </em>107 Conn. 229, 140 A. 116 (1928); <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>51 Conn. 446 (1883). In all of these cases, the omission or misstatement in the mortgage obscured the nature or amount of the secured obligation, potentially misleading subsequent lien creditors relying on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The plaintiffs sole challenge to the validity of the defendant\u2019s mortgages is that they fail to state the maximum term of the promissory note. Failure to state the maximum term of a promissory note, however, does not, of itself, render a mortgage invalid. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Kilbride, </em>58 Conn. 109, 109-10, 119, 19 A. 519 (1889); <em>Merrills </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>supra, 266-67; see also <em>Lampson Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Chiarelli, </em>supra, 312 (no invalidation for failure to state time period for performance of obligation secured by mortgage); <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>supra, 27 (no invalidation for failure to state terms for payment of interest); see generally 9 G. Thompson, Real Property (1958 Replacement) \u00a7 4744, p. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">We reiterate that a mortgage need not set forth all of the terms of the underlying obligation provided that it gives notice of the nature and amount of the obligation, so that subsequent lien creditors are not misled. The plaintiff has expressly disavowed any claim that the mortgages in this case defrauded or otherwise misled subsequent lien creditors. We conclude, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>fore, that the mortgages are not invalid under our common law for failure to state the maximum term of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The question certified to us from the district court asked us to determine whether the defendant\u2019s mortgages \u201care valid and enforceable in light of the provisions of section 49-3 lb (a) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d Having concluded that \u00a7 49-31b (a) does not supplant common law standards for the validity of mortgages, and that the defendant\u2019s mortgages are valid under those common law standards, we answer the certified question: \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-5\"> Title 11 of the United States Code, \u00a7 544, provides in relevant part: \u201cTRUSTEE AS LIEN CREDITOR AND AS SUCCESSOR TO CERTAIN CREDITORS AND PURCHASERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201c(a) The trustee shall have, as of the commencement of the case, and without regard to any knowledge of the trustee or of any creditor, the rights and powers of, or may avoid any transfer of property of the debtor or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable by\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\u201c(1) a creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case, and that obtains, at such time and with respect to such credit, a judicial lien on all property on which a creditor on a simple contract could have obtained such a judicial lien, whether or not such a creditor exists;</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\u201c(2) a creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case, and obtains, at such time and with respect to such credit, an execution against the debtor that is returned unsatisfied at such time, whether or not such a creditor exists; or</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">\u201c(3) a bona fide purchaser of real property, other than fixtures, from the debtor, against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected, that obtains the status of a bona fide purchaser and has perfected such transfer at the time of the commencement of the case, whether or not such a purchaser exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107 (a), a chapter 11 debtor-in-possession, such as the plaintiff, may exercise the powers of a trustee under \u00a7 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">The Unsecured Creditors Committee in the plaintiff\u2019s chapter 11 case is a party in the plaintiffs bankruptcy proceeding; see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 705; and, therefore, a party to the certification question before this court. Its arguments in favor of invalidating the defendant\u2019s mortgages are substantially similar to those of the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199a, the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, provides in relevant part: \u201cuniform certification of questions of law act.

Slosberg and the mortgage deed dated March 11,1980 [sic], from Dart &amp; Bogue Company, Inc. f/k/a Arctos Corporation to Milton O. Slosberg are valid and enforceable in light of the provisions of Section 49-31b (a) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d Although the certified question asks us to consider the general validity of the defendant\u2019s mortgages under applicable Connecticut law, the sole issue raised by the parties before this court is whether the mortgages are invalid for failing to state the maximum term of the promissory note. Accordingly, we limit our review to a determination of that particular question. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185 (formerly \u00a7 3063).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> The named grantor on the mortgage and maker on the note is Arctos Corporation. Arctos Corporation is the plaintiffs prior name. On this certification, we treat Arctos and the plaintiff as the same entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\"> The relevant provision, identical in both mortgages, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A93\">\u201cTHE CONDITION OF THIS DEED is such that whereas the Grantor is justly indebted to the Grantee in the amount of ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,450,000.00) by virtue of its promissory note of even date with this instrument, by which note, for value received, the Grantor promises to pay to the order of the Grantee said sum with interest at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum from the date of said note, payable upon the unpaid principal balance until fully paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASl\">With regard to the supplemental mortgage, the reference to the note \u201cof even date with this instrument\u201d is obviously incorrect, since the supplemental mortgage was executed on March 11, 1981, and the note on November 13,1980. The plaintiff makes no claim, however, that this mistake has any bearing on the supplemental mortgage\u2019s validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> <em>Sadd </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>143 Conn. 582, 124 A.2d 522 (1956), construed the statutory predecessor of \u00a7 49-3, General Statutes \u00a7 2970d.

Section 2 of the bill obliges that a mortgage deed shall constitute a valid lien on the premises described therein if the note is secured by said mortgage and sufficiently described therein by reference to the date the principal amount thereof and the maximum term thereof; namely, the maturity date. I urge passage of the bill Mr. Speaker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cThe Speaker: Gentleman from the 136th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">\u201cRep. Alan H.

Representative Lowden replied: \u201cNot unless they are invalid on the face of them. We haven\u2019t done anything to disturb them. They remain at status quo.\u201d 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1976 Sess., p. 2149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\"> We note, however, that the originally proposed version of General Statutes \u00a7 49-31b (a); Raised Committee Bill No. 5677, General Assembly, February Sess., 1976; included a statement of purpose which provided, inter alia, that the bill was intended to clarify that the information included on certain federally sponsored mortgage forms would satisfy common law notice-giving requirements. The statement of purpose is additional evidence that \u00a7 49-31b (a) was intended to supplement, rather than supplant, common law standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\"> Our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s mortgages are valid under common law criteria makes it unnecessary to determine whether they would also be valid under the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 49-31b (a). Specifically, we do not address the defendant\u2019s argument that, because the mortgages stated the name and address of the mortgagee, they satisfied \u00a7 49-31b (a) by providing \u201cinformation from which there can be determined\u201d the maximum term of the note. We note, however, that such an interpretation would be consistent with the provisions for record notice of security interests in personal property under Article 9 of our Uniform Commercial Code; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-401 et seq.; which our legislature enacted in 1959, fifteen years before it enacted \u00a7 49a-31b (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
