Because the continuing validity of a number of pre-1985 grand juries is affected by our resolution of this issue, this is an unusual case demanding expedited resolution. Accordingly, we announce herewith our decision that Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611, as clarified by Public Acts 1986, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>No. 86-317, did not revoke the authority of or alter the procedures governing investigatory grand juries that had been properly authorized before October 1,1985. A full opinion will be filed in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">There is error, the judgment of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
