The trial court granted a motion for reservation upon stipulated facts to determine the propriety of the defendant\u2019s computation of the plaintiff\u2019s gross earnings tax. We conclude that the reserved question<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is to be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. The plaintiff is a Delaware corporation authorized to do business in this state. On its invoices to Connecticut purchasers of its petroleum products, the plaintiff charged these purchasers separately for the sales price and for the 2 percent Connecticut gross earnings tax that it collected from them pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-587.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In filing its quarterly gross earnings tax returns between December 31, 1980, and March 31, 1984, the plaintiff did not report as gross earnings the 2 percent which, in its invoices, it had labeled as a separate charge for the gross earnings tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Disagreeing with the plaintiffs exclusion of the 2 percent in its calculation of the gross earnings tax, the department of revenue services notified the plaintiff that it owed an additional gross earnings tax on the excluded 2 percent charge for the relevant tax years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought administrative relief from this rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-595<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but the defendant, after a hearing, upheld the department\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was liable for the additional tax, interest and penalties. The plaintiff paid this amount in full, under protest, as it was required to do by General Statutes \u00a7 12-600,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> before commencing its appeal to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-597.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>In the trial court, the parties jointly requested that the case be reserved for appellate advice on the stated question of law whether the gross earnings upon which \u00a7 12-587 levies a tax includes the 2 percent charge collected by the plaintiff taxpayer from its customers. The trial court granted this request, and, after transfer of the appeal to this court, the present proceedings ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Before we reach the merits of the reserved question, three preliminary matters warrant brief clarification. First, because the statute authorizing reservations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-235,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> does not require that a case be at the final judgment stage when the reservation is brought, this court has jurisdiction to decide the reserved question even though the case is here on an interlocutory appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 4147 (formerly \u00a7 3133)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, </em>192 Conn. 671, 681-85, 474 A.2d 760 (1984); <em>New Haven Metal &amp; Heating Sup</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>ply Co. </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>128 Conn. 213, 218, 21 A.2d 383 (1941). Second, because this case is an appeal from an adverse ruling of the commissioner of revenue services, the plaintiff is entitled to a plenary review of its challenge of its tax assessment, and is not limited to an administrative appeal under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. General Statutes \u00a7 4-186<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; Practice Book \u00a7 257 (d) (3)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; see <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 421, 521 A.2d 569 (1987); <em>Xerox Corporation </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>175 Conn. 301, 303, 397 A.2d 1367 (1978). Third, because the question posed by the reservation principally concerns the imposition of a tax, and not a claimed right to an exemption or a deduction, the taxing statute must be strictly construed against the taxing authority and in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Schlumberger </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 420-23; <em>The B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 6, 8-9, 490 A.2d 991 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The crucial question raised by the reservation is what meaning to attach to that portion of \u00a7 12-587 which imposes a 2 percent tax on \u201cthe amount of gross earnings from the sale of petroleum products within this state.\u201d We approach this question according to well established principles of statutory construction designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 572, 522 A.2d 763 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987); <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Starting, as we must, with the language of the statute itself, we note that \u00a7 12-587 defines \u201cgross earnings\u201d in two alternative ways: \u201c(1) in the case of a corporation, those earnings from the sale of petroleum products to which the sales factor is applied under subdivision (3) [now (b)] of section 12-218 and (2) in the case of any other company, those earnings from such sales made within this state.\u201d Both parties have addressed their attention only to subsection (1). The sales factor of General Statutes \u00a7 12-218,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u00a7 12-587 (1) refers, is one component of a three factor formula designed to apportion to Connecticut, for the purposes of the corporation business tax, a portion of the taxable income of multistate corporations whose income is derived, inter alia, from the sale of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>property. <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 416. This factor is defined, in \u00a7 12-218, as \u201cthe part of the taxpayer\u2019s gross receipts from sales or other sources during the income year . . . which is assignable to the state.\u201d The difficulty created by the cross-reference to \u00a7 12-218 is the statutory disparity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>between the coverage of the petroleum products tax and the corporation business tax. While \u00a7 12-587 purports to tax \u201cgross earnings,\u201d the income that \u00a7 12-218 apportions to this state is a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cnet income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In the face of this statutory conundrum, the parties have, not surprisingly, proffered alternate constructions of \u201cgross earnings\u201d in \u00a7 12-587. Their disagreement revolves around four issues. First, does the statutory definition of \u201cgross earnings\u201d in \u00a7 12-587 have a plain and unambiguous meaning that we must enforce? Second, if the statute requires construction beyond its plain meaning, what inferences should be drawn from its legislative history and the purpose it was intended to serve? Third, what insights do related statutes offer about the legislature\u2019s intention in its choice of language in this section? Fourth, to what extent does the statute authorize administrative elaboration of those provisions that cannot readily be applied literally?</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s principal argument is that its tax liability is governed by the express language of \u00a7 12-587 (1) which, it maintains, plainly and unambiguously precludes the inclusion in gross income of the 2 percent tax imposed upon it but collected from its customers. The plaintiff reads the definition of \u201cgross earnings\u201d in \u00a7 12-587 (1) as containing two component parts, neither of which renders this 2 percent charge taxable. Specifically, the plaintiff argues, moneys collected from consumers for taxes are plainly neither \u201cearnings from the sale of petroleum products\u201d nor do they fall within the \u201cnet income\u201d to which the \u00a7 12-218 sales factor applies. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The first half of the plaintiff\u2019s statutory argument, on which it relies in passing, cannot withstand independent analysis. What the legislature intended by defining \u201cgross earnings\u201d as \u201cearnings from the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of petroleum products\u201d can hardly be deemed to be plain and unambiguous on its face. The heart of the disagreement between the parties is how to define the relevant \u201cearnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The weightier part of the plaintiffs statutory argument is its insistence that we must read literally and apply strictly the statutory instruction that \u201cgross earnings\u201d are \u201cthose earnings . . . to which the sales factor <em>is applied\u201d </em>under \u00a7 12-218 (b). (Emphasis added.) Because the sales factor is applied, by that statute, to net income, the plaintiff maintains that \u201cgross earnings\u201d under \u00a7 12-587 are limited to net income. Pursuing that syllogism, the plaintiff argues that its \u201cgross earnings\u201d do not include tax payments that are normally deductible in the calculation of net income.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The difficulty with this argument is that it proves too much. If \u201cgross earnings\u201d are indeed to be measured by \u201cnet income,\u201d expenses other than taxes would also be deductible from gross receipts in order to determine the basis upon which the \u00a7 12-587 tax is to be levied. To its credit, not even the plaintiff has pursued the logic of its position to this extreme. Nonetheless, the logical consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s position demonstrates that the legislature could not have intended the irrational result that would follow from an equation of \u201cgross earnings\u201d with net income. We must reject an interpretation of \u00a7 12-587 that would have the statute operate in a way that is \u201cdifficult and possibly bizarre.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>supra, 558-59; <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 152, 480 A.2d 519 (1984).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>It is possible to ascribe meaningful content to the cross-reference in \u00a7 12-587 to the sales factor in \u00a7 12-218 (b) if we read that cross-reference to incorporate only the sales factor itself and not its net income attributes. Such a construction is plausible because \u00a7 12-218 is not a taxing statute but is, instead, an allocation statute. All that \u00a7 12-218 purports to do is to assign to Connecticut that portion of a multistate corporation\u2019s income that may thereafter, under \u00a7 12-214, be taxed in Connecticut pursuant to the corporation business tax. <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra. Presumably, the legislature included a reference to \u00a7 12-218 (b) in the \u201cgross earnings\u201d definition of \u00a7 12-587 in order to reflect its understanding of the prevailing multistate system for the refining and distribution of petroleum products. See <em>Mobil Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>492 F. Sup. 1004, 1006 (D. Conn. 1980), aff\u2019d in part and dismissed in part, 639 F.2d 919 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 967, 101 S. Ct. 3122, 69 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1981). What is most significant in \u00a7 12-218 (b), therefore, for purposes of the petroleum gross earnings tax, is its description of the components of the sales factor, i.e., \u201cgross receipts,\u201d and not that this factor is applied, for apportionment purposes, to net income. Informed by \u00a7 12-218, therefore, the statutory definition of \u201cgross earnings\u201d in \u00a7 12-587 instructs us to look to the usual meaning of \u201cgross receipts.\u201d Such a definition, because it is not plain and unambiguous, requires recourse to more than linguistic analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In order to shed further light on the scope of \u201cgross earnings\u201d in \u00a7 12-587, we turn next to an examination of the purpose that the gross earnings tax on petroleum products was intended to serve. The legislature expressly described that purpose in General Statutes \u00a7 12-599 (a), which states: \u201cIt is not the intention of the general assembly that the tax imposed under section 12-587 be construed as a tax upon purchasers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>petroleum products, but that such tax shall be levied upon and be collectible from petroleum companies as defined in section 12-587, and that such tax shall constitute a part of the operating overhead of such companies.\u201d Subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-599<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> enjoined petroleum companies subject to the tax from raising their wholesale prices in Connecticut by any amount higher than the average amount of wholesale price increases \u201cin all ports on the eastern coast of the United States.\u201d Upon a challenge to the constitutionality of the antipassthrough provision of \u00a7 12-599 (b), that subsection was held invalid because it conflicted with the federal Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 and with federal mandatory petroleum price regulations. <em>Mobil Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 1011-14. The plaintiff maintains that this history demonstrates that the legislature, intent upon avoiding a pass through of the tax, did not contemplate a tax levy that included in its base the amount of the tax that, after the federal decision, became payable by petroleum customers. The defendant argues, to the contrary, that the unenforceability of \u00a7 12-599 (b), for constitutional reasons, does not disturb the legislative intent, manifested in \u00a7 12-599 (a), that the petroleum products tax be treated as an item of operating overhead measured, under \u00a7 12-587, by gross earnings derived from the sales of petroleum products in Connecticut. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In enacting the gross earnings tax on petroleum products, the legislature was entitled to pursue more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>than one statutory objective. In addition to its intent to limit price increases to Connecticut customers of petroleum products, the legislature was free to impose a gross earnings tax as part of the operating overhead costs of Connecticut producers and distributors of petroleum products. Neither in this case nor in the federal litigation concerning \u00a7 12-599 (b) has a constitutional challenge been raised to this latter aspect of what the legislature chose to do. <em>Mobil Oil Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 1006. Perhaps in anticipation of the constitutional vulnerability of its anti-passthrough provision, the legislature expressly provided for the sever-ability of any part of the petroleum products tax that might be held invalid or unconstitutional, so that the remaining \u201csections, parts, clauses and phrases\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 12-587 to 12-602, inclusive, \u201cshall remain in full force and effect.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-601.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although the legislature\u2019s first preference, to have the petroleum distributors bear the entire cost of the gross earnings tax, cannot be implemented constitutionally, we are obligated to enforce its secondary preference that the petroleum products tax be treated as an item of operating overhead measured by gross earnings derived from the sale of petroleum products in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In order to give effect to the legislative purpose stated in \u00a7 12-599 (a), we must construe \u201cgross earnings\u201d in \u00a7 12-587 in such a way that the tax \u201cconstitute[s] a part of the operating overhead\u201d of companies that produce and distribute petroleum products. In furtherance of our task we may usefully consider existing legislation in related areas of the law; <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>192 Conn. 488, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>494, 472 A.2d 775 (1984); and the judicial construction that such legislation has previously received. <em>C. White &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>181 Conn. 114, 123, 434 A.2d 949 (1980). In a number of cases interpreting \u201cgross earnings\u201d under the utilities companies tax; General Statutes \u00a7 12-264<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; we have held that \u201cgross earnings\u201d include a taxpayer\u2019s \u201centire earnings and receipts.\u201d <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>152 Conn. 671, 673, 211 A.2d 697 (1965); <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>131 Conn. 1, 6, 37 A.2d 361 (1944); <em>State </em>v. <em>United Electric Light &amp; Water Co., </em>90 Conn. 452, 460, 97 A. 857 (1916). That construction furnishes a particularly appropriate analogy in this case because of the cross-reference in \u00a7 12-587 to the sales factor in \u00a7 12-218, which, as previously noted, describes the relevant inquiry as one concerned with \u201cgross receipts.\u201d In the absence of a specific statutory exemption for tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>receipts, we conclude, on the basis of these precedents, that \u00a7 12-587 includes within \u201cgross earnings\u201d the amounts that the plaintiff has collected as taxes passed through to its customers. This result is not altered by the fact that, for its own accounting purposes, the plaintiff billed its customers separately for the sales price of its petroleum products and for the taxes it collected from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Finally, the result we reach finds support in an administrative regulation issued by the defendant. The legislature gave the defendant express authority, in General Statutes \u00a7 12-602,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to adopt regulations to implement the provisions of the act imposing a gross earnings tax on petroleum products. Regulations properly promulgated under \u00a7 12-602 \u201cshall be prima facie evidence of the proper interpretation\u201d of the act. The relevant regulation, enacted in 1983 as \u00a7 12-602-la (c) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, states: \u201c \u2018Gross earnings' mean and include gross receipts from the initial sale of petroleum products, but do not include the amount of state or federal excise taxes on gasoline or special fuel.\u201d By its express exclusion of some taxes, but not the ones here in question, from the definition of \u201cgross earnings\u201d in \u00a7 12-587, the defendant has provided \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d that the statute is to be interpreted to include within the plaintiff's tax basis the tax payments that it has collected from its customers. The regulation\u2019s equation of \u201cgross eam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ings\u201d with \u201cgross receipts\u201d is consistent with our own analysis of the various statutes that illuminate what the legislature intended to encompass in the statutory definitions contained in \u00a7 12-587.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Ordinarily \u201cthe construction of a statute on an issue that has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny is a question of law on which an administrative ruling is not entitled to special deference.\u201d <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 423. If, however, a governmental agency\u2019s \u201ctime-tested\u201d interpretation of a statute is reasonable, that interpretation should be acccorded great weight by the courts. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 555-56, 400 A.2d 712 (1978); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>168 Conn. 478, 493, 362 A.2d 785 (1975). The plaintiff argues, however, that the regulation impermissibly enlarges the statutory definitions contained in \u00a7 12-587, and that, so interpreted, the regulation exceeds the power of an administrative agency to prescribe rules and regulations. We conclude, however, that the regulation is entirely reasonable and consistent with the statutory mandate of \u00a7 12-587. Furthermore, we note that the principal case on which the plaintiff relies; <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 144, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986); lends additional credibility to the position of the defendant in this case. In the absence of any submission to the contrary, we may assume that Regulation 12-602-la (c) was promulgated, as \u00a7 12-602 requires, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by chapter 54 of the General Statutes, the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189. Those procedures include the submission of proposed regulations to the legislative regulation review com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>mittee for its approval. General Statutes \u00a7 4-170.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As we held in <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, legislative ratification of a proposed regulation supports the position that the regulation is consistent with the general statutory-scheme that the regulation was designed to implement.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The question that was reserved to this court stated the issue as follows: \u201cWas the two percent charge, which was noted on Getty invoices as a charge for the Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax, includable in Getty\u2019s gross earnings derived from the sale of petroleum products and subject to a two percent tax under Section 12-587?\u201d For the reasons stated above, our answer to the reserved question is \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-5\"> The Connecticut gross earnings tax on the sale of petroleum products is codified in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-587 through 12-602.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\"> After the filing of the appeal in the Superior Court, Texaco, Inc., acquired Getty Refining and Marketing Company, Inc.

Any taxpayer which is taxable both within and without this state shall apportion its net income as provided in this section. For purposes of apportionment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>of income under this section, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if in such state such taxpayer conducts business and is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax, or if such state has jurisdiction to subject such taxpayer to such a tax, regardless of whether such state does, in fact, impose such a tax. The net income of the taxpayer shall be apportioned as follows: (a) Such income, when derived from business other than the manufacture, sale or use of tangible personal or real property, shall be apportioned within and without the state by means of an apportionment fraction, the numerator of which shall represent the gross receipts from business carried on within Connecticut and the denominator shall represent the gross receipts from business carried on everywhere, except that any gross receipts attributable to an international banking facility, as defined in section 12-217, shall not be included in the numerator or the denominator; (b) when derived from the manufacture, sale or use of tangible personal or real property, the portion thereof attributable to business within the state shall be determined by means of an apportionment fraction to be computed as the sum of the property factor, the payroll factor and twice the receipts factor, divided by four. The first of these fractions, the property factor, shall represent that part of the average monthly net book value of the total tangible property held and owned by the taxpayer during the income year which is held within the state, without deduction on account of any encumbrance thereon, and the value of tangible property rented to the taxpayer computed by multiplying the gross rents payable during the income year or period by eight. For the purpose of this section, gross rents shall be the actual sum of money or other consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer or for its benefit for the use or possession of the property, excluding royalties, but including interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or any other amount required to be paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement and a proportionate part of the cost of any improvement to the real property made by or on behalf of the taxpayer which reverts to the owner or lessor upon termination of a lease or other arrangement, based on the unexpired term of the lease commencing with the date the improvement is completed, provided, where a building is erected on leased land by or on behalf of the taxpayer, the value of the land is determined by multiplying the gross rent by eight, and the value of the building is determined in the same manner as if owned by the taxpayer. The second fraction, the payroll factor, shall represent the part of the total wages, salaries and other compensation to employees paid by the taxpayer during the income year which was paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>in this state, excluding any such wages, salaries or other compensation attributable to the production of gross income of an international banking facility as defined in section 12-217. Compensation is paid in this state if (i) the individual\u2019s service is performed entirely within the state; or (ii) the individual\u2019s service is performed both within and without the state, but the service performed without the state is incidental to the individual\u2019s service within the state; or (iii) some of the service is performed in the state and (1) the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the state, or (2) the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual\u2019s residence is in this state. The third fraction, the receipts factor, shall represent the part of the taxpayer\u2019s gross receipts from sales or other sources during the income year, computed according to the method of accounting used in the computation of its entire net income, which is assignable to the state, and excluding any gross receipts attributable to an international banking facility as defined in section 12-217, but including receipts from sales of tangible property if the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser within this state, other than a company which qualifies as a Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) as defined in Section 992 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and as to which a valid election under Subsection (b) of said Section 992 to be treated as a DISC is effective, regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale, receipts from services performed within the state, rentals and royalties from properties situated within the state, royalties from the use of patents or copyrights within the state, interest managed or controlled within the state, net gains from the sale or other disposition of intangible assets managed or controlled within the state, net gains from the sale or other disposition of tangible assets situated within the state and all other receipts earned within the state; and (c) any motor bus company carrying on business partly without the state shall apportion to this state its net income derived from carrying of passengers for hire by means of an apportionment fraction, the numerator of which shall represent the total number of miles operated within this state and the denominator of which shall represent the total number of miles operated everywhere, but income derived by motor bus companies from sources other than the carrying of passengers for hire shall be apportioned as herein otherwise provided.
