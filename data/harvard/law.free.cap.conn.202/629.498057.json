Bunkley, appeals from convictions and sentences on various counts of a substitute information containing six counts. The first count charged the defendant with engaging police in pursuit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-223 (b); the next three counts charged the defendant with manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the fifth and sixth counts charged the defendant with assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The charges had as their basis a collision between two automobiles in East Hartford on August 13,1982, that caused the deaths of three persons and injuries to two others.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A jury found the defendant guilty of engaging police in pursuit, and of so much of the information as charged him with manslaughter in the second degree and assault in the third degree. See General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-56, 53a-61.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court imposed a sentence of unconditional discharge on the first count. The defendant received an effective sentence of imprisonment for twenty-two years for the manslaughter and assault convictions. Only the judgment with respect to the manslaughter and assault counts are here on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The defendant urges seven assignments of error. Specifically, he contends that the trial judge erred in: (1) refusing to grant the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal; (2) permitting the state to charge him with and the jury to convict him of manslaughter and assault under the facts of this case; (3) refusing to permit the defendant to cross-examine two police officers concerning their knowledge of a civil suit filed against them on behalf of the victims of the accident that gave rise to the charges filed against the defendant; (4) refusing to disqualify the office of the state\u2019s attorney after it was disclosed that a member of that office formerly represented the defendant in criminal matters; (5) excluding, as irrelevant, evidence of a speed survey conducted by police at the scene of the accident; (6) failing to instruct the jury properly on the defendant\u2019s state of mind; and (7) sentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment for several deaths arising from a single automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The evidence adduced at trial showed that on August 13, 1982, Jean Hopkins was working as an assistant manager at Billy Four, a clothing store in the Charter Oak Mall on Silver Lane in East Hartford. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>was on duty around noon when she observed a man crouching between the clothing racks in the store. Hopkins approached the man and asked him whether he needed help. The man answered that he did not need assistance, and walked quickly toward an exit. Hopkins then noticed a laundry bag on the floor near where the man had been standing. When examined, the bag contained seventeen pairs of jeans that had been removed from the clothing racks. Hopkins subsequently identified the defendant as the man in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">At about the same time, Susan Johnson, the manager of Billy Four, was on her way out of the store when she overheard the conversation between Hopkins and a man she later identified as the defendant. As she returned to meet with Hopkins, she saw a bag at the man\u2019s feet and observed his hasty departure. After Johnson told Hopkins to push the \u201cpanic button,\u201d she followed the defendant out of the store and into a parking lot. She saw him enter a brown Lincoln automobile and then drive off at a high rate of speed. In the parking lot she caught sight of a police officer sitting in a parked police vehicle. Before she could reach the officer to report the incident, he was driving away. Meantime, back at the store, Hopkins had pushed the panic button to activate a system designed to signal the East Hartford police department. No signal was given. The system was disconnected. Testimony at trial established that the police did not learn of the episode in Billy Four until after the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Officer Richard Rohner of the East Hartford police department testified that as he sat in his standing police vehicle in the Charter Oak Mall at approximately noon on August 13, 1982, he noticed a brown Lincoln automobile going at a high rate of speed through the parking lot over to Forbes Street. Rohner immediately followed the car and saw it turn south onto Forbes Street without stopping for a red light. At this time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Rohner signalled the operator of the Lincoln to stop by turning on a siren and flashing blue lights. The driver failed to stop. As Rohner proceeded south on Forbes Street he saw the Lincoln pass through a red light and turn west onto Silver Lane. Rohner pursued the Lincoln and while doing so radioed for assistance. Officer Patricia Topliff of the East Hartford police department heard Rohner\u2019s call and joined the ensuing chase on Silver Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Silver Lane is a four-lane highway which runs generally east and west. It is undisputed that the defendant was proceeding westerly, that at the same time Eleanor Mitchell was operating a motor vehicle easterly along Silver Lane, and that traffic was heavy in both directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Rohner testified that he pursued the defendant at rates of speed ranging up to sixty miles per hour. A witness, Thomas Saggio, testified that he was travelling west in the left lane of Silver Lane when the defendant\u2019s vehicle passed him on the right, cut over into the left lane and struck his vehicle. Other witnesses testified that the defendant swerved back and forth in the westbound lanes, at one time going off the road, and then over the center line between the east and westbound lanes. Another witness driving easterly testified that the defendant was straddling the center line and missed his car by inches. A passenger in that vehicle saw the collision of the defendant\u2019s car with the Mitchell vehicle in the rear view mirror. That witness testified that the defendant\u2019s car crossed over the center line of the highway into the eastbound lane and struck the other vehicle head on. The defendant admitted that at the moment of impact he was operating the Lincoln at a speed of sixty to seventy miles per hour. Eleanor Mitchell and her daughters, Anne Marie and Sharon, who were passengers in her vehicle, were killed. Her son Todd and his friend, William Luchon, who were also riding as passengers, were seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Each count of manslaughter in the substitute information charged that the defendant, under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, recklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another person and thereby caused the death of another person. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). Each assault count alleged that under similar circumstances the defendant\u2019s reckless conduct caused serious physical injury to another person. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). The crimes as charged included the elements that constituted the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the second degree and assault in the third degree. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1), 53a-61 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved for a bill of particulars and in response thereto the state filed a bill specifying that the reckless manner in which the defendant operated a motor vehicle, so that the lives and safety of the public might be in danger, consisted of the operation of said motor vehicle at an excessive rate of speed, improper passing, and the operation of said motor vehicle on the wrong side of the road.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>response appears to have satisfied the defendant. At no time thereafter did the defendant move for a supplemental bill of particulars, nor did he request a statement of the essential facts claimed to constitute the offenses charged. See Practice Book \u00a7 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">After the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant filed a written motion for a judgment of acquittal. The motion was denied. At the close of all the evidence, the defendant again moved for a judgment of acquittal. The trial court reserved decision on the motion and submitted the case to the jury. After the jury returned guilty verdicts on the lesser offenses of manslaughter in the second degree and assault in the third degree, the court denied the motion. Prior to the imposition of sentence, the defendant filed motions for a new trial, for acquittal, and in arrest of judgment. Each motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s second allegation of error wherein he contends that the state\u2019s attorney improperly charged him with the crimes of manslaughter and assault. The defendant argues that the prosecutor exceeded his authority by charging the defendant with the \u201cgeneric\u201d crime of manslaughter in contravention of a legislative scheme to treat motor vehicle homicides in a specific manner. He further argues that the manslaughter and assault statutes under which he was tried and convicted are unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. We reject both aspects of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">A comparison between the former Connecticut law relating to the crime of homicide and the law as it currently exists will be helpful in understanding the issues involved in this assignment of error and the basis of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Homicide under former Connecticut law was of two kinds, murder and manslaughter. See General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 1140 et seq. Murder was classified into two categories, murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree, and our statutes expressly defined the types of conduct which constituted murder. See General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Manslaughter was not statutorily defined. See General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 1143. It is fair to presume, there being nothing to indicate the contrary, that it was the legislative intention to borrow the common law definition of manslaughter. This assumption comports with our principle of statutory construction that technical words which \u201chave acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Manslaughter in the words of Zephaniah Swift is the unlawful killing of another, without malice, express or implied, and may be either voluntary upon a sudden heat of passion, or involuntary in the commission of some unlawful act, or negligently in doing a lawful act. Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1796) p. 305. Our case law divided the crime of manslaughter into two categories, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. The crime of involuntary manslaughter historically included vehicular homicide. Whoever caused death because of \u201cculpable negligence,\u201d \u201cgross negligence,\u201d or \u201crecklessness\u201d in the act of operating a motor vehicle was subject to punishment under the manslaughter statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Block, </em>87 Conn. 573, 89 A. 167 (1913); <em>State </em>v. <em>Goetz, </em>83 Conn. 437, 76 A. 1000 (1910); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>82 Conn. 671, 74 A. 927 (1910). Frequently, these various degrees of negligence eluded exact definition and often were used interchangeably. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra, 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>In 1918, the legislature enacted stringent and detailed provisions respecting vehicular homicide. General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 6191 provided in relevant part that \u201cevery person operating a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state, who shall, in consequence of his intoxication or of any gross or wilful misconduct or negligence, cause any loss of life . . . shall be fined . . . or imprisoned . . . or both.\u201d Even after enactment of \u00a7 6191, however, persons were still charged with involuntary manslaughter, if the circumstances surrounding the vehicular homicide were particularly egregious. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>120 Conn. 231, 180 A. 287 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The defendant acknowledges that, in the past, persons were indeed charged with the common law crime of involuntary manslaughter for operating a motor vehicle so as to cause death. He points out, however, that common law crimes were abolished following the adoption of our penal code in 1969, and further points out that our penal code contains specific sections pertaining to death caused by improper operation of an automobile; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-56b, 53a-57 and former \u00a7 53a-58a (now \u00a7 14-222a); and our motor vehicle laws provide rules for vehicle use of the highways. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-219, 14-222, 14-232. The defendant contends that these statutes ought to be interpreted in such a way as to indicate a clear legislative intent to render a person criminally liable for a vehicular homicide only in accordance with these statutes, and to preclude prosecution under other criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The penal code made significant changes in our criminal law. Manslaughter is now statutorily defined and is classified into two categories, first and second degree manslaughter. The mental states required for the commission of each category of manslaughter are specifically defined. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>(13). The code also distinguishes reckless from criminally negligent conduct. A person acts <em>recklessly </em>if he is \u201caware of and <em>consciously disregards </em>a substantial and unjustifiable risk,\u201d and \u201cacts with \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 . . . when <em>he fails to perceive </em>a substantial and unjustifiable risk.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13) and (14).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The defendant readily admits that our statutes relating to vehicular homicide are applicable if death occurs through <em>criminal negligence </em>or simply through <em>negligence </em>in the operation of a motor vehicle. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-57,14-222a. He does not dispute that the crimes of first and second degree manslaughter include death resulting from <em>reckless </em>conduct. Nevertheless he continues to maintain that we should infer from the adoption of statutes expressly dealing with vehicular homicide, a legislative intent that persons causing death while operating a motor vehicle should be prosecuted only under those provisions. This argument is wholly without merit. It may be disposed of by little more than saying so.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The argument, we think, misapprehends the purpose and effect of the relevant statutes in chapter 952 of title 53a of the General Statutes. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58 (a) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>nally negligent homicide when, with criminal negligence, he causes the death of another person, <em>except </em>where the [actor] caused such death by a motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This statute expressly excepts from its operation deaths caused by a motor vehicle. The legislature has thus manifested an intent to treat an actor who causes death through the criminally negligent operation of a motor vehicle differently than an actor who, with criminal negligence, causes death by means <em>other than </em>the operation of a motor vehicle. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57. In view of this difference in treatment, a violation of \u00a7 53a-57 is classified as a class D felony whereas a violation of \u00a7 53a-58 is only a class A misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The legislature, however, has made no such exception to the <em>manslaughter </em>provisions of chapter 952. The only provision in our homicide statutes which provides an exception for deaths caused by a motor vehicle is \u00a7 53a-58, the criminally negligent homicide statute. Principles of statutory construction lead us to conclude that the legislature did not intend such an exception to exist in our manslaughter provisions. We cannot create an exception to a statute in the very same chapter which the legislature itself has not created either expressly or by implication. See <em>State ex rel. Heimov </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>131 Conn. 8, 12, 37 A.2d 689 (1944); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 47.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">This conclusion is strengthened by reference to \u00a7 53a-57, the statute under which the defendant argues he should have been charged. That statute, by its express terms, only applies to an actor who, \u201cwith <em>criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle, </em>\u201d causes the death of another. (Emphasis added.) That statute is absolutely silent as to any criminal sanction where an actor, acting with a <em>more culpable state of mind, </em>causes the death of another in the operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>of a motor vehicle. Accordingly, because the legislature knows how to create an exception in a statute as it did in \u00a7 53a-58, and did not do so anywhere else in the relevant statutory scheme of chapter 952, the defendant, given the more culpable state of mind required under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), was properly charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">This approach does not denigrate the rubric that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed in favor of a defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>175 Conn. 279, 291, 397 A.2d 1352 (1978). Rather, statutory construction in the relevant statutory scheme justifies such a reasonable evaluation of legislative intent where criminal sanctions are made commensurate with the degree of culpability of the actor as the statutory scheme indicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The defendant raises no claim at this juncture that the statutes under which he was prosecuted are unconstitutional. His argument therefore raises no question of judicial construction but only one of legislative policy with which courts cannot interfere unless constitutional guarantees have been violated. We are not inclined to create an exception to our manslaughter statutes for every person operating a motor vehicle on a highway of the state who, in consequence of reckless operation, causes a loss of life. We are even less inclined to relax the rule so plainly laid down in other cases. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>193 Conn. 632, 479 A.2d 218 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra. It is a matter of common knowledge that many lives are .lost and many persons injured through the reckless operation of motor vehicles on the public highways. The safety of the public from injury and loss of life from the reckless operation of motor vehicles well may have been thought by the legislature to be of such supervening importance as to warrant the inclusion of a motor vehicle in the statutory definition of a \u201cdangerous instrument.\u201d See Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (7). The prosecution of the defendant for the crimes of manslaughter and assault was therefore not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The defendant also objects to being charged with manslaughter under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) on the ground that the statute as applied to him in this case is unconstitutionally vague. Specifically, he contends that the standard of recklessness, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13), is unconstitutionally vague because it did not give him fair warning as to when his conduct became reckless as opposed to criminally negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The so-called \u201cvagueness\u201d doctrine is broadly based on constitutional requirements of due process. Under both the state and federal constitutions, \u201c[a] defendant is constitutionally entitled \u2018to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\u2019 against him. Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 8; U.S. Const., amend VI.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 269, 368 A.2d 222 (1976). \u201c[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 167, 377 A.2d 263 (1977). We have previously stated that in order to withstand a vagueness challenge, a law \u201cmust give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly.\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>169 Conn. 140, 143, 363 A.2d 68 (1975); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The defendant was accused in three separate counts of the crime of manslaughter in the first degree. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>substitute information charged that the defendant, under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, <em>recklessly </em>engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another and thereby caused death. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). Turning to the bill of particulars, we note that the defendant was fully and clearly informed that he had operated a motor vehicle recklessly. The operation of a motor vehicle upon a public highway is a clearly defined act, susceptible of being easily understood. Its operation recklessly is a description of a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We do not agree with the defendant that it is impossible to draw a sound line of distinction between vehicular homicides caused by criminal negligence on the one hand, and recklessness on the other hand, and say that one is specific and certain and the other vague and indefinite. To operate a motor vehicle upon a public highway recklessly is not an intangible act. It has specific relation to possible contact with human beings.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13), a person acts <em>recklessly </em>when he \u201cis aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk.\u201d A person acts with <em>criminal negligence </em>\u201cwhen he fails to perceive\u201d such a risk. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14). The difference between these mental states is clear. Recklessness involves a <em>subjective realization </em>of a risk and a conscious decision to ignore that risk; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghiloni, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 570, 573, 398 A.2d 1204 (1978); whereas criminal negligence concerns a failure to realize that risk. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14). The record in this case shows beyond doubt that the defendant knew what he was charged with and that he was not misled in any way in the preparation of his defense. The statutes under which the defendant was charged are not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that his motions for judgment of acquittal were erroneously-denied. He argues that the state failed to prove the crimes of manslaughter in the second degree and assault in the third degree beyond a reasonable doubt because no evidence was introduced to show that his conduct amounted to recklessness; that is, that he was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). It is the defendant\u2019s position that the unexpected entry of a vehicle from a private driveway onto the highway obstructed his view and caused the collision with the Mitchell vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">This court is bound by well settled rules when a jury verdict is challenged on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict. We will not weigh the evidence nor resolve questions concerning the credibility of witnesses. Instead, we look to that evidence most favorable to the state and to all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. If, from that viewpoint, there is substantial evidence of probative value to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict as to each element of the crime, the verdict will not be disturbed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>184 Conn. 400, 403, 439 A.2d 1040 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>176 Conn. 257, 262, 407 A.2d 948 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The testimony established that at the time of the collision the defendant was driving at an excessive rate of speed, having no regard to the traffic on the highway. Eyewitnesses testified that the defendant disregarded overhead traffic signals, failed to stop upon signal by a police officer, improperly passed other vehicles and failed to drive in the proper lane. In our view, the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom permitted the jury to determine that the defendant had driven recklessly.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Recklessness is an essential element of the crimes of manslaughter and assault and must be proven by the state beyond a reasonable doubt. We have recognized the difficulty of proving by direct evidence that an accused subjectively realized and chose to ignore a substantial risk. We have held, therefore, that \u201c[t]he state of mind amounting to recklessness may be inferred from conduct.\u201d <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Wabrek, </em>129 Conn. 302, 308, 27 A.2d 631 (1942); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghiloni, </em>supra; W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law (2d Ed.) \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">From the testimony it is clear that the defendant knew or should have known that his driving conduct was in violation of the law and that death and injury was a probable consequence of his violations. The jury was free to disregard the evidence pertaining to the unexpected entry of another vehicle from a private driveway onto the highway. The defendant has merely pointed to a conflict in the evidence, the resolution of which is for the jury and not a proper consideration for this court. In sum, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was guilty of manslaughter in the second degree and assault in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court erred in certain rulings at trial. First, he contends that the court erred in refusing to allow him to cross-examine two state witnesses concerning a civil action filed against them on behalf of the victims of the collision. Next, he claims the court erred in excluding evidence of a speed survey conducted by the police at the scene of the collision. We find no error in either ruling by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The facts pertinent to the cross-examination claim may be summarized. During the cross-examination of Rohner, the defendant asked whether the Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>family and the Mitchell estate had filed a lawsuit against the officer. After objection by the state, the court ruled that the defendant could inquire whether the officer knew of the civil action, remarking that \u201c[ajnything that would go to show bias, motivation and prejudice is admissible.\u201d The court also allowed the defendant to inquire whether Rohner was aware of the specific allegations in the complaint. The defendant was not allowed to inquire, however, as to the specific allegations themselves. Specifically, the defendant was prohibited from revealing to the jury that the civil complaint alleged reckless misconduct on the part of the officers who pursued the defendant. The court stated that questions concerning the specific allegations made in the complaint would only raise collateral matters and confuse the jury. The same issue arose during the cross-examination of Topliff and following objection, inquiry into the specific allegations of the complaint was prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In an apparent attempt to rehabilitate Rohner, the state, on redirect examination, elicited testimony from Rohner that he did not fear financial loss from the pending civil action because the officers who were sued were indemnified by an insurance company. The state then requested that the court take judicial notice of a letter in the court file of the pending civil case. The letter, which was from the East Hartford corporation counsel, indicated that the municipality would pay any damages assessed against the officers. The defendant objected, arguing that the letter was irrelevant, prejudicial and not a proper subject for judicial notice. The court overruled the objection and took judicial notice of the letter, part of which was later read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The defendant contends that the court\u2019s refusal to allow questions concerning the specific allegations of the civil complaint denied him the opportunity to attack the officers\u2019 credibility by a showing of possible bias. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>According to the defendant, without knowledge of the complaint the jury was deprived of facts necessary to judge the officers\u2019 reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The sixth amendment to the federal constitution guarantees an accused in a criminal prosecution the right to confront witnesses against him. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 481, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985). \u201cThe primary interest secured by the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is the right to cross-examination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>197 Conn. 602, 608, 500 A.2d 555 (1985); see <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S. Ct. 1074, 13 L. Ed. 2d 934 (1965). One important function of cross-examination is to expose a witness\u2019s possible motivation in testifying. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Privitera, </em>1 Conn. App. 709, 712, 476 A.2d 605 (1984). To comport with sixth amendment standards, the defendant must be allowed to \u201cexpose to the jury the facts from which the jurors, as sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Several of our recent decisions have discussed the issue of whether, and to what extent, a prosecution witness may be cross-examined regarding a related civil action that the <em>witness </em>has filed against the <em>defendant. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Balias, </em>180 Conn. 662, 433 A.2d 989 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Privitera, </em>supra. In the present case, the civil suit was filed by a third party against the witnesses. We may look to those recent decisions for guidance, however, because the underlying concerns in those cases were essentially the same as those underlying the present case. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>supra, 610, we explained that: \u201c \u2018As a general rule cross-examination of the prosecuting witness should be allowed to show the <em>pendency, existence </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>status </em>of [a] civil action . . . arising out of the same set of circumstances as those which served as the basis for the criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delucia, </em>40 Or. App. 711, 596 P.2d 585, 587 (1979); see also annot., 98 A.L.R.3d 1060. Because the trial court in <em>Milum, </em>did not allow any inquiry into the pendency of the civil action, we found error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>supra; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Privitera, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In the present case, the defendant was allowed to question the officers as to their awareness of the pending civil action and also as to their knowledge of the specific allegations in the action. We have held that this degree of inquiry is sufficient to bring to the jury\u2019s attention facts which may impugn a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Balias, </em>supra, 676-77. The trial court here did not violate sixth amendment standards by refusing to allow questions regarding the specific allegations themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We also hold that the trial court\u2019s rulings did not constitute an abuse of discretion. A trial court \u201c \u2018may restrict a cross-examination to evidence which is competent, material, and relevant . . . .\u2019\u201d Id., 676. Here, the trial judge disallowed the questions, ruling that they raised collateral issues and could confuse the jury. He correctly pointed out that the recklessness or gross negligence of one party is not a defense to a claim of recklessness against another party. See, e.g., <em>Menzie </em>v. <em>Kalmonowitz, </em>107 Conn. 197, 200, 139 A.2d 698 (1928). The trial court\u2019s ruling was well within its discretionary powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The court also did not commit error by taking judicial notice of the letter from the East Hartford corporation counsel and admitting it into evidence. A court has the power to take judicial notice of the file in another case pending in that court. <em>Guerriero </em>v. <em>Galasso, </em>144 Conn. 600, 605, 136 A.2d 497 (1957). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>trial court also has the power to determine the relevancy of evidence, and in exercising that power, is given broad discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>197 Conn. 595, 601, 500 A.2d 551 (1985). It was well within the court\u2019s discretion to decide that the letter was relevant for rehabilitation purposes. Even though Rohner did not know of the letter\u2019s existence, the evidence clearly revealed that he knew he was indemnified. The letter thus tended to corroborate Rohner\u2019s testimony that he did not fear personal financial loss from the pending civil suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The defendant\u2019s second evidentiary claim is that the court erroneously excluded a speed survey made by the police at the scene of the accident. This survey, which was conducted by a member of the East Hartford police department within two weeks of the accident, measured the speed of the eastbound traffic on Silver Lane at about the same time of the day and in the place that the accident occurred. The survey revealed that the highest speed recorded was 82 m.p.h., the lowest was 16 m.p.h., and that the average speed, excluding the highest and lowest, was slightly over 37 m.p.h.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The defendant claimed the evidence was relevant to determine whether the defendant\u2019s driving conduct evinced an extreme indifference to human life and constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe. The court rejected this argument and ruled that the evidence was not relevant to any issue before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">We have already noted that the trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevance of evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>supra. Once again, we are hard pressed to find that the court\u2019s ruling in this instance constituted an abuse of that discretion. The trial court noted, sua sponte, that the survey was confined to vehicles travelling east while the defendant here had been travelling west. The court further noted that often, vehicles travelling in one direction, for example, away from a particular site during the lunch or rush hours, will travel at a rate of speed different from those travel-ling in the opposite direction. These observations by the court highlight the irrelevance of the survey. In addition, the violation of speeding laws at the site of the accident by others has little, if any, relevance to the question of whether the defendant\u2019s entire course of conduct at the time and place in question was reckless. In short, we fail to find a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion in this ruling.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>196 Conn. 557, 566, 494 A.2d 1190 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The defendant next contends that the entire office of the state\u2019s attorney should have been disqualified from the defendant\u2019s case because of an alleged conflict of interest. Prior to trial, the defendant moved that the office of the state\u2019s attorney for the Hartford-New Britain judicial district be disqualified on the ground that an assistant state\u2019s attorney in that office, Dennis O\u2019Connor, had previously represented the defendant in criminal matters. During an evidentiary hearing, it was revealed that O\u2019Connor had been a deputy assistant public defender in Hartford from October, 1976, to November, 1979, and that during that time he had represented the defendant. O\u2019Connor could not recall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the number of times he had represented the defendant. He was, however, able to identify the defendant in court. There was no evidence that their prior association was in any way related to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">O\u2019Connor did not immediately inform the other prosecutors in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office of his prior association with the defendant when he learned of the present prosecution. Several months prior to trial, however, he believes that he informed the state\u2019s attorney, John M. Bailey, and other prosecutors of this fact. On one occasion, O\u2019Connor was present when an assistant state\u2019s attorney, Kevin McMahon, and an investigator were discussing some aspects of the defendant\u2019s case. O\u2019Connor could not recall anything of the conversation except that he informed McMahon and the investigator that he thought he had represented the defendant while serving as a public defender. O\u2019Connor also recalled that he and several prosecutors had been subpoenaed by the defendant to testify at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information based on selective prosecution. He further testified that prior to that hearing he and some of the other prosecutors who had been subpoenaed discussed the issues raised in that motion and discussed the elements of the manslaughter and vehicular homicide statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Following the hearing, the trial court disqualified O\u2019Connor and McMahon from any further participation in the defendant\u2019s case. The court refused, however, to disqualify any of the other prosecutors affiliated with the office of the state\u2019s attorney for the Hartford-New Britain judicial district from further proceedings in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>180 Conn. 443, 429 A.2d 936 (1980), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>186 Conn. 547, 442 A.2d 939 (1982), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Moeller </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>459 U.S. 838, 103 S. Ct. 85, 74 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 80 (1982), the matter of attorney disqualification was extensively discussed. There, we explained that the trial court has broad discretion in determining whether an attorney should be disqualified, due to an alleged breach in confidentiality or conflict of interest. Id., 448. Noting Canons 4 and 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we set forth essentially a two part test to be employed when a claim of disqualification arises. Disqualification of an attorney is warranted if the moving party establishes first, that \u201che had in the past enjoyed an attorney-client relationship with the attorney\u201d and second, that the attorney had \u201caccepted employment adverse to the interests of a former client on a matter substantially related to the prior litigation.\u201d Id., 449-50. Under the substantial relationship portion of the test, disqualification is the proper sanction only upon a showing that the relationship between the issues in the prior and present cases is \u201cpatently clear\u201d or where the issues are \u201cessentially the same.\u201d Id., 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Employing the two part test, we held in <em>Jones </em>that disqualification of a prosecutor who had formerly represented the defendant was a proper sanction, but that disqualification of the office of the state\u2019s attorney was not warranted. Id., 452, 457. The defendant recognizes our holding in <em>Jones </em>but argues that the case is distinguishable. In <em>Jones, </em>there was no evidence that the prosecutor had discussed the defendant\u2019s case with other prosecutors. In the present case, however, the evidence clearly disclosed that the discussions as hereinabove set forth took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The defendant maintains that O\u2019Connor\u2019s prior representation enabled him to obtain \u201cconfidential informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>tion\u201d about the defendant\u2019s personal background, his family, and his medical and drug problems. He claims that this information was relevant to the defendant\u2019s mental state, which is one of the essential elements of the crimes charged. Because O\u2019Connor discussed the elements of the crimes with other prosecutors, the defendant contends that there was opportunity for O\u2019Connor to disclose the background information concerning the defendant to the other prosecutors. This opportunity, he claims, in and of itself, required disqualification of the entire office of the state\u2019s attorney. The trial court rejected this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The record does indicate conduct on the part of O\u2019Connor which deserves criticism. When O\u2019Connor recalled his former representation, he had a duty to remove himself entirely from <em>any </em>further contact with anyone involved in prosecuting his former client. Due regard for avoidance of even the appearance of ethical impropriety required his immediate and total withdrawal. The fact that O\u2019Connor deviated from this standard does not, however, in and of itself require disqualification of the other prosecutors in the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">There was evidence to show that O\u2019Connor overheard a conversation between another prosecutor and an investigator, and had discussed with several prosecutors the defendant\u2019s selective prosecution motion in connection with which they had been subpoenaed. There was no evidence, however, that O\u2019Connor ever discussed the factual issues or merits of the defendant\u2019s case with the other prosecutors. Of more importance, there was no evidence that O\u2019Connor confided in the other prosecutors any information or knowledge of the defendant\u2019s background that he had acquired during his prior association with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">As we explained in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 452-53, \u201cthe appearance of impropriety alone is \u2018simply too slender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>a reed on which to rest a disqualification order except in the rarest of cases.\u2019 <em>Board of Education of the City of New York </em>v. <em>Nyquist, </em>590 F.2d 1241, 1247 (2d Cir. 1979).\u201d In many of the cases where entire firms have been disqualified, those firms had obtained some advantage in the pending litigation because of their access to prior confidential communications between the lawyer and his former client. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 454; see, e.g., <em>NCK Organization, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Bregman, </em>542 F.2d 128, 135 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Canadian Gulf Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Triton International Carriers, Ltd., </em>434 F. Sup. 691, 695 (D. Conn. 1976). The record does not reveal such an advantage in the present case. Other courts have ordered firm disqualification where one attorney had actually been involved on the opposing side in the pending litigation, or in matters substantially related to it. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Uzzi, </em>549 F. Sup. 979, 984 (S.D.N.Y. 1982); <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Marlayne, Inc., </em>163 N.J. Super. 529, 541, 395 A.2d 255 (1978), aff\u2019d, 83 N.J. 460, 416 A.2d 852 (1980). Clearly, that is not the situation in the present case. There was no evidence that O\u2019Connor\u2019s prior association with the defendant was related in any way to the present litigation. Under the facts of this case, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion to disqualify all of the prosecutors. Our conclusion, however, does not forestall further inquiry in another proceeding, into what information the prosecutors obtained, directly or even indirectly from O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim of error is that the court improperly charged the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state. His challenge is divided into three parts. He contends that the court erred first, in its instructions on the element of recklessness, second, in instructing the jury that a person is responsible for the natural consequences of his acts, and third, in not allowing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>jury to consider whether the defendant had lost control of his vehicle prior to the fatal collision. We reject each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">It is well established that in reviewing instructions to the jury, we do not read the challenged portions in isolation but consider the charge as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 268, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 206, 445 A.2d 314 (1982). A reversal is required only if it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s challenge to the portion of the charge regarding the definition of recklessness. At one point in its instructions, the court summarized the definition of recklessness but omitted the element of an awareness and conscious disregard of the risk. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). It is the defendant\u2019s position that this instruction diluted the state\u2019s burden of proving every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). The defendant did not take exception to this portion of the charge. We will consider his claim, however, because the failure to instruct a jury properly on an element of the offense is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 512-13, 518 A.2d 388 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">A short time before giving the challenged instruction, the court defined recklessness to the jury and included the element of an awareness of and conscious disregard of the risk. The court later instructed the jury on the issue of manslaughter in the second degree and again gave the complete definition of recklessness. Finally, in response to the jury\u2019s request for supplemental instructions on several aspects of the case, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>read the complete statutory definition of recklessness to the jury. Considering this charge as a whole, we cannot conclude that the jury could reasonably have been misled as to the meaning of recklessness. Although the jury on one occasion heard an incomplete definition of recklessness in the context of a summary of the term, the complete definition was given on three other occasions. The court also informed the jury that the state must prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We are convinced, therefore, that the jury was correctly informed as to the definition of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The defendant next claims that a portion of the court\u2019s instructions violated the holding in <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979). The court here told the jury that \u201cEvery person is held to be responsible for the natural consequences of his acts.\u201d In <em>Sandstrom, </em>a similar instruction was held to have violated a defendant\u2019s due process rights because the jury might have interpreted the statement as a conclusive or burden-shifting presumption, thereby relieving the state of its burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 517-24.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the defendant here took no exception to the portion of the instruction at issue, his claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>199 Conn. 30, 33, 505 A.2d 699 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\u201cIn reviewing instructions to the jury the court looks at the charge as a whole, and will not sever one portion and analyze it in isolation from the rest.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>178 Conn. 689, 693, 425 A.2d 111 (1979); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lenczyk, </em>1 Conn. App. 270, 273, 470 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>A.2d 1240 (1984). When the court\u2019s statement here is viewed in its proper context, it is clear that no violation of <em>Sandstrom </em>occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The jury in this case had been informed that a civil suit was pending against the officers who had pursued the defendant. After making the challenged statement the court continued to instruct the jury that if an accused \u201ccommits a felonious act, it does not alter its nature or diminish its criminality to prove that other causes cooperated to produce that result.\u201d The court concluded this portion of its instructions as follows: \u201cIt is for these reasons that I charge you that whatever role the conduct of Officers Rohner and Topliff had in the final result is wholly irrelevant and immaterial to Daryl Bunkley\u2019s criminal liability, and cannot be used to insulate the defendant . . . from criminal responsibility.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The challenged portion was thus given as part of the court\u2019s instructions as to the legal effect that the officers\u2019 conduct might have on the defendant\u2019s liability. The instructions, including the challenged sentence, properly stated the law with regard to this issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Spates, </em>176 Conn. 227, 235, 405 A.2d 656 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 922, 99 S. Ct. 1248, 59 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alterio, </em>154 Conn. 23, 30, 220 A.2d 451 (1966). Since the challenged statement was not given as part of the court\u2019s instruction on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>element of the crimes charged, it did not shift the state\u2019s burden of proving the elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Compare <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>185 Conn. 163, 171, 440 A.2d 858 (1981), aff'd, 460 U.S. 73, 103 S. Ct. 969, 74 L. Ed. 2d 823 (1983). The charge therefore did not violate the dictates of <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The defendant\u2019s final challenge to the instructions concerns the court\u2019s refusal to instruct that loss of control of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was relevant to determining the defendant\u2019s state of mind. The defendant filed a request to charge which asked essentially that the jury be told that the defendant\u2019s necessary mental state had to be formed prior to the time when the defendant lost control of his vehicle. The court declined to give the requested instruction, informing the jury instead that whether the defendant had control of his vehicle prior to the fatal collision was immaterial and irrelevant to his criminal liability. The defendant duly excepted to the instruction as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The purpose of a court\u2019s instructions is to give the jury <em>\u201ca </em>clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged and the proper guidance to determine if those elements were present.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>166 Conn. 569, 574, 353 A.2d 776 (1974). Instructions to the jury need not be in the precise language of a request. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The court here charged the jury on the specific elements of the crime of manslaughter in the first degree, including the element of recklessness. It then instructed the jury on proximate cause, stating that if the defendant set in motion a chain of events that led to the victims\u2019 death without interruption from other causes, then he may be found to have caused those deaths. The court concluded by stating that whether the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ant had control of his vehicle immediately prior to the collision was therefore immaterial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">From this brief summary of the court\u2019s instructions on manslaughter, it is clear that the jury was clearly and fully instructed on the elements of the crime including the element of recklessness and on the necessary causal connection between any reckless conduct and the resulting deaths. The court\u2019s refusal to deliver the charge requested by the defendant was a proper exercise of its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that his conviction and consecutive punishment for the manslaughter and assault counts arising from one accident violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. See U.S. Const., amend. VIII. We recently rejected double jeopardy challenges to consecutive sentences imposed for the felony murder of two victims of the same robbery; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 656, 482 A.2d 300 (1984); and for the deaths of fourteen victims of the same act of arson. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 110, 503 A.2d 136 (1985). Our reasoning in both cases was that the statutes under which the defendants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>convicted both used the language \u201ccauses the death of a person.\u201d We explained that: \u201cA fundamental purpose of the criminal law is to protect individual citizens from the criminal conduct of another. People are neither fungible nor amorphous. Where crimes against persons are involved, a separate interest of society has been invaded for each violation. Therefore when two or more persons are the victims of a single episode there are as many offenses as there are victims.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 565-66; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The manslaughter statute under which the defendant was convicted here authorizes a finding of guilt for one who \u201ccauses the death of <em>another person.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1). The assault statute likewise uses the language \u201ccauses serious physical injury to <em>another person. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2). These phrases are quite similar to the language contained in the statutes at issue in <em>Couture </em>and <em>Madera. </em>We therefore adopt the reasoning employed in those decisions and reject the defendant\u2019s claimed violation of the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-55. manslaughter in the first degree: class B felony, (a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ...

The State has no burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s acts were the sole or only acts which caused the final result of the accident and physical injuries to which I will refer in a few minutes. It is for these reasons that I charge you that whatever role the conduct of Officers Rohner and Topliff had in the final result is wholly irrelevant and immaterial to Daryl Bunkley\u2019s criminal liability, and cannot be used to insulate the defendant, Daryl Bunkley, from criminal responsibility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\"> The court\u2019s instructions on proximate cause were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">\u201cA death or injury is a direct proximate cause where it directly and materially contributed to the happening of a subsequent accruing immediate cause of death or injury. As the rule is otherwise stated, if the acts of the defendant were the cause of the death or injury, no more is required.

If you find that this defendant set in a motion a chain of events that led to the death of each of the three victims, without interruption from other causes, then that is sufficient evidence from which you can find that the defendant caused the death of the three victims. I therefore charge you that whether Daryl Bunkley had control of the brown Lincoln he was operating just prior to the fatal impact is immaterial and irrelevant to his criminal liability, and is not a fact for your determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
