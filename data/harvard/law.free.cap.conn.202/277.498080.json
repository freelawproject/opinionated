J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5H\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether the Uniform Commercial Code modifies the common law of accord and satisfaction so that a creditor can now effectively reserve his rights against a debtor while cashing a check that the debtor has explicitly tendered in full satisfaction of an unliquidated debt. The plaintiff, County Fire Door Corporation, brought an action in two counts against the defendant, C. F. Wooding Company, to recover moneys allegedly owed for goods sold and delivered. Before trial, the plaintiff withdrew the first count, a suit on a default judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>obtained in New York. On the second count, the trial court found the issues for the plaintiff and awarded it damages of $2100. The defendant has appealed from the trial court\u2019s subsequent denial of its motion to set aside the judgment against it. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The trial court\u2019s articulation and the exhibits at trial establish the following facts. On November 17, 1981, the defendant ordered a number of metal doors and door frames from the plaintiff. The plaintiff undertook responsibility for delivery of the goods to the worksite. Alleging that the plaintiff\u2019s delay in delivery of the doors and frames had caused additional installation expenses, the defendant back charged the plaintiff an amount of $2180. The defendant informed the plaintiff that, on the basis of this back charge, and other payments and credits not at issue, the remaining balance due the plaintiff was $416.88. The plaintiff responded by denying the validity of this back charge. According to the plaintiff, the balance due on its account was $2618.88. The defendant immediately replied, in writing, that it would stand by its position on the validity of the back charge and the accuracy of its calculation of the amount owed to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The defendant thereafter, on January 10,1983, sent the plaintiff the check that is at the heart of the present controversy. The check was in the amount of $416.88. It bore two legends. On its face was the notation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u2018\u201cFinal payment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">Upjohn Project</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">Purchase Order #3302 dated 11/17/81.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">On the reverse side, the check stated: \u201cBy its endorsement, the payee accepts this check in full satisfaction of all claims against the C. F. Wooding Co. arising out of or relating to the Upjohn Project under Purchase Order #3302, dated 11/17/81.\u201d The plaintiff did not advise the defendant directly that it planned to cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>this check under protest. Instead, the plaintiff crossed out the conditional language on the reverse side of the check and added the following: \u201cThis check is accepted under protest and with full reservation of rights to collect the unpaid balance for which this check is offered in settlement.\u201d The plaintiff then indorsed and deposited the check in its account.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The defendant made no further payments to the plaintiff and the plaintiff brought the present action to recover the remaining amount to which it claimed it was entitled. The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on two grounds. The court agreed with the plaintiff that the enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 42a-l-207<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had deprived debtors generally of the power unilaterally to enforce the terms of a conditional tender of a check to their creditors. Furthermore, in the specific circumstances of this case, the court concluded that the plaintiff could rightfully treat the defendant\u2019s offer of an accord as if it had been a payment on account, because the amount of the tender had been no more than the amount the defendant itself had calculated to be due and owing to the plaintiff. For these reasons, the court awarded the plaintiff $2100 as the unpaid balance of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The defendant\u2019s appeal does not contest the monetary calculation used by the court in arriving at the amount of the judgment against the defendant, but maintains instead that the trial court erred because the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was foreclosed as a matter of law. The defendant maintains that, when the plaintiff knowingly cashed a check explicitly tendered in full satisfaction of an unliquidated debt, the plaintiff became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>bound by the terms of settlement that the check contained. The defendant\u2019s argument takes issue with both aspects of the contrary ruling of the trial court. First, the defendant claims that the plaintiff\u2019s action of cashing this check constituted an acceptance of its offer, including its terms of settlement, despite the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 42a-l-207 for authority to substitute words of protest for words of satisfaction. Second, the defendant claims that the amount that it tendered the plaintiff constituted a valid offer of an accord and satisfaction because the underlying debt was unliquidated in amount. We agree with both of the defendant\u2019s claims. We will, however, take them up in reverse order, because we would not reach the statutory issue if the defendant had failed to establish its common law defense to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">When there is a good faith dispute about the existence of a debt or about the amount that is owed, the common law authorizes the debtor and the creditor to negotiate a contract of accord to settle the outstanding claim. Such a contract is often initiated by the debtor, who offers an accord by tendering a check as \u201cpayment in full\u201d or \u201cin full satisfaction.\u201d If the creditor knowingly cashes such a check, or otherwise exercises full dominion over it, the creditor is deemed to have assented to the offer of accord. Upon acceptance of the offer of accord, the creditor\u2019s receipt of the promised payment discharges the underlying debt and bars any further claim relating thereto, if the contract of accord is supported by consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Kelly </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Kowalsky, </em>186 Conn. 618, 621, 442 A.2d 1355 (1982); <em>W.H. McCune, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revzon, </em>151 Conn. 107, 109, 193 A.2d 601 (1963); <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>43 Conn. 455, 462 (1876); 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts (1981) \u00a7 281; E.A. Farnsworth, Contracts (1982) \u00a7 4.23, esp. p. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">A contract of accord and satisfaction is sufficiently supported by consideration if it settles a monetary claim that is unliquidated in amount. This court has had numerous occasions to decide whether, in the context of accord and satisfaction, a claim is unliquidated when the debtor tenders payment in an amount that does not exceed that to which the creditor is concededly entitled. \u201cWhere it is admitted that one of two specific sums is due, but there is a dispute as to which is the proper amount, the demand is regarded as unliquidated, within the meaning of that term as applied to the subject of accord and satisfaction. . . . Where the claim is unliquidated any sum, given and received in settlement of the dispute, is a sufficient consideration.\u201d <em>Hanley Co. </em>v. <em>American Cement Co., </em>108 Conn. 469, 473, 143 A. 566 (1928); <em>W.H. McCune, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revzon, </em>supra; <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Zion Baptist Church, Inc., </em>143 Conn. 90, 98-99, 119 A.2d 736 (1956); <em>Perryman Burns Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Coal Co. </em>128 Conn. 70, 73, 20 A.2d 404 (1941); <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>supra<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; see also 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts (1981) \u00a7 74, esp. illustration 4; E.A. Farnsworth, supra, \u00a7 4.23, p. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Application of these settled principles to the facts of this case establishes, as the defendant maintains, that the parties entered into a valid contract of accord and satisfaction. The defendant offered in good faith to settle an unliquidated debt by tendering, in full sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>isfaction, the payment of an amount less than that demanded by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the common law, the plaintiff could not simultaneously cash such a check and disown the condition on which it had been tendered. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kowalsky, </em>supra, and authorities therein cited. Having received the promised payment, the plaintiff discharged the defendant from any further obligation on this account, unless the enactment of \u00a7 42a-l-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code has changed this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The principal dispute between the parties is what meaning to ascribe to \u00a7 42a-l-207 when it states that \u201c[a] party who with explicit reservation of rights . . . assents to performance in a manner . . . offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice the rights reserved. Such words as \u2018without prejudice,\u2019 \u2018under protest\u2019 or the like are sufficient.\u201d The plaintiff contends, as the trial court concluded, that this section gave the plaintiff the authority to cash the defendant\u2019s check \u201cunder protest\u201d while reserving the right to pursue the remainder of its underlying claim against the defendant at a later time. The defendant maintains that the statutory reference to \u201cperformance\u201d contemplates something other than the part payment of an unliquidated debt. We noted in <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kowalsky, </em>supra, 622 and n.3, that there was considerable disagreement in the cases and the scholarly commentaries about the scope of the transactions governed by \u00a7 42a-l-207, but did not then undertake to resolve this disagreement. We now decide that \u00a7 42a-l-207 does not displace the common law of accord and satisfaction and that the trial court erred in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Because \u00a7 42a-l-207 is part of the Uniform Commercial Code, it is important to reconcile its provisions with those found in other articles of the code. See <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corporation v. Home, </em>202 Conn. 106, 115, 520 A.2d 162 (1987); <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 448, 456, 518 A.2d 64 (1986); W. Grosse &amp; E. Goggin, \u201cAccord and Satisfaction and the 1-207 Dilemma,\u201d 89 Com. L.J. 537, 544 (1984). Two likely candidates for such a reconciliation are the provisions of article 3, dealing generally with the law of negotiable instruments, including checks; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-3-101 through 42a-3-805; and the provisions of article 2, dealing generally with contracts for the sale of goods. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-101 through 42a-2-725.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Article 3 provides little support for reading \u00a7 42a-l-207 to permit a creditor unilaterally to change the terms of a check tendered in full satisfaction of an unliquidated debt. As the parties have noted, \u00a7 42a-3-112 (1) (f) preserves the negotiability of a check that includes \u201ca term . . . providing that the payee by indorsing or cashing it acknowledges full satisfaction of an obligation of the drawer.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no such validation, anywhere in article 3, for a term on a check that negates a condition that a drawer has incorporated in a negotiable instrument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the contrary, General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-407 takes a dim view of the unauthorized alteration of an instrument. Under \u00a7 42a-3-407 (1) <em>\u201c[a]ny </em>alteration of an instrument is material which changes the contract of <em>any </em>party thereto in <em>any </em>respect . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The effect of the material alteration of a completed instrument is either to discharge the liability, on the instrument, of \u201cany party whose contract is thereby changed,\u201d or to continue the enforceability of the instrument \u201caccording to its original tenor.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-407 (2) and (3). According to this section, the plaintiffs conduct in substituting words of protest for words of satisfaction would have put the plaintiff at risk of discharging the defendant entirely, if such conduct were deemed to have been fraudulent. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-407 (2) (a). Even without a finding of fraud, however, the most for which the plaintiff could hope, under article 3, was to enforce the instrument \u201cin full satisfaction,\u201d because that was \u201cits original tenor.\u201d This result is supported by \u00a7 42a-3-802 (1) (b), which provides that, presumptively, the taking of a negotiable instrument suspends the underlying obligation \u201cuntil the instrument is due,\u201d and that \u201cdischarge of the underlying obligor on the instrument also discharges him on the obligation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>utes \u00a7 42a-3-603 (1), a drawer is discharged from liability on an instrument \u201cto the extent of his payment or satisfaction.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The impact of these various article 3 rules is clear. Because the check tendered by the defendant was only enforceable \u201caccording to its original tenor,\u201d the plaintiff, by receiving \u201cpayment or satisfaction,\u201d discharged the defendant not only on the instrument but also on the underlying obligation. See J. White &amp; R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (2d Ed. 1980) pp. 603-604 n.57. To read \u00a7 42a-l-207 to validate the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in this case would, therefore, fly in the face of the relevant provisions of article 3, which signal the continued vitality of the common law principles of accord and satisfaction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Although \u00a7 42a-l-207 does not fit easily within the principles of article 3 that govern checks, the section has a close and harmonious connection with article 2. Article 2 regulates ongoing conduct relating to performance of contracts for the sale of goods. That article recurrently draws inferences from acquiescence in, or objection to, the performance tendered by one of the contracting parties. A course of performance \u201caccepted or acquiesced in without objection\u201d is relevant to a determination of the meaning of a contract of sale. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-208 (l).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Between merchants, proposals for additional terms will be added to a contract of sale unless there is a timely \u201cnotification of objection.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-207 (2) (c); see W. Grosse &amp; E. Goggin, supra, 551.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A buyer who is confronted by a defective tender of goods must make a seasonable objection or lose his right of rejection. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-602 (1), 42a-2-605,42a-2-606 (1), 42a-2-607 (2);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Plateq Corporation </em>v. <em>Machlett Laborar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>tories, Inc., </em>189 Conn. 433, 441-42, 456 A.2d 786 (1983); <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Saxton Products, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 266, 270-72, 439 A.2d 314 (1981). In an instalment sale, a party aggrieved by nonconformity or default that substantially impairs the value of the contract as a whole will nonetheless have reinstated the contract \u201cif he accepts a nonconforming instalment without seasonably notifying of cancellation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-612 (3).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A contract whose performance has become impracticable requires the buyer, after-notification by the seller, to offer reasonable alternatives for the modification or the termination of the affected contract; the buyer\u2019s failure to respond, within a reasonable period of time, causes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>sales contract to lapse. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-616 (1) and (2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In these and other related circumstances, article 2 urges the contracting parties to engage in a continuing dialogue about what will constitute acceptable performance of their sales contract. See generally J. White &amp; R. Summers, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 3-1 through 3-9. It is entirely consistent with this article 2 policy to provide, as does \u00a7 42a-l-207, a statutory methodology for the effective communication of objections. See J. McDonnell, \u201cPurposive Interpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code: Some Implications for Jurisprudence,\u201d 126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 795, 828 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">From the vantage point of article 2, it is apparent that \u00a7 42a-l-207 contemplates a reservation of rights about some aspect of a possibly nonconforming tender of goods or services or payment in a situation where the aggrieved party may prefer not to terminate the underlying contract as a whole. See, e.g., <em>Cherwell-Ralli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rytman Grain Co., </em>180 Conn. 714, 718, 433 A.2d 984 (1980); W. Grosse &amp; E. Goggin, supra, 551; A. Rosenthal, \u201cDiscord and Satisfaction: Section 1-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code,\u201d 78 Colum. L. Rev. 48, 63 (1978). Indeed, the Official Comment to \u00a7 42a-l-207 itself explains that the section supports ongoing contractual relations by providing \u201cmachinery for the continuation of performance along the lines contemplated by the contract despite a pending dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>pute.\u201d See W.D. Hawkland, \u201cThe Effect of U.C.C. \u00a7 1-207 on the Doctrine of Accord and Satisfaction by Conditional Check,\u201d 74 Com. L.J. 329, 331 (1969). It is significant, furthermore, that the text of \u00a7 42a-l-207 recurrently refers to \u201cperformance,\u201d for \u201cperformance\u201d is a central aspect of the sales transactions governed by article 2. By contrast, article 3 instruments, which promise or order the payment of money, are not characteristically described as being performed by anyone. The contracts encapsulated in various forms of negotiable instruments instead envisage conduct of negotiation or transfer, indorsement or guaranty, payment or acceptance, and honor or dishonor. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 42a-3-201, 42a-3-413, 42a-3-414, 42a-3-416, 42a-3-418; see generally J. White &amp; R. Summers, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 13-6 through 13-10,13-12. We conclude, therefore, that, in circumstances like the present, when performance of a sales contract has come to an end, \u00a7 42a-l-207 was not intended to empower a seller, as payee of a negotiable instrument, to alter that instrument by adding words of protest to a check tendered by a buyer on condition that it be accepted in full satisfaction of an unliquidated debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Our conclusion is supported by the emerging majority of cases in other jurisdictions. While the case law was divided five years ago, when we postponed resolution of the controversy about the meaning of \u00a7 42a-1-207; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kowalsky, </em>supra, 621-22; it is now the view of the substantial majority of courts that have addressed the issue that \u00a7 42a-l-207 does not overrule the common law of accord and satisfaction.

Section 3-802 (3) read as follows: \u201cWhere a check or similar payment instrument provides that it is in full satisfaction of an obligation the payee discharges the underlying obligation by obtaining payment of the instrument unless he establishes that the original obligor has taken unconscionable advantage in the circumstances.\u201d It was deleted in 1952 \u201con the ground that it would work hardship and was open to abuse.\u201d Uniform Commercial Code, 1952 Official Draft (Sup.
