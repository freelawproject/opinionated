J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adn\">This ease concerns the legal sufficiency of various notices sent by a landlord in order to terminate the lease of a tenant occupying federally subsidized housing. The plaintiff, Jefferson Garden Associates, brought a summary process action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-23<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 47a-15<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ant, Doris Greene, to recover possession of the leased premises because of the defendant\u2019s noncompliance with a no pets clause in her lease. The trial court ruled in the plaintiff\u2019s favor both on the plaintiff\u2019s own cause of action and on the defendant\u2019s five special defenses. The defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The relevant facts are largely undisputed. On December 30, 1978, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a written one year lease for the use and occupancy of an apartment at 87F Michael Road in New London. Despite the unequivocal prohibition of article 11 (g) of the lease, in which the tenant agreed \u201cto have no animals or pets of any kind on the premises unless expressly permitted in writing by the LANDLORD,\u201d the defendant continues, without permission, to keep a doberman pinscher in her apartment. The defendant claims that she needs a dog for security reasons. The 1978 lease containing the no pets clause has not been formally renewed by the parties. That lease, however, contained a provision for automatic renewal, entitled \u201cTermination and Renewal,\u201d which stated: \u201cUnless terminated or modified as provided herein, this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>one month each at the foresaid rental, subject to adjustment as herein provided. The TENANT shall execute a new lease at the end of the initial term, if requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The plaintiff undertook to have the defendant either correct her violation of the no pets clause of her lease or vacate her apartment. To that end, the plaintiff sent the defendant three separate termination notices that specifically instructed the defendant that she risked eviction because of her material noncompliance with the no pets clause. These notices detailed timetables within which she might take remedial action or voice objections to the threatened eviction proceedings. When, despite her receipt of these notices, the defendant failed to reply to the warnings they contained, the plaintiff served her with a notice to quit possession and thereafter brought a summary process action seeking immediate possession of the leased premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In response to the plaintiffs summary process action, the defendant filed an answer and several special defenses. She questioned the enforceability of the no pets clause and claimed that the notices sent by the plaintiff did not comply with applicable state and federal statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The trial court found all the issues in favor of the plaintiff. The court concluded that the no pets clause continued to be binding upon the defendant, even though her lease had not been renewed formally, because her original lease had automatically been renewed by its own terms. The court furthermore concluded that the defendant\u2019s concerns about security in the apartment complex did not suffice to permit her to keep a dog in violation of the explicit no pets clause in her lease. These conclusions, which are unchallenged in the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court, establish that the defendant was in material noncompliance with the terms of her lease and that the plaintiff therefore had good cause for termination of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The trial court also concluded that the plaintiff had sent the defendant the termination notices required by state and federal law. The applicable principles of Connecticut law are codified in General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23, and the procedures that are required for a valid eviction are set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 47a-15. In addition, a landlord who seeks to evict a tenant from the Michael Road apartment complex must comply with the applicable federal regulations. These regulations apply because the apartments are part of a low income housing project that was originally constructed with the assistance of a mortgage provided pursuant to section 236 of the National Housing Act; 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-l;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that currently receives rent subsidies under section 8 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under federal law, a landlord seeking to evict a tenant from federally subsidized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>apartments must send such a tenant a section 236 termination notice that complies with the requirements of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 450.4 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (now \u00a7 247.4 [a]) and a section 8 eviction notice that complies with the requirements of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 886.101 and 886.128.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The 1978 lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>stipulated, in article 4 (b), that the landlord\u2019s right to terminate would be governed by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The trial court determined that the plaintiff had complied with these notice requirements by virtue of the three separate termination notices that were introduced into evidence at trial. The plaintiff, on April 12, 1983, sent the the defendant a \u201cnotice of good cause\u201d informing her that her violation of article 11 (g) of the lease forbidding pets, unless remedied, constituted cause for termination of her occupancy of the premises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>That same date,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the plaintiff sent the defendant a second notice, denominated a notice pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-15, which again informed the defendant that, because of her dog, she was in material noncompliance with article 11 (g) of her lease. That notice set May 12,1983, as the date on which the defendant\u2019s rental agreement would terminate unless she remedied her breach within three weeks.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the stipulated date, May 12, 1983, the plaintiff informed the defendant of its intention to terminate her tenancy on June 12,1983, because of her violation of article 11 (g). This third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>notice expressly invited the defendant to voice, either by telephone or in writing, any objections she had to the commencement of eviction proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court found that \u201c[a]ll of these notices were served by mailing one copy of each and hand delivering another copy to the defendant. The defendant admitted that she had received these notices by mail and a copy hand delivered.\u201d The court noted, finally, that the defendant had offered no evidence that the plaintiff had failed to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ply \u201cwith the provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations set forth in her special defenses.\u201d These various factual findings and conclusions of law are the crux of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The defendant\u2019s appeal contests the validity of her eviction in three respects. She claims that the trial court erred, with respect to the relevant notices: (1) in finding that they had been properly delivered; (2) in allowing them to be introduced into evidence at trial; and (3) in concluding that their terms complied with the applicable requirements of state and federal law. We find no error in any of these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The trial court\u2019s findings with respect to the delivery of the notices required by federal and state statute were twofold. Although there was little direct evidence of the manner in which the deliveries had been accomplished, the court heard testimony from the plaintiff\u2019s property manager about the customary manner in which the landlord handled the delivery of such notices. The customary pattern consisted of having notices served \u201cby both hand delivery and mail delivery.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff\u2019s agent testified, without objection, that a notice to quit had been served on the defendant, and that this notice had been followed by the commencement of the summary process action against her. On the basis of this evidentiary record, the court determined that the termination notices had in fact been served \u201cby mailing one copy of each and hand delivering another copy to the defendant.\u201d As previously noted, the court further found that the defendant had admitted, in her testimony at trial, \u201cthat she had received these notices by mail and a copy hand delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The trial court\u2019s findings on delivery and receipt of the notices are findings of fact that must stand unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>they are \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4061 (formerly \u00a7 3060D); <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Alleyne, </em>195 Conn. 399, 403, 488 A.2d 452 (1985); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). The defendant challenges only the court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant evidence, not its admissibility. In these circumstances, the question resolves itself into one of credibility that falls within the province of the trial court. <em>Robert Lawrence Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Del Vecchio, </em>178 Conn. 1, 14, 420 A.2d 1142 (1979); <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Dumouchel Paper Co., </em>154 Conn. 343, 349, 225 A.2d 797 (1966). In weighing the testimony of the defendant concerning delivery of the termination notices to her, the court was entitled to find more persuasive her initial testimony acknowledging her receipt of each of the relevant notices than her subsequent statements casting doubt on which notices she had received. <em>Barrila </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>190 Conn. 631, 639, 461 A.2d 1375 (1983); <em>Griffin v. Nationwide Moving &amp; Storage Co., </em>187 Conn. 405, 422, 446 A.2d 799 (1982); <em>Raia </em>v. <em>Topehius, </em>165 Conn. 231, 235, 332 A.2d 93 (1973). The defendant never denied having actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s intention to terminate her lease because of her continued violation of its no pets clause. At trial, her testimony focused primarily on her alleged right to continue to have her dog because of security problems at the complex and because her written lease had not been formally renewed. On this record, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s findings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The trial court admitted the various termination notices denominated exhibits B, C and D into evidence over the objection of the defendant that they were inadmissible as business records because no foundation had been laid for their admission. The plaintiff offered these exhibits through the testimony of its property manager. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>This witness testified that it was in the normal course of business for the plaintiff to prepare, serve and keep copies of termination notices, even though he himself had not participated in any of these functions. The court determined that this testimony sufficed to meet the business records requirements set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-180.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims, in her brief,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the termination notices are not business records within \u00a7 52-180 because they were prepared, not in the ordinary course of business, but rather in anticipation of litigation. Relying on <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>318 U.S. 109, 111-15, 63 S. Ct. 477, 87 L. Ed. 645, reh. denied, 318 U.S. 800, 63 S. Ct. 757, 87 L. Ed. 1163 (1943), the defendant maintains that this purpose robs the notices of the indicia of trustworthiness that underlie the business record exception. We disagree with this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">One reason is that this issue was not distinctly raised at trial. Although the defendant offered timely objections at trial to the admissibility of the notices, the basis for the objection was the alleged lack of competency of the witness to offer the notices into evidence. The defendant never objected to admission of the notices on the ground that they had been prepared for litigation. We need not review any claim of error that was not properly raised at trial. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 288, 3063 (now \u00a7 4185); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>197 Conn. 50, 53 n.2, 495 A.2d 1044 (1985), cert. granted, 476 U.S. 1114, 106 S. Ct. 1967, 90 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1986); <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 164, 166, 438 A.2d 865 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The other reason for upholding the ruling of the trial court is substantive. Even if we were to overlook the defendant\u2019s procedural failure, the defendant has read too much into <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>supra. The generally accepted view of the test enunciated in that case is that documents prepared for litigation are excluded, not on a per se basis, but rather upon an inquiry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>whether such documents bear circumstantial indicia of lack of trustworthiness. In the exercise of appropriate discretion, courts may exclude such records where they are self-serving and a motive for falsification can be demonstrated. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>526 F.2d 470, 473 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Caldecott </em>v. <em>Long Island Lighting Co., </em>417 F.2d 994, 996 (2d Cir. 1969); C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 308; C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Handbook of Connecticut Evidence (1976) \u00a7 11.14. Although this court has recognized that the trustworthiness of business records, under \u00a7 52-180, \u201ccomes from their being used for business and not for litigation\u201d; <em>Emhart Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376, U.A.W., </em>190 Conn. 371, 388-89, 461 A.2d 422 (1983); we have not thereby mandated the exclusion of multipurpose documents that have ancillary utility in subsequent litigation. We have emphasized, instead: that \u00a7 52-180 should be liberally construed; id., 388; that the essential hallmark of admissibility under \u00a7 52-180 is the trustworthiness of the document; <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>179 Conn. 349, 358-59, 426 A.2d 305 (1979); <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Plante, </em>175 Conn. 1, 3-4, 392 A.2d 488 (1978); C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 306; and that appellate review in these cases is limited to ascertaining whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>supra, 360; <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Wolk, </em>170 Conn. 226, 232, 365 A.2d 1190 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Examining the evidence in this case in the light of these governing principles, we reiterate that the plaintiff\u2019s property manager testified that the notices in question had been prepared in the ordinary course of the managerial responsibilities of a landlord. He testified, without contradiction, that, although it was the plaintiff\u2019s policy to initiate eviction procedures upon discovery of a violation of the no pets clause, such procedures would immediately be stopped if the tenant removed the animal from the premises. This testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>mony supports the plaintiffs assertion of the duality of purposes served by the termination notices. Furthermore, the defendant has not alleged that the copies of the notices that were admitted at trial had been altered or otherwise falsified in any way. Under these circumstances, any remaining concerns about the probity of the documents in the present litigation relate only to the weight the notices should be given and do not preclude their admissibility. The trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in admitting the notices into evidence. See <em>Emhart Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376, U.A.W., </em>supra, 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We consider finally whether the three notices sent by the plaintiff suffice to meet the statutory requirements of \u00a7 47a-15 and the regulatory requirements of section 236 and section 8 housing contained in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 450.4 (a), 886.101 and 886.128. The defendant has alleged that the notices are defective in the following respects: (1) the notice issued on April 12, 1983, pursuant to \u00a7 47a-15, which advised the tenant of a May 12 termination date, fails to comply with the thirty day limitation of \u00a7 47a-15, since the notice would have taken at least one day to be delivered; (2) the notice to quit contained in the plaintiff\u2019s letter of May 12, 1983, does not advise a tenant that if a judicial proceeding for eviction should be instituted the tenant could present a defense, and thus the notice fails to comply with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 450.4 (a); and (3) that same letter does not advise a tenant that he or she has ten days to present objections to eviction to management, and thus the notice fails to comply with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 886.128 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Before we address each of these alleged defects, we need to identify the standards by which to test the adequacy of the termination notices sent to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ant. \u201c[T]he remedy of summary process is available only when there is a lease and it has been terminated. The purpose of the action is to enable the landlord upon such termination to recover possession from the tenant. . . . Because of the summary nature of this remedy, the statute granting it has been narrowly construed and strictly followed.\u201d <em>Jo-Mark Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Pantanella, </em>139 Conn. 598, 600-601, 96 A.2d 217 (1953); see also <em>Marrinan </em>v. <em>Hamer, </em>5 Conn. App. 101, 103, 497 A.2d 67 (1985). It follows that, before a landlord may pursue its statutory remedy of summary process under \u00a7 47a-23, the landlord must prove its compliance with all the applicable preconditions set by state and federal law for the termination of a lease. The plaintiffs complaint in this case duly alleged that the notices it had sent to the defendant met the substantive requirements prescribed by these regulatory provisions. The trial court therefore erred in criticizing the defendant for her failure to offer evidence to show the plaintiffs noncompliance with the applicable requirements. Because the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses raising these issues were precisely the same issues as the plaintiff had pleaded, they did not relieve the plaintiff of its burden of proving the propriety of its termination of the lease as a condition to its right to summary process. See <em>Southland Corporation </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>1 Conn. App. 439, 443, 473 A.2d 318 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In order to demonstrate its compliance with the notices required for a proper termination, a landlord must show that the notices given to the tenant apprised her of the information a tenant needs to protect herself against premature, discriminatory or arbitrary eviction. <em>Joy </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>479 F.2d 1236, 1241 (4th Cir. 1973); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Denny, </em>365 F. Sup. 1254, 1260 (W.D. Va. 1973); <em>Apartments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>43 N.C. App. 648, 651, 260 S.E.2d 146 (1979). To further this salutary purpose, the notice requirements of \u00a7 47a-15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>must be construed strictly. <em>Jo-Mark Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Pantanella, </em>supra. Strict construction does not, however, require ritualistic compliance with statutory or regulatory mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It is appropriate to enforce the mandates of our own statutes in this area in a purposive manner consistent with the pattern that has developed for the enforcement of the federal rights of tenants in federally subsidized housing. For such tenants, despite a recognition that a loss of federally subsidized housing implicates due process rights under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution, federal law has moved away from requiring either a special federal forum or special federal forms. Federal courts have concluded that a tenant\u2019s right to fair adjudication of good cause for the termination of his tenancy can be vindicated by recourse to the normal judicial process of state court eviction procedures. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Royal Arms Apartments, </em>729 F.2d 1081, 1082 (6th Cir. 1984); <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Gastonia Housing Authority, </em>675 F.2d 1342, 1347 (4th Cir. 1982); <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Georgia Residential Finance Authority, </em>503 F. Sup. 610, 621 (N.D. Ga. 1980), aff'd, 678 F.2d 919 (11th Cir. 1982). In 1981, the Congress amended the statute governing section 8 eviction procedures to eliminate a former requirement that termination notices could only be given by public housing authorities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (d) (1) (B). Federal regulations require proper notification before such a tenancy can be terminated, but, for leases entered into after October 1, 1981, they no longer regulate the content of the notice of termination, but rely instead on the notice procedures prescribed by state or local law. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 882.215 (c) (3). These less stringent regulations now govern the eviction of tenants who receive rent subsidies under section 8 programs even though they reside in housing complexes originally financed by federal sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tion 236 subsidies. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 882.215 (i).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See generally National Housing Law Project, HUD Housing Programs (1985 Sup.) c. 14. These federal developments indicate a movement away from formalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We therefore conclude that judicial appraisal of a landlord\u2019s compliance with both state and federal requirements for notices of termination must reflect the purpose that the notices were meant to serve. As we have held in other contexts, in which regulatory and constitutional rights were also implicated; <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 359-60, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981); not every deviation from the strict requirements of either statutes or regulations warrants dismissal of an action for summary process. When good cause for termination of a lease has clearly been shown, and when notices of termination have been sent in strict compliance with statutory timetables, a landlord should not be precluded from pursuing summary eviction proceedings because of hypertechnical dissection of the wording of the notices that he has sent. See <em>Brezina </em>v. <em>Dowdall, </em>472 F. Sup. 82, 85 (N.D. Ill. 1979); <em>Southland Corporation </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>supra, 452-53; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hendrix, </em>162 Ga. App. 299, 301-303, 290 S.E.2d 504 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Proceeding from these principles, we conclude that the plaintiff in this case sufficiently established the preconditions for its action for summary process. The most important of these conditions is that the plaintiff prove good cause for termination of a lease. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>case, good cause was shown because of the defendant\u2019s material and continued noncompliance with the no pets clause in her lease. Good cause is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">There is an issue about whether the plaintiff complied with the time requirements of \u00a7 47a-15. That statute conditions a landlord\u2019s right to evict on the delivery of a written notice to the tenant specifying the tenant\u2019s wrongful acts or omissions and specifies that the notice should warn the tenant that \u201cthe rental agreement shall terminate upon a date not less than thirty days after receipt of the notice.\u201d The purpose of this thirty day provision is to provide a grace period in which a tenant may correct the wrongful conduct that prompted the initiation of termination proceedings. <em>Kapa Associates </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 274, 278, 408 A.2d 22 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In this case, the plaintiff, on April 12, 1983, mailed and served a \u00a7 47a-15 notice that set a termination date of May 12,1983. The defendant argues that this notice was untimely because there was no evidence about when it was in fact delivered to the defendant. We read the record differently. The plaintiff offered testimony at trial that the notice had been mailed on the date of its issuance and the trial court found that a duplicate had been personally served on the defendant on that same day. Although our statutes contain no special definition for \u201creceipt of the notice\u201d under \u00a7 47a-15, comparable federal regulations concerning the sending of termination notices to a tenant provide that \u201c[t]he date on which a notice shall be deemed to be received by the tenant\u201d shall be the later of two dates: the mailing of a notice of termination or the service of such a notice on the tenant. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 450.4 (b). When there has been actual timely service upon a tenant, nothing in our statute or these regulations postpones \u201creceipt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the notice\u201d until <em>delivery </em>of a mailed notice of impending termination. The plaintiff has fully complied with the time requirements of \u00a7 47a-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">There is also an issue about whether the contents of the plaintiffs termination notices complied with applicable federal regulations. Because the plaintiffs housing complex was financed in part through federal \u00a7 236 subsidies, the defendant\u2019s lease, in article 4b, incorporated the provisions of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 450. The plaintiff was therefore obligated to provide the defendant with a termination notice that complied with 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 450.4 (a). That regulation requires proper service of a written notice informing the tenant of: (1) the date \u201cthe tenancy is terminated\u201d; (2) the reasons for the landlord\u2019s action; and (3) the tenant\u2019s right to present a defense if a judicial proceeding for eviction is instituted. The plaintiff\u2019s notice of May 12,1983, was designed to comply with these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The defendant maintains that this notice is deficient in three respects. She claims that the letter does not sufficiently state the date her \u201ctenancy is terminated\u201d because it merely advises her of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cintention\u201d to terminate her tenancy on June 12, 1983. We disagree. In light of the earlier warning contained in the letter of April 12, indicating an intent to proceed with termination of the lease on May 12, the defendant cannot have been misled about the significance of the June 12 termination date. The defendant\u2019s complaint about failure to advise her about her right to present a defense in judicial eviction proceedings is even less persuasive. Since the plaintiff\u2019s letter clearly informed the defendant that, \u201c[i]n the event [of an] eviction proceeding . . . you will receive notice and be given an opportunity to present a defense,\u201d the gravamen of this argument must be that the relevant \u201ceviction proceeding\u201d is not explicitly denominated a \u201cjudicial proceeding for eviction.\u201d Again, we fail to perceive how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>this minor deviation from the language of the federal regulation can have prejudiced the defendant\u2019s rights in any way. The defendant\u2019s final issue pursuant to this regulation contests the trial court\u2019s finding with respect to the manner of delivery of this notice to the defendant, an issue that we have resolved adversely to the defendant in part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Because the defendant herself was receiving federal section 8 rent subsidies, the plaintiff\u2019s termination notices also had to comply with the requirements of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 886.128 (a). That regulation states that the landlord must give a tenant-\u201ca written notice of the proposed eviction, stating the grounds and advising the Family that it has ten days (or such greater number, if any, that may be required by law) within which to respond\u201d to the landlord. The defendant contends that none of the notices she received apprised her of this ten day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The plaintiff argues that the letter sent on May 12 complies with the substance if not with the letter of the ten day requirement. Although that letter did not expressly inform the defendant that she had ten days to respond to the landlord, it did advise her that she could call or write management in order to present any objection to the termination of her lease. More important, according to the plaintiff, in postponing the date of termination to a date thirty days in the future, the notice in effect offered the defendant a more generous time period for response than that mandated by the federal regulation. The persuasiveness of this argument depends upon the factual circumstances in which it arises. We can conceive of cases in which an open-ended invitation to respond might lull a tenant into inaction and thus might excuse a failure to undertake timely remedial measures to correct noncompliance with a lease. This is not such a case. The record before us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>reflects the actions of a tenant who, fully cognizant of the landlord's insistence on enforcing the no pets clause in her lease, steadfastly persisted, until and including the date of trial, in asserting that she had a right to keep a doberman pinscher in her apartment. In these circumstances, the content of the notice sent by the plaintiff sufficiently complied with the requirements of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 886.128 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In addition to these arguments concerning the validity of the termination notices sent to the defendant, the defendant has raised a final claim that the plaintiff is not entitled to summary process because of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to prove service of a notice to quit on the defendant. The defendant\u2019s brief makes this contention without specifically identifying whether it is meant as an attack on the formal notice to quit possession which, according to the plaintiff, was served on the defendant as a precedent to the initiation of the summary process action, or as yet another criticism of the notice of termination contained in the letter of May 12, 1983. The latter criticism we have fully addressed earlier in this opinion. As to the former, the court file, of which we may take judicial notice, contains a document expressly denominated a notice to quit, dated June 13, 1983, that on its face manifests its service by a duly authorized process server. Apart from her general denial of the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the defendant has pointed to nothing in the trial record to show that the validity of this notice, or its service, was ever made a specific issue before the trial court. The trial court found all the issues for the plaintiff. In the absence of a request by the defendant for a further articulation, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3082 (now \u00a7 4051), of the basis on which the trial court came to this conclusion with respect to the notice to quit, we lack the record we need for review of this issue. Without such a record, which it was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>defendant\u2019s burden to produce, we decline to find error in the ruling of the trial court on this issue. <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 714, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983); see <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>190 Conn. 491, 493, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra, 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\"> At all relevant times, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 provided: \u201cNOTICE to quit POSSESSION OP PREMISES.
