An arrest warrant was issued for the defendant on July 22, 1983. The warrant was not executed and the defendant was not arrested, however, until July 29, 1985, more than two years after the offenses were committed. The record indicates no reason for the delay in the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss claiming that, because he had not been \u201cprosecuted\u201d within one year of the date of the commission of the offenses charged as required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b), his prosecution was time-barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither the defendant nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>state presented testimony at the hearing on the motion. The trial court, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Cordova, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 377, 448 A.2d 848 (1982),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The defendant subsequently filed a conditional plea of nolo contendere under General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> expressly reserving his right to appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion. The trial court accepted the plea of nolo contendere, entered a finding of guilty, imposed a sentence of one year suspended after nine months and a period of probation, and ordered restitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The only issue raised by this appeal is whether the issuance of the arrest warrant on July 22,1983, within the period of limitation provided by General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b), tolled the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant contends on appeal, as he did in the trial court, that he was not \u201cprosecuted\u201d as required by the statute until he was arrested by virtue of the warrant and an information filed in court on July 29, 1985, well beyond the period of limitation provided by \u00a7 54-193 (b). The state argues, however, that the defendant was \u201cprosecuted\u201d for the purposes of the statute of limitations when a judicial officer, presented with an affidavit and a short form information, which incorporated an application for an arrest warrant and an arrest warrant, found probable cause and issued the arrest warrant on July 22,1983, shortly after the crimes charged had been committed. We agree with the state and conclude that the issuance of the arrest warrant tolled the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person may be prosecuted for any [misdemeanor] . . . except within one year next after the offense has been committed.\u201d The statute, however, does not define \u201cprosecuted\u201d or contain any provision delineating at what stage of the prosecution the limitation period is tolled. The Appellate Session of the Superior Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cordova, </em>supra, the only authority in Connecticut construing this provision, analyzed the statute in the context of the policies underlying limitations statutes, and concluded that the issuance of the warrant tolls the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Although the purpose of a statute of limitations is to ensure a timely commencement of prosecution, juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>dictions differ on what act will suffice to show such commencement. In jurisdictions where legislation requires the finding of an indictment or the filing of an information as the first step in a criminal case, the \u201cprosecution\u201d is deemed commenced by either of these acts, and the running of the statute of limitations is thereby tolled. 2 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 18.5; see 1F. Wharton, Criminal Law (14th Ed.) \u00a7 90. In the absence of such legislation, however, it is generally held that the prosecution is commenced, and the statute tolled, at the time a complaint is laid before a magistrate and a warrant of arrest is issued. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chacon, </em>479 So. 2d 229, 230 (Fla. App. 1985); <em>McMorris </em>v. <em>State, </em>277 Md. 62, 67-68, 355 A.2d 438 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mars, </em>39 Md. App. 436, 438, 386 A.2d 1234 (1978); <em>see Akers </em>v. <em>State, </em>370 So. 2d 81, 83 (Fla. App. 1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>92 P. 829, 830 (Kan. 1907); 2 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, supra; 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law \u00a7 230. The American Law Institute model penal code is in accord. It provides that \u201c[a] prosecution is commenced either when an indictment is found [or an information filed] or when a warrant or other process is issued, provided that such warrant or process is executed without unreasonable delay.\u201d Model Penal Code (1985) \u00a7 1.06 (5); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>66 Or. App. 896, 676 P.2d 344 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>236 Pa. Super. 131, 344 A.2d 710 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b) does not make reference to the finding of an indictment or the filing of an information but provides only that a person must be \u201cprosecuted\u201d within a specified time. Further, neither the Practice Book nor our statutes contain provisions for the finding of an indictment<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or the filing of an infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>mation prior to the arrest of an accused person. Cf. Practice Book \u00a7 972.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this state, the initial step to commence a prosecution, when an arrest is to be made by virtue of a warrant, is the presentation of an application for a warrant, which is accompanied by an affidavit, by a prosecutorial official to a judicial authority. If the judicial authority finds that the accompanying affidavit shows probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed, and that the person complained against committed it, the judicial authority may issue an arrest warrant. General Statutes \u00a7 54-2a.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>When an arrest warrant has been issued, and the prosecutorial official has promptly delivered it to a proper officer for service, he has done all he can under our existing law to initiate prosecution and to set in motion the machinery that will provide notice to the accused of the charges against him.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When the prosecutorial authority has done everything possible within the period of limitation to evidence and effectuate an intent to prosecute, the statute of limitations is tolled. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>189 So. 2d 254, 261-62 (Fla. App 1966). An accused should not be rewarded, absent evidence of a lack of due diligence on the part of the officer charged with executing the warrant, for managing to avoid apprehension to a point in time beyond the period of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We recognize, however, that some limit as to when an arrest warrant must be executed after its issuance is necessary in order to prevent the disadvantages to an accused attending stale prosecutions, a primary purpose of statutes of limitation. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Levine, </em>658 F.2d 113, 127 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>202 Conn. 86, 91, 519 A.2d 1201 (1987); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 92 S. Ct. 455, 30 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1971). Therefore, we adopt, what we think is the sensible approach of the model penal code, and conclude that, in order to toll the statute of limitations, an arrest warrant, when issued within the time limitations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u00a7 54-193 (b), must be executed without unreasonable delay. Model Penal Code, supra. We do not adopt a per se approach as to what period of time to execute an arrest warrant is reasonable. A reasonable period of time is a question of fact that will depend on the circumstances of each case. If the facts indicate that an accused consciously eluded the authorities, or for other reasons was difficult to apprehend, these factors will be considered in determining what time is reasonable. If, on the other hand, the accused did not relocate or take evasive action to avoid apprehension, failure to execute an arrest warrant for even a short period of time might be unreasonable and fail to toll the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The statute of limitations is, however, an affirmative defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 90; <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>199 Conn. 631, 640, 508 A.2d 1376 (1986). Consequently, the burden was on the defendant to prove the elements of that defense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>supra; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Karlin, </em>785 F.2d 90, 92 (3d Cir. 1986). Since no testimony was taken on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss concerning the reason for the delay in the execution of the warrant in this case, he has failed to meet that burden. We cannot assume, nor could the trial court, that the warrant was not executed with due diligence. The warrant directed the officer serving it to arrest the body of the defendant and \u201cforthwith\u201d have him before the superior court. \u201cIt is . . . presumed until the contrary appears that a public officer acting officially has done his duty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lenihan, </em>151 Conn. 552, 555, 200 A.2d 476 (1964). There was no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The defendant argues that <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>190 Conn. 219, 460 A.2d 961 (1983), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>196 Conn. 557, 494 A.2d 1190 (1985), require a conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>that the defendant was not \u201cprosecuted\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-193 (b) until the information was filed in court. We disagree. Both <em>Vitale </em>and <em>Falcon </em>are concerned with the issue of when an accused\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel attaches in a criminal prosecution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 562; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 231. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 232, we held that an arrest, whether or not accomplished by a warrant, did not mark the start of adversarial judicial proceedings for right to counsel purposes. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, we reaffirmed our holding in <em>Vitale </em>and stated, \u201c[njeither the request of a state\u2019s attorney, nor the action of a court in granting that request [for an arrest warrant], converts an arrest warrant into an official accusation signaling the state\u2019s commitment to prosecute.\u201d Taken in the context of the case in which it was made, the statement means only that the issuance of an arrest warrant does not commence such adversarial judicial proceedings as trigger a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel. Neither case, however, forecloses our holding that the issuance of an arrest warrant is sufficient initiation of a prosecution to toll the statute of limitations if the warrant is served with due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">We agree, therefore, with the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in this case. The timely issuance of the arrest warrant tolled the statute of limitations in the absence of an evidentiary showing of unreasonable delay in its service upon the defendant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Model Penal Code, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In this opinion Peters, C.

This conclusion does not comport with the purpose of the sixth amendment. \u201cThe speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nonetheless substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>tial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 8, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 71 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1982). Absent a formal charge, the sixth amendment right to a speedy trial does not extend to the period prior to arrest. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 321, 92 S. Ct. 455, 30 L.

Neither \u00a7 54-82m nor Practice Book \u00a7 956B (b), which implements the statutory provision, attach any significance to the date of the issuance of an arrest warrant for determining when the right of an accused to a speedy trial comes into being.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
