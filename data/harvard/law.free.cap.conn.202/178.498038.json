Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af\">The principal question on this appeal is whether an insurer must arbitrate an <em>under-insured </em>motorist claim pursuant to an arbitration provision of an uninsured motorist clause included in an insurance policy issued by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The underlying facts are undisputed. The plaintiff, Security Insurance Company of Hartford, issued an automobile insurance policy to the defendant, John DeLaurentis. The effective dates of the policy were from March 1,1978, to March 1,1979. The policy contained uninsured motorist coverage which provided, inter alia, for the arbitration of all coverage issues arising thereunder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The policy provided coverage for four separate vehicles owned by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>On September 18,1978, the defendant was involved in an accident with a vehicle owned and operated by-Eva Pikoulidis. Pikoulidis was insured by Metropolitan Property and Liability Insurance Company under a single limit policy of $50,000, a sum in excess of the statutory limits then in effect. On March 24,1980, the defendant filed suit against Pikoulidis. This suit was settled on January 19, 1984; the defendant was paid the $50,000 policy limit. The defendant alleges that the reasonable value of his claim exceeds $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Upon settlement, the defendant filed for arbitration of his claim under his own policy, seeking to stack his uninsured motorist coverage, $20,000 on each of his four vehicles, to increase the coverage limit to $80,000. Because the amount payable under the policy would be reduced by \u201call sums paid on account of the insured\u2019s bodily injury by or on behalf of the owner or operator of the uninsured automobile,\u201d the potential recovery in the arbitration proceeding would be $30,000, the $80,000 policy limit reduced by the $50,000 paid on behalf of Pikoulidis.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The plaintiff responded by filing a declaratory judgment action which sought (1) a temporary and permanent injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with arbitration, and (2) a determination whether (A) \u201c[t]he 1979 amendment to Section 38-175c of the Connecticut General Statutes should apply retroactively; [(B) i]f not, is an underinsured motor vehicle on September 18,1978, an uninsured motor vehicle under Section 38-175c; [and (C) does the] plaintiff have any obligation to proceed to arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In its memorandum of decision dated April 18,1985, the trial court, <em>Spada, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs request for summary judgment, and permanently enjoined the defendant from proceeding to arbitration. The court also answered \u201cno\u201d to each question presented for determination by declaratory judgment. On May 20, 1985, the defendant filed a request for further articulation. On July 28,1985, the court filed a memorandum of decision in response to the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The defendant has appealed from the trial court rulings. The defendant claims that the court erred in ruling: (1) that the plaintiff has no obligation to proceed to arbitration; (2) that the insurance policy should not be construed to include underinsured motorists within its uninsured motorist protection; (3) that the defendant is permanently restrained from proceeding to arbitration without a finding of irreparable harm or lack of an adequate remedy at law; and (4) that the jurisdictional requirements for a declaratory judgment action were met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error is that the trial court erred in ruling that the plaintiff has no obligation to proceed to arbitration. The defendant argues that the issue of whether the plaintiff must arbitrate the defendant\u2019s underinsurance claim is a question of coverage which must be determined by arbitration. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>support of this argument, the defendant points to the language of the insurance policy issued by the plaintiff, as well as the mandatory language of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the defendant\u2019s characterization of the issue as one of coverage is erroneous. The plaintiff contends that the issue of whether the plaintiff must arbitrate the defendant\u2019s claim is one of arbitrability which is a question for the court. <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>155 Conn. 270, 274, 231 A.2d 531 (1967), citing <em>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>148 Conn. 192, 198, 169 A.2d 646 (1961). The plaintiff also argues that the policy it issued to the defendant does not extend insurance benefits to accidents with underinsured motorists and General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c does not mandate arbitration because the statute does not apply retroactively. We agree with the defendant that the issue is one of coverage and, as such, the plaintiff is obligated to proceed with arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The duty to arbitrate may be created by contract or by statute. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>199 Conn. 618, 622, 509 A.2d 467 (1986); <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Coating Products, Inc., </em>152 Conn. 592, 596, 210 A.2d 667 (1965), and cases cited therein. In the absence of a contrary statute, \u201c[t]he obligations and rights of the parties are described and limited by their written agreement. The answer to the question whether or not the court shall direct a party to proceed with arbitration is embodied in the insurance contract.\u201d <em>Visselli </em>v. <em>American Fidelity Co., </em>155 Conn. 622, 624, 237 A.2d 561 (1967); <em>John A. Errichetti Associates </em>v. <em>Boutin, </em>183 Conn. 481, 488, 439 A.2d 416 (1981); <em>W. J. Megin, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>181 Conn. 47, 51, 434 A.2d 306 (1980). Parties who have contracted to arbitrate certain matters have no obligation to arbitrate any matters other than those which they have agreed to arbitrate. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Group, </em>supra; <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra. Except when mandated by statute, a court may not compel parties \u201cto arbitrate matters other than those which they have agreed to arbitrate under the provisions of their insurance policy.\u201d <em>Visselli </em>v. <em>American Fidelity Co., </em>supra; <em>John A. Errichetti Associates </em>v. <em>Boutin, </em>supra; <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>see Batter Building Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Kirschner, </em>142 Conn. 1, 4, 110 A.2d 464 (1954). \u201cWhether a particular dispute is arbitrable is a question for the court, unless, by appropriate language, the parties have agreed to arbitrate that question, also. <em>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>[supra]; <em>College Plaza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harlaco, Inc., </em>152 Conn. 707, 206 A.2d 832 [1965].\u201d <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The arbitration clause contained in the policy issued by the plaintiff, which constitutes the agreement to arbitrate and which, necessarily, determines the issues to be arbitrated, provides the following: \u201cArbitration: If any person making claim [under Part IV, Protection Against Uninsured Motorists,] and the company do not agree that such person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured highway vehicle or an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury to the insured, or do not agree as to the amount of payment which may be owing hereunder, <em>or do not agree as to the coverage of insurance hereunder, </em>then, upon written demand of either, the matter or matters upon which such person and the company do not agree shall be settled by arbitration .... Such person and the company each agree to consider itself bound by any award made by the arbitrators pursuant to this provision.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">This agreement to arbitrate is not a broad, all encompassing provision for arbitration. Cf. <em>John A. Errichetti Associates </em>v. <em>Boutin, </em>supra, 489. The provision applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>only to claims filed pursuant to part IV of the insurance policy; unless the claim is filed pursuant to this clause, the arbitration provision is inapplicable. See <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra, 275. Under the agreement, the plaintiff and the defendant agreed to arbitrate the following issues: (1) the insured\u2019s right to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile; (2) the amount of damages; and (3) any dispute as to the coverage of insurance to the claim filed by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">While the defendant and the plaintiff, for the purpose of this appeal, do not disagree that the defendant is \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d from Pikoulidis, or as to \u201cthe amount of payment which may be owing,\u201d there is disagreement as to whether the policy extends insurance benefits to this underinsurance claim. Whether an underinsured motor vehicle is an \u201cuninsured automobile\u201d within the terms of the policy is a question of the coverage under part IV of the policy. See <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra, 276 (whether a \u201chit-and-run\u201d automobile is an \u201cuninsured automobile\u201d under the terms of the policy is a question of coverage).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>obtain insurance benefits hinges upon a resolution of the dispute over whether the policy extends coverage to the claim filed. The arbitration clause contained in the policy mandates that the parties arbitrate this coverage dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Further support for our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s claim is one of coverage which must be decided by arbitration can be found in the language of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 38-175c (a) (1) provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>all motor vehicle insurance policies issued on or after October 1,1971, which include an uninsured motorist provision \u201cwhich contains a provision for binding arbitration shall include a provision for final determination of insurance <em>coverage </em>in such arbitration proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>supra, 622-23. The policy issued by the plaintiff contains such a provision. \u201cIn <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>181 Conn. 37, 41, 434 A.2d 304 (1980), we recognized that this provision of \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1) had legislatively overruled our holding in <em>Frager </em>that an insurer could contractually limit the uninsured motorist issues to be decided by the arbitrators and thus exclude questions of coverage.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>supra. In <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 42, this court interpreted the statute broadly and held that the expressed intent and effect of the statute \u201cis to remove from the court and to transfer to the arbitration panel the function of determining, in the first instance, all issues as to coverage under automobile liability insurance policies containing uninsured motorist clauses providing for arbitration.\u201d See also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>supra, 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The plaintiff argues, and the trial court held, that the policy issued to the defendant does not afford \u201ccoverage\u201d for accidents with underinsured motorists and that since the defendant is \u201cunable to meet the threshold issue of whether the tortfeasor vehicle is an uninsured vehicle,\u201d there is no duty on the part of the plaintiff to proceed to arbitration. In fact, the trial court framed the issue as \u201cwhether the Defendant\u2019s motor vehicle qualified for underinsurance benefits under \u00a7 38-175c.\u201d This analysis fails to recognize that the determination of arbitrability is dependent upon the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, not upon the relative strength or weakness of a party\u2019s position on the disputed claim. See <em>John A. Errichetti Associates </em>v. <em>Boutin, </em>supra, 488; <em>W. J. Megin, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 51; <em>Visselli </em>v. <em>American Fidelity Co., </em>supra, 624. In <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 39-40, we stated that \u201c[t]he function of the court ... is to determine, in the first instance, whether the issue is arbitrable. If the court so decides, an order compelling arbitration is issued. If, on the other hand, the court decides that the issue is not arbitrable, it can proceed to decide the issue on the merits. In such a case, however, the plaintiff can appeal on the ground that the court erred in concluding that the issue was not arbitrable.\u201d See also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In this case, the trial court, instead of deciding the threshold question of whether the issue was arbitrable, decided the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim. The court examined the language of the policy to determine whether the policy extends insurance benefits to accidents with underinsured motorists. The court stated that because \u201cthe policy does not extend coverage to underinsurance accidents,\u201d the plaintiff has no obligation to proceed to arbitration. This analysis is erroneous because it was the trial court\u2019s obligation to decide first whether the issue was arbitrable, that is, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>claim involved a coverage dispute. Only if the court answered no to this question should the court have reached the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim. See <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra. By deciding the merits of the coverage dispute first, the court interpreted the policy, thus deciding the \u201ccoverage dispute\u201d that should have been decided by arbitration. The trial court\u2019s analysis was contrary to <em>Oliva. </em>Whether the defendant is able to establish that the policy should be construed to extend insurance benefits to accidents with underinsured motorists pursuant to the uninsured motorist clause is a question of coverage. The parties have contractually agreed to arbitrate coverage questions. The defendant\u2019s election to do so must be honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The subject policy provides for arbitration if a claimant and the company do not agree as to coverage of insurance under part IV of the policy. The defendant filed a claim pursuant to part IV and the plaintiff disputes whether part IV of the policy extends insurance benefits to the defendant\u2019s underinsurance claim. Whether underinsurance protection is included within uninsured protection under part IV, when read as a whole, is a coverage question which must be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the written agreement of the parties. The trial court erred in granting the plaintiff\u2019s request for an injunction, permanently restraining the defendant from proceeding to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Because of our disposition of the defendant\u2019s first claim of error, we need not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s three remaining claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> The policy contains the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201cPART IV\u2014PROTECTION AGAINST UNINSURED MOTORISTS . . . \u201cArbitration: If any person making claim hereunder and the company do not agree that such person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury to the insured, or do not agree as to the amount of payment which may be owing under this Part, then, upon written demand of either, the matter or matters upon which such person and the company do not agree shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Such person and the company each agree to consider itself bound and to be bound by any award made by the arbitrators pursuant to this Part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">This language was subsequently amended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHY\">\u201cCONNECTICUT AMENDMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">\u201cIt is agreed that ...

Such person and the company each agree to consider itself bound by any award made by the arbitrators pursuant to this provision.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The plaintiff does not dispute that the policy as amended was the policy in effect at the time of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-5\"> In <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>155 Conn. 270, 231 A.2d 531 (1967), which was decided before the enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c, the policy provided for arbitration of two issues: (1) the insured\u2019s right to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile; and (2) the amount of such damages. The court held that the issue of \u201c[wjhether an unidentified automobile is an \u2018uninsured automobile\u2019 within the terms of the policy . . . pertains to coverage under Part IV of the policy.\u201d Id., 276. Because \u201ccoverage disputes\u201d were not arbitrable issues under the contract entered into between the insured and the insurer, the insurer had no obligation to proceed with arbitration. Id., 276-77. \u201cWe note, however, that <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennslvania General Ins. Co., </em>[supra], and its progeny, including <em>Visselli </em>v. <em>American Fidelity Co., </em>155 Conn. 622, 237 A.2d 561 (1967), have been legislatively overruled by General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c to the extent that they held that an insurer could limit the issues relating to uninsured motorist coverage which the arbitrator could decide. <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>181 Conn. 37, 41, 434 A.2d 304 (1980).\u201d <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>4 Conn.
