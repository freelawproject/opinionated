J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1U\">This appeal involves claims of an employee that he was wrongfully discharged despite assurances of lifelong employment so long as his performance remained satisfactory. The plaintiff, Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>P. Finley, brought an action in three counts against the defendant, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Company, alleging that the defendant\u2019s termination of his employment was wrongful because of: (1) breach of express contract; (2) promissory estoppel; and (3) breach of an implied covenant of good faith. Following a jury trial, the trial court, <em>Missal, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdicts on the second and third counts of the complaint, and submitted the first count, alleging breach of express contract, to the jury. The jury rendered a general verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which found error and ordered a new trial on the first and second counts of the complaint. We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">This case arises out of the defendant\u2019s decision to terminate the employment of the plaintiff on April 12, 1976. The plaintiff, who had been employed by the defendant for twenty-four years, was a manager in the defendant\u2019s Medicare department, part B, at the time of his discharge. The jury might reasonably have found that the defendant, through its agents and its personnel manual,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made representations to him that his employment would not be terminated so long as his performance was satisfactory. Furthermore, the plaintiff at trial introduced into evidence written performance appraisals made during his employment with the defendant, as well as the oral statements of one of his former supervisors, to show that his job performance had been satisfactory. From the defendant\u2019s evidence, however, the jury might also reasonably have found that for some time before the plaintiffs discharge, he and his immediate supervisor had been involved in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>divisive and acrimonious departmental dispute. Both men ultimately were discharged because of their inability to resolve their differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The plaintiffs amended complaint alleged, in the first count, the breach of an express contract arising out of the defendant\u2019s assurances that the plaintiff would remain employed so long as his job performance was satisfactory. Despite the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on this count, the trial court permitted this claim to go to the jury. The jury found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s second count, sounding in promissory estoppel, alleged that the plaintiff had relied to his detriment on the defendant\u2019s representations of continued employment. His third count alleged that the defendant violated an implied covenant of good faith by wrongfully terminating his employment. As to these two counts, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. After the adverse jury verdict on count one, the plaintiff moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial on these latter counts only. This motion was denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. With respect to the first count, in which he was appealing from the adverse jury verdict, the plaintiff claimed that the trial court had erred in instructing the jury that: (1) the statute of frauds barred it from considering any oral representations made by the defendant in deciding whether the parties had had an employment contract; and (2) it could not find an employment contract solely from statements made in the defendant\u2019s personnel manual. With respect to the second count, in which he was appealing from the directed verdict, the plaintiff claimed that he had detrimentally relied on the defendant\u2019s promises of continued employment while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>his job performance remained satisfactory. No appeal was taken with respect to the directed verdict on the third count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The Appellate Court found error in each of the rulings challenged by the plaintiff. It rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the general verdict rule barred its review of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of error in the jury instructions; <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 394, 396-97, 499 A.2d 64 (1985); and found plain error in the charge as given. Id., 402, 404-13. It also held that the trial court improperly directed a verdict for the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s promissory estoppel claim. Id., 413-17. The Appellate Court accordingly set aside the verdict for the defendants on the first and second counts of the complaint and ordered a new trial on those counts. Id., 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">On appeal to this court after certification, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court erred in holding that: (1) the general verdict rule did not apply to the circumstances of this case; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s claims of error relating to the trial court\u2019s jury charge were reviewable under the plain error doctrine, despite the plaintiff\u2019s failure properly to preserve these claims for appeal; (3) the errors in the charge were not harmless; and (4) the trial court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant on the second count of the complaint, alleging promissory estoppel. We agree with the defendant that the general verdict rule requires the sustaining of the jury\u2019s verdict notwithstanding the Appellate Court\u2019s findings of error in the jury charge on the first count and the directed verdict on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As a threshold matter, we first consider the issue of whether the Appellate Court improperly invoked the plain error doctrine to reach the merits of the plaintiffs claims regarding the jury charge on the first count. The plaintiff, although he took exception to the portions of the charge relating to the statute of frauds and the effect of the defendant\u2019s personnel manual, failed to raise these claims of error in his motion to set aside the verdict. Accordingly, the Appellate Court held that it could review these claims only under the plain error doctrine. See <em>Pietrorazio </em>v. <em>Santopietro, </em>185 Conn. 510, 515-16, 441 A.2d 163 (1981) (in civil action seeking money damages, claims of error must be raised in motion to set aside verdict in order to ensure their full appellate review). The plain error doctrine, as stated in Practice Book \u00a7 3063 (now \u00a7 4185), provides that the Supreme and Appellate Courts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cmay in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-265 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant relies on several recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>holdings of this court to argue that plain error review should be invoked only in extraordinary situations where the error is obvious. <em>See Kolich </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>198 Conn. 322, 326, 502 A.2d 918 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>195 Conn. 253, 262-63, 487 A.2d 545 (1985). In this case, the defendant contends, plain error review was inappropriate because the relevant portions of the trial court\u2019s charge were not contrary to \u201csettled\u201d Connecticut law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 3063 sets forth a discretionary standard under which the Supreme and Appellate Courts \u201cmay\u201d review claims not properly raised in the trial court \u201cin the interests of justice.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatem, </em>194 Conn. 594, 595, 483 A.2d 1087 (1984); see generally <em>Mickel </em>v. <em>New England Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>132 Conn. 671, 674, 47 A.2d 187 (1946). On certification, therefore, the scope of our review is limited to determining whether the Appellate Court abused its discretion in granting review under the plain error doctrine. The critical question, accordingly, is not whether this court would have granted review in the same circumstances, but whether, if we indulge every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision, that court properly exercised its discretionary power under Practice Book \u00a7 3063. See <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>188 Conn. 316, 320-21, 449 A.2d 182 (1982); <em>DeLorenzo </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>4 Conn. App. 560, 562, 495 A.2d 1106 (1985); <em>DeSantis </em>v. <em>Piccadilly Land Corporation, </em>3 Conn. App. 310, 316, 487 A.2d 1110 (1985); see generally <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>199 Conn. 70, 75, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986). We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We first examine the propriety of plain error review of the trial court\u2019s instruction regarding the statute of frauds. The trial court told the jury that \u201cto determine whether an express contract of employment of a nature [the plaintiff] claims did exist, you cannot rely on any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>thing that [the plaintiff] or any other witness may have said with regard to oral promises made to [the plaintiff] about a contract of employment with the defendant .... It is the law of this state that they could not be the basis of a contract of employment ... for any agreement that is not to be performed within one year of the making thereof must be in writing.\u201d The defendant claims the Appellate Court erred in reviewing this instruction under the plain error doctrine because Connecticut law is \u201cunsettled\u201d on the issue of whether the statute of frauds applies to an employment contract of indefinite duration. It further claims that the parties\u2019 alleged contract \u201chad a minimum intended term of more than one year,\u201d and that, therefore, the contract was subject to the statute of frauds provision that \u201cany agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof\u201d must be evidenced by a writing signed by the party to be charged or its agent. General Statutes \u00a7 52-550 (a) (5). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Despite a dearth of recent Connecticut case law on the subject, our most apposite precedent comports with the majority view that a contract of indefinite duration is not subject to the \u201cone year\u201d provision of the statute of frauds. <em>Burkle </em>v. <em>Superflow Mfg. Co., </em>137 Conn. 488, 493, 78 A.2d 698 (1951); see 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts (1979) \u00a7 130, comment a; 2 A. Corbin, Contracts (1950) \u00a7\u00a7 444 through 445; 3 S. Williston, Contracts (3d Ed. Jaeger) \u00a7 500. \u201cUnder the prevailing interpretation, the enforceability of a contract under the one year provision does not turn on the actual course of subsequent events, nor on the expectations of the parties as to the probabilities. Contracts of uncertain duration are simply excluded; the provision covers <em>only </em>those contracts whose performance <em>cannot possibly </em>be completed within a year.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts, supra; <em>Burkle </em>v. <em>Superflow Mfg. Co., </em>supra. The plaintiff\u2019s alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>employment contract was of indefinite duration. The defendant does not claim that it could not possibly be performed within a year. We conclude, therefore, that the Appellate Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the trial court\u2019s instruction was plain error reviewable under Practice Book \u00a7 3063.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court erred in reviewing the trial court\u2019s instruction on the personnel manual under the plain error doctrine. The trial court instructed the jury in the following manner: \u201c[Y]ou cannot rely solely on anything written in [the defendant\u2019s] employment manual to determine whether the contract of employment [the plaintiff] claims existed did, in fact, exist. Although there has been introduced evidence from the employment manual; there has been testimony about these pages of the employment manual, it is the law in this state that without further explicit indication from the defendant . . . that an employment manual cannot form a sole basis of a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant.\u201d The defendant argues that, like the instruction on the statute of frauds, this instruction was not a \u201cclear misapplication of a settled rule of law.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The defendant correctly asserts that it is not \u201csettled\u201d law in Connecticut that statements in an employer\u2019s personnel manual may form the basis of a contract between employer and employee. This court, however, has never held, as the trial court instructed the jury, that such statements <em>cannot </em>form the basis for such a contract. To the contrary, we have stated only recently that such representations, under appropriate circumstances, may give rise to an express or implied contract between employer and employee. <em>Magnan </em>v. <em>Anaconda Industries, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 558, 564, 479 A.2d 781 (1984); see generally <em>Dolak </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>145 Conn. 497, 503, 144 A.2d 312 (1958) (statements in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>written retirement plan gave rise to employer-employee contract); <em>Tilbert </em>v. <em>Eagle Lock Co., </em>116 Conn. 357, 361-63, 165 A. 205 (1933) (assurances in employee benefit plan constituted enforceable promise to pay benefits in accordance with plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In the present case, statements in the defendant\u2019s personnel manual were of critical relevance to the issue of whether an express contract existed between the defendant and the plaintiff. \u201c \u2018The intention of the parties manifested by their words and acts is essential to determine whether a contract was entered into and what its terms were. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Hydro-Hercules Corporation </em>v. <em>Gary Excavating, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 647, 652, 353 A.2d 714 (1974). The relevant statements in the defendant\u2019s personnel manual certainly could have been interpreted as noncontractual. In the absence of \u201cdefinitive contract language,\u201d however, \u201cthe determination of what the parties intended to encompass in their contractual commitments is a question of the intention of the parties, and an inference of fact.\u201d <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Saxton Products, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 266, 274-75, 439 A.2d 314 (1981). In this case, therefore, whether the defendant\u2019s personnel manual gave rise to an express contract between the parties was a question of fact properly to be determined by the jury. See <em>Toussaint </em>v. <em>Blue Cross, </em>408 Mich. 579, 613-14, 292 N.W.2d 880 (1980); <em>Pine River State Bank </em>v. <em>Mettille, </em>333 N.W.2d 622, 628 (Minn. 1983); <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 N.Y.2d 458, 465-66, 443 N.E.2d 441, 457 N.Y.S.2d 193 (1982). The Appellate Court did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in granting review of the trial court\u2019s instruction under the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In an argument ancillary to its claim that the Appellate Court erroneously granted review under the plain error doctrine, the defendant claims that any error in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury was harmless. In regard to the instruction barring the jury from considering the defendant\u2019s oral statements as the basis for a contract, the defendant claims any error was harmless because the plaintiff failed to introduce evidence of oral statements that would tend to support a contract claim. The Appellate Court, however, found evidence in the record to support its conclusion that the defendant, through its agents, did make oral representations to the plaintiff which the jury could reasonably have interpreted as supporting the plaintiff\u2019s claim of an express contract. The Appellate Court could reasonably have concluded that the jury should have had the opportunity to consider these oral representations in making the factual determination of whether such a contract existed. The trial court\u2019s erroneous instruction deprived it of this opportunity. We therefore conclude that the instruction was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that any error in the trial court\u2019s instruction on the personnel manual was harmless because, in terminating the plaintiff, the defendant complied with the procedures outlined in its personnel manual. This claim requires little discussion. The trial court\u2019s instructions prohibited the jury from finding a contract based on the representations contained in the personnel manual. The defendant now asks us to conclude that the jury was obliged to find in its favor on a question of fact which the court forbade it to consider. As we held earlier in this opinion, the import of the defendant\u2019s personnel manual in resolving the plaintiff\u2019s claim of an express contract was a question of fact. The Appellate Court could rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sonably have concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiff was entitled to have [this] critical factual issue in the case presented to the jury pursuant to proper principles of law.\u201d <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 413. Accordingly, we conclude that the erroneous instruction on the defendant\u2019s personnel manual was not harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We now address the defendant\u2019s principal claim of error, that the Appellate Court erred in holding that the general verdict rule did not require that court to sustain the jury verdict for the defendant in spite of any trial court error. The defendant points out that the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint raised two principal claims: first, that a contract existed between the parties; and second, that the defendant\u2019s termination of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, despite his satisfactory job performance, constituted a breach of that contract. The defendant\u2019s answer denied both of these claims. The plaintiff did not submit interrogatories to the jury to determine its findings on each of the plaintiff\u2019s principal claims; Practice Book \u00a7 312; and the jury ultimately rendered a general verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff\u2019s claims of error attacked only the trial court\u2019s instructions on the issue raised in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>first claim\u2014whether a contract existed\u2014and not the issue raised in the second claim\u2014whether the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of the contract. The defendant\u2019s answer, however, raised distinct defenses to both of the plaintiff\u2019s principal claims. Because the jury\u2019s verdict for the defendant could have been based on either of these distinct defenses, the defendant now urges that review of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of error is precluded by the general verdict rule. We agree with the defendant that the general verdict rule applies in the present case, and that the verdict for the defendant comprises an \u201cimplicit finding\u201d that the plaintiff was terminated for his failure to peform his job satisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The plaintiff concedes that even if the jury had found that the parties entered into a contract, it reasonably could have found that the plaintiff was terminated for failing to perform his job satisfactorily. The plaintiff argues, however, that the general verdict rule only applies to multicount complaints, or actions involving one or more special defenses. Because only one count of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, and no special defenses, went to the jury, the plaintiff claims that the general verdict rule is not applicable. The Appellate Court took the same view. <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 397. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The so-called general verdict rule provides that, if a jury renders a general verdict for one party, and no party requests interrogatories, an appellate court will presume that the jury found every issue in favor of the prevailing party. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>188 Conn. 201, 204, 449 A.2d 142 (1982); <em>Collucci </em>v. <em>Pinette, </em>185 Conn. 483, 489, 441 A.2d 574 (1981). The rule applies whenever a verdict for one party could reasonably be rendered on one or more distinct causes of action; see <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>F.M.C. Corporation, </em>190 Conn. 700, 706, 462 A.2d 376 (1983); or distinct defenses. See <em>Royal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dalene Hardwood Flooring Co., </em>151 Conn. 463, 466, 199 A.2d 698 (1964). A party desiring to avoid the effects of the general verdict rule may elicit the specific grounds for the verdict by submitting interrogatories to the jury. Alternatively, if the action is in separate counts, a party may seek separate verdicts on each of the counts. <em>Ziman </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>110 Conn. 108, 113-15, 147 A. 370 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Under the interpretation advanced by the plaintiff, the general verdict rule would apply only if two or more counts of the plaintiffs complaint had been submitted to the jury, or if, for example, the defendant had pleaded the plaintiffs failure to perform his job satisfactorily as a special defense. The application of the general verdict rule, however, does not depend on the niceties of pleading but on the distinctness and sever-ability of the claims and defenses raised at trial. Where, for example, a plaintiff submits to the jury several different specifications of negligent conduct in support of a single cause of action for negligence, we have held that the general verdict rule does not apply. <em>Novak </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>178 Conn. 506, 508, 423 A.2d 147 (1979); <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Lenox Theater Co., </em>143 Conn. 646, 648, 124 A.2d 520 (1956). Our rationale for declining to apply the rule in such circumstances is that \u201cthe various grounds of negligence alleged are often so interlocked as to make it difficult to consider them separately,\u201d and formulating interrogatories to obtain separate findings on the various claims would \u201ccomplicate the work of court, jury and counsel.\u201d <em>Ziman </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>supra, 115. Where, however, a plaintiff submits two or more separate causes of action to the jury, such as a claim for wanton and willful misconduct joined with a claim for simple negligence, the general verdict rule does apply, whether or not the claims are pleaded in separate counts. Id., 116-17; <em>Menzie </em>v. <em>Kalmonowitz, </em>107 Conn. 197, 200, 139 A. 698 (1928). Likewise, it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>distinctness of the defenses raised, and not the form of their pleading, that is the decisive test governing the applicability of the general verdict rule. <em>Meglio </em>v. <em>Comeau, </em>137 Conn. 551, 553-54, 79 A.2d 187 (1951). \u201cIf the defenses are clearly distinct, the fact that one has not been specially pleaded . . . will not prevent the application of the rule.\u201d <em>Royal Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dalene Hardwood Flooring Co., </em>supra, 466; accord <em>LaFleur </em>v. <em>Farmington River Power Co., </em>187 Conn. 339, 342, 445 A.2d 924 (1982); <em>Henry A. Finman &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Truck &amp; Trailer Service Co., </em>169 Conn. 407, 410, 363 A.2d 86 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We again emphasize that in the present case the defendant\u2019s answer controverted both of the principal claims raised by the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The defendant\u2019s denials of the contract\u2019s existence and of its breach presented the jury with distinct and severable defenses to the plaintiff\u2019s claims. <em>See Henry A. Finman &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Truck &amp; Trailer Service Co., </em>supra. The plaintiff did not request interrogatories to the jury in order to obtain separate jury findings on the controverted issues. While we acknowledge that the trial court\u2019s erroneous instructions would have tainted any jury finding for the defendant on the issue of the contract\u2019s existence, we presume that the jury\u2019s general verdict included a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s termination was justified by his unsatisfactory job performance. Accordingly, we conclude that the verdict for the defendant must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Our conclusion that the general verdict rule requires the sustaining of the defendant\u2019s verdict on the first count makes it unnecessary for us to reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s fourth and final claim. That claim is that the Appellate Court erroneously reversed the directed verdict for the defendant on the second count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>of the plaintiffs complaint, which alleged a cause of action in promissory estoppel. Under a promissory estoppel theory, a party may maintain a claim for damages based upon a promise which induces the party\u2019s action or forbearance, if such action or forbearance is undertaken in reasonable reliance upon the promise. <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 475, 427 A.2d 385 (1980); <em>Hebrew University Assn. </em>v. <em>Nye, </em>148 Conn. 223, 232, 169 A.2d 641 (1961); 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts (1981) \u00a7 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In the present case, the plaintiff based his cause of action in the second count upon the defendant\u2019s alleged promise not to terminate him so long as he performed his job satisfactorily. As discussed in part III, supra, we presume that the jury\u2019s general verdict on the first count of the complaint encompassed a finding that the defendant\u2019s termination of the plaintiff was justified by his unsatisfactory job performance. The verdict stands as a final determination of that factual issue. <em>Harry A. Finman &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Truck &amp; Trailer Service Co., </em>supra, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u201c \u2018Where a question of fact essential to the judgment is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, the determination is conclusive between the parties in a subsequent action . . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>Brockett </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>154 Conn. 328, 337, 225 A.2d 190 (1966), quoting Restatement (Judgments) (1942) \u00a7 68; accord <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>190 Conn. 784, 787, 462 A.2d 1054 (1983). On a subsequent relitigation of the promissory estoppel claim, a jury would be bound by the finding that the defendant\u2019s alleged promise, not to terminate the plaintiff as long as his job performance was satisfactory, was fulfilled according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Whatever the possible merits of the plaintiff\u2019s promissory estoppel claim on other grounds, therefore, our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims on the first count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>effectively would preclude the plaintiff from prevailing at a new trial on the second count. Accordingly, without addressing the Appellate Court\u2019s disposition of the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal on the second count, we conclude that the court erred in ordering a new trial on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\"> The manual provided, in a section subtitled \u201cInvoluntary Terminations (Dismissals),\u201d that \u201c[i]t is Company policy to terminate any employee who cannot perform satisfactorily, whose attendance is poor, or who is otherwise unsuited to his job.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\"> The plaintiff raised in his preliminary statement of issues, but failed to brief, a claim of error in the granting of the directed verdict on the third count. As a result, the Appellate Court deemed this claim abandoned. <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., 5 </em>Conn. App. 394, 396 n.1, 499 A.2d 64 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\"> Although Practice Book \u00a7 3063 (now \u00a7 4185) applies by its terms to Supreme Court review of trial court decisions, the rule is also binding on the Appellate Court by virtue of Practice Book \u00a7 2000, which provides: \u201c[t]he practice and procedure for appeals to the appellate court shall conform to the rules of practice governing appeals to the supreme court except where a particular practice or procedure is specified by the rules of the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-265. action of supreme court on appeals and WRITS OF error.

If an action is remanded, the whole costs, except the costs on the writ of error or appeal, shall be taxed in favor of the prevailing party, and the costs in the supreme court shall be taxed in favor of the plaintiff in error or appellant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\"> The brief of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, as amicus curiae, expresses the fear that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in this regard will make \u201cevery termination a potential jury trial.\u201d This fear is unfounded. By eschewing language that could reasonably be construed as a basis for a contractual promise, or by including appropriate disclaimers of the intention to contract, employers can protect themselves against employee contract claims based on statements made in personnel manuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> The defendant claims additionally that any errors in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury were harmless because, as a matter of law, the plaintiff\u2019s case falls within the ambit of the traditional rule that, absent independent consideration, an agreement for \u201cpermanent\u201d employment is terminable at the will of either party. See, e.g., <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>142 Conn. 734, 736, 118 A.2d 316 (1955). Since this argument assumes that the plaintiff failed to state a cognizable claim in contract, it necessarily implies that the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the first count. The defendant, however, did not include such a claim of error in its brief to the Appellate Court. We therefore decline to consider this same claim, raised interstitially in the defendant\u2019s harmless error argument, on appeal by certification from that court. See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 433, 518 A.2d 49 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 434 and n.6, 493 A.2d 865 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
