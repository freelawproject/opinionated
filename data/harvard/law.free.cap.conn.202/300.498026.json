The defendant claims that this appeal by the state is not properly before us because the trial court denied the state permission to appeal. We have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>Standard Tallow Corporation </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 57 n.7, 459 A.2d 503 (1983); <em>Chrysler Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 227, 429 A.2d 478 (1980).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The background circumstances disclosed by the record relevant to the determination of our jurisdiction include the following. On December 21, 1983, the defendant was charged with one count of the crime of operating without a permit for collection on or about August 24, 1983, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-454. Some time later, the state filed a substitute information charging S &amp; R with nine counts of operating without a permit for collection in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-454 on or about nine dates in August and September, 1983. The state maintained that the charges stemmed from the defendant\u2019s conduct in collecting a chemical liquid, latex waste from a Windsor Locks corporation, and transporting it to S &amp; R\u2019s place of business in South Windsor. The defendant pleaded not guilty on January 18,1984, and elected a jury trial. At that time, the defendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">On February 3, 1984, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Briefs were filed, and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>March 8,1984, the motion was argued before the court, <em>Norm, J. </em>On May 10,1984, the trial court filed an eight page memorandum of decision in which it denied the motion to dismiss. In this decision, the court rejected the first claim raised in the motion to dismiss, that the information failed to contain \u201can allegation of criminality,\u201d concluding that the bill of particulars filed subsequent to the motion to dismiss satisfied this requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the state, by electing to proceed in a civil suit through the department of environmental protection, was precluded from pursuing the criminal prosecution under principles of collateral estoppel. The court noted the existence of a factual dispute as to whether the material allegedly transported by the defendant without a permit was \u201ca liquid chemical,\u201d the transportation of which was proscribed by the statute. The court opined that the defendant could not demonstrate that the issue it sought to foreclose on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>motion to dismiss had necessarily been resolved in the earlier civil proceeding brought against the defendant by the commissioner of environmental protection, which had been disposed of by a stipulated judgment on January 30, 1984.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After a thorough discussion of collateral estoppel, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion to reargue the motion to dismiss on two grounds. One ground was directed to the collateral estoppel aspect. There the defendant alleged that it was now admitting that the material involved was \u201ca chemical liquid\u201d under the statute for the purposes of the judgment in the civil case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Permission to reargue was granted. After reargument and the filing of a supplemental brief, the court granted the motion to dismiss. In its supplemental memorandum on the motion to dismiss, the court said, inter alia, that during reargument and in the supplemental brief, \u201cthe defendant admitted that the material in question here, as in the prior civil action, is liquid chemical, or in the words of the statute, that the latex materials are chemical liquids.\u201d It therefore decided that the other requirements for the application of collateral estoppel were met and it granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The state then moved for permission to appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state based its motion on General Statutes \u00a7 54-96<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>174 Conn. 100, 110, 384 A.2d 315 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>(1977).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state thereafter filed a \u201cMotion for Further Articulation\u201d with the trial court requesting further articulation of the legal basis for applying collateral estoppel, the factual basis for its conclusion that \u201cthe other requirements for the application of collateral estoppel [were] met,\u201d the basis for the conclusion \u201cthat any issues have been resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor in prior litigation\u201d and \u201c[w]hether the court has concluded that any issues were fully and fairly litigated when only a stipulated judgment has entered, and the basis for that conclusion.\u201d The court, in a four page memorandum of decision, dated January 15, 1985, denied the motion to appeal and granted the motion for further articulation. In its articulation, the court said: \u201cIt is the understanding of this Court that the factual allegations which were the subject of that related civil matter are the same as those which form the basis of the charges in the instant criminal action.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201cThe State of Connecticut hereby moves the court for permission to appeal dismissal of the captioned case, contained in a judgment and memorandum of decision of the court, <em>Noren, J., </em>dated September 28,1984, and attached hereto as Exhibit A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">\u201cThis motion is brought pursuant to General Statutes, section 54-96 and <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>174 Conn. 100, 110, 384 A.2d 315 (1977).

In this motion, the state \u201cmove[d] for review and reversal of the decision of the trial court denying it permission to appeal from its decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the above-captioned case.\u201d On March 26, 1985, the Appellate Court directed that the motion for review and the relief requested therein be granted. Pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>to Practice Book \u00a7 3004A (now \u00a7 4023), the case was transferred to this court on May 28, 1985.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u201cThe right to an appeal is not a constitutional one.\u201d <em>Chanosky </em>v. <em>City Building Supply Co., </em>152 Conn. 449, 451, 208 A.2d 337 (1965). \u201cThere is ... no common-law right of appeal by the state in criminal matters. . . . The right of the state to appeal in criminal cases is granted only by statute.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Falzone, </em>171 Conn. 417, 417-18, 370 A.2d 988 (1976); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Audet, </em>170 Conn. 337, 340, 365 A.2d 1082 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>106 Conn. 114, 115, 137 A. 394 (1927). \u201cAs we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>[supra, 119]: \u2018 \u201cStatutes authorizing an appeal in a criminal case must be strictly followed.\u201d 17 Corpus Juris, 14; <em>State </em>v. <em>Caplan, </em>85 Conn. 618, 84 Atl. 280 [1912].\u2019 The conditions of the statute must therefore be met to have a valid appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Audet, </em>supra. \u201cThe right of appeal is purely statutory. It is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met. [Id., 342]; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>135 Conn. 262, 266, 63 A.2d 589, aff\u2019d, 337 U.S. 901, 69 S. Ct. 1046, 93 L. Ed. 1715 (1948).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In this case, the right of appeal exists only by virtue of General Statutes \u00a7 54-96. That statute provides, in part, that appeals \u201cmay be taken by the state, <em>with the permission of the presiding judge. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The words of a statute are to be given their commonly approved meaning, unless a contrary intent is expressed. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 221, 479 A.2d 814 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 764, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982). The term \u201cpermission\u201d as used in \u00a7 54-96 needs no judicial gloss to demonstrate that it means the obtaining of consent and authority of the court; no automatic <em>right </em>to appeal is conferred upon the state. The statutory language unmistakably confers upon the trial court the choice of granting or withholding the appeal privilege depending upon the circumstances of each case. It is apparent from the permissive language of the statute that the legislature did not intend that permission to appeal be granted in every case in which it is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We have recently said: \u201cThe provision that permission from the . . . judge be obtained was a limitation on the right of appeal granted the state. . . . This condition is generally considered to be a prerequisite to appeal by the state. . . . However, as the dominant intention of the legislature was to extend the right of appeal to the state, the limitation placed upon that right is one which must be so exercised as to avoid abuse and unreasonable consequences.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 109-10. The permission of the trial judge is a condition which is a \u201cprerequisite\u201d to the existence of the state\u2019s right of appeal in a criminal matter under \u00a7 <em>54-96. State v. Avcollie, </em>supra, 109. It follows, therefore, that without that permission there is no viable appeal unless the court\u2019s denial of permission is \u201c \u2018so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d Id., 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">This case reaches us in an unusual posture. As already noted, the Appellate Court granted the state\u2019s motion for review and the relief requested therein; its order reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of permission to appeal and thus created an appeal where one had not there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>tofore existed. The Appellate Court\u2019s order, which was not accompanied by a memorandum of decision, impliedly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The defendant argues that the Appellate Court erred in reversing the trial court because, having invoked <em>Avcollie </em>and \u00a7 54-96, the state did not meet the standard set out in <em>Avcollie. </em>Maintaining that it has had no opportunity to have a review of the Appellate Court order, which created an appeal where none existed before, the defendant urges us to inquire whether the trial court did abuse its discretion. The state argues that the trial court\u2019s denial did violate <em>Avcollie </em>and, \u201c[m]oreover, the \u2018extreme abuse of discretion\u2019 test expounded by the defendant is a standard of review and has no bearing on reviewability, which is the issue here.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, the state argues, and we agree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>that this court has \u201cthe general supervisory power to protect its jurisdiction to hear appeals\u201d and that this \u201cpower cannot be defeated by the arbitrary action of a trial court.\u201d Accordingly, we proceed with our jurisdictional inquiry which brings us, as it must, to the issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion for, if it did, then a viable appeal exists and, if it did not, such an appeal does not exist. Put another way, the jurisdictional predicate for this appeal under \u00a7 54-96 exists only if the trial court abused its discretion in denying the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal. We conclude that there was no such abuse in this case and, therefore, dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">We agree with the state and the defendant that <em>Avcollie </em>lays down the standard to be followed in this case. Recognizing that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s granting or denial of the state\u2019s motion to appeal constitutes a \u2018judicial determination\u2019 within the court\u2019s discretion\u201d and that \u201c[ojrdinarily\u201d we will not review rulings made in the exercise of a court\u2019s discretion; <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 110; the <em>Avcollie </em>court, nevertheless, said that \u201c[i]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>those cases of manifest abuse . . . where injustice appears to have been done, this court will grant review to determine whether the court\u2019s exercise is \u2018so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d Id. The \u201cjudicial determination\u201d we spoke of in <em>Avcollie, </em>which is within the court\u2019s discretion, is more than \u201ca mere formality\u201d as is evidenced by its reference to <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavabetta, </em>supra. In striking down the trial court\u2019s earlier denial of the state\u2019s motion to appeal in <em>Avcollie, </em>we determined that \u201cjust such a clear and extreme abuse of discretion is evident.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 111. In doing so, we said that even the trial court itself admitted \u201cthat there was no considered reason for denying the state the opportunity to appeal\u201d and, therefore, we held that \u201cits action [was] arbitrary and an abuse of its discretion . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Inherent in the concept of judicial discretion is the idea of choice and a determination between competing considerations. Discretion could generically be said to apply to issues which do not yield a fundamentally empirical yes or no answer. The very core consideration of choice in discretion logically means that neither party is absolutely entitled to have that discretion exercised in its favor. We must determine whether the trial court\u2019s denial of permission to appeal was an abuse of its discretion. We conclude that it was not in this case. In reaching this conclusion, we weigh heavily the fact that in this case, unlike both <em>Avcollie </em>and <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>4 Conn. App. 520, 495 A.2d 724 (1985), the trial court did give \u201cconsidered reason[s]\u201d; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra; and did so at length and still later articulated them on request of the state. We hasten to add that our conclusion does not imply that we would have resolved the merits in the same fashion as the trial court. But the question of determining whether a trial court has abused its discretion does not depend upon whether a reviewing court would have reached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>same conclusion. See, e.g., <em>Bringhurst </em>v. <em>Harkins, </em>32 Del. 324, 122 A. 783 (1923); <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Lyle Adjustment Co., </em>70 N.M. 209, 213-14, 372 P.2d 797 (1962); <em>Abbenhaus </em>v. <em>Yakima, </em>89 Wash. 2d 855, 858-59, 576 P.2d 888 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We are aware, as the state argues, that the deference given to the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion should not be interpreted as meaning that its exercise is insulated from meaningful review. While another trial court might have resolved the competing considerations differently, given the analysis of the trial court in this case, we cannot say its considered reasons constituted \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cunreasonable\u201d action. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra. \u201cArbitrary\u201d means \u201c[wjithout adequate determining principle . . . not governed by any fixed rules or standard.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). \u201cUnreasonable\u201d means \u201cirrational.\u201d Id. One court aptly set out this reasoning: \u201cWhere there is room for two opinions, an action taken after due consideration is not arbitrary or capricious even though a reviewing court may believe it to be erroneous.\u201d <em>Abbenhaus </em>v. <em>Yakima, </em>supra. The memoranda filed by the trial court disclose a unique fact pattern, in both the civil and criminal aspects of this matter, which are admittedly based on identical facts. Despite the claims of the state to the contrary, even though we do not reach the merits, an examination of the trial court\u2019s memorandum on the issue of granting or withholding of the required permission to appeal discloses that the trial judge recognized his obligation \u201cto playfair with the system.\u201d See M. Rosenberg, \u201cJudicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed from Above,\u201d 22 Syracuse L. Rev. 635, 665 (1971). We do not see evident in this case, as we did in <em>Avcollie, </em>a \u201cclear and extreme abuse of discretion\u201d or a case \u201cwhere injustice appears to have been done.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>There was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal under \u00a7 54-96. Because that permission is crucial under the statute for an appeal to be viable and, a fortiori, for our subject matter jurisdiction, we have no such jurisdiction under the circumstances of this case. This requires that we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In this opinion, Peters, C. J., Callahan and Novack, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 22a-454 provides: \u201cpermit for collection, STORAGE OR TREATMENT, CONTAINMENT, REMOVAL OR DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES, MATERIALS OR WASTES: SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION. study of disposal methods.

In addition, the state asks this court to note that \u201cimplicit in the Appellate Court\u2019s order was a determination that the denial of permission to appeal was an abuse of discretion or would lead to unreasonable consequences. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>[174 Conn. 100, 111, 384 A.2d 315 (1977)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>4 Conn. App. 520, 523, 495 A.2d 724 (1985).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">These arguments are not persuasive. It is true that the defendant did not file an objection to the state\u2019s motion for review, but its position cannot be suggested to be one of acquiescence given its written objection together with the supporting documents it had earlier filed in the trial court. In addition, the defendant did not file a motion to dismiss the appeal. This presents no bar to our jurisdictional inquiry in this case for at least two reasons. First, as this opinion indicates, we are entitled to consider the entire proceedings below in order to determine if this court has jurisdiction. Second, our general supervisory power over appeals referred to in Practice Book \u00a7 3096 (now \u00a7 4183) is peculiarly applicable in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">While we deal elsewhere in this opinion with the impact of <em>Avcollie, </em>we will comment here on the state\u2019s citation of <em>Bellamy. </em>In <em>Bellamy, </em>the Appellate Court was, as is this court, the third court involved. In that case, the trial court had denied the state\u2019s motion to appeal. Thereafter, the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>late Session of the Superior Court granted the state\u2019s motion for review and set aside the trial court\u2019s denial and the state filed its appeal in the Appellate Court. The <em>Bellamy </em>court, unlike the trial court in this case, even after the Appellate Session granted the state the right to appeal, did not offer any reasons for its denial of permission to appeal. The Appellate Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>supra, 523, noted that <em>\u201c[i]mplicit </em>in the decision of the Appellate Session was the determination that the denial of permission to appeal was, <em>under the circumstances, </em>so arbitrary as to be an extreme abuse of discretion, a determination with which we agree.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The case before us is not <em>Bellamy </em>because it does not reflect a clear abuse of discretion. In this case, the trial court wrote a long memorandum of decision. In response to the state\u2019s motion, the court further articulated its decision. Therefore, the \u201cimplicit\u201d abuse of discretion opined in <em>Bellamy </em>has no place in the explicit reasoning of the trial court decision which is attacked in this case. Moreover, unlike <em>Bellamy, </em>its \u201cimplicit\u201d ratiocination cannot summarily lead here to the conclusion that \u201cthe denial of permission to appeal was, under these circumstances, so arbitrary as to be an extreme abuse of discretion . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b325-7\">Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIy\">dissenting. Because I find no valid reason for the denial of the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal in either the memoranda of the trial court or the majority opinion, I agree with the conclusion of the Appellate Court when it granted the state\u2019s motion for review that the trial court abused its discretion in denying such permission. Although the majority opinion implies that the trial court gave reasons for its denial of permission to appeal which would negate any \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d it does not specify what these reasons were or advance any reasons for such denial approved by the majority. The trial court did give reasons for its initial decision denying the motion to dismiss and also for its subsequent granting of the motion following reargument. The court filed an additional memorandum of decision responding to the state\u2019s motion for further articulation of the reasons for this reversal and also denying its motion for permission to appeal. All but the last paragraph of that memorandum simply elaborate upon the court\u2019s reasons for previously granting the motion to dismiss as requested in the motion for further articulation. The last paragraph is as follows: \u201cFairness, the bedrock upon which is based the doctrine of collateral estoppel, demands an end to these proceedings. And there will be no seismic result to Cardozo\u2019s edifice of justice; <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>U.S. 319, 328, 82 L. Ed. 288, 58 S. Ct. 149 (1937); as the Court exercises the discretion upon which he said the constitutional validity of our statute depends; Id.; in the absence of the convoluted facts and chronology of <em>[State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>174 Conn. 100, 384 A.2d 315 (1977)], and in the absence of its admission of no considered reason for denying the state the opportunity to appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">To the extent that this paragraph relies upon the doctrine of collateral estoppel as demanding \u201can end to these proceedings,\u201d it necessarily implicates the merits of the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the prosecution because of the stipulated judgment in the civil action and the terminology used in the release given by the commissioner of environmental protection in settlement of any civil claims against the defendant for water pollution. The remainder of the paragraph, as supplemented by a footnote,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seems to question the present constitutional viability of General Statutes \u00a7 54-96, the statutory authority for the state to appeal on questions of law. It concludes that, because the \u201cconvoluted facts and chronology\u201d of <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, where the trial judge had expressly conceded there was no good reason to deny permission to appeal, are absent, permission to appeal should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">To the extent that the opinion may rely on the elaborate discussion by the trial court of the grounds upon which it dismissed the information as its statement of \u201cconsidered reasonfs]\u201d for denying permission to appeal, the implication is that, so long as the mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>orandum of decision gives more than cursory treatment to the issues, a trial judge has absolute discretion to deny permission to appeal under the statute. The legislature could never have intended to vest in a trial judge such arbitrary authority to preclude appellate review of his own decisions. It is fundamental that one cannot be a judge in his own case. Unless this principle is deemed to have been wholly disregarded in \u00a7 54-96 by making the trial judge\u2019s determination conclusive, so long as the record demonstrates that sufficient judicial effort has been devoted to the issues, a denial of permission to appeal cannot properly be based upon the trier\u2019s view that his judgment is correct and that any appeal therefrom would be fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">To the extent that the opinion may rely upon the remaining reasons given by the trial court for denying permission to appeal, it seems to imply that such an exercise of discretion is reversible only where there has been an express admission by the trial judge that there is no good reason to deny the appeal, as in <em>Avcollie. </em>It is quite evident from the brief comments in the memorandum expressly addressing the motion for permission to appeal that the trial court took a jaundiced view of \u00a7 54-96, intimating that its constitutional validity was seriously in question. This plainly erroneous view appears to have been a significant influence in inducing the court to conclude that, unless the \u201cconvoluted facts and chronology\u201d of <em>Avcollie </em>were duplicated, permission to appeal should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Neither the trial court nor the majority have taken the view that the issues sought to be raised by the state in this appeal are frivolous. Indeed they are highly significant, involving a question of whether one state agency in pursuing its authorized functions may deliberately or inadvertently invade the exclusive authority of the state\u2019s attorney to pursue a criminal prosecution. Nor does the majority opinion suggest any hard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ship that will be suffered by this corporate defendant or by other persons as a possible ground to support the action of the trial court. I find it incomprehensible, therefore, that the majority chooses to reverse the conclusion of the Appellate Court that the trial court did abuse its discretion in denying permission to appeal rather than address the substantial and unprecedented issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> The footnote referenced at the end of the quoted paragraph of the trial court\u2019s memorandum was as follows: \u201cIn light of the myriad and vast changes which have taken place in the field of constitutional law in the past nearly half century, and in light of the rationale for the decision in <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 82 L. Ed. 288, 58 S. Ct. 149 (1937), it is intriguing to contemplate the fate of general statutes section 54-96 if considered today by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
