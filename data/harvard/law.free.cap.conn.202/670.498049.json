The factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>background of this case is undisputed. The plaintiff, Dale Van Tienen, sued the defendant, The Register Publishing Company (Register), for defamation and wrongful discharge following her termination from employment for allegedly plagiarizing a news story from a competing newspaper. Prior to trial, the plaintiff deposed Murray Farber, a former managing editor at the Register, who had been employed by the Register at the time of the plaintiffs termination. During the deposition, the plaintiffs counsel asked Farber who else, besides some staff members, had complained about the plaintiffs job performance. Farber began to answer, stating that \u201cthere was a point at which Mr. LaPrade [the Register\u2019s legal counsel] . . . .\u201d Defense counsel interrupted Farber\u2019s answer by objecting and instructing Farber not to answer \u201cinsofar as [the] answer relates to any conversation with counsel [Carter LaPrade]\u201d on the ground that the attorney-client privilege prevented discovery of such communications. Farber indicated that he wished to answer the question despite defense counsel\u2019s objection. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued that Farber was not the defendant\u2019s witness, and that the attorney-client privilege was Farber\u2019s to claim, not the Register\u2019s. Defense counsel claimed that the privilege belonged to the Register since Farber had been an employee of the company at the time in question. After a lengthy colloquy between the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and defense counsel, Farber decided to answer the question concerning LaPrade\u2019s complaints with regard to the plaintiff. Defense counsel renewed his objection. Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion for a protective order to expunge that portion of the deposition transcript regarding LaPrade\u2019s complaints about the plaintiff. The defendant also moved to disqualify the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asserting that disqualification was the only remedy to protect the defendant from use of the confidential information brought out in the deposition. The trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>Fracasse, J., </em>granted both the motion for a protective order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the motion to disqualify the plaintiffs counsel. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff raises a number of issues concerning the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motions. We recently held, however, in <em>Burger &amp; Burger, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murren, </em>202 Conn. 660, 522 A.2d 812 (1987), that an order disqualifying counsel is not a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken. Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to address the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-14\"> The plaintiff conceded at oral argument that our review of her claim of error with respect to the granting of the motion for a protective order was contingent upon our determining that a disqualification order is immediately appealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
