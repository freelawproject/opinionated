Subsequently, at a hearing before a commissioner in chancery, Carol claimed she was mentally incompetent when she executed the agreement and should not be bound by it. The trial court scheduled a hearing for February 10, 1983, to determine the validity of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Until 8:00 p.m. on the evening before the hearing, Carol\u2019s attorney attempted unsuccessfully to settle the property settlement dispute. Apparently, a conflict arose between Carol and her attorney regarding the conduct of the litigation and Carol\u2019s desire to advance a position the attorney considered untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">On the morning of the hearing, Carol\u2019s attorney, citing the conflict with Carol, requested permission to withdraw as counsel. The attorney stated that \u201cethical reasons\u201d and her client\u2019s wishes would prevent her from continuing to represent Carol adequately.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The trial court rejected the attorney\u2019s request to withdraw voluntarily and questioned Carol regarding her desire to dismiss her attorney from further representation. Carol indicated to the court that she would like to secure new counsel if the case could be continued for that purpose. In response, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">Ma\u2019am, you didn\u2019t understand what I said. I said that if you wish to represent yourself here today, you may do that before the Court. If you do not wish to represent yourself and you wish [present counsel] to continue representing you, the Court will allow that to happen. If you have another lawyer that is outside or willing to come here later on today and try this case, fine. But, I\u2019m not going to continue the case because some dispute has arisen in the last several months between you and [your attorney]. It\u2019s a little bit late for that now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">Thereupon, Carol consented to the withdrawal of her attorney. The court advised Carol that it was her responsibility \u201cto secure [her] own counsel between now and [two o\u2019clock] and [to] get any witnesses\u201d she desired by that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>When Carol returned to court at two o\u2019clock, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">Your Honor, I do not have an attorney with me. I spoke to one law firm that told me that they could not appear on such short notice on such a complex matter; that without adequate preparation, it would be an embarrassment to themselves and to the Court. And in addition to which it would be highly unethical to represent a client with such poor preparation. For the record, I once more would like to ask for a continuance of thirty days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The trial court again denied Carol\u2019s motion for a continuance and proceeded to hear the merits of the case. At the conclusion of the evidence, the court ruled that Carol was competent at the time she executed the agreement and, accordingly, held that the agreement was valid. Consequently, the court incorporated the agreement into its final decree of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">A motion for a continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court in view of all the circumstances of the case. A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a continuance will be reversed on appeal only if it is plainly erroneous and upon a showing of abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice to the movant. <em>Autry </em>v. Bryan, 224 Va. 451, 454, 297 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">When a trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance \u201cseriously imperil [s] the just determination of the cause,\u201d the judgment will be reversed. <em>Myers and Axtell, Receivers </em>v. <em>Trice, </em>86 Va. 835, 842, 11 S.E. 428, 430 (1890). Reversal is especially warranted when nothing in the case indicates that the movant\u2019s purpose for the motion is to delay or evade trial. <em>Id. </em>at 838, 11 S.E. at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Nothing in the record in the present case suggests that Carol\u2019s purpose in requesting a continuance was to delay or evade her trial. She had little or no advance notice that she would be without counsel at the time of trial. As a result, Carol was forced into the trial of a complex matter without the assistance of counsel. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion and that Carol was prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Accordingly, we will reverse the decree of the trial court and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
