Myers, Jr., Clerk of the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (the Clerk). The deed contained the signatures of five grantors. Three different notaries public executed certificates stating that the deed was \u201c[subscribed and sworn to\u201d by each grantor. The Clerk refused to record the deed because he believed the words, \u201csubscribed and sworn to,\u201d did not comply with Code \u00a7 55-113. Cumbee petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandamus to compel the Clerk to record the deed. The court denied the petition, ruling that the words, \u201csubscribed and sworn to,\u201d do not constitute \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the acknowledgment statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Code \u00a7 55-113 prescribes the requirements for an acknowledgment and reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">Such . . . clerk . . . shall admit any such writing to record as to any person whose name is signed thereto, except acknowledgment of contracts for the sale of real property shall require the seller or grantor of such real property to acknowledge his signature as herein provided ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">(1) Upon the certificate of ... a notary public . . . that such writing had been acknowledged before him by such person. Such certificate shall be written upon or annexed to such writing and shall be substantially to the following effect, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">I, _, clerk (or deputy clerk, or a commissioner in chancery) of the_court, (or a notary public) for the county (or corporation) aforesaid, in the State (or territory, or district) of _, do certify that E.F., or E.F. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>G.H., and so forth, whose name (or names) is (or are) signed to the writing above (or hereto annexed) bearing date on the -day of-, has (or have) acknowledged the same before me in my county (or corporation) aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">Given under my hand this_day of__</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The policy of the Commonwealth is \u201cto look with great leniency on certificates of acknowledgment, and to uphold them if possible.\u201d <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Rorer\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>135 Va. 1, 24, 116 S.E. 767, 775 (1923), <em>error </em>denied, 262 U.S. 734 (1923). Obvious technical errors in a certificate of acknowledgment will be disregarded; a substantial compliance with the acknowledgment statute is all that is required. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf it is reasonably certain that the grantor made the acknowledgment of the instrument in question that is sufficient,\u201d <em>id., </em>because \u201c[t]he object of the statute is that the notary . . . shall know and certify that the person whose name is signed to the instrument is the person who is acknowledging it.\u201d <em>Building and Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Roane, </em>205 Va. 916, 917, 140 S.E.2d 823, 824 (1965). Indeed, a handbook for notaries public prepared and published by the Secretary of the Commonwealth pursuant to Code \u00a7 47.1-11,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides, <em>inter alia, </em>two suggested forms of and procedures for acknowledgments, one using the words, \u201cacknowledged before me,\u201d and the other, the words \u201csubscribed and sworn.\u201d <em>A Handbook for Notaries Public Practicing in Virginia, </em>(3d ed. July 1980), p. 5-6 (the Handbook).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The Clerk contends that the phrase, \u201csubscribed and sworn to,\u201d generally called the \u201cjurat,\u201d is an unacceptable and insufficient acknowledgment of a deed of conveyance. He relies in part on <em>Wisniewski </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>223 Va. 141, 143, 286 S.E.2d 223, 224 (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Wisniewski, </em>a statute specifically prescribed that persons desiring to form a limited partnership shall \u201csign and swear to\u201d the partnership certificate. The certificate was signed and <em>acknowledged </em>by all the partners before a notary public. We held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>that because the partners failed to \u201cswear to\u201d the certificate it was rendered ineffective. In <em>Wisniewski, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">There is a marked difference between acknowledging a signature and signing a document under oath. An acknowledgment merely verifies that the person named executed the document in question. Code \u00a7 55-118.3. By swearing to a document, on the other hand, one vouches that the contents of the writing are true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">223 Va. at 143, 286 S.E.2d at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Although <em>acknowledging </em>one\u2019s signature is not equivalent to <em>swearing to </em>a document, it does not follow that when a person subscribes and <em>swears to </em>a document he has not acknowledged his signature. A certificate of acknowledgment signifies that the person acknowledging the document stated in the presence of the notary that the document was his or her act. The person may either have already signed the document or the person may sign the document in the notary\u2019s presence. However, the \u201cjurat\u201d indicates that the person actually signed the document in the presence of the notary. Swearing to an instrument subsumes an acknowledgment. Thus, it logically follows that when a person signs and swears to a document he acknowledges that \u201che executed the instrument.\u201d Code \u00a7 55-118.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">While the words \u201csubscribed and sworn to\u201d are not those suggested in Code \u00a7 55-113, we hold that, because it is \u201creasonably certain\u201d that the grantors acknowledged the deed, there has been a substantial compliance with the statute. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and grant the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-12\"> The Clerk demurred to the petition on the grounds that (1) the phrase \u201csubscribed and sworn to\u201d did not substantially comply with Code \u00a7 55-113, and (2) mandamus did not lie because \u201cthere was no clear ministerial duty which the [clerk] failed to perform.\u201d The trial court sustained the first ground of the demurrer, but fails to address the second. Because the Clerk has not assigned cross-error with respect to this issue, we will not address it on appeal.
