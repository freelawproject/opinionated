The horses were valued at a total of $18,000. Following a hearing, the Board disallowed Carlo\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">Thereafter, pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-552<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 15.1-553<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, Carlo appealed the Board\u2019s decision. The appeal was tried in a <em>de novo </em>proceeding, and a jury awarded Carlo an $18,000 verdict. Carlo sought to have judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict; the trial court, however, entered a \u201cfinal decree\u201d that reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-7\">And, it appearing to the Court that a jury, duly empanel-led to hear the complainant\u2019s claim, did on the 28th day of January, 1983, return its verdict that the complainant\u2019s claim should be allowed in the amount of $18,000; it is accordingly ADJUDGED, ORDERED, and DECREED that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the Board of Supervisors of Nottoway County, Virginia, approve the complainant\u2019s claim in the amount of $18,000, to be paid from the dog fund of the County as funds become available to do so as provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">Carlo contends on appeal, as he did at trial, that he is entitled to a judgment against the County and that the trial court erred in remanding the case to the Board for satisfaction of the jury\u2019s verdict. On the other hand, the County contends that Carlo merely obtained \u201can <em>in rem </em>judgment against the Nottoway County dog fund.\u201d We agree with Carlo that he is entitled to a judgment against the County on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">It may be true that Carlo\u2019s initial claim, if originally approved by the Board, was payable solely from the County\u2019s dog fund pursuant to former Code \u00a7 29-213.25. When the Board disallowed Carlo\u2019s claim, however, Carlo appealed this decision pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-552 and 15.1-553, a remedy not challenged by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">An \u201cappeal\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-552 is a <em>de novo </em>action at law, resulting in a judgment for either the claimant or the county. <em>See Luck Const. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell Cty., </em>115 Va. 335, 79 S.E. 393 (1913) (appeal of board of supervisors\u2019 decision treated as an action at law). Indeed, Code \u00a7 15.1-553 clearly supports the proposition that an appeal hereunder results in a judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-7\">No execution shall be issued upon any <em>judgment </em>recovered against a county, board of supervisors, or against any officer of the county, when the <em>judgment </em>should be paid by the county, but the same shall be provided for by the board of supervisors in the next county levy and paid by the treasurer as other county charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">Thus, when a claimant obtains a judgment in a <em>de novo </em>proceeding under Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-552 and 15.1-553, the judgment \u201cshall be . . . paid ... as other county charges.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-553. Nothing in the statutory scheme indicates that a county board of supervisors\u2019 decision on a claim for livestock compensation is excepted from Code \u00a7 15.1-553. Had the General Assembly intended to make such an exception, it could have so stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court erred in refusing to enter a judgment against the County on the jury\u2019s verdict. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>cordingly, we will reverse the ruling below, vacate the \u201cfinal decree\u201d entered by the trial court, and enter judgment in favor of Carlo in the amount of $18,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b20-8\"> Former Code \u00a7 29-213.25, now Code \u00a7 29-213.87, read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-9\">Any person who has any livestock or poultry killed or injured by any dog not his own shall be entitled to receive as compensation the fair market value of such livestock or poultry ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-10\">...
