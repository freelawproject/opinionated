We have examined the issue and have concluded not to impose such liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Appellant Anne Hunter Bell was injured severely on February 2, 1981 in the City of Virginia Beach when she was attacked at her place of employment, the Mariner Hotel, by Littleton C. Hudgins, III, son of appellees Littleton C. Hudgins, Sr. and Dorothy T. Hudgins. Bell sued the assailant, his parents, and her employer, seeking recovery of compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court sustained a demurrer filed by the parents and we awarded the plaintiff this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">In her motion for judgment, the plaintiff alleged that the assailant, who was 16 years of age and resided with his parents in their Virginia Beach home, had suffered \u201cfor a long period of time\u201d from serious emotional problems, all of which were known to the parents. The plaintiff further asserted that \u201con frequent occasions these emotional problems manifested themselves in violence\u201d on the part of the son, a fact \u201cwell known\u201d to the parents. The plaintiff also alleged that, immediately prior to the date of the attack on her, the son had been involved \u201cin certain illegal activities\u201d on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>her employer\u2019s premises, located near the home of the parents. She asserted that these \u201cactivities\u201d involved violence and threats of violence which were \u201cmade known\u201d to the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The plaintiff alleged that the knowledge of such violent conduct should have put \u201canyone\u201d on notice that the son \u201cshould be placed in an institution for safe keeping.\u201d Nevertheless, the plaintiff asserted, \u201cthe defendant parents failed to heed those warnings and clear indications of potential harm and allowed the child to remain free to move about the community at will.\u201d She asserted that the parents, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have \u201cseen to his in house custodial treatment and care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The plaintiff alleged that, as the result of the parents\u2019 negligent failure to prevent the son from being \u201cat large\u201d in the community, she was permanently injured when the son attempted to rape her and when he assaulted her with a knife while she was performing her duties as a desk clerk at the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In sustaining the demurrer, the trial court ruled that the plaintiffs claim did not state a cause of action. The court noted that \u201c[i]f public policy demands a parent to be held liable in these circumstances, it should be accomplished by an appropriate act of the General Assembly and not by judicial pronouncement.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Virginia adheres to the general rule that, in the absence of a master-servant or principal-agent relationship, the fact of paternity alone does not impose liability on parents for the torts of their minor child. <em>Hackley </em>v. Robey, 170 Va. 55, 65, 195 S.E. 689, 693 (1938). But the plaintiff says she does not rely on a theory of vicarious tort liability in this case. Instead, the plaintiff contends that, under certain specified circumstances, parents are liable for their own negligence which results in injury or damage intentionally inflicted by their minor child to third parties. Pointing out that an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of jurisdictions impose such liability, <em>see </em>Annot., 54 A.L.R.3d 974, the plaintiff invites us to adopt the Restatement position. That rule provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cA parent is under a duty to exercise reasonable care so to control his minor child as to prevent it from intentionally harming others or from so conducting itself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them, if the parent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>(a) knows or has reason to know that he has the ability to control his child, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">(b) knows or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 316.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We decline the plaintiffs invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">We are unwilling to establish in Virginia by judicial decree a blanket rule which would impose civil liability upon parents who fail to control their minor child\u2019s criminal behavior. <em>See Lanterman </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>277 Md. 364, 354 A.2d 432 (1976). The General Assembly already has legislated in this area, but stopped short of imposing the broad parental liability urged by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-44 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">\u201cThe owner of any property may institute an action and recover from the parents, or either of them, of any minor living with such parents, or either of them, for damages suffered by reason of the willful or malicious destruction of, or damage to, such property by such minor. No more than $500 may be recovered from such parents, or either of them, as a result of any incident or occurrence on which such action is based. Any such recovery from the parent or parents of such minor shall not preclude full recovery from such minor except to the amount of the recovery from such parent or parents. The provisions of this statute shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other law imposing upon a parent liability for the acts of his minor child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">We reject the plaintiffs argument that the language in the last sentence of the statute \u201cspeaks directly to the existence of the cause of action for which Bell now argues.\u201d This is a vicarious liability statute which imposes liability without a determination of the parents\u2019 independent negligence. The \u201cadditional\u201d law mentioned in the last sentence refers to existing law based on vicarious liability, such as the liability of a parent based upon a principal-agent relationship. Similar statutes enacted in other states have been construed to focus primarily on prevention of juvenile delinquency, malicious mischief, and vandalism and, in view of the monetary limitation, to impose a penalty upon parents rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>to afford compensation to the victim, the relief sought in this case. <em>See </em>Annot., 8 A.L.R.3d 612, 615, 624-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">We believe that a decision whether to adopt a doctrine of parental neglect is more properly left to the legislature because of the many societal and policy considerations which necessarily bear upon such a decision. <em>See Williamson </em>v. <em>The Old Brogue, Inc., </em>232 Va. 350, 350 S.E.2d 621 (1986). As the trial court noted in sustaining the demurrer, many public policy issues arise from the suggestion that a parent who fails to institutionalize or severely curtail the activities of an emotionally disturbed minor child should be liable to third persons for the child\u2019s intentional torts. For example, should this concept of liability be applied to other family relationships? That is, should one spouse have the duty to control the conduct of an emotionally unstable spouse? Should the rule apply to other relationships, such as between physician and emotionally ill patient? Should the doctrine apply to all minor children regardless of age, even though parental control diminishes as the child matures? Should the rule apply to anyone standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to the emotionally disturbed child? Will there be an adverse effect upon the mental health care system, the judicial system, and traditional family relationships if such a rule is adopted? Answers to these and other policy questions generated by the rule advocated by the plaintiff should come from the General Assembly and not the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Finally, <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>145 Va. 489, 134 S.E. 576 (1926), relied on by the plaintiff, is inapposite. In that case, a plaintiff recovered damages from a father as the result of the negligence of defendant\u2019s <em>adult </em>son who, while intoxicated, drove the father\u2019s motor vehicle into the plaintiff. However, that case was tried on the theories of respondeat superior and negligent entrustment, concepts which are different from the theory relied upon in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Consequently, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
