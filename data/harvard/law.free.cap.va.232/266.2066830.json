Harvey during or subsequent to the commission of rape. Pruett was also indicted for the rape and robbery of Mrs. Harvey. In the first phase of a bifurcated trial conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3, a jury convicted Pruett of all three charges and fixed his punishment for rape at life imprisonment and for robbery at seventy-five years\u2019 imprisonment. In the second phase of the trial, the jury heard evidence in aggravation and mitigation of the murder charge and fixed Pruett\u2019s punishment on that charge at death. Following consideration of a pre-sentence report, the trial court imposed the sentences fixed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Pruett appealed his convictions for rape and robbery to the Court of Appeals. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.06, we certified those charges to this Court and consolidated them with Pruett\u2019s appeal of his murder conviction and the automatic review of his death penalty under Code \u00a7 17-110.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">I. Pretrial Matters</p>\n<p id=\"AUc\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">In a pretrial motion, Pruett sought to suppress \u201call statements, confessions or admissions\u201d he made to the police concerning the crimes in question. The trial court denied the motion, and this denial is the subject of Pruett\u2019s principal assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">The record shows that shortly before noon on February 13, 1985, the nude, mutilated body of Wilma L. Harvey was found on a bed in the home she shared with her husband, Richard, in Virginia Beach. Richard was out of town on a business trip at the time his wife was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Evidence at the suppression hearing shows that in the early stages of their investigation, police officers learned from witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that Pruett\u2019s automobile was parked in front of the Harvey residence on the evening of February 12, preceding the discovery of Mrs. Harvey\u2019s body. The police also learned that Pruett was a close friend of the Harveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Shortly after midnight on February 14, a detective was dispatched to Pruett\u2019s home to ask him \u201cif he would accompany\u201d the detective to police headquarters \u201cfor an interview.\u201d Pruett was transported to headquarters, where he was interviewed by Sergeant J. T. VanderHeiden in a session lasting about 90 minutes. VanderHeiden did not give Pruett the warnings outlined in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), prior to any questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">During the interview, which was recorded and transcribed, Pruett admitted he visited Wilma Harvey on the evening of February 12, but he denied killing her. He said he left the Harvey residence about 5:45 p.m. VanderHeiden had information, however, that placed Pruett\u2019s car in front of the Harvey home somewhat later than 5:4s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When this apparent conflict developed, VanderHeiden read Pruett his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Pruett signed a waiver stating he understood his rights and was willing to make a statement and answer questions without a lawyer present.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The interview ended some 20 to 30 minutes after the waiver was signed with VanderHeiden requesting Pruett to \u201cgive [the police] a call if he had any additional information.\u201d Pruett then left police headquarters and was driven home by a detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Later in the day on February 14, VanderHeiden learned that Pruett\u2019s fingerprints had been found on the inside of the right lens of eyeglasses worn by Wilma Harvey and on the headboard of the bed on which her body was found. VanderHeiden dispatched a detective to Pruett\u2019s home with instructions to ask him to accompany the detective to police headquarters, \u201cthe same as the first interview.\u201d. Pruett was not arrested \u201cat that time.\u201d He arrived at police headquarters about 3:45 p.m. Prior to questioning, VanderHeiden advised Pruett of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and Pruett signed a waiver stating he understood his rights and was willing to make a statement and answer questions without a lawyer present.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The second interview, which was videotaped, lasted some <em>AVi </em>hours. During the interview, Pruett not only confessed to the rape, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>robbery, and murder of Wilma Harvey but also volunteered the information that in 1975, he robbed and murdered Debra Mclnnis, the assistant manager of a Kentucky Fried Chicken store. At the end of the interview, Pruett was arrested, placed in handcuffs, and transported to a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Pruett testified at the suppression hearing that he did not feel he was free to leave during the 1:00 a.m. interview on February 14. He admitted, however, that he was told he was not under arrest at the time of the interview, and he said that he did, \u201cin fact,\u201d leave when the interview was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On appeal, Pruett contends that \u201cthe first interview was a custodial interrogation to which <em>Miranda </em>applied.\u201d Pruett argues that because he was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the beginning of the first interview and the police gained, during that \u201cinitial improper interrogation,\u201d incriminating information which was used to secure his confession during the second interrogation, the confession was tainted by the illegality of the earlier confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">It is well settled, Pruett maintains, that a confession secured after an earlier incriminating statement has been illegally obtained should be held inadmissible, absent a demonstration by the prosecution that the second statement was not \u201ca product of the earlier unwarned and coerced confession.\u201d Then, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bayer, </em>331 U.S. 532, 540 (1947), Pruett metaphorizes that \u201cafter an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing, no matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed\u201d and \u201ccan never get the cat back in the bag.\u201d Pruett concludes that the Commonwealth should be made to \u201csuffer the consequences\u201d of the police failure to advise him of his rights and the only appropriate sanction is the suppression of the incriminating statements he made in both interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We disagree with Pruett. <em>Miranda </em>applies only to \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d which means \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444. <em>Miranda </em>does not affect \u201cgeneral questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477. Neither is the application of <em>Miranda </em>triggered \u201csimply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect.\u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977). <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required \u201conly where there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him \u2018in custody.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In denying Pruett\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court found that Pruett was \u201cnot under arrest\u201d at the time of the first interview,. that he \u201cknew from the beginning ... he was not under arrest,\u201d and that he was \u201cfree to leave at any time\u201d during the interview. The court concluded that Pruett\u2019s initial meeting with the police was \u201cnoncustodial questioning,\u201d not \u201ca custodial interview,\u201d and, therefore, that it was not necessary for the police to advise Pruett of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">These findings of the trial court are amply supported by the evidence. Sergeant VanderHeiden testified without contradiction at the suppression hearing that although he considered Pruett \u201ca suspect,\u201d he did not advise Pruett of his <em>Miranda </em>rights because he was not a \u201cconcrete suspect\u201d and the police had \u201cnothing to indicate that he was the person who had killed Wilma.\u201d VanderHeiden said that Pruett \u201cand just about everybody else in the City of Virginia Beach was a suspect at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">VanderHeiden testified further that Pruett was not under arrest at the time of the interview, was told he was not under arrest, and was told he was not a suspect. Pruett was not booked on any charge, according to VanderHeiden, and he was not under any physical restraint. When asked what he would have done had Pruett said he wanted to leave, VanderHeiden replied that he \u201cwould [have] let him leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">We think the record of the suppression hearing demonstrates clearly that Pruett was not in custody at the time of the first interview and that he was subjected only to \u201cgeneral questioning ... in the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 477. Hence, the police were not required to give Pruett the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before commencing questioning. <em>See Coleman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 226 </em>Va. 31, 47, 307 S.E.2d 864, 873 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109 (1984); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 470, 248 S.E.2d 135, 144 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). But even if we assume that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required before questioning commenced in the first interview, our opinion with respect to the admissibility of the confession obtained at the second confrontation would remain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298 (1985), the accused made an incriminating statement while in custody without benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Approximately one hour later, the accused was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and made a full confession. He contended that the confession was tainted by the earlier failure of the police to give him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and he relied upon the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d metaphor to support the contention. The Court rejected both the contention and the metaphor, holding that \u201ca suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">We recently applied <em>Elstad </em>to approve the admission of confessions in <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 408-09, 329 S.E.2d 815, 822, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 865 (1985), and <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 501, 512-13, 331 S.E.2d 407, 416 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1031 (1986), both death penalty cases. <em>Poyner </em>involved a contention that a second confession was tainted because the first was preceded by allegedly defective <em>Miranda </em>warnings. In <em>Boggs, </em>the defendant claimed that his confession was inadmissible because an earlier incriminating statement was unwarned.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Pruett says he is \u201caware of \u201d <em>Elstad, </em>and he stresses in his brief this passage from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">The Court today in no way retracts from the bright-line rule of <em>Miranda. </em>We do not imply that good faith excuses a failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings; nor do we condone inherently coercive police tactics or methods offensive to due process that render the initial admission involuntary and undermine the suspect\u2019s will to invoke his rights once they are read to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">470 U.S. at 317. Pruett then, argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">[T]he police in this case set out on a course of action knowing full well that if they advised [Pruett] initially of his rights under <em>Miranda, </em>they would not have gotten the information that they were seeking. It was a deliberate, bad faith plan on the part of the police to solicit inculpatory information in the initial 1:00 a.m. unwarned custodial interrogation, and then to try and cleanse themselves by letting [Pruett] go home for several hours and then picking him up again for the warned, so-called voluntary 3:45 p.m. interrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The difficulty with this argument is that it finds absolutely no support in the record. An examination of the record reveals nothing to suggest that the police tactics in this case even approached the type condemned in the passage from <em>Elstad </em>quoted above, <em>i.e., </em>those which \u201crender the initial admission involuntary and undermine the suspect\u2019s will to invoke his rights once they are read to him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Rather, the language of <em>Elstad </em>immediately following the passage quoted above is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">A handful of courts have, however, applied our precedents relating to confessions obtained under coercive circumstances to situations involving wholly voluntary admissions, requiring a passage of time or break in events before a second, fully warned statement can be deemed voluntary. Far from establishing a rigid rule, we direct courts to avoid one; there is no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the suspect\u2019s initial inculpatory statement, though technically in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>was voluntary. The relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second statement was also voluntarily made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 317-18 (footnote omitted). In this case, even assuming that a technical <em>Miranda </em>violation occurred in the initial interview, we have no difficulty finding that the statements made in both interviews were clearly voluntary and, hence, admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">B. Motions for Psychiatric Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">In a pretrial motion filed pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-169.1 and -169.5, Pruett asked the trial court to order a psychiatric evaluation at state expense to determine whether his \u201cactions during the time of the alleged offense may have been affected by mental disease or defect.\u201d The court appointed Dr. Thomas K. Tsao to evaluate Pruett \u201cconcerning [his] mental state at the time of the offenses, including whether he may have had a significant disease or defect which rendered him insane at the time of the offenses, and his competency to understand the nature of these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AaN\">After Dr. Tsao submitted his report,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defense counsel moved the .court to appoint another psychiatrist to evaluate Pruett \u201con the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>issue of his sanity and ability to withstand trial.\u201d Counsel\u2019s sole basis for this motion was that Dr. Tsao\u2019s evaluation took only about \u201cone hour\u2019s time\u201d and, hence, was \u201cinadequate.\u201d The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Then, approximately one month before trial, Pruett made another motion for the appointment of a psychiatrist. This time, defense counsel told the trial court that Pruett only recently had informed counsel of his wartime experiences in Viet Nam. Counsel admitted that Pruett had told Dr. Tsao of his Viet Nam experiences, but counsel asserted that because Dr. Tsao was \u201cof oriental nationality,\u201d he would be prejudiced against Pruett for \u201cthe things\u201d Pruett had done in Viet Nam. Counsel told the court that the defense desired an evaluation of Pruett by a psychiatrist recognized as an authority in the \u201cphenomenon . . . known in psychiatric circles as delayed stress syndrome\u201d and that Dr. Tsao was not such an authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Pruett took the witness stand briefly to tell the court that he served with the Army in Viet Nam for about a year. Pruett said he was a cook on a transport vessel that \u201cwent up and down the coast,\u201d but that he was also a soldier \u201cevery other day,\u201d serving on shore duty and engaging in combat.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The trial court denied Pruett\u2019s motion. Pruett maintains that this was error, that the denial of his second evaluation \u201cin effect prevented [him] from developing facts in mitigation of the offense as is authorized in the capital sentencing statute, Va. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Furthermore, Pruett says, the General Assembly, in response to <em>Ake </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68 (1985),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has enacted Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:1, entitled \u201cExpert assistance when defendant\u2019s mental condition relevant to capital sentencing.\u201d Pruett quotes a portion of this section which states in Paragraph (A) that, on motion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>counsel for an indigent in a capital murder case, a trial court shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">[A]ppoint one or more qualified mental health experts to evaluate the defendant and to assist the defense in the preparation and presentation of information concerning the defendant\u2019s history, character, or mental condition, including . . . (iii) whether there are any other factors in mitigation relating to the history or character of the defendant or the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Pruett does not argue that the foregoing section actually required the trial court to appoint a second psychiatrist to evaluate him but that the \u201cone or more\u201d language authorized the court to make such an appointment in the exercise of its discretion. The denial of his motion, Pruett maintains, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We do not think the trial court abused its discretion. We agree with the Attorney General that the trial court\u2019s appointment of Dr. Tsao provided Pruett \u201call that he was constitutionally or statutorily entitled to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The order appointing Dr. Tsao specifically directed that he was to include in his report \u201cany . . . mitigating circumstances.\u201d The order also directed the doctor to \u201cassist in evaluation, preparation and presentation of the defense as necessary.\u201d This language was inclusive enough to require Dr. Tsao\u2019s assistance in the penalty stage of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The trial court made a specific finding that Dr. Tsao was a competent physician, based upon the court\u2019s prior experience with Dr. Tsao \u201con other instances.\u201d Pruett told Dr. Tsao about his wartime experiences in Viet Nam, and there is nothing in the record except defense counsel\u2019s argument even hinting that the doctor would not have given an unbiased opinion concerning those experiences, even though he was, by Pruett\u2019s description, \u201cof oriental nationality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The fact that Pruett may not have received from Dr. Tsao the opinion he wanted is completely immaterial. Pruett does not have \u201ca constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own.\u201d <em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 83; <em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 99, 107, 334 S.E.2d 838, 843 (1985). Put another way, Pruett has no right to \u201cshop around\u201d at state expense until he finds a doctor who will give him the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>he wants. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>753 F.2d 342, 350 n.7 (4th Cir. 1985), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Turner </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>476 U.S. _, 106 S.Ct. 1683 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">C. Motions Concerning Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">On the morning of trial, Pruett moved the trial court to impanel two juries, one to determine guilt, and, in the event of conviction, one to determine punishment. Pruett argued that it was \u201cagainst [his] constitutional rights and rights to fair trial that [the] jury be death qualified before it even determines the issue of guilt and innocence.\u201d The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Pruett acknowledges that in <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 479-80, 331 S.E.2d 422, 431 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986), we upheld the constitutionality of the provision in Virginia\u2019s death penalty statutes for the use of the same jury in both the guilt and punishment stages of a capital trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pruett says, however, that the accused in <em>Watkins </em>contended that \u201conce a jury finds a man guilty of a capital offense, it is incapable of impartiality in fixing his punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 331 S.E.2d at 431. His contention, Pruett says, is different: a jury which has been \u201cdeath qualified\u201d and hence capable of fixing punishment is incapable of impartiality in determining guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We disagree. In <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 690-91, 251 S.E.2d 202, 207, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979), we rejected the argument that \u201ca defendant\u2019s rights to due process and an impartial trial under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments\u201d are violated by the use of death-qualification questions during <em>voir dire </em>in a capital murder case. And in <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>476. U.S. _, 106 S.Ct. 1758 (1986), the United States Supreme Court recently rejected the argument that \u201cthe very process of questioning prospective jurors at <em>voir dire </em>about their views of the death penalty violates the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 106 S.Ct. at 1763 n.7. The Court said the states have an \u201centirely proper interest in obtaining a single jury that could impartially decide all of the issues in [a capital murder] case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>_, 106 S.Ct. at 1768, and that the process of \u201cdeath qualification\u201d of jurors is proper even assuming it \u201cproduces juries somewhat more \u2018conviction-prone\u2019 than \u2018non-death-qualified\u2019 juries,\u201d <em>id. </em>at_, 106 S.Ct. at 1764.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">After the trial court denied Pruett\u2019s motion for two juries, he moved the court to permit him to plead guilty and submit to the jury the question of punishment alone. The court denied this motion. The court\u2019s action was correct. Rule 3A:13(a) provides that \u201c[t]he accused is entitled to a trial by jury only in a circuit court on a plea of not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Pruett points out, however, that Rule 3A:18 provides that \u201c[t]he trial of capital cases shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.1 of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2 [Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 to -264.5] and, except to the extent conflicting therewith, the provisions of this Part Three A shall be applicable thereto.\u201d Pruett argues that because Article 4.1 of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2 \u201cprovides for a bifurcated trial, with a separate hearing on the issue of punishment, ... he is entitled to a jury on the issue of punishment alone following a plea of guilty on all charges to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">But there is no provision in Article 4.1 of Chapter 15 of Title 19.2 concerning the entry by an accused of a plea of guilty in a capital murder case. There is no conflict, therefore, between Article 4.1 and Rule 3A:13(a), and, hence, pursuant to Rule 3A:18, \u201cthe provisions of . . . Part Three A shall be applicable [to the entry of a plea of guilty in a capital case].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">D. Jury Selection</p>\n<p id=\"AIU\">1. <em>Voir Dire </em>Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">During <em>voir dire, </em>defense counsel requested permission to ask prospective jurors whether they understood \u201cthat should their verdict not be unanimous, then the Court would impose [a] proper sentence.\u201d The trial court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Pruett argues that the proposed question contained an accurate statement of Virginia law concerning the action to be taken when a jury is unable to agree on sentence in a capital case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pruett maintains that the door was opened for the question when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>court permitted the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to ask the prospective jurors whether they understood \u201cthe jury must be unanimous in its verdict that the death penalty is the appropriate sentence in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 266 S.E.2d 87 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 983 (1982), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal of a defense instruction which would have told the jury that \u201cif it could not reach agreement as to the appropriate punishment, the court would dismiss it and impose a life sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 979, 266 S.E.2d at 92. We said that \u201c[w]hile this was a correct statement of law it concerned a procedural matter and was not one which should have been the subject of an instruction\u201d because \u201c[i]t would have been an open invitation for the jury to avoid its responsibility and to disagree.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The same reasoning applies to the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the <em>voir dire </em>question in the present case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And this view is not changed by the fact that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney was permitted to ask the jurors if they knew a death verdict must be unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">2. Challenge for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Pruett contends the trial court abused its discretion in the jury-selection process and \u201cfailed to properly preserve [his] right to an impartial jury at the penalty phase.\u201d Initially, the trial court questioned the jurors as a group and then examined each one separately. Prospective juror Alfred Friedman survived the group questioning and the individual examination by the court and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. When Friedman was questioned individually by defense counsel, however, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">[Defense counsel]: Now, if the evidence showed that this victim was helpless, that the murder was especially brutal, that she suffered before her death, that her hands were tied and her mouth was gagged, do you feel you could still consider giving David Pruett life in the penitentiary knowing what I have just told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Mr. Friedman: Could I consider it? Yes. I could consider it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">[Defense counsel]: Okay, sir. And if you also learned at the sentencing stage that Mr. Pruett had done this before some ten years prior to another helpless victim, do you still feel you could consider giving him life in the penitentiary as opposed to the death penalty? Second murder now. You are sentencing him on the second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">Mr. Friedman: I would have to struggle at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">[Defense counsel]: Okay, sir. Let me take you one further question. Given the fact that evidence has been presented that he\u2019s killed two helpless women, bound, with a knife and that they have both suffered and that he put on no evidence in mitigation of these offenses, could you consider life in the penitentiary as opposed to death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">Mr. Friedman: That\u2019s a tough question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">[Defense counsel]: These are tough cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">Mr. Friedman: Yes. I know that. I could consider life, but I would probably lean toward the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Arguing that Friedman\u2019s answers showed he was \u201cpredisposed towards the death penalty \u00e1nd could not give a fair consideration to life imprisonment,\u201d Pruett moved the trial court to strike Friedman for cause. The trial court denied the motion, and Pruett used a peremptory strike to remove Friedman from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Pruett argues on appeal that Friedman\u2019s answers on <em>voir dire </em>\u201cclearly indicate that his state of mind was not impartial as to the possible punishment for [capital murder].\u201d Citing <em>Justus, </em>Pruett maintains that Friedman exhibited the sort of partiality that \u201cno amount of rehabilitation\u201d could erase. 220 Va. at 977, 266 S.E.2d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">In <em>Justus, </em>however, the prospective juror had formed an opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt so strong that \u201cif no evidence was forthcoming from him, [her] opinion would persist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case, Friedman did not display such an inflexible attitude. In the same breath that he said he \u201cwould probably lean toward the death penalty,\u201d Friedman also said he \u201ccould consider life [imprisonment].\u201d Even after he said he leaned toward the death penalty, Friedman responded to further questioning by defense coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>sel and affirmed that \u201c[i]f [his] conscience dictated it, . . . [he] could hold\u201d to the conviction that \u201clife would be a proper punishment . . . even if all eleven of [his] fellow jurors were voting for the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In deciding whether the trial court erred in refusing to strike Friedman for cause, we do not confine our consideration to the bald statement that he \u201cwould probably lean toward the death penalty.\u201d We consider that the statement was made against the backdrop of the worst possible scenario under circumstances which likely would prompt a similar statement from other prospective jurors. We also consider the statements Friedman made before and after his \u201cleaning toward\u201d answer, statements showing clearly that his views on capital punishment would not \u201cprevent or substantially impair the performance of [his] duties as [a juror] in accordance with instructions of the court and [his] oath.\u201d <em>Clozza </em>v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 124, 128, 321 S.E.2d 273, 276 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1230 (1985) (prospective jurors indicated belief that, death was appropriate punishment for capital murder); <em>see also Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. at 516, 331 S.E.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">II. The Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Pruett\u2019s only complaint about the guilt phase of his trial concerns a comment made by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney during his closing argument to the jury. The prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]he defense conceded [guilt] in their voir dire of you and in their opening statement.\u201d Citing the portion of the comment concerning the concession during <em>voir dire, </em>Pruett moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Pruett argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comment improperly \u201cinsinuated to the jury panel that counsel for the defense had talked with each of them at voir dire about [Pruett] committing these crimes [when in fact] not all prospective jurors were asked questions ... in which [Pruett\u2019s] guilt was indicated.\u201d Defense counsel says he indicated that \u201c[Pruett] may have committed the crimes ... in order to ascertain any possible bias at the penalty stage.\u201d Counsel states, however, that he chose \u201con an individual case-by-case basis\u201d which of the prospective jurors would be asked questions indicating guilt and that the prosecutor\u2019s comment effectively nullified this choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The trial court did not err in denying Pruett\u2019s motion for mistrial. Defense counsel did concede guilt to some of the prospective jurors during individual <em>voir dire </em>examination and, in his opening statement, counsel told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">The defense will not contest any facts presented by the Commonwealth. . . . Defense will not put on any evidence on the issue of guilt or innocence. ... I guess hearing that, at least, you know the direction we are eventually going in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">So you think here\u2019s the man\u2019s attorney telling you that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is correct, and he has no evidence to offer . . . [but he is] the same attorney . . . who ... got a commitment from you [during <em>voir dire] </em>that each and every one of you can give consideration, serious consideration in your deliberations as to two forms of punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In closing argument to the jury, defense counsel noted that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney in his argument \u201creferred several times to the fact that [the defense] had conceded guilt in this matter.\u201d Counsel then said he could not \u201ctake issue with [the prosecutor] on that point.\u201d Counsel also told the jury that his \u201cgoal [was] to save David Pruett\u2019s life\u201d and that he had \u201c \u2018just begun to fight\u2019 ... for about the highest stakes . . . any lawyer could ever fight for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">It is obvious that, in view of the well-nigh-conclusive nature of the evidence of Pruett\u2019s guilt, the defense adopted the tactic of conceding culpability in the early stages of the trial in aid of a later effort in the penalty phase to save Pruett from the electric chair. Defense counsel admits that he conceded guilt to some of the prospective jurors during <em>voir dire </em>and, although he did not use precise language of concession, he effectively conceded guilt to all the actual jurors in his opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">It is difficult to understand, therefore, why Pruett objects to the prosecutor\u2019s comment that he had conceded guilt to all the prospective jurors or how the comment prejudiced him. The comments certainly did not prevent the defense tactic from succeeding, and the fact that the tactic did not succeed does not convert the comment into reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>III. The Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">A. Admission of Prior Unadjudicated Criminal Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In the penalty phase of the trial, the jury received evidence of Pruett\u2019s prior convictions for attempted robbery and embezzlement. The jury also viewed the videotape of the interview conducted on the afternoon of February 14, 1985, during which Pruett confessed not only to the murder of Wilma Harvey but also to the 1975 killing of Debra Mclnnis. In addition, the jury heard, over Pruett\u2019s objection, the testimony of Larry Mclnnis, Debra\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Mclnnis testified that on the evening of May 25, 1975, he went to meet his wife \u201cafter work\u201d at the Kentucky Fried Chicken store where she was employed. Finding the front door locked, he went to the side door and heard \u201csome distressing noises.\u201d He opened the door, entered the store, and found his wife \u201claying in the floor in a pool of blood.\u201d She had \u201cmultiple stab wounds about her throat, along with slash marks on her throat,\u201d and \u201ca large lump on the side of her head.\u201d She was alive, but she died the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Pruett acknowledges that this Court \u201chas consistently allowed evidence of a defendant\u2019s . . . prior unadjudicated criminal conduct ... to come in at the sentencing stage in a capital case in order to prove his future dangerousness as a continuing threat to society.\u201d Pruett contends, however, that by allowing Larry Mclnnis to testify, the trial court permitted the Commonwealth to introduce evidence of the vileness of the 1975 murder of Debra Mclnnis, evidence which was irrelevant to the question whether Pruett represented a continuing threat to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Furthermore, Pruett maintains, the Commonwealth was permitted to play for the jury \u201can extremely lengthy and detailed videotaped confession out of [his] very mouth as to the circumstances of his killing of Debra Mclnnis in 1975.\u201d The testimony of Larry Mclnnis' \u201cserved merely to inflame the jury,\u201d Pruett opines, and, hence, the trial court should have limited the evidence of his prior unadjudicated criminal conduct to his videotaped confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Under Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and -264.4(C), the death penalty may be imposed only if the Commonwealth proves the future dangerousness of the accused or the vileness of the offense for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>which he is on trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Future dangerousness may be established by showing that there is \u201ca probability based upon evidence of the prior history of the defendant or of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense of which he is accused that he would commit <em>criminal acts of violence </em>that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>we defined \u201ccriminal acts of violence\u201d as \u201cserious crimes against the person committed by intentional acts of unprovoked violence.\u201d 219 Va. at 478, 248 S.E.2d at 149. The testimony of Larry Mclnnis concerning the condition in which he found his wife tended to fit her murder precisely within the <em>Smith </em>definition. The same testimony no doubt also tended to establish the vileness of the McInnis murder, and, if offered solely for that purpose, the testimony may have been irrelevant and thus inadmissible. But evidence of a prior act of violence is certainly probative of the probability that the accused would commit other criminal acts of violence. When offered for that purpose, as the testimony of Mclnnis was offered here, the evidence should be considered relevant and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Furthermore, we do not think the trial court was bound to limit the evidence of prior unadjudicated conduct to what was revealed by the videotape. In the first place, Pruett\u2019s confession as it related to the Mclnnis murder was not as detailed as Pruett now maintains. On many matters about which he was questioned, Pruett answered either that he did not know or could not remember. On one vital point concerning the number of times he stabbed Mrs. Mclnnis, Pruett first said he stabbed her numerous times but later reversed himself and said a few times. And even when the interview neared its end, Pruett\u2019s interrogators were still trying to get him to provide details they apparently thought necessary to confirm that it was he who actually murdered Mrs. Mclnnis.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Aside from that, Larry Mclnnis was the first person to observe the victim and the crime scene after the fatal attack. Regardless of the relationship he shared with the victim, he was a competent witness with first-hand knowledge of essential facts. His testimony was not offered \u201cmerely to inflame the jury,\u201d but to supplement and corroborate Pruett\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>We have approved the admission of similar evidence of prior unadjudicated criminal conduct in the penalty phase in a number of death penalty cases, including our recent decisions in <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. at 418, 329 S.E.2d at 827-28, <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. at 488, 331 S.E.2d at 436, and <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 393, 345 S.E.2d 267, 283 (1986). While the factual situations involved here and in our earlier decisions may vary somewhat from case to case, the basis for the legal principle remains the same: evidence of prior criminal acts of violence, whether adjudicated or not, is relevant to a determination of future dangerousness. Accordingly, we adhere to our earlier rulings and hold that the trial court did not err in admitting the testimony of Larry McInnis.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">B. Propriety of Death Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"AlF\">1. Passion and Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1) requires this Court in every capital case to determine whether the death sentence was \u201cimposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d Pruett argues that the trial court erred in upholding the death penalty in this case because it was the product of passion and prejudice. The record, however, is free from any indication that the jury was motivated by untoward influences in deciding to fix Pruett\u2019s punishment at death. So we reject Pruett\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"AAy\">2. Excessiveness and Disproportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2) requires this Court to decide whether the death sentence is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Pruett argues that his death sentence is excessive and disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Pruett\u2019s argument necessitates a comparison of his case with other capital cases. For this purpose, pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), we have accumulated \u201cthe records of all capital felony cases . . . as a guide in determining whether the sentence imposed in the case under review is excessive.\u201d In making the required comparison, then, we turn to a consideration of \u201cboth the crime and the defendant\u201d involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>a. The Crime</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Taking advantage of his friendship with the Harveys, knowing that Richard Harvey was out of town, and acting on the pretext that he wanted \u201c[t]o see how [Wilma] was doing,\u201d Pruett visited the Harvey home on February 12, 1985, and engaged Wilma in conversation. He formed the intent to rob her when a paper boy called to collect and Pruett saw Wilma take money from a cash box. Later, when Wilma said she had \u201cto get ready to go . . .to her church,\u201d Pruett asked permission to use the bathroom. While in the bathroom, he decided he \u201cwanted some sex\u201d and told himself, \u201cwell, go do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Pruett emerged from the bathroom and told Wilma he wanted \u201csome sex.\u201d She refused, and he \u201chad to force her\u201d by brandishing a knife he had brought with him. After the rape, he \u201ctied her up\u201d hand and foot, gagged her with a sock, and stabbed her repeatedly. When she tried to kick him, he \u201ccut her whole throat open.\u201d He thought \u201cthe knife went all the way through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Pruett then \u201clooked through all the drawers.\u201d He took money from the drawers as well as the cash box out of which Wilma paid the paperboy.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">An autopsy was performed on Wilma\u2019s body, and the medical examiner testified at the sentencing hearing. He stated that Wilma suffered \u201cseven stab wounds located on the neck, and twelve stab wounds located on her chest and one to her abdomen.\u201d She had \u201cslash wounds ... on the neck,\u201d one superficial and the other \u201cvery deep.\u201d There were \u201cthree [cut] wounds on her left hand\u201d and \u201cstab wounds . . . that . . . passed through and through \u2014 one on the left thigh and one on her left leg.\u201d There was a \u201csmall superficial stab over her left kneecap\u201d and \u201ca superficial cut over her left great toe.\u201d In all, the medical examiner counted 29 wounds to Mrs. Harvey\u2019s body. In addition, he found \u201cbruising from blunt force injury to the back of her right thigh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The medical examiner expressed the opinion that any one of several wounds would have been fatal by itself and that others would have been fatal \u201cin combination.\u201d He also said that the gag in Mrs. Harvey\u2019s mouth was tied in such a way it alone would have caused death by asphyxia \u201cover a period of time.\u201d Further, Wilma\u2019s arms were tied so tight with a nylon stocking that ligature marks remained when the stocking was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The medical examiner testified further that Mrs. Harvey suffered \u201cdefensive wounds\u201d to her left arm and leg, meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>wounds \u201cproduced on the extremities ... as the victim attempts to ward off the blows of the weapon.\u201d Finally, the doctor stated that all the wounds were inflicted prior to death, while Wilma was \u201cin a lying-down position,\u201d and \u201cafter her hands were tied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2, the crime of capital murder is subject to the death penalty if it is \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involve [s] torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d This is the \u201cvileness\u201d factor referred to in our death penalty opinions. The foregoing description of Pruett\u2019s crime depicts the torture inflicted upon the victim, the aggravated battery committed against her, and the depravity of mind of her assailant, all attesting the utter vileness of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">b. The Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">As noted in Part III (A), <em>supra, </em>a person who commits capital murder is subject to the death penalty if it is proved that there is \u201ca probability based upon evidence of the prior history of the defendant or of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense of which he is accused that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C). This is the \u201cdangerousness\u201d factor, as we have called it in our opinions. -</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">We have recited in other parts of this opinion the history of Pruett\u2019s previous criminal convictions, the evidence of his prior unadjudicated criminal conduct in the killing of Debra Mclnnis, and the circumstances surrounding his rape, robbery, and murder of Wilma Harvey. This recitation establishes the strong probability that Pruett would commit other criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society, thus attesting his extreme dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">3. The Comparison</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">In determining whether a sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate, we inquire if \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 260, 284, 257 S.E.2d 808, 824 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980); <em>see also Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. at 523, 331 S.E.2d at 422. Considering both the crime and the defendant involved in this case, we can say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>without qualification that Pruett\u2019s offense is the sort for which juries in Virginia generally have approved the death penalty. Indeed, Pruett\u2019s case ranks among the worst we have considered since Virginia\u2019s present death penalty statutes became effective in 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Before concluding, we note a request by Pruett that we commute his sentence of death to life imprisonment. Although Code \u00a7 17-110.1(D) authorizes such action, we are unable to find any reason to commute Pruett\u2019s sentence or otherwise to disturb the judgment of the trial court. Accordingly, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> VanderHeiden testified he had information indicating that Pruett\u2019s car was parked in front of the Harvey residence as late as 8:00 p.m. on February 12.
