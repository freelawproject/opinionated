Assuming, as the trial court concluded, that the rule in <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Firmstone, </em>134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922), applies to a plaintiffs answers to interrogatories, we must decide whether the answers of the plaintiff in this case fall within the compass of that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">On March 27, 1978, Nancy Austin filed a motion for judgment against Martin R. Jewell and Roy E. Flick, claiming damages for personal injuries she sustained in an automobile accident which occurred on July 29, 1977. Austin\u2019s car was struck in the rear while she was stopped behind traffic in the northbound lane of Sudley Road in Manassas. She alleged that Jewell was operating a pickup truck immediately behind her; that Flick was driving an automobile directly behind Jewell; that it was \u201cthe duty of each of the Defendants ... to operate their respective cars in a careful and prudent manner\u201d; that Jewell and Flick \u201cso operated their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>vehicles so as to cause the front end of the Jewell vehicle to strike the rear end of the Plaintiffs vehicle with great force and violence\u201d; and that the plaintiff suffered permanent injuries as the \u201cproximate result of the reckless and negligent conduct of the Defendants\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">During discovery, Jewell served Austin with a set of 56 interrogatories. The questions and answers relevant to this appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">3. State in full detail the manner in which you assert that the incident of which you complain occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">I was heading in a northerly direction on Sudley Road. I was stopped approximately 400 feet north of Jackson Avenue, waiting for the traffic to move on. Martin R. Jewell was stopped directly behind me. Roy E. Flick, who was also travelling in a northerly direction on Sudley Road, did not see the brakelights of Mr. Jewell\u2019s vehicle. Mr. Flick\u2019s vehicle collided with the rear of Mr. Jewell\u2019s vehicle forcing Mr. Jewell\u2019s vehicle into the rear of my vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">46. Did you make a statement to anyone at the scene of the accident with regard to the collision? If so, state the name of such person and the substance of your statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">Yes. The Prince William County Police Officer asked me how the accident had happened. I told him that I was sitting still and the truck and car hit me from behind, was all I knew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">For a period of more than two years, Austin was unable to serve process on Flick, and on August 11, 1980, the trial court granted Austin\u2019s motion to nonsuit her action with respect to him. Austin later filed a new suit against Flick, but the action was dismissed on a plea of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">In April 1982, Austin\u2019s counsel advised Jewell\u2019s attorney that his client\u2019s response to interrogatory number 3 needed to be amended. By letter dated April 8, 1982, addressed to Jewell\u2019s attorney, Austin\u2019s attorney amended his client\u2019s answer to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">I was heading in a northerly direction on Sudley Road. I was stopped approximately 400 feet north of Jackson Avenue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>waiting for traffic to move on. Martin R. Jewell, who was travelling directly behind me failed to stop and struck the rear of my vehicle with his vehicle. Immediately thereafter, a vehicle operated by Roy E. Flick was also travelling in a northerly direction on Sudley Road collided with the rear of Mr. Jewell\u2019s vehicle forcing Mr. Jewell\u2019s vehicle into the rear of my vehicle causing a second impact to my vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In a deposition taken on April 19, 1982 and admitted to the record, Austin testified that \u201cit was just like two impacts because another car hit the back of the truck after the truck hit me. And then it was hit like twice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">On May 13, 1982, Jewell filed a third-party motion for judgment against Flick, and the matter was set for trial on March 10, 1983. Before the jury had been seated, Jewell made a motion for summary judgment. Invoking the rule in <em>Massie </em>that \u201c[n]o litigant can successfully ask a court or jury to believe that he has not told the truth\u201d, 134 Va. at 462, 114 S.E. at 656, Jewell argued that Austin\u2019s original answer to interrogatory number 3 absolved Jewell of any actionable negligence and that she was bound by that sworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Austin\u2019s trial counsel argued that the original answer did not accurately reflect Austin\u2019s response to interrogatory number 3; that, in fact, Austin had always maintained there were two impacts; that it was simply \u201cattorney error\u201d that caused an incomplete answer to be transcribed and forwarded to Jewell\u2019s counsel; that the amended answer had been given in order to rectify the error; and that Jewell\u2019s counsel had agreed that \u201cit was all right\u201d to amend Austin\u2019s answer by filing the letter of April 8, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">After considering the arguments of counsel and reviewing our decision in <em>Massie, </em>the trial court agreed with Jewell that the <em>Massie </em>rule applied and, thus, that Austin was bound by her original answer. The court then granted Jewell\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissed Jewell\u2019s third-party claim against Flick, and entered final judgment against Austin.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">On appeal, Austin argues that the <em>Massie </em>rule does not apply in this case because she \u201cwas not attempting to disown her own statements\u201d and adopt the more favorable testimony of others; that <em>Massie </em>does not prevent a litigant from explaining or clarifying a previous statement; and that if she had been permitted to put on evidence, she would have explained the reason for the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>parent inconsistency between her original and her amended answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Jewell maintains that Austin\u2019s original answer was a statement of facts \u201cwithin her own knowledge\u201d; that her answer was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d; that Austin is now \u201casking this Court to permit her . . . to change [her] position after her suit against Flick was held to be time-barred\u201d; and that Austin is bound by <em>Massie </em>to her original answer to interrogatory number 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We assume, without deciding, that the <em>Massie </em>rule applies to a litigant\u2019s answers to interrogatories; nevertheless, we agree with Austin that the rule does not apply in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The <em>Massie </em>doctrine is not to be read as a rule of thumb, categorical, absolute, and universally applicable. By definition, it applies only to \u201cstatements of fact\u201d made by the litigant, to statements of facts \u201cwithin his own knowledge\u201d, and to \u201cthe necessary inferences therefrom\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">[T]he rule in <em>Massie </em>[does not] apply to an adverse statement standing in isolation from the litigant\u2019s testimony as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\"><em>Baines </em>v. <em>Parker and Gladding, </em>217 Va. 100, 104, 105, 225 S.E.2d 403, 406-07 (1976). Rather, \u201c[a] damaging statement made in one part of his testimony must be considered in the light of an explanation of such statement made in a later part of his testimony. . . . And it is generally for the jury to determine whether it will accept such explanation or clarification.\u201d <em>VEPCO </em>v. <em>Mabin, </em>203 Va. 490, 494, 125 S.E.2d 145, 148 (1962). <em>See also Olsten </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>230 Va. 317, 336 S.E.2d 893 (1985); <em>Seven-Up Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Moseley, </em>230 Va. 245, 335 S.E.2d 272 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>We cannot say as a matter of law that the import of Austin\u2019s statements, \u201cconsidered as a whole, conclusively absolves [Jewell] of actionable negligence\u201d. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Carter &amp; Grinstead, </em>226 Va. 361, 370, 310 S.E.2d 666, 671 (1983). Although Austin\u2019s original answer to interrogatory number 3 indicates there was only one impact, her answer to interrogatory number 46, stating that both \u201cthe truck and car hit me from behind\u201d, bespeaks two impacts. Moreover, Austin\u2019s amended answer to interrogatory number 3, which Jewell conceded in oral argument had been properly filed, states that Austin recalled feeling two impacts, first when Jewell\u2019s truck collided with her car, and again when Flick\u2019s car struck Jewell\u2019s truck and forced it into the rear of Austin\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Austin was not attempting to disown her own statements and adopt the testimony of others more favorable to her position. Rather, she was requesting an opportunity to testify, relying upon her own statements, considered as a whole. If her request had been granted, Jewell would have been free to use her pre-trial statements for purposes of impeachment, and the jury would have been free to reject her testimony at trial. But we are of opinion the jury should have been permitted to consider her testimony and her explanation of any appearance of inconsistency raised on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against the plaintiff, and we will reverse the judgment and remand the case for a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\"> Parenthetically, Jewell suggests that the <em>Massie </em>issue \u201cshould not be considered\u201d because, he says, it goes \u201csubstantially beyond the Assignment of Error.\u201d We do not agree. We review the case as it was tried below and presented on appeal. In support of his motion for summary judgment, Jewell relied exclusively on the rule in Massie, the trial court rested its decision sustaining the motion on that rule, Austin assigned error to that ruling, and, on appeal, both parties briefed and argued the question whether <em>Massie </em>applies to answers to interrogatories and, if so, whether Austin\u2019s answers fall within or outside the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\"> See <em>Worrell </em>v. Worrell, 174 Va. 11, 4 S.E.2d 343 (1939), where, without deciding whether the <em>Massie </em>rule applied to the plaintiffs pre-trial written statements, we affirmed the judgment for the plaintiff on the ground that the statements did not fall within the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
