Pickus to practice law. The suspension was based upon a finding that Pickus had violated several provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility in his handling of three real estate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">Licensed in October 1977, Pickus worked for other attorneys off and on until June 1978. At that time, he established a practice on his own in Richmond with \u201cvery little\u201d experience in handling real estate matters. In December 1978, he met Robert O. Davis, Jr., who was engaged in buying and selling real estate. Davis employed Pickus to \u201chandle all [his] business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">The three transactions in question were the first Pickus handled for Davis. In two of the cases, occurring in March and June 1979, Capital Savings and Loan Association agreed to lend Davis money for the refinancing of existing deeds of trust totaling $107,108.40 on two pieces of property in Richmond. Pickus acted as closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>attorney in both cases. Capital Savings instructed Pickus to satisfy the prior deeds of trust and to obtain mortgagee title insurance policies insuring that the new loans constituted first liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Pickus obtained commitments for title insurance, and Capital Savings issued him checks totaling $143,323.53, covering the proceeds of the two loans. Pickus endorsed the checks and turned them over to Davis upon the latter\u2019s representation that he would satisfy the prior liens and obtain their release. Davis failed to satisfy the liens, and, without checking the land records, Pickus certified to the title insurance company that the prior liens had been satisfied and that the loans of Capital Savings were secured by first deeds of trust. The insurance company issued policies insuring the loans as first liens. Ultimately, Capital Savings made claim against the insurance company, and the claim was settled for $29,195.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">In the third transaction, occurring in April 1979, Virginia First Savings and Loan Association agreed to lend Davis money to refinance an existing $100,000 deed of trust on his own home. Pickus acted as settlement attorney in this transaction. Virginia First Savings instructed Pickus to satisfy the prior trust and to obtain a mortgagee title insurance policy insuring that the new loan would constitute a first lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Pickus obtained a commitment for title insurance, and Virginia First Savings issued him a loan proceeds check in the amount of $140,000. Pickus endorsed this check and delivered it to Davis after the latter became \u201cvery coercive\u201d and insisted he would \u201ctake care\u201d of satisfying the prior deed of trust himself. Davis did not satisfy the prior trust, and Pickus did not apply for or obtain a title insurance policy. Pickus did prepare and deliver to Virginia First Savings a settlement statement indicating that the prior trust had been satisfied, but he did not check the land records to determine whether the prior lien had been released.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Pickus received no part of the loan proceeds involved in the three transactions. He testified before the Board that he paid the money over to Davis because he trusted him \u201cimplicitly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Davis also testified before the Board. At the time he testified, he was an inmate at Powhatan Correctional Center, and he previously had served a sentence at Allenwood Federal Prison Camp in Pennsylvania. Davis testified that he persuaded Pickus to turn the loan proceeds checks over to him because his bank would give him immediate credit while Pickus\u2019 bank would wait for the checks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>clear. Davis stated that Pickus did not know he, Davis, had not satisfied the prior liens and that Pickus was \u201cvery surprised\u201d when \u201cthese transactions came to light\u201d in 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">A former Assistant United States Attorney who had participated in the investigation of charges against Davis also testified before the Board. He described Davis as \u201ca professional con man\u201d involved in \u201cbank fraud in connection with real estate transactions.\u201d The witness said Davis was \u201c[v]ery good at [defrauding banks].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">In suspending Pickus\u2019 license, the Board found that he had violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(1), (4), and (6), 6-101(A)(1), (2), and (3), and 9-102(A) and (B) of the Code of Professional Responsibility. This Code was revised in 1983, after the time the transactions in question occurred. Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia, Va. Code 1984 Added Volume 11, at 219. In the discussion which follows, we will refer to the pre-1983 version of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\n<em>The Alleged Violation of DR 1-102(A)(1), (4), and (6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">These Disciplinary Rules provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-8\">\n<em>DR 1-102 Misconduct.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-9\">(A) A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-10\">(1) Violate a Disciplinary Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-11\">(4) Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-12\">(6) Engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">216 Va. 1064, 1065-66 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">Pickus argues that DR 1-102(A)(1) and (6) have no \u201cindependent significance in this case\u201d and that the question whether he violated DR 1-102 in any respect \u201chinges upon the sufficiency of the Bar\u2019s evidence regarding Pickus\u2019 alleged violation of D.R. 1-102(A)(4), pertaining to \u2018dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\u2019 \u201d Pickus argues further that in establishing a violation of DR 1-102(A)(4), a showing of scienter is required; the language of the Rule imports \u201cfraudulent or deceitful activity, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>proof of which rests upon a showing of intentional conduct or at least knowing acquiescence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Yet, Pickus says, the proceeding before the Board \u201cis void of any evidence that [he] made any deliberate or knowing misrepresentations, or that he had any specific intent to defraud, or that he deliberately misrepresented a state of facts.\u201d Indeed, Pickus says, the Board made \u201cfindings of fact to the contrary, indicating that [he] acted upon the representations of . . . Davis ... in certifying to the title insurance company that prior deeds of trust had been satisfied.\u201d The evidence as a whole, Pickus concludes, was \u201coverwhelming that [he] never knowingly or intentionally made a misrepresentation,\u201d and, hence, \u201cthe Board\u2019s finding that D.R. 1-102 was violated must be vacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">We will assume, without deciding, that scienter is an essential element in the establishment of a case of misrepresentation under DR 1-102(A)(4). <em>See Gibbs </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>232 Va. 5, 348 S.E.2d 202 (1986) (this day decided). It does not follow, however, that we must reverse the Board\u2019s finding that Pickus violated DR 1-102(A)(4). We think that the element of scienter was established by the clear proof required in disciplinary proceedings. <em>Seventh District Committee </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>212 Va. 278, 284, 183 S.E.2d 713, 717 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Pickus certified to the title insurance company that the prior liens involved in the two Capital Savings transactions had been satisfied and released of record. The act of making this certification was certainly knowing and intentional. Necessarily implicit in Pickus\u2019 certification was the representation that <em>he, </em>or someone for whom he was responsible, had satisfied the prior liens and ascertained from the land records that those liens had been released. Pickus performed the same sort of knowing and intentional act and made the same type of representation when he showed on a settlement statement that the prior deed of trust involved in the Virginia First Savings transaction had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">These representations, however, were not true, and Pickus knew they were not true. Neither he nor anyone for whom he was responsible had satisfied any of the prior liens or ascertained whether the liens had been released of record, and he, of course, knew that neither he nor anyone for whom he was responsible had performed any of these necessary acts. We conclude, therefore, that the Board did not err in finding Pickus had violated DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>In reaching this conclusion, we have not overlooked Pickus\u2019 argument that the Board found he had acted upon the representations of Davis in certifying to the title company that the prior liens had been satisfied. We believe, however, it is immaterial that Pickus may have acted upon Davis\u2019 representations. In receiving and handling the funds entrusted to him by the lending institutions, Pickus occupied a fiduciary relationship vis-a-vis those institutions, with a transcendent duty to disburse the funds as they directed, rather than as Davis wished. It avails Pickus nothing, therefore, to protest that he acted upon Davis\u2019 representations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Remaining in this aspect of the case is the question whether Pickus violated DR 1-102(A)(1), which prohibits the \u201c[violation of] a Disciplinary Rule,\u201d and DR 1-102(A)(6), which proscribes \u201cany other conduct that adversely reflects on [a lawyer\u2019s] fitness to practice law.\u201d Because Pickus violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and, as we hold infra, other Disciplinary Rules as well, it follows that he also violated DR 1-102(A)(1) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\n<em>The Alleged Violation of DR 6-101 (A)(1), (2), and(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">These Disciplinary Rules provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\n<em>DR 6-101 Failing to Act Competently.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">(A) A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">(1) Handle a legal matter which he knows or should know that he is not competent to handle, without associating with him a lawyer who is competent to handle it.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">(2) Handle a legal matter without preparation adequate in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">(3) Neglect a legal matter entrusted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">216 Va. at 1106, amended at 218 Va. 192 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Pickus argues that the Disciplinary Rules and the Ethical Considerations provide little guidance in determining what constitutes incompetence, inadequate preparation, and neglect within the meaning of DR 6-101(A)(l), (2), and (3). With reference to the question of incompetence, Pickus points out that EC 6-1 states a lawyer shall \u201caccept employment only in matters which he is or intends to become competent to handle\u201d and that EC 6-3 states an attorney may \u201caccept . . . employment if in good faith he expects to become qualified through study and investigation, as long as such preparation would not result in unreasonable delay or expense to [the] client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Concerning inadequate preparation and neglect, Pickus submits that the \u201cprevailing standard\u201d was enunciated in ABA Comm, on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Informal Op. 1273 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">Neglect involves indifference and a consistent failure to carry out the obligations which the lawyer has assumed to his client or a conscious disregard for the responsibility owed to the client. The concept of ordinary negligence is different. Neglect usually involves more than a single act or omission. Neglect cannot be found if the acts or omissions complained of were inadvertent or the result of an error of judgment made in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Pickus then argues that he had every reason to believe he would be competent to handle the transactions in question or, if he doubted his own ability, he had \u201ca basis for a good faith belief that he would become competent to handle them.\u201d Under the good faith provision of EC 6-3, Pickus says, he \u201ccould not have known that he was not competent to handle the transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_q\">Pickus also argues there was no evidence that he was inadequately prepared or that he gave inadequate attention to the transactions. To the contrary, Pickus states, \u201cthis is a situation in which [his] acts were \u2018inadvertent [and] the result of an error of judgment made in good faith.\u2019 \u201d Further, concerning neglect, Pickus maintains \u201cthere was no harm to the client (Davis) because of Pickus\u2019 conduct; Davis actually received adequate services within a short time frame and without undue expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">We do not agree with Pickus. We think the record of this case provides clear proof that he was not competent or prepared to handle the transactions in question and that he knew he was inad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>equate in these respects. We also think the record amply establishes Pickus\u2019 neglect of legal matters entrusted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The previous recitation in this opinion of the way Pickus handled the transactions in question should be proof enough, by itself, of Pickus\u2019 lack of competence and preparation. But there is more.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">It is true that Pickus was inexperienced; these were his first real estate closings, except for one in which he \u201cassisted.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We would have thought, however, that even an inexperienced attorney would know not to release escrowed funds to a client before the conditions of escrow are satisfied. Yet, Pickus admitted in his testimony he \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d it was his \u201cresponsibility\u201d to make sure the lending institutions whose loans he closed were placed \u201cin first position,\u201d and he acknowledged he turned the loan proceeds over to Davis \u201cout of naivety\u201d because he \u201cdid not know any better at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Pickus obviously recognized his own inadequacies. He found it necessary to seek the advice of his own client and the latter\u2019s secretary on how to handle the transactions. Pickus admitted that Davis \u201cknew much more\u201d about real estate transactions than Pickus, \u201calthough [Pickus was] the lawyer.\u201d Pickus also sought the assistance of a loan officer of one of the lending institutions because he, Pickus, \u201cdidn\u2019t have the experience and [the loan officer] knew it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Unfortunately, Pickus did not learn from experience; he handled the last of the transactions as poorly as the first. Even more unfortunate was Pickus\u2019 failure to associate an experienced attorney to assist him in handling the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Concerning the question of neglect, Pickus argues that since \u201cthere was no harm to the client (Davis) because of Pickus\u2019 conduct,\u201d no violation of DR 6-101 (A)(3) occurred. Pickus apparently reads DR 6-101 (A)(3) to apply only to matters entrusted to a lawyer by a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">The language of DR 6-101(A)(3), however, encompasses neglect of legal matters entrusted to a lawyer, whether entrusted by a client or a third party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, the lending institutions en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>trusted legal matters to Pickus, within the meaning of DR 6-101(A)(3), when they delivered the loan proceeds to him with directions to satisfy prior liens and to obtain mortgagee title insurance policies insuring that the new loans constituted first liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">With DR 6-101 (A)(3) made applicable to the transactions in question, there hardly seems any basis for argument that Pickus did not neglect the matters entrusted to him by the lending institutions. He not only failed to satisfy the prior liens in all three cases but also failed in one instance to obtain title insurance. Neglect, according to ABA Informal Op. 1273, <em>supra, </em>\u201cinvolves indifference and a consistent failure to carry out the obligations which the lawyer has assumed to his client or a conscious disregard for the responsibility owed to the client.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think this definition describes Pickus\u2019 actions with complete accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\n<em>The Alleged Violation of DR 9-102(A) and (B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">These Disciplinary Rules provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\n<em>DR 9-102 Preserving Identity of Funds and Property of a Client.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">(A) All funds of clients paid to a lawyer or law firm, other than advances for costs and expenses, shall be deposited in one or more identifiable bank accounts maintained in the state in which the law office is situated and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm shall be deposited therein except as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">(1) Funds reasonably sufficient to pay bank charges may be deposited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">(2) Funds belonging in part to a client and in part presently or potentially to the lawyer or law firm must be deposited therein, but the portion belonging to the lawyer or law firm may be withdrawn when due unless the right of the lawyer or law firm to receive it is disputed by the client, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>which event the disputed portion shall not be withdrawn until the dispute is finally resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">(B) A lawyer shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">(1) Promptly notify a client of the receipt of his funds, securities, or other properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">(2) Identify and label securities and properties of a client promptly upon receipt and place them in a safe deposit box or other place of safekeeping as soon as practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">(3) Maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the lawyer and render appropriate accounts to his client regarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">(4) Promptly pay or deliver to the client as requested by a client the funds, securities, or other properties in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">216 Va. at 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Pickus argues that the purpose of DR 9-102 is \u201cboth to protect the client and to avoid any appearance of impropriety by an attorney in regard to the client\u2019s funds.\u201d The focus, Pickus says, is \u201con the Attorney-Client relationship,\u201d and, thus, DR 9-102 is not \u201ca proper mechanism by which to address complaints that third parties may have against Pickus since that Rule was not promulgated for the protection of third parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">We disagree with Pickus. We think DR 9-102 was promulgated to protect third parties as well as clients. Indeed, the Comment to DR 9-102, appearing in ABA, <em>Annotated Code of Professional Responsibility </em>441 (1979), states that \u201cDR 9-102 sets forth rules to govern the attorney\u2019s handling of moneys and other properties on behalf of clients or <em>third </em>parties.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">We do not rest our decision on this ground alone, however. In our opinion, the lending institutions involved in this case were more than third parties in their relationship with Pickus. The institutions were not represented by their own attorneys, so Pickus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>acted alone in closing the loans in question. When a lawyer acts as a closing or settlement attorney and no other lawyer is involved, the closing or settlement attorney represents all the parties and, in this limited sense, all the parties are his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In such a situation, the settlement attorney assumes the duties of a fiduciary and must properly handle and dispose of any funds not his own which he may receive in connection with the settlement. And we think DR 9-102(A) and (B) set forth the rules governing the proper handling and disposition of such funds. Hence, we believe the Board correctly found that Pickus had violated DR 9-102(A) and (B).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\n<em>Propriety of Suspension</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Pickus argues that the suspension of his license to practice law was not justified by the evidence before the Board. He has already paid \u201chandsomely\u201d for his \u201cmistake,\u201d Pickus says, and he has instituted procedures in his office to insure that deeds of trust will \u201calways be satisfied upon receipt of loan proceeds.\u201d The suspension of his license under these circumstances, Pickus asserts, was \u201ca clear abuse of the Board\u2019s power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The determination of a proper sanction was a matter within the discretion of the Board. <em>Gibbs, </em>232 Va. at 42, 348 S.E.2d at 211; <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Seventh District </em>Committee, 220 Va. 1056, 1062, 265 S.E.2d 753, 757 (1980). The sanction imposed was within permissible limits, and nothing in the record suggests the Board abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">We will affirm the Board\u2019s order suspending Pickus\u2019 license to practice law in this Commonwealth for a period of one year, with the suspension to commence November 1, 1986. Pickus shall give notice, by certified mail, of his suspension to all clients for whom he is currently handling matters and to all opposing attorneys and presiding judges in pending litigation. Pickus shall further make immediate appropriate arrangements for the disposition of those matters presently in his care in conformity with the wishes of his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-13\"> Because it is immaterial that Pickus may have acted upon Davis\u2019 representations, we reject Pickus\u2019 argument that a member of the Board improperly failed to recuse himself. Pickus asked for the recusal because the Board member had previously represented Davis in a real estate transaction. Pickus\u2019 attorney told the Board that the challenged member\u2019s prior experience might place him in the position to say, \u201cwell, I wasn\u2019t deceived by Mr. Davis, [so] 1 don\u2019t understand why Mr. Pickus was deceived by Mr. Davis.\u201d The real issue was not whether Davis deceived Pickus but whether Pickus deceived the lending institutions or the title insurance company, and the Board member\u2019s prior experience did not preclude him from participating in the consideration of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b30-10\"> Both Pickus and Davis mentioned in their testimony another transaction, one Pickus handled for Davis\u2019 mother. We do not know, however, whether the transaction involved the satisfaction and release of prior liens. Davis described the transaction as one \u201cregarding an estate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b30-11\"> As we hold <em>infra, </em>the lending institutions were also clients of Pickus in the sense that he represented all the parties to the loan closings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b31-12\"><em> </em>Because neglect may consist of a <em>conscious </em>disregard of responsibility, we reject Pickus\u2019 argument that it would be inconsistent to find he violated both DR 1-102 and DR 6-101 since, he says, \u201ca violation of D.R. 1-102 properly is based upon a finding of <em>knowledge </em>(i.e., deliberate or intentional fraudulent action) and a violation of D.R. 6-101 rests upon a determination of <em>ignorance </em>(i.e., incompetence or neglect).\u201d While neglect may result from ignorance, it may also be the product of deliberate or intentional action, <em>i.e., conscious </em>action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b32-13\"> Citing <em>In re Rabb, 73 </em>N.J. 272, 374 A.2d 461 (1977), Pickus says the reference to third parties in the ABA Comment \u201crelates to situations in which the lawyer has acquired funds for the client \u2018to pay over to others on the client\u2019s behalf.\u2019 \u201d This does not mean that the reference may not also relate to other situations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b33-11\"> Pickus does not argue that the way he handled the funds in question conformed to the requirements of DR 9-102(A) and (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
