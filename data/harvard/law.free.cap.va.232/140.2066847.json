It provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">I direct my Executrix to divide [my estate] into as many equal shares as there shall be children, me surviving, plus the number of my children predeceasing me but leaving issue me surviving, and I give, devise and bequeath one of such shares to each of my children me surviving and one share to the issue of each deceased child of mine, such issue to take, collectively, per stirpes, the share of their deceased ancestor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">The testatrix died on April 2, 1982, survived by four children, Elizabeth H. Hyman, William Everett Hannan, Jr., Kenneth Heron Hannan, and Isabella Hannan Pfeil (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cHyman\u201d). Her fifth child, James M. Han-nan, had died of cancer in May 1977. Under a decree entered in January 1977 by the Probate Court of Cumberland County, Maine, James had adopted Mary Elizabeth Glover, his wife\u2019s 35-year-old daughter by a former marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">Mrs. Glover filed a petition asking the court below to declare that \u201cpetitioner is the issue of decedent\u2019s son James Hannan, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>as such is entitled to a prescribed share\u201d of his mother\u2019s estate. Upon consideration of the pleadings, memoranda of law, and argument by counsel, the trial court ruled that, under Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1, \u201c[t]he word \u2018issue,\u2019 standing alone, now includes persons who qualify by or through adoption.\u201d Accordingly, the court granted Mrs. Glover\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment awarding her a one-fifth share of the testatrix\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On appeal, Hyman contends that the trial court erred in its construction of the statute. We agree. Therefore, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The trial court based its ruling upon Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 which reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">In the interpretation of wills and trusts, adopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gift terminology and terms of relationship in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession unless a contrary intent shall appear on the face of the will or trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession, referred to in Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1, are set forth in Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1. That statute provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">If, for purposes of Title 64.1, a relationship of parent and child must be established to determine succession by, through or from a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">1. An adopted person is the child of an adopting parent and not of the biological parents. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The trial court was persuaded that Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1 places adopted children on the same footing as natural children. In addition, the trial court was persuaded that since the word \u201cissue\u201d defines a class, then, by operation of Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1, adopted children were automatically placed in that class regardless of the common law meaning of the word \u201cissue.\u201d In our view, a different result is dictated by settled principles governing the construction of wills as well as by principles governing the construction of statutes that are in derogation of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Our analysis begins with an examination of the common law meaning of the word \u201cissue.\u201d Since the infancy of the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>system in this Commonwealth the word \u201cissue\u201d has meant \u201cheirs of the body\u201d and has been distinguished from seemingly similar words such as \u201cchildren.\u201d <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>11 Va. (1 Hen. &amp; M.) 240, 290 (1807). At least since 1935 this Court has stated explicitly that the word \u201cissue\u201d does not include adopted children. In <em>Munday </em>v. <em>Munday\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>164 Va. 145, 148-50, 178 S.E. 917, 918-19 (1935), we wrote as follows on that precise question: <em>\u201cIssue </em>is ordinarily defined as descendants of a common ancestor. ... To bring an adopted child within the accepted definition of the word \u2018issue\u2019 would certainly place upon the term a very strained construction. . . . Our conclusion is that under our statute \u2018issue\u2019 means natural descendants of a common ancestor.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Over the years we have reiterated what was said in <em>Munday. See Vicars </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>227 Va. 432, 437, 318 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1984); <em>Langhorne </em>v. <em>Langhorne, </em>212 Va. 577, 578, 186 S.E.2d 50, 51, <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 946 (1972); <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Flanary, </em>185 Va. 409, 415, 38 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1946). As a matter of common law then, it is plain that in Virginia the word \u201cissue\u201d does not include adopted children.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Given the common law meaning of the word \u201cissue,\u201d any statute enacted to change that meaning would necessarily be in derogation of the common law. Two important rules of construction come into play where a statute is in derogation of the common law. First, \u201c[t]he common law is not to be considered as altered or changed by statute unless the legislative intent be plainly manifested.\u201d <em>Hannabass </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>164 Va. 519, 525, 180 S.E. 416, 418 (1935). Second, \u201c[statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed and not to be enlarged in their operation by construction beyond their express terms.\u201d C. <em>&amp; O. Railway </em>v. <em>Kinzer, </em>206 Va. 175, 181, 142 S.E.2d 514, 518 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Further, since this case involves the construction of a will, at least one other important rule of construction applies. We stated the rule in <em>Driskill </em>v. <em>Carwile, </em>145 Va. 116, 120, 133 S.E. 773, 774 (1926), where we wrote that \u201cwords having a definite legal significance are to be understood as used in their definite legal sense. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Absent the statute relied upon by Glover, the rule set forth in <em>Driskill </em>would make this an \u201copen and shut\u201d case. We would give \u201cissue\u201d its definite legal meaning and simply conclude that \u201cissue\u201d does not include adopted children and, therefore, Glover cannot take under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>However, because the statute is in effect we must determine its impact upon the construction of the will. At the threshold of the statutory analysis, it is significant to us that the statute does not state specifically that the word \u201cissue,\u201d when used in a will or trust, includes adopted children. Thus, it could be argued that the statute, on its face, does not make it \u201cplainly manifest\u201d that the General Assembly intended the change in the common law that is urged by Glover. This point is made even more persuasive when one considers that other states have made precisely such a change in their law. For example, in 1947, Maryland enacted the following provision: \u201cThe term \u2018child,\u2019 \u2018heir,\u2019 \u2018issue,\u2019 \u2018descendant\u2019 or an equivalent in a deed, grant, will or other written instrument shall be held to include any adopted person, unless the contrary plainly appears by the terms thereof. . . .\u201d Maryland Code \u00a7 16-78(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Moreover, the terms of the applicable statute itself do not lead to the conclusion advanced by Glover. There are two things that must occur before Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 operates to bring adopted children into the application of will and trust language. There must exist a class gift; and a contrary intent must not appear on the face of the will or trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">More specifically, the first part of the statute says, in part, that \u201cadopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gift terminology and terms of relationship in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession. . . .\u201d There is no dispute in this case that a gift to \u201cissue\u201d is a class gift. But Glover argues that the rules on determining relationships help establish that adopted children are included in the word \u201cissue.\u201d According to Glover, since the rules set forth in Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1 say that an adopted child is the child of the adopting parent, it is plain that the General Assembly intended to put adopted children on the same footing as natural children. Glover argues from that proposition that \u201cissue\u201d now includes adopted children.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">An almost identical argument was made and rejected in <em>Munday, </em>164 Va. 145, 178 S.E. 917. In that case, a provision of the adoption statute provided that an adopted child was \u201cto all intents and purposes the child and heir at law of the person so adopting him or her. . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 5333 (1930). Based on the language of the adoption statute, the argument was made that it was the intent and purpose of the General Assembly \u201cto put an adopted child on the same plane as a natural child\u201d and that un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>less an adopted child was included in the meaning of the word \u201cissue\u201d the intent of the General Assembly would be thwarted. <em>Munday, </em>164 Va. at 148, 178 S.E. at 918. We rejected that argument holding that the word \u201cissue\u201d did not include adopted children. Part of our rationale was that, at the time Code \u00a7 5333 was promulgated, the word \u201cissue\u201d had been previously used in other statutes and had always been defined to mean natural descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">By the same token, when Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 went into effect in 1978, the word \u201cissue\u201d had a specific meaning that had always been applied. Thus, here, as in <em>Munday, </em>the fact that another statute, in this case Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1, sought to put adopted children on the same plane as natural children could not thereby alter the meaning of the word \u201cissue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Further, Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 is qualified by the phrase \u201cunless a contrary intent shall appear on the face of the will or trust.\u201d Counsel for Glover conceded at oral argument that Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1, by its terms, permitted the description of a class that excluded adopted children. The provision sets forth no guidelines for expressing the contrary intent. It does not suggest, for example, that the contrary intent cannot be expressed through the use of one word that has always been understood not to include adopted children. In other words, the statute does not say that the contrary intent cannot be expressed through the use of the word \u201cissue.\u201d If Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 is strictly construed, as it must be, then its terms are met by the use of the established word \u201cissue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Also significant is the fact that the parties agree that Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 was enacted in response to a Law Review article written in 1978 concerning the general problem of the inheritance rights of children. Johnson, <em>Inheritance Rights of Children In Virginia, </em>12 U. Rich. L. Rev. 275 (1978) (hereinafter cited as <em>\u201cInheritance Rights\u201d). </em>That article is important here because it contains a discussion of the word \u201cissue.\u201d In a discussion of lapsed bequests and devises, Professor Johnson pointed out a problem with the then existing Code \u00a7 64.1-64;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> he wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The problem presented by section 64.1-64 is that its operative word, \u201cissue,\u201d has the absolute biological meaning, \u201cissue of the body\u201d of the deceased beneficiary. <em>It is a matter of settled law and biology that while an adopted person can become one\u2019s child, he can never become one\u2019s issue, and thus an adopted child is precluded from taking under section 64.1-64.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><em>Inheritance Rights, </em>12 U. Rich. L. Rev. at 289 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Professor Johnson\u2019s concern with the 1968 version of Code \u00a7 64.1-64 led to its being changed by removing the word \u201cissue\u201d and substituting the phrase \u201cchildren or their descendants.\u201d Acts 1978, c. 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Glover argues that the deletion of the word \u201cissue\u201d in the anti-lapse statute has no bearing on whether Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 was intended to change the meaning of the word \u201cissue\u201d to include adopted children. According to Glover, her position is correct because the two sections deal with two separate things. In her brief she wrote as follows in an <em>effort to </em>explain her position: \u201cSection 64.1-64 provides for disposition of property where a beneficiary is named but predeceases [the] testator <em>and the will is silent </em>as to whom the property should then go. Section 64.1-71.1 deals with determining eligible members of a class created by the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOX\">Glover\u2019s argument does not answer the critical question raised by the General Assembly\u2019s actions in promulgating Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 while at the same time amending Code \u00a7 64.1-64. If Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 means what Glover says and makes all generic terms, including \u201cissue,\u201d embrace adopted children then why was there a need to amend Code \u00a7 64.1-64. The answer is obvious. The General Assembly was fully aware that the word \u201cissue\u201d did not include adopted children. Had the 1968 version not been changed, Professor Johnson\u2019s concern would have remained valid. By substituting the phrase \u201cchildren and their descendants\u201d for the word \u201cissue,\u201d in the statute, the General Assembly made two things unmistakably clear: (1) if it wanted to change the legal consequences of the word \u201cissue\u201d it knew how; and (2) that the word \u201cissue,\u201d unless modified or redefined, does not include adopted children.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>We hold that Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 does not operate to include adopted children within the meaning of the word \u201cissue.\u201d If the General Assembly intends for adopted children to be included in the word \u201cissue,\u201d it must say so. For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> The version of the statute discussed by Professor Johnson provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHy\">When issue of devisee or legatee to take estate. \u2014 If a devisee or legatee die before the testator, leaving issue who survive the testator, such issue shall take the estate devised or bequeathed, as the devisee or legatee would have done if he had survived the testator, unless a different disposition thereof be made or required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the will. This rule shall also apply to a devise or bequest to several jointly, one or more of whom die in the lifetime of the testator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Code \u00a7 64.1-64 (1973 Repl. Vol.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b165-5\">POFF, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">I cannot join the majority in this opinion. Ancient notions of primogeniture and estates tail and the Statute de Donis have long since been abandoned in this Commonwealth. <em>See Orndoff </em>v. <em>Turman, </em>29 Va. (2 Leigh) 200 (1830). Left surviving, however, was the case-law rule that a testator is presumed to have employed such words as \u201cissue\u201d to exclude \u201cpersons who qualify as such only by or through adoption\u201d. <em>Langhorne </em>v. <em>Langhorne, </em>212 Va. 577, 578, 186 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1972). That presumption was rooted in medieval England\u2019s obsession with bloodlines in the devolution of property. <em>See generally </em>T. Bergin &amp; P. Haskell, Preface to Estates in Land and Future Interests 9 (1966). As I read Acts 1978, c. 647, the General Assembly intended to reverse the presumption enunciated in <em>Langhorne.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The 1978 Act, a comprehensive revision of statutory and case law, was patterned after statutory drafts recommended in a law review article authored by Professor J. Rodney Johnson, <em>Inheritance Rights of Children in Virginia, </em>12 U. Rich. L. Rev. 275 (1978). The legislature repealed four sections in Title 64.1, entitled \u201cWills and Decedents\u2019 Estates\u201d, amended and reenacted four sections in that Title, added five new sections to that Title, and made certain conforming changes in related titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Code \u00a7 64.1-5.1, one of the new sections, provides that when a parent-child relationship \u201cmust be established to determine succession by, through or from a person . . . [a]n adopted person is the child of an adopting parent\u201d. To conform existing sections with the new definition, the General Assembly deleted as superfluous references in Code \u00a7\u00a7 64.1-11 and -16 to adopted children and, in \u00a7 64.1-64, substituted the word \u201cchildren\u201d for the word \u201cissue\u201d so that all children, including a \u201cchild of an adopting parent\u201d, would enjoy the benefits of the lapsed legacy statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1, another new section, is addressed to courts construing generic terms in wills and trusts. Under that section, \u201cadopted persons ... are included in class gift terminology and terms of relationship\u201d. This canon of construction applies \u201cto all wills of decedents dying after July one, nineteen hundred seventy-eight,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regardless of when executed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">This new canon must be applied in the interpretation of a will \u201cunless a contrary intent shall appear on the face of the will\u201d. <em>Id. </em>The majority holds that the word \u201cissue\u201d must be given its common-law meaning and that the testatrix\u2019s use of that word evinces an intent to restrict her class gift to her biological grandchildren or their biological descendants. But a gift to \u201cissue\u201d is archetypically \u201cclass gift terminology\u201d, and courts of this Commonwealth, including the Supreme Court, are commanded by statute to interpret such language to connote testamentary intent to <em>include </em>adopted persons in the class eligible for the gift. Yet the majority construes this very language as proof of intent to <em>exclude </em>them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Other courts, applying statutes similar to those enacted by our General Assembly in 1978, have felt bound by the statutory mandate. <em>See Wheeling Dollar Sav. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. Hanes, 160 W.Va. 711, 719, 237 S.E.2d 499, 504 (1977); <em>accord Wielert </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>84 Ill. App. 3d 151, 154, 404 N.E.2d 1111, 1113 (1980). <em>See also Scribner </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>489 A.2d 8 (Me. 1985); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Green, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>389 So. 2d 235 (Fla. App. 1980); <em>In re Trusts Created by Agreement with Harrington, </em>311 Minn. 403, 250 N.W.2d 163 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In effect, the majority has disinterred and applied a case-law rule of construction buried by the General Assembly. As I perceive the public-policy standards imposed by the 1978 Act, adopted persons now stand on the same footing as biological children for purposes of both testate and intestate inheritance, provided, of course, that a testator may <em>expressly </em>confine the beneficiaries of a class gift to those related by blood or <em>expressly </em>exclude those who are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Applying the statutory canons of construction in effect in Virginia on the date of the testatrix\u2019s death, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 64.1-62, I would hold that Mrs. Glover is included in the class gift terminology employed in the Hannan will and, as the sole surviving child of her adopting parent, is entitled to take, through him, his share of the testamentary gift. Accordingly, because I find no merit in the appellants\u2019 other assignments of error, I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">CARRICO, C.J., and COCHRAN, J., join in dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> Because the testator in <em>Vicars </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>227 Va. 432, 318 S.E.2d 377 (1984), a case cited by the majority, had died in 1904, Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 was not applicable to the question on appeal, and we applied the common-law presumption enunciated in <em>Langhorne. </em>In a recent note commenting upon the decision in <em>Vicars </em>and the effect of the enactment of Code \u00a7 64.1-71.1 which he had drafted, Professor Johnson said: \u201cAlthough this case is valuable as a good explanation of prior law, it will have no application to wills of decedents dying after July 1, 1978 (regardless of when executed), which will be governed by a statute passed in 1978 for the express purpose of reversing these common law presumptions.\u201d Johnson, <em>Wills, Trusts, and Estates, </em>19 U. Rich. L. Rev. 779, 792 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> Code \u00a7\u00a7 64.1-5.1 and -71.1 are declarations of public policy. In the formulation of public policy, the legislature has the power to amend laws affecting testamentary dispositions retroactively, and a testator is charged with knowledge of that fact when he executes his will. Indeed, a testamentary gift, valid when the will was executed, may be completely revoked retroactively by operation of \u201ca statutory declaration of public policy concerning wills\u201d enacted before the testator\u2019s death. <em>Papen </em>v. <em>Papen, </em>216 Va. 879, 883, 224 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1976) (revocation by divorce from spouse-beneficiary).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> It should be added that the majority reaches this conclusion in the face of facts which tend to defeat it.
