The statute also declares, however, that \u201cwhere more than one included offense shall be committed within a six-hour period such multiple offenses shall, on the first such occasion, be treated for the purposes of this article as one offense provided the person charged has no record of prior offenses chargeable under this article\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) certified abstracts of Stanley\u2019s record which showed four convictions: (1) driving under the influence of intoxicating beverages (DUI), October 19, 1978; (2) DUI, October 19, 1982; (3) DUI, November 18, 1983; and (4) driving on a revoked license, November 18, 1983. In the first of two rulings underlying its judgment, the trial court concluded that the first conviction could not be considered because the abstract \u201cwas not executed by the duly constituted Judge\u201d. The abstracts of the third and fourth convictions showed that the two offenses had been committed simultaneously, and, in its second ruling, the trial court concluded that they \u201cconstituted a single offense\u201d under the statute. Finding proof of only two convictions, the court dismissed the show cause order and directed that a certified copy of the judgment be sent to DMV. \u201cA proceeding under Virginia\u2019s Habitual Offender Act is not a criminal proceeding,\u201d <em>Whorley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 740, 746, 214 S.E.2d 447, 451, <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 946 (1975), and we granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Commonwealth an appeal to consider the trial court\u2019s second ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In an opinion issued the year following enactment of the Habitual Offender Act, the Attorney General concluded that multiple offenses committed simultaneously \u201care to be counted as one offense . . . only if the driver has no record of a previous offense chargeable under the Act.\u201d 1968-69 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 178, 179 (1969). Thereafter, the General Assembly amended the Act on four occasions. Acts 1970, cc. 507, 724; Acts 1974, c. 453; Acts 1982, c. 655; Acts 1984, c. 780. None of these amendments altered the Attorney General\u2019s construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The legislature is presumed to have had knowledge of the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the statutes, and its failure to make corrective amendments evinces legislative acquiescence in the Attorney General\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\"><em>Deal </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 618, 622, 299 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Obviously, the General Assembly intended multiple offenses committed within a six-hour period to constitute a single offense under the Habitual Offender Act only when the driver has not previously been convicted of an offense chargeable under the Act and then \u201conly on the first occasion\u201d. Because the record shows that Stanley was convicted of such an offense on October 19, 1982, we hold that the trial court erred in ruling that Stanley\u2019s two convictions on November 18, 1983 constituted a single conviction. We will reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
