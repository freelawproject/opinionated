(Business Products), to recover damages for alleged breaches of warranty. In a bench trial, the trial court awarded Wharton a judgment against Business Products in the amount of $8,335,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but dismissed the suit against Savin, finding that the evidence failed to establish that Savin breached any alleged warranties. Wharton appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Savin.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In November 1981 Wharton purchased from Business Products a paper copier manufactured by Savin. At the time of purchase, Wharton entered into a standard copier maintenance agreement with Business Products.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">As part of its marketing campaign, Savin furnished a \u201cguarantee\u201d set forth in certain promotional literature prepared by Savin. The \u201cguarantee\u201d stated that Savin \u201cwill maintain new Savin Plain Paper Copiers in working order for a period of 8 years, provided they are continuously covered by our standard copier maintenance agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The copier proved to be unsatisfactory and was replaced by a second copier in December 1981. The second copier\u2019s performance record was no better. During a period of approximately nine months, the two copiers required maintenance service on 39 separate occasions. The numerous problems included \u201cjamming,\u201d \u201cskewing,\u201d making \u201cdirty\u201d copies, and making \u201clight\u201d copies. Indeed, the evidence established that the copier malfunctioned nearly every time it was needed for extended use.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The only evidence about the value of the defective copier was the testimony of two of Wharton\u2019s partners. When counsel asked one of the partners about the copier\u2019s value, he responded: \u201cI guess I could graphically describe it this way. If the defendants offered it to us for fifty dollars, I would not want it. It has no value to our firm.\u201d Another partner, in answer to a similar question, stated, \u201c[t]hat machine has absolutely no value to our firm or to me individually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Savin contends on appeal, as it did at trial, that Wharton (1) failed to prove that Savin breached any warranty, and (2) failed to prove damages. Because our view of the damage issue is dispositive, we will not address the breach of warranty issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Under the Uniform Commercial Code, \u201c[t]he measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.2-714(2). This formula was essentially the measure of damages for breach of warranty before the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code. <em>Holz </em>v. <em>Motor Company, </em>206 Va. 894, 896-97, 147 S.E.2d 152, 155 (1966); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>202 Va. 700, 705, 119 S.E.2d 332, 335 (1961); <em>Jacot </em>v. <em>Grossmann Seed Co., </em>115 Va. 90, 98, 107, 78 S.E. 646, 647, 650 (1913); <em>Eastern Ice Co. </em>v. <em>King, </em>86 Va. 97, 103, 9 S.E. 506, 508 (1889).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Thus, in proving damages for breach of warranty of goods that can be bought and sold on the open market, a party must present evidence of the <em>fair market </em>value<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cat the time and place of acceptance\u201d of the \u201cgoods accepted\u201d and of what they would have had \u201cif they had been as warranted.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The difference in these two valuations is the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\"><em>Holz, </em>in which we considered the standard of proof for damages in breach of warranty cases, is virtually indistinguishable from the present case. In <em>Holz, </em>the plaintiff purchased through a dealer a new automobile manufactured by Chrysler Corporation. The plaintiff had many problems with the automobile, and it was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the dealer\u2019s garage for repairs \u201cnearly half of the time\u201d during a period of one year from the date of its delivery. During that time, however, the plaintiff had driven the automobile between 8,000 and 9,000 miles. The trial court set aside a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove damages, and we affirmed. In <em>Holz, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\">The proof here fails to establish the difference in the value of the Crown Imperial automobile free from material defects and the value of the automobile delivered to plaintiff with the alleged defects. The sale price may be taken as the value of the car without the defective parts, but there was no evidence to establish the value of the allegedly defective automobile. It was not contended that the automobile did not run, or that any essential part of the car continuously failed to function. Plaintiffs chief complaints were directed to the noise of the engine and other parts of the car, improper steering, and its riding qualities. <em>Plaintiffs statement that the automobile was worthless to him does not establish the fact that it had no value. </em>Obviously the automobile had some value, since it had been driven between 8,000 and 9,000 miles during a period of twelve months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">206 Va. at 897-98, 147 S.E.2d at 155 (emphasis added). <em>Accord Twin Lakes Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Coffey, 222 </em>Va. 467, 473-75, 281 S.E.2d 864, 867-68 (1981) (a plaintiffs testimony that defective goods are valueless <em>to him, </em>without more, is insufficient to establish that the goods have no value; however, expert testimony that a mobile home was valueless is sufficient evidence to support such a finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In the present case, Wharton totally failed to prove the value of the copier as accepted. The statements by two of Wharton\u2019s partners that the copier had no value to them or their firm \u201cdoes not establish the fact that it had no value.\u201d <em>Holz, </em>206 Va. at 897, 147 S.E.2d at 155. Because no probative evidence of the defective copier\u2019s value was introduced, Wharton, as a matter of law, failed to prove any damages for breach of warranty as required by Code \u00a7 8.2-714(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\"> According to the trial court\u2019s memorandum opinion, this amount represents the purchase price of the copier, $11,845, less a credit of $3,510 for Wharton\u2019s nine months\u2019 use of the copier, valued at $390.00 per month. Business Products has not appealed this judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> Fair market value is the price the goods would bring if they were offered for sale by one who desires, but is not obliged to sell, and were bought by one who desires, but is under no necessity of having them. <em>See Fruit Growers </em>v. <em>Alexandria, </em>216 Va. 602, 606, 221 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> The purchase price is not necessarily the fair market value the goods would have had \u201cif they had been as warranted,\u201d but it may be persuasive evidence thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
