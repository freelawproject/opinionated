Arthur Weaver Company, Incorporated (Weaver), against Medcom, Incorporated (Medcom), and Medical Services of America, Incorporated (Medical Services). Medcom filed a counterclaim against Weaver and joined Clippard Instrument Laboratory, Inc. (Clippard), as a third-party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Weaver instituted the action against Medcom on an account for goods and against Medical Services as guarantor on the account. Medcom and Medical Services filed joint grounds of defense denying liability. Medcom also filed its counterclaim against Weaver and its third-party motion for judgment against Clippard, alleging breach of warranty against both.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court struck Medcom\u2019s and Medical Services\u2019 evidence in defense of Weaver\u2019s claim and submitted to the jury the amount of Weaver\u2019s damages as the only issue. The court also struck Medcom\u2019s evidence on its counterclaim against Weaver and on its third-party claim against Clippard. Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict against Medcom for $31,109.73, and against Medical Services for $80,483.49, as guarantor of Medcom\u2019s obligation to Weaver.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The principal issues presented in this appeal are whether the trial court erred by (1) striking Medcom\u2019s evidence presented as a defense to Weaver\u2019s account claim; (2) construing Medical Services\u2019 guaranty letter as creating a continuing obligation; and (3) striking Medcom\u2019s evidence on its counterclaim and third-party motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Because the trial court struck Medcom\u2019s and Medical Services\u2019 evidence, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to them. <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>226 Va. 106, 109, 306 S.E.2d 879, 881 (1983). Weaver is a wholesale distributor of mechanical, electro-mechanical, and fluid drive products. Clippard is a manufacturer of pneumatic products for which Weaver acts as a distributor. Medical Services is a health service company which provides a variety of services, including the rental of certain health care equipment to individual patients. Medical Services rents a device called an oxygen concentrator, which extracts pure oxygen from the air and makes it available to the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">After having purchased its concentrators from various manufacturers, Medical Services, in 1978, decided to manufacture its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>concentrator. Medical Services, therefore, established Medcom as a separate corporate entity to carry out that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">Because Medcom lacked engineering expertise, it contacted Weaver for assistance in manufacturing the concentrator. Weaver, in turn, contacted Clippard to obtain the benefit of Clippard\u2019s expertise in supplying the appropriate parts. In order for Medcom to obtain the credit necessary to purchase parts from Weaver, Medical Services signed two letters guaranteeing Medcom\u2019s payment for parts ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Medcom relied on Weaver\u2019s and Clippard\u2019s expertise in developing a prototype oxygen concentrator. For example, although all oxygen concentrators then on the market used electrical valves, Medcom accepted Clippard\u2019s recommendation to use pneumatic valves. Additionally, Clippard and Weaver were instrumental in Medcom\u2019s decision to incorporate into its concentrator Clippard\u2019s \u201ccam timer,\u201d a mechanism crucial to the concentrator\u2019s satisfactory operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Almost all the component parts used in Medcom\u2019s concentrator were purchased through Weaver. Weaver sold Medcom the compressors, compressor housings, base plates, fans, major valves, motors, and cam timers. Indeed, according to the uncontradicted evidence, \u201c[p] ractically everything in the unit, maybe with the exception of the pipe and the caps, was bought through Weaver.\u201d Clippard manufactured the primary valve system, the cam timer, and certain miscellaneous parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Using the valve configuration, piping, and plastic tubing recommended by Weaver and Clippard, Medcom produced approximately 1200 oxygen concentrator units. Although Weaver and Clippard recommended the parts for the concentrator and represented that they would perform their intended function, the following problems arose: (1) the piping connections developed leaks; (2) the valves in the cam timer unit stuck in either the open or closed position; (3) the shutoff valves malfunctioned; and (4) the acrylic subplates recommended by Clippard to reduce leakage merely compounded the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">I. <em>Medcom\u2019s Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">First, we consider whether the trial court erred in striking Medcom\u2019s evidence of Weaver\u2019s alleged breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Weaver argues that the trial court correctly struck Medcom\u2019s evidence because (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Medcom did not plead breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and (2) the evidence presented at trial, in any event, was insufficient to create a jury issue on the alleged breach of implied warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In Paragraph 7 of its motion for judgment, Weaver alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">7. All valves and other components sold to Medcom by Weaver were in proper working order when delivered . . . ; further, all such valves and other components are not defective and <em>are fit for the purpose for which they were intended to be used by Medcom, </em>although no such warranty was made to Medcom by Weaver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">(Emphasis added.) In its grounds of defense, Medcom \u201cdenie[d] each and every allegation of Paragraph 7.\u201d Thus, Medcom expressly denied Weaver\u2019s assertion that the parts were \u201cfit for the purpose for which they were intended.\u201d Medcom also denied the ' assertion that Weaver had not made any warranty of the parts. The issue of implied warranty, therefore, was before the court, entitling Medcom to present evidence in support thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Accordingly, we must determine whether Medcom\u2019s evidence created a jury issue concerning Weaver\u2019s alleged breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Code \u00a7 8.2-315 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is ... an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">In order to recover under Code \u00a7 8.2-315, a buyer must prove that (1) the seller had reason to know the particular purpose for which the buyer required the goods, (2) the seller had reason to know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the buyer was relying on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment to furnish appropriate goods, and (3) the buyer in fact relied upon the seller\u2019s skill or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In the present case, Medcom introduced evidence from which the jury reasonably could infer that (1) Weaver and Clippard knew the particular purpose for which Medcom required the parts, (2) Weaver and Clippard knew Medcom was relying on their skill or judgment in selecting and furnishing appropriate parts, and (3) Medcom relied upon Weaver\u2019s and Clippard\u2019s skill or judgment. There was also evidence from which the jury reasonably could infer that the parts were not reasonably fit for their intended purpose, thereby causing the concentrator to malfunction and fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">When a seller breaches an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and the warranted goods have no value except for that purpose, the purchaser may assert the breach as a complete defense to the seller\u2019s action for the purchase price. Here, there was evidence to support a finding that the component parts manufactured for and sold to Medcom were not suitable for their intended purpose, and no evidence suggests that the parts had any value except for that purpose. Consequently, Medcom was entitled to assert a breach of implied warranty as a complete defense to Weaver\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The resolution of conflicting evidence is a function of the jury. Here, the evidence relating to an implied warranty and breach thereof was conflicting and should have been submitted to the jury to resolve the conflicts. We hold, therefore, that the trial court erred in striking the evidence Medcom presented in defense of Weaver\u2019s action for the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">II. <em>Medical Services\u2019 Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Next, we consider whether the trial court correctly construed Medical Services\u2019 guaranty as a continuing one. Because Medcom was a new company without, established credit, Weaver obtained from Medical Services a letter of guaranty. The letter, dated March 6, 1979, was written by Charlie Smith, a Medcom employee authorized by Medical Services to make the guaranty. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">This letter is in reference to our recent large orders. In the event that we discontinue buying from your company, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>any reason, Medical Services of America agrees to purchase all stock for which you have purchase orders from [us].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The record shows that Medcom has paid for all purchase orders Weaver had on hand on March 6, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Subsequently, at Weaver\u2019s request, Medical Services sent Weaver a second letter, guaranteeing Medcom\u2019s purchases made during the 90-day period beginning November 1, 1979. Likewise, the record shows that Medcom has paid for all purchase orders placed during the period provided in the second letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Smith, called by Weaver, testified that the March 6 letter guaranteed only those purchase orders Weaver had on hand on March 6, 1979. Nevertheless, the trial court ruled that the March 6 letter, as a matter of law, continued to guarantee payment of all purchase orders received by Weaver after March 6, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In support of its argument that the March 6 letter was a continuing guaranty, Weaver cites <em>Pascoe Steel </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>224 Va. 530, 298 S.E.2d 97 (1982), where we said: \u201ca guaranty, unlimited as to time, but given in circumstances evidencing the guarantor\u2019s intent to cover a series of transactions, will be construed as a continuing one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534, 298 S.E.2d at 99. The guaranty in <em>Pascoe, </em>however, unlike the March 6 letter, expressly stated that it was a \u201ccontinuing guaranty,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 533, 298 S.E.2d at 98, covering all liabilities incurred \u201cnow or at any time hereafter,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 532, 298 S.E.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The March 6 letter was written in reference to Medcom\u2019s \u201crecent large orders\u201d and informed Weaver that, in the event Medcom discontinued purchasing parts from Weaver, Medical Services would \u201cpurchase all stock for which [Weaver had] purchase orders from [Medcom].\u201d The March 6 letter is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one being the interpretation given by Smith. Moreover, a jury reasonably could infer that Weaver\u2019s request for a second guaranty supports Smith\u2019s interpretation of the March 6 letter. Because reasonable minds could differ as to the meaning of the March 6 letter, we hold that the trial court erred in refusing to submit the resolution of this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>III. <em>Medcom\u2019s Counterclaim and Third-Party Motion for Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The trial court struck Medcom\u2019s evidence on its counterclaim against Weaver and on its third-party claim against Clippard, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Medcom failed to produce sufficient evidence of damages. Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Medcom, we must consider whether Medcom produced sufficient evidence of monetary damages to create a jury issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In its counterclaim and third-party motion for judgment, Medcom sought damages of $750,000 for (1) loss of business reputation, (2) loss of profits, and (3) payment for defective component parts. Medcom presented no evidence touching upon loss of business reputation or loss of profits. Moreover, Medcom points to no evidence indicating the amount it paid Weaver for the defective component parts, and our examination of the record discloses none.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Although not pleaded, Medcom attempted to prove two other elements of damage: (1) the cost of defective parts removed from concentrator units, and (2) the cost of labor and replacement parts incurred in repairing concentrator units. Medcom\u2019s witness testified that the inventory of defective parts amounted to $90,849 and that replacement costs amounted to $19,827.65. The witness, however, conceded that an undetermined amount of the defective inventory and replacement costs was attributable to defective parts acquired from sources other than Weaver and Clippard.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The trial court ruled that Medcom\u2019s evidence relating to these two elements of damage was insufficient to create a jury issue, and we agree. Although \u201c[p]roof of absolute certainty as to the amount of loss or damage is not essential,\u201d <em>duPont Co. </em>v. <em>Universal Moulded Prod., </em>191 Va. 525, 572, 62 S.E.2d 233, 255 (1950), a claimant must prove \u201cwith reasonable certainty the amount of damages and the cause from which they resulted,\u201d <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank &amp; Trust, </em>228 Va. 644, 652, 325 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1985); <em>see Hale </em>v. <em>Fawcett, </em>214 Va. 583, 585, 202 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Ordinarily, it is the jury\u2019s function to determine whether and to what extent a litigant has been damaged. In the present case, however, Medcom\u2019s evidence of damages was vague, indefinite, and speculative. We hold, therefore, that the trial court prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>erly struck Medcom\u2019s evidence on its counterclaim and third-party claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We will reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment striking Medcom\u2019s and Medical Services\u2019 evidence in defense of Weaver\u2019s account claim, vacate Weaver\u2019s damage award, affirm the portion of the judgment striking Medcom\u2019s evidence on its counterclaim and third-party motion for judgment, and remand the case for a new trial limited to Weaver\u2019s claims against Medcom and Medical Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-10\"> The trial court and Weaver\u2019s counsel were aware at trial that Medcom was asserting breach of an implied warranty for a particular purpose. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry, Medcom\u2019s trial counsel (different from counsel on appeal) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">I think I have shown that Medcom relied upon the expertise of Clippard and Weaver when they sold them the product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">In other words, I have to get within that part of the Uniform Commercial Code which allows a Jury to decide whether or not the parts were suitable for the purpose for which they were designed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
