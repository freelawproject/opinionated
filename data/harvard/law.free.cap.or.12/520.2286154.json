It was the duty of plaintiff when approaching macMnery about wMch he was employed to both think and look, in order to avoid injury from such machinery, and if you find from the evidence that the injury sustained by plaintiff was received by reason of his' failure to think or look as to what he was doing, he was guilty of such negligence as precludes recovery.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b538-17\">Id.\u2014Ebayee eoe Instbuctions\u2014Eailuke to Instruct.\u2014Where the plaintiff claims that the facts showed an emergency which required such prompt and speedy action as would excuse him in a failure to exercise the same care and forethought that would ordinarily be required of a prudent man under similar circumstances, it is Ms duty to ask for an instruction appropriate to that theory of the ease.

The evidence showed that the plaintiff was comparatively inexperienced in mills; that he had been told to approach the shaft in the way he did; that the machinery had been previously heating, and that he smelled burning oil, and was in a great hurry to ascertain which shaft was heating at this particular time. The court had no right to take all these circumstances away from the jury and say to them, that if in the excitement of the moment he permitted his eyes to wander off to see if the oil was not dripping from some other shaft, that that was conclusive evidence of negligence. (Wheeler v. <em>Town of Westport, </em>30 Wis. 413; <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>I. St. L. &amp; R. Co. </em>1 N. E. Rep. 899.) The inferences to be drawn from undisputed facts as well as the facts themselves are ordinarily for the jury. <em>(Sioux City &amp; P. R.

And this is especially true where reasonable men might draw different conclusions from the admitted facts. <em>(Thurber v. H. R. R. Co. </em>60 N. Y. 331; <em>A. &amp; H. R. R.

It is assumed that twelve men drawn from the different vocations of the community at large can draw a safer and wiser conclusion from undisputed facts than a single judge. <em>(Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>17 Wall. 657; <em>Davis v.

A witness is as much bound to attend at' the trial of a cause, if served by a constable, as if served by a sheriff, and he is under the same obligations if served by any other person, or accepts or acknowledges service of the subpoena as if served by either. The restriction of cross-examination on immaterial matters is not a subject of exception. <em>(Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Methuen, </em>1 Allen, 33; <em>Plato </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>16 Abb. Pr. 188; <em>Rand </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Newton, </em>6 Allen, 38; <em>Commonw. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>4 Cush. 593.) It is the duty of an employee working in the vicinity of machinery to exercise his <em>thinking faculties; </em>if he fails to do so and is injured in consequence thereof, he is guilty of such negligence as prevents a recovery. <em>(Stone </em>v. <em>Oregon City Manuf Co. </em>4 Oreg. 55; <em>Bruker </em>v. <em>Town of Covington, </em>69 Ind. 33.) Where, as in this case, the plaintiff has been the actor in the affair in which the injury was received, and his acts <em>per se </em>would indicate negligence, he cannot recover without proof that he exercised ordinary care. <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>O. R. &amp; N. Co. </em>10 Oreg. 250; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>12 Oreg. 329.) The complaint alleges that the accident occurred, because the <em>wheels were fastened upon the shafts by keys, etc., </em>an objection going to the original construction of . the mill. It seems plain that under such circumstances plaintiff assumed whatever risk was incident to working about machinery constructed in this particular manner, and that if the same was in fact dangerous it became his duty to use the greater care and diligence to avoid such danger. <em>(Mansfield Coal Co. </em>v. <em>McEnery, </em>91 Pa.

The respondent, in his answer to the complaint, denied all the material allegations thereof, and alleged affirmatively that the injury was received in consequence of the appellant\u2019s own carelessness in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The issue between the parties involved mainly the questions, whether the respondent was guilty of negligence and carelessness in consequence of the condition of the mill at the time the affair occurred, and if so, was the appellant careless and negligent concerning the matter, and did his carelessness and negligence contribute to the injury? The evidence seems to have been conflicting as to whether the mill was in an unsafe aud dangerous condition as alleged in the complaint, and as to whether the appellant was \u201cprudently and carefully performing his duties as such servant \u201d at the time he received the injury. The mill seems to have been in the same condition at the time the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>happened that it was when the appellant commenced his term of service on the 1st of January preceding, though there was evidence tending to show that the respondent\u2019s superintendent had promised, upon appellant\u2019s complaining to him, to have it repaired as soon as he completed a contract they were then working upon, but did not. He subsequently, when appellant again complained to him, made another promise to remedy the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the respondent, upon which the judgment appealed from was entered. The grounds of error specified in the notice of appeal upon which the appellant relies in this court are the following: That the court erred in sustaining the respondent\u2019s objection to questions asked upon cross-examination by appellant\u2019s counsel to one T. C. Miller, a witness for the respondent, as follows: \u201cWho, if anyone, served the subpcena upon you ? State whether or not your fees were tendered you at the time the subpoena was served upon you. State what distance you came to attend as a witness in this case.\u201d And in the court\u2019s saying in connection therewith, in the presence of the jury, \u201c that the jury would not be justified in drawing any inference therefrom, even if the witness were shown to have attended without any subpoena being served upon him at all.\u201d Also in limiting the counsel for the appellant to an hour and a half in which to sum up the case to the jury, and in the court\u2019s giving certain instructions to the jury which will hereafter be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The case has been very thoroughly and ably presented upon both sides. The counsel for the appellant by his brief and argument has shown that he has investigated every phase of it with the closest scrutiny. Yet, after a full consideration of every question, I am inclined to the opinion that his points are not well taken. The real issue between the parties was one of fact, and the court ought not to disturb the finding of the jury unless it is clearly shown that error was committed at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The first ground of error cannot possibly be maintained, whether the witness, T. C. Miller, was subpoenaed by the party or by an officer, or was not formally subpoenaed at all, was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>no importance, nor whether any fees were tendered to him, nor the distance he came to attend as a witness. If he had come voluntarily in order to be a witness in the case, it might have shown a feeling of friendship for the party who called him; but that question was not asked him, and those that were asked him were entirely too remote to elicit any material fact. Suppose he had answered the question by saying \u201c that no subpoena had been served upon him\u201d; \u201cthat the respondent had requested him to attend, and that he consented to do so \u201d; \u201c that he had waived the formal service of subpoena.\u201d What possible discredit could it have cast upon his testimony? And the same inquiry may be made if he had answered that no fees were tendered him. I think the court concluded rightly \u201cthat the jury would not be justified in drawing any inference therefrom, even if the witness were shown to have attended without any subpoena being served upon him at all,\u201d and it might have added \u201c without having required the prepayment of his fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AcW\">The second ground of error, the limiting of the appellant\u2019s counsel to one hour and thirty minutes in which to argue the case to the jury, I believed to be more serious, as I had always entertained.the view that the statute gave two hours on a side in such cases. It reads as follows: \u201cNot more than two counsel on a side shall be allowed to address the jury on behalf of the plaintiff or defendant; and the whole time occupied on either side shall not exceed two hours unless the court, for special reasons, shall otherwise permit.\u201d (\u00a7 194, subd. 4, Civ. Code.) But a careful observance of the language will show, I think, that the legislature did not intend to grant any definite time in which counsel might address the jury. It merely provided that the whole time occupied for that purpose should not exceed two hours on a side; and left in the court the power to permit, for special reasons, a longer time. The provision was a restriction upon the power of the court; it cannot permit any more time to be occupied than that, unless for special reasons. Courts at common law had the right to limit the time counsel should occupy in addressing the jury, and the statute confers the same right. It is included in the authority, \u201cto control in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>furtherance of justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers and all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it, in every matter appertaining thereto.\u201d (\u00a7 848, subd. 5, Civ. Code.) The legislature, by the former section, limits the said time to two hours on a side, leaving in the court the right to extend it for good reasons; but it has not restricted the power of the court from limiting it still more. It has not interfered with the power of the court, except as before stated. The latter may allow counsel to occupy two hours on a side for the purpose mentioned, but it hasno authority to permit them to occupy a longer time unless there are good reasons for so doing. Its power so far is' restricted, but in no other particular. A trial might, and often does, take such a course that only a single question of fact is left for the consideration of the jury, and that may involve the credibility of but one witness; in such case it would require a great amount of patience upon the part of a <em>nisi prius </em>judge to be compelled to sit four hours and listen to the harangue of a garrulous counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It was contended by the appellant\u2019s counsel that, irrespective of the statute, the Circuit Court, ill view of the importance of the case, extent of the testimony, its contradictory character, and of the intricate points of law involved in it, abused its discretion in limiting the time as it did herein. However that may have been, as a matter of fact, it does not appear with sufficient certainty to justify our interference with the judgment. Though I would be much more satisfied with the proceeding, if the court had allowed counsel two hours upon a side, yet I must concede that the presiding judge had the better opportunity to determine that matter</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The third assignment of error involves the <em>correctness </em>of the fifth and eighth instructions given by the Circuit Court to the jury. The following is a copy of the said instructions respectively: \u201cFifth. If you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff knew the position, condition, and character of the machinery by which he was injured, and could have reasonably avoided danger by approaching the same from the outward revolutions of the gear, and did not do so because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>think to look, then he was guilty of negligence precluding his recovery,, and your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cEighth. It was the duty of plaintiff when approaching machinery about which he was employed, both to think and look in order to avoid injury from such machinery, and if you find from the evidence that the injury sustained by the plaintiff was received by reason of his failure to think or look as to what he was doing, he was guilty of such negligence as precludes his recovery, and your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The complaint against these instructions is, that they were given without qualification; that the circumstances under which the appellant was situated at the time he approached the machinery to ascertain whether any of the shafts were heating, his inexperience, the machinery having been previously heating, the smell of burning oil, and the necessity of haste, were disregarded; that the evidence showed an emergency had arisen, and the court did not allow the jury to consider it; that it, in effect, took these circumstances from the jury. But it must be remembered that the evidence upon that point was conflicting; that there was evidence upon the side of the respondent which tended to show that the machinery in all respects was in good condition, and ordinarily safe; that the key did not project, and that it would not be dangerous if it did; that it was customary to permit such keys to project; that the general condition of the machinery was good; that the appellant should have approached the particular gearing from the other side, and that there was nothing to prevent him from so doing; that the appellant had made different statements in relation to the shaft after he got hurt, and, at some five or six different times, had told different persons that the accident was caused by his own carelessness, and that it would not have occurred if he had not been in such a hurry to get away, so as to have a few hours to himself, and his being in a hurry and thinking about something else at the time. It was doubtless in view of all the testimony that said instructions were given. The court did not assume, and it had no right to assume, the correctness of the testimony on either side. If that adduced by the appellant had been conceded to be true, there would, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the appellant\u2019s standpoint, have been more ground for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">It cannot be maintained that the instructions were erroneous as abstract propositions. The fifth one is to the effect, that if the appellant knew the position, condition, and character of the machinery by which he was injured, and could have reasonably avoided danger by approaching the same from the outward revolutions of the gear, and did not do so because he did not think or look, he was guilty of such a degree of negligence as to preclude his recovery. I think that is clearly maintainable as a correct proposition of law. The eighth one is to the effect that it was the duty of the appellant, when approaching machinery about which he was employed, both \u201cto think and look\u201d in order to avoid injury from such machinery, and if he received the injury by reason of his failure to \u201cthink or look\u201d as to what he was doing, he was guilty of such negligence as precluded his recovery. That is also as it appeal\u2019s to me, a correct proposition of law, nor do I understand that the appellant\u2019s counsel controverts either of these conclusions; but he contends that under the peculiar circumstances of this case they are incorrect, because, he says, the evidence shows that the state of affairs before mentioned existed. He cannot, however, maintain that. The evidence adduced by the appellant may, and doubtless. did, tend to show it, but the evidence of the respondent showed quite to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">It may be claimed that the court, admitting the correctness-of the counsel\u2019s position, should have charged, that if the facts were as the appellant claimed, that the appellant did not \u201cthink or look\u201d in consequence of the exigency of the case and the flurried condition of mind he was in, occasioned thereby, his failure to \u201cthink and look\u201d would not be such negligence as-would necessarily preclude his recovery, or, in other words, that the jury should take such facts and circumstances into consideration in determining whether the appellant was guilty of negligence or not. But the court was not asked to charge that, nor was the charge it gave necessarily inconsistent therewith, and the instructions referred to were not in and of themselves erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>neous. If, therefore, the appellant\u2019s counsel is correct in his position regarding the law, in such a case it does not follow that \u2022.the court committed error as alleged. This view of the case did mot probably occur to the mind of the court. In the hurry and \u25a0confusion attending a jury trial, the presiding judge cannot be expected to instruct in regard to every view in which the facts of a .case may be considered, without having his attention directed to. it. His neglect in that particular should not therefore be held to be error, where his attention was not directly called to the matter by an appropriate prayer for instructions. It is unnecessary to speculate upon the consequences that would have followed if such an instruction upon the point under consideration had been asked and refused. I am inclined to believe, however, that if the facts were as the appellant claimed, in regard to the condition of the mill and machinery, and that the other circumstances existed when the injury was received, the question of appellant\u2019s negligence should have been submitted to the jury, and been determined in view of those facts and circumstances. Whether a person in a certain affair has acted carelessly and .imprudently or not, depends very much upon the condition in which he is placed. The same prudence and deliberation would not be expected from him in case a house was on fire as would be in ordinary occurrences. But the view we have taken -of this, matter renders it unnecessary to express any opinion upon that point. It is sufficient to determine that the two instructions considered were not erroneous as given, whatever might have been the case if prefaced as before suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">This court, in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Oregon City Manuf. Co. </em>4 Oreg. 52, held that the refusal of an instruction, similar in terms to the said two instructions, was error, and reversed the judgment. The court there said \u201cthat there is very little machinery in a woolen mill but what is dangerous to careless and thoughtless operatives; consequently, we hold that it was the duty of respondent, while engaged in working in the vicinity of such machinery, to exercise his thinking faculties, and give careful attention to the business in which he was engaged. If he failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>to do so, and was injured in consequence thereof, it was such negligence as contributed to his own injury, and would prevent his recovery in the action.\u201d This I believe to be the general rule in such cases, and it is decisive of the present question. If the facts and circumstances surrounding the affair in which the party received the injury were such as to excuse him from that degree of care and thoughtfulness a prudent man would ordinarily exercise, they should, I think, be taken into consideration by the jury in determining the question of the party\u2019s negligence; but where, as in this case, such facts and circumstances are controverted, and the court fail to call the attention of the jury to them, the counsel for the party should so frame the instruction desired as to secure their benefit in case they are found to exist. The true test as to whether the party is chargeable with negligence in such a case is, whether the act is such that a man of ordinary prudence would not have done it under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The fourth and last ground of error this court is required to consider is the correctness of the seventh instruction given to the jury. The following is a copy of the said instruction:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\"><em>u </em>7. It is a general principle that a person cannot recover for an injury occasioned by the negligence of another, unless he himself is without negligence, contributing to the injury of which he complains. If, therefore, you find from the evidence that the negligence, carelessness, or want of care, on the part of plaintiff, contributed to the injury of which he complains, he cannot recover in this action, and your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The appellant\u2019s counsel contends that the instruction is incorrect, in not specifying the degree of negligence that must contribute to the injury, to prevent a recovery; that there are three degrees of negligence\u2014slight, ordinary, and gross; and that a party may contribute slight negligence to the injury, and still recover on account of the negligence of the adverse party.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The instruction was evidently intended only to lay down the ordinary rule upon the subject, and the language employed is the same that is commonly used in stating the general principle which governs in such cases. The jury could not possibly have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>been misled in consequence of any omission in the particular mentioned, even if it were necessary to make the distinction, as the next following instruction fully explained the degree of negligence required to be shown in order to defeat a recovery in the action. By the eighth instruction the jury were told as follows: \u201cIf you find from the evidence that the injury in question was caused by some negligence upon the part of the defendant, amounting to want of ordinary care, and that the plaintiff himself exercised ordinary care in the matter, then it would be no defense that the plaintiff might have avoided the injury by the utmost possible care. Extraordinary care on the part of the plaintiff is not required, and its absence would not excuse the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">This fully served to explain the previous instruction in the respect mentioned, and it is idle to contend that the jury could have been misled upon the point. Besides, I do not concede that a party can recover in such a case when chargeable with any degree of negligence upon his part if it directly contributes to the injury. A person may be negligent in an affair and still recover on account of the negligence of another party, but not when his negligence is the proximate cause of the injury. The law does not enforce contribution between joint tort feasors. However slight the negligence upon the part of a plaintiff may be, if it be such that but for that negligence the misfortune could not have happened he cannot recover; but if the injury would have happened if his want of care had not contributed thereto, there may be a liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">I am inclined to the belief that, said instruction is correct, without any explanation. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-8\">Wat-do, C. J., did not sit in this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
