(Angell Highways, \u00a7 276; <em>Rex. </em>v. <em>St. Weonards, </em>6 Car. &amp; P. 582; <em>State </em>v. <em>Purify, </em>86 N.

In the former case it is not necessary to set out the <em>termim; </em>in the latter, both must be set out with certainty. (Taunton, J., in <em>Simpson </em>v <em>Lewthwaite, </em>3 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Adol. 226.) In pleading a highway it is sufficient to set forth in a compendious way that it is a highway, without setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>forth when it became a highway. <em>(Aspindall </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 Term Rep. 266.) But if the <em>termini </em>be stated, they must be proved, because they become descriptive of the identity of the highway described. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>15 Me. 476; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State, </em>41 Tex. 253; <em>Rex. </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of St. Weonards, </em>6 Car. <em>&amp; </em>P. 582.) \u201c When, however, a local description sufficient to identify and fix the precise point of obstruction is given, as well as the <em>termini, </em>the latter may be disregarded, and proof that a road existed at the place of obstruction is alone necessary.\u201d <em>(Lewiston </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>27 Ill. 419; <em>Dimon </em>v. <em>People, </em>17 Ill. 421; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>People, </em>63 Ill. 186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The indictment in this case contains such a local description in the allegation \u201cthat there is a strip of land lying in front of said town of Ellensburg, as appears from a plat of said town recorded in the office of the county clerk of said Curry County, and along the navigable waters of Rogue Hiver, which forms a part of said highway, and which said strip of land lying in front of said town, and along the navigable waters of Hogue Hiver as aforesaid, now is, and for more than twenty years prior to said 1st day of May, A. H. 1874, had been, a public highway and public landing, over which all persons had been accustomed to pass and repass at pleasure; that on the 1st day of May, 1884, in the county aforesaid, the said H.
