In addition, he found: that the check No. 903 for $2,100, payable to Denton Company, was issued to it after Bailey Company had had notice of the interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>bank and had agreed that payments would be by check payable jointly to Denton Company and the bank; and that this payment should, therefore, not be allowed as a credit as against the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">As to the claims asserted by the Surety Company by way of credits, one, the judgment in favor of Minneapolis for $598.58, which the surety had paid, the other, the judgment in favor of the Trane Co. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, the district judge, while adverting to them in his findings, did not expressly dispose of them, U. S. for Benefit of Trane Co. v. Denton Plumbing &amp; Heating, 128 F.Supp. 881. However, by failing to allow them as offsets or credits and by awarding plaintiff judgment for $5,086.82, the aggregate of the two sums, the $2,986.28 and the $2,100 check above referred to, he in law, rejected them.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The defendant, appealing from the judgment, is here complaining of the action of the court in disallowing as credits the items following (1) the $2,-100 check hereinabove referred to; (2) the material claim and judgment of Minneapolis-Honeywell, which it paid; and (3) the material claim and judgment of Trane Company which, unless that judgment is reversed by this court, it must pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">For the reasons hereafter briefly stated, we find ourselves in agreement with each of appellant\u2019s contentions. As to the $2,100 claim, this is the record. After the accountant put on by plaintiff had stated the account between Bailey Company and Denton Company, with the resulting unpaid balance as above stated, plaintiff\u2019s counsel picked up, among' the items making up the account, a check, No. 903, for $2,100, payable to Denton Plumbing Co., and stated to the court with reference to it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">\u201cIf it please the Court, one of the items on this yellow sheet is an item of $2100, and it shows on its face that it is a payment to the Denton Plumbing Co. Now, we will contend that they are not entitled to credit for that against us, because at the time that that payment was made, they had notice that that had been assigned to us by the plumbing company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">Defendant, objecting in effect that there was no proof to support the assertion that the check had been paid to the plumbing company without the consent of the bank, the court stated, \u201cI will carry it along with the case. Unless they connect it up some way, I don\u2019t see how they can be admitted\u201d. Further saying that the bank could recover only that which Denton could, he .stated in substance that in this suit against the surety the bank, as assignee, stands in the shoes of Denton. Notwithstanding these statements and the fact that no other or further evidence was offered as to the check, he gave effect in his findings of fact to plaintiff\u2019s contention and disallowed the check as a proper credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">As to the Minneapolis judgment, the prime, indeed the sole, purpose of the bond was to protect and pay such claims. Under no circumstances could the Den-ton Company or the bank, as its assignee, in a suit on the bond come ah\u00e9ad of the claim of Minneapolis,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or by refusing to credit the amount on the whole sum due could Denton or its assignee require the Surety Company in effect to pay it twice. The Trane Company judgment would have stood in the same case except that, at the time of the trial below, it had not become final and was to be appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">In these circumstances, the court should have either deferred judgment in this cause until the issues with respect to the Trane Company claim were finally determined or, if it decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>proceed to judgment, it should have provided for a stay of execution of the judgment until the Trane matter was determined and for a credit thereon if and when the Trane Co. judgment became final against the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">In disallowing the $2,100 credit and in proceeding to judgment without taking the two material claims into consideration, the court committed error requiring a reversal of the judgment. The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions in the event of another trial to allow as a credit in stating the account the $2,100 check and the Minneapolis judgment and, if and when the Trane judgment, this day affirmed, in cause No. 15116 on the docket of this court becomes final, to allow the amount of that judgment also as a credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-15\">. As later broken down in the evidence, this was $598.50 paid to Minneapolis-Honeywell, and $6,221.51, for which Trane Co., a supplier to Denton, had sued and obtained judgment against the surety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\">.
