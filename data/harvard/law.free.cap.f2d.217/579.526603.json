Under these contracts Western Union agrees to and does assign to the respective companies all telegraph messages to certain geographical areas specifically routed by the sender via Western Union Cables. Western Union receives as a fee for these services a compensation in excess of that normally charged for landline services. These fees, originally a flat sum per period, and now a fixed sum per word, are not related to the cost encountered by Western Union in performing these contractual obligations. The geographical areas encompassed by these agreements, the Pacific and Central America areas, are those which Western Union has not itself serviced at any time, since it has no facilities to render such service.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission over these contracts stems from that Commission\u2019s approval in 1943 of the merger of Western Union and Postal Telegraph, Inc., pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222. 10 F.C.C. 148. In connection with this merger the Commission undertook the statutory responsibility of insuring that the ensuing domestic telegraph monopoly would not discriminate between international telegraph carriers. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(e). It approved a Formula for the Distribution of Outbound International Traffic,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> proposed by the carriers themselves, for equitable allocation of all international telegraph traffic emanating from the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tinental United States. 10 F.C.C. 184. Under this, quotas were allotted to interested carriers by geographical areas, in accordance with their activities and facilities in the base year 1942. Quota fulfillment was to be computed by addition of routed to unrouted messages handled by the carrier, in order to reduce the incentive to get specific routings, which were, however, to be respected. Periodic instructions from the International Quota Bureau to Western Union informed it of the necessary allocations of unrouted traffic to achieve the contemplated equalization. In addition, the Formula explicitly permitted two companies, Press Wireless, Inc., and RCA Communications, Inc., to receive all messages specifically routed to them in certain areas without quota.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Despite the fact that Western Union has no quotas and is not listed as entitled to messages without quota in the areas involved in the disputed contracts, petitioners claim that these contracts are valid under a clause in the Formula which provides: \u201cAnything in this formula to the contrary notwithstanding, the Merged Company and each international carrier shall respect specific rout-ings of any messages handled by it, and shall transfer to another carrier any messages specifically routed via such other carrier.\u201d Petitioners read this provision to override all contrary allocations elsewhere in the Formula; the intervening carriers disagree, and so did the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of a Formula adopted and approved by it after careful consideration' \u2014 like other administrative regulations of a responsible governmental agency \u2014 is entitled to great weight if not so unnatural or unreasonable as to ensnare and entrap those governed by it. Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700; Danielson v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 2 Cir., 204 F.2d 266; Crowley\u2019s Milk Co. v. Brannan, 2 Cir., 198 F.2d 861; Fleet-Wing Corp. v. Clark, Em.App., 166 F.2d 145. The Commission did not err in construing the Formula in the light of the statutory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>vision which was its authorization. All that was said in Tobin v. Edward S. Wagner Co., 2 Cir., 187 F.2d 977, on which petitioners so heavily rely, is that general statutory principles cannot be relied on to fill a gap in administrative regulations. We did not purport to lay down a general rule preventing administrators from interpreting their regulations to harmonize with the goals of statutory policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cThe quotas established pursuant to sections IV and VI hereof with respect to each category shall be applied by the Merged Company as follows: all the outbound traffic (routed and unrouted) in such category, handled by the Merged Company, except</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>In this case we find the Commission\u2019s interpretation not only reasonable, but also persuasive on the merits. A Formula like the one before us clearly must be read as an integrated whole. There are several persuasive reasons for refusing to accept petitioners\u2019 reading of the clause upon which they focus. Any clause in the nature of a proviso is always strictly construed. Shilkret v. Musicraft Records, 2 Cir., 131 F.2d 929, certiorari denied Musicraft Records v. Shilkret, 319 U.S. 742, 63 S.Ct. 1030, 87 L.Ed. 1699. And petitioners\u2019 interpretation renders superfluous the explicit permission in later sections of the Formula to RCA Communications and Press Wireless to handle their expressly routed traffic without quotas. Petitioners argue that the opportunities given to these two companies were meant to be left open for all other comers into new areas where they were not interested in 1942. It is ridiculous to suppose that the Formula contemplated strict surveillance of contemporary competition without also intending to limit the dangers of Western Union Cables expansion in the future. The provision for equalization of traffic through corrective distribution of unrouted messages was the heart of the Formula and its application would be seriously undercut by acceptance of petitioners\u2019 tactics as legitimate. Furthermore, petitioners\u2019 position cannot really be justified as a proper sacrifice to the wishes of the customer. Often a sender chooses cable service as a means of insuring greater secrecy for his message ; but under the contracts here, this wish is not respected, for while Western Union offers a cable service, Globe and Tropical do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Petitioners urge that their reading of the Formula must be correct because it has been advocated in the past by several of the carriers here involved as in-tervenors. Even if true, such past actions would be no more persuasive than Western Union\u2019s own position to the contrary in the years preceding these contracts, when Western Union considered such messages as unrouted. But actually the companies involved claimed their own routed messages only to areas in which they were, in terms of the Formula, \u201cinterested.\u201d Moreover, one of the in-tervenors, Commercial Pacific Cable Company, has consistently repudiated petitioners\u2019 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Petitioners further claim that the Commission erroneously failed to distinguish between its landlines and its overseas divisions. They contend that the contracts here in question were entered into solely by the Western Union Cables and were thus not governed by either the Formula or 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(e) regulating the activities of the merged landlines carrier. This argument is ingenious, but unpersuasive. Subsection (4) of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(e), on which petitioners rely, unless limited as the Commission suggests to the allocation of quotas, would permit Western Union effectively to escape all of the contemplated regulation. In all operating realities, Western Union Telegraph Company encompasses the activities of Western Union Cables, which in legal effect is but the name given to Western Union\u2019s international operations. The international and the domestic components of the company file one consolidated tariff with the Commission. Profits from the contracts in question were considered revenue to the company as a whole. In the absence of a demonstration by Western Union of any managerial or accounting division of its two components, the international and the domestic, the Commission could reasonably attribute the illegal contracts to the organization as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Apart from the illegality of these agreements under the Formula, the Commission also suggested that the exorbitant contract prices might in themselves violate 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(e). The fees paid Western Union under these arrangements are vastly in excess of the charges assessed by other carriers for the performance of similar services. We agree also with this conclusion of the Commission; these fees, the result of mere horse-trading, as petitioners\u2019 witnesses conceded, were neither just nor reasonable nor in accord with the uniform standard of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The orders of the Commission are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-12\">.
