The accused and the government\u2019s attorney stipulated that the-only issue presented to this court was-that arising from the admission by the trial court of the testimony of the divorced wife of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-29\">Although the record does not indicate that the questioned testimony was objected to on the specific ground of privileged communication between husband and wife,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> both the accused and the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ernment have treated the matter in this light and we shall consider it in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">It will thus be seen that what is objected to is testimony by,a former wife not as to a conversation between her husband and herself, but between her husband and a third party. The record further discloses that the conversation was not made in the privacy of the home or under circumstances that surround it with any of the indicia of confidentiality as between husband and wife, for not only was it made with a third person, but also it was made in the presence of others. The proof of this latter fact, ,in the form in which it was received,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would be incompetent had it not been made on cross-examination by appellant\u2019s counsel. As it is, the court and jury must consider it as being properly in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">As stated above, appellant did not clearly state to the trial court the precise basis for the privilege claimed. The same is the situation here. However, since the appellant cites several cases in which there is raised the issue as to the right of the accused in a criminal case to prevent the testimony of a former wife as to conversations or communications with him, we assume that the basis of appellant\u2019s appeal is that he claims the court below erred in not recognizing such a right. See Blau v. United States, 340 U.S. 332, 71 S.Ct. 301, 95 L.Ed. 306, and Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 74 S.Ct. 358. Appellant concedes that divorce removes the baa\u201d of incompetency which would be available if the marriage had not been dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">There are two answers to this contention. The first is that the testimony here was not as to a conversation with the wife, it was rather as to an act, 1. e. a telephone conversation to which the wife was not a party. The Supreme Court stated in the Pereira case, 347 U. S. 1, 6, 74 S.Ct. 358, 361: \u201cThe privilege, generally, extends only to utterances, and not to acts [Wigmore, Evidence] \u00a7 2337. A review of Mrs. Joyce\u2019s testimony reveals that it involved primarily statements made in the presence of Brading or Miss Joyner, or both, acts of Pereira <em>which did not amount to communications, </em>* * [Emphasis supplied.] The discussion in Wigmore, referred to in this quotation, says: \u201cThe privilege has for its object the security from apprehension of disclosure, \u2014 a security in consequence of which confidences will be freely given and not withheld. The pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>tection therefore extends only to <em>communications, </em>i. - e. utterances, not <em>acts.\u201d </em>This clearly refers to communications or utterances to the wife and not a communications or utterance to another. Testimony as to such a communication to another is as to an act rather than as to a communication between husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The second answer is that, even if the general rule appli\u00e9s to a situation where the wife overheard a conversation between her husband and' another on the.theory that this amounted to a communication between husband and wife, there is an exception to the rule where the communication is not really confidential. This point is also touched upon in the Pereira case, 347 U.S. 1, 6, 74 S.Ct. 358, 361,'where the court says: \u201cAlthough marital communications, are presumed to be confidential, that presumption may be overcome by proof of facts showing that they 'were not intended to be private. Blau v. United States, 340 U.S. 332, 71 S.Ct. 301, 95 L.Ed. 306; Wolfie v. United States, 291 U.S. 7, 54 S. Ct. 279, 78 L.Ed. 617. The presence of a third party negatives the presumption of privacy. Wigmore, Eyid\u00e9nce, \u00a7 2336. So too, the intention that the information conveyed be transmitted to a third person. Id., \u00a7 2336.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Cle\u00e1rly here there was a communication with \u00e1 third 'person, and this would rebut the presumption of privacy. In point of fact, since the act about which the wife testified was the communication to the third person, it is even clearer that there was no issue here as to the right of the husband to confide freely to his wife, because that is not what he was attempting . to do. Finally, there is the testimony from which the jury could conclude that there was no effort, to keep the conversation'with the third party away from the ears' of even the employe\u00e9s' of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We knovv of no. rule of evidence, and we know of no public policy that would support such rule if it should be put forward, that gives an accused such privilege as is here claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The trial court having committed no error in admitting' the evidence complained of, the judgment is therefore Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-19\">. \u201cQ.
