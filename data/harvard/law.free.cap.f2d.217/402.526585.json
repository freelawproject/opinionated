This construction, which can be pre-fabricat-ed as a unit, is a basic square or rectangular metal frame with a top and two sides which fits over the wooden curbing of the roof opening. The inner side of the frame extends slightly above the level of the top side of the frame so as to provide a condensation gutter. The top or covering member of the frame joins both sides and then continues outwardly on a horizontal plane to form a marginal flange. On top of this basic frame there is set an elliptic plastic dome with an outwardly projecting base flange coextensive with the horizontal flange of the frame. The dome and frame are joined on these flanges by passing bolts through aligned holes in these flanges; the holes in the plastic being slightly larger in diameter than the bolts so as to allow for the expansion and contraction of the plastic.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-24\"> The district court in holding that the patent is invalid for want of invention stated that \u201c * * * practically every element in the plaintiff\u2019s patent was taken directly from the prior art and those that were not (if there are any) were either suggested by the prior art or else were devised by the patentee as unstartling routine solutions to problems incident to the use of the materials incorporated in the plaintiff\u2019s patent.\u201d An element which did not appear in previous skylight construction as disclosed in the references cited by the defendant was \u201c * * * the expedient of locating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the fastening means on flanges exterior to and outside of the curb of the skylight opening * * * \u201d so as to prevent water from seeping into the interior of the building. The district court stated that \u201cThis expedient, satisfactory and useful as it is, still appears to be the type of solution which one might expect from the ordinary skilled mechanic and does not rise to the dignity of invention.\u201d \u201cThe question whether an improvement requires mere mechanical skill or the exercise of the faculty of invention, is one of fact * * * Thomson Spot Welder Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 1924, 265 U.S. 445, 446, 44 S.Ct. 533, 534, 68 L.Ed. 1098. \u201cFindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous * * * .\u201d Rule 52, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C. O\u2019Brien v. O\u2019Brien, 7 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 254; Red Devil Tools v. Hyde Mfg. Co., 1 Cir., 1951, 193 F.2d 491; B. F. Sturtevant Co. v. Massachusetts Hair &amp; Felt Co., 1 Cir., 1941, 122 F.2d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"> It was never the object of the patent laws to grant a monopoly \u201c * * * for every trifling device, every shadow of a shade of an idea, which would naturally and spontaneously occur to any skilled mechanic or operator in the ordinary progress of manufactures.\u201d Atlantic Works v. Brady, 1882, 107 U.S. 192, 200, 2 S.Ct. 225, 231, 27 L.Ed. 438. See Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 1950, 340 U.S. 147, 71 S.Ct. 127, 95 L.Ed. 162.

Co., 3 Cir., 1953, 203 F.2d 846, certiorari denied 346 U.S. 818, 74 S.Ct. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
