On a prior appeal this court held that industrial homeworkers employed by defendant were covered by the Act, but not by the regulations then in effect. Tobin v. Edward S. Wagner Co., 2 Cir., 187 F.2d 977. Subsequent to that decision the regulations were amended to their present form. Judge Galston has found that the defendant\u2019s operations fall within the amended regulations and that the regulations were propei\u2019ly promulgated under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(a). D.C.E.D.N.Y., 115 F. Supp. 118. We see no reason to overturn his well-reasoned conclusions. While there was no advance notice of the amendment, yet that was not necessary, both because of its nature as an \u201cinterpretative\u201d rule and because of the Administrator\u2019s finding of \u201cgood cause\u201d for immediate action, based upon the fact that other employers in general were complying with . this interpretation of the Act and defendant had long known of the view held by the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
