Judge Ryan\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s conception, Atoman, was neither original nor infringed by defendant\u2019s independently produced movie, Atom Man v. Superman, is supported by substantial evidence, Darrell v. Joe Morris Music Co., 2 Cir., 113 F.2d 80, and is in accord with prior decisions of this court. Arnstein v. Edward B. Marks Music Corp., 2 Cir., 82 F.2d 275; Warner Bros. Pictures v. Majestic Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 310. We also concur in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s disclosures to defendants concerning Atoman were not made in circumstances of implied contract or trust so as to support an action for unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> Plaintiff\u2019s only new allegation \u2022on this appeal is his contention of prejudicial hostility on the part of the trial judge. The basis alleged for such prejudice is too trivial to warrant further consideration, and the judge\u2019s conduct of the trial was proper. Plaintiff refused several opportunities before the announcement of the decision to ask for a mistrial. The judge\u2019s active interrogation of witnesses in this non-jury trial was within his discretion. Bissonette v. National Biscuit Co., 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 1003; Pariser v. City of New York, 2 Cir., 146 F.2d 431, 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
