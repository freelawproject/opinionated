United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127; Friedberg v. United States, 348 U.S. 142, 75 S.Ct. 138; Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 147, 75 S.Ct. 194; and United States v. Calderon, 348 U.S. 160, 75 S.Ct. 186; it is plain, in the light of those cases, that the contention is without merit. For it is settled in them and in the opinion of this court in Dupree v. United States, 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 781, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201c * * * This contention stems from the erroneous belief that Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41] restricts proof in a criminal case to certain formalized methods unless the Government first proves that the books and records kept by the taxpayer are themselves incorrect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\"><em>\u201cA </em>prosecution for income tax evasion is not an effort by the Government to compute income tax at all. It is an effort by the Government to prove that the taxpayer failed to compute it honestly. There is nothing in this Section nor in any other applicable statute that restricts the Government in the method of proving this fact if it exists. * * <em>*\u00bb </em>Dupree v. United States, supra.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">To maintain their second point, that the court erred in rejecting petitioners\u2019 testimony, that they had $52,-000 in undeposited cash at the beginning date of the net worth computation, petitioners were confronted below, not only with the necessity of overcoming difficulties inherent in the task of inducing the trier to accept as credible the bizarre, indeed, in some aspects fantastic account of the manipulations and the hoarding or hiding places of this cash, but also with the burden of overcoming the prima facies of the commissioner\u2019s determination. If the taxpayers\u2019 testimony had required the acceptance of their claim only that, engaged for many years in an illicit, indeed an actively forbidden business where stealth and secrecy were essential to survival, they acquired by stealth and kept by more stealth a considerable accumulation of illgotten gains, the going might not have been so difficult. When, however, as here, the tale is embellished with so many fantastic particulars, evidencing a rashness and recklessness in choosing the custodians and places of custody for this large amount of illegal cash, the demands upon credulity pass all reasonable bounds, and the claim in effect that the Tax Court was compelled, or even ought to have accepted the story, must and will be rejected by us out of hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Upon its third position, that commissioner and Tax Court erroneously included in the net worth computation for the year ending October, 1946, as a cash asset, a sum of $12,783.35 as gambling cash on hand, we think it clear that petitioners stand in much better case. Indeed we are of the opinion that the uncontradicted testimony in regard to this item completely supports the taxpayer\u2019s contention that, instead of being cash on hand in October, 1946, the true explanation of the entry, on which commissioner and Tax Court based their determination, is that it was a debit-cash income from games. This is shown by the testimony of the certified public accountant, by the journal entry 45, through which this figure was first brought into the books, reading \u201cDebit-cash item from games, $12,783.35\u201d, by the net income from games, shown on petitioner\u2019s tax returns for the year ending September 30, 1946, $12,615.32, and by other evidence in the case which completely rebuts the fiating of the commissioner and of the government witness. Cf. U. S. v. Caserta, 3 Cir., 199 F.2d 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 attack upon the item and the taxes for 1946 is sustained, and the determination of the commissioner and the finding of the Tax Court as to this item and this year are, therefore, rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">When it comes to taxpayers\u2019 fourth and last question, whether the evidence supports the fraud assessments, while it follows from what has been said just above that it does not support such an assessment for the year 1946, as to the other years the matter stands differently. As the Tax Court states in its opinion and as the record shows, with the exception of the $12,000 item above discussed, petitioners agree in the main with respondent\u2019s computation as to their net worth at the end of the fiscal year 1946, though they, of course, account for part of it as attributable to the $52,000 cash which petitioners claim to have had on hand at the beginning of the net worth period. We have disapproved the action of commissioner and Tax Court with regard to the $12,000 item, and the position of petitioners, that there was a failure to prove fraud as to the year 1946, is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">With respect to the other years, however, while we agree with petitioners that this case is different from many net worth cases involving gambling operations, in that it is undisputed that the taxpayers have kept some records with respect to them and have returned at least some of the income received therefrom, we cannot agree with them that the decision as to them must be reversed. In view of the undisputed facts as to petitioners\u2019 net worth and of the lameness of their explanation as to the $52,-000 cash on hand, on which they rely to escape the charge of fraudulently withholding a part of their income, we are unable to say that the Tax Court\u2019s findings of fraud as to those years are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">As to the years 1943, 1944 and 1945, the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed. As to the year 1946, it is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-17\">. 12 T.C.M. 954.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"pAUu\"> These are: for the Tear ended Sept. 30 Deficiency Additions to tax for fraud</p>\n<p id=\"AEW\">Earl Kite 1943 $3,054.01 $1,035.69</p>\n<p id=\"Adn\">1944 4,276.92 1,845.29</p>\n<p id=\"Aja\">1945 7,496.58 3,748.29</p>\n<p id=\"Aaf\">1946 2,891.36 1,445.68</p>\n<p id=\"AO2\">Mary B.

The Tax Court found that petitioners were husband and wife, engaged in several income-producing activities as equal partners; that they operated a retail whiskey business under the name of Kite\u2019s Bar, an illegal gambling operation, an apartment house, a riding stable and a fishing boat; that petitioners received income from each of these activities; that the books and records pertaining to the operation of the bar were set up and maintained by certified public accountants and that the books and records pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to the other operations were maintained by Mary Kite or the employee in charge of the particular operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The Tax Court pointed out that the records reflecting the income from the gambling operations merely showed total figures for each day\u2019s activities and did not itemize the receipts and expenditures; that the original memoranda from which the totals were obtained were destroyed; and that although petitioners needed a great deal of cash on hand in the operation of the gambling activities, no record of cash on hand was kept. In addition, the Tax Court found that the records pertaining to the apartments, the riding stables, and the charter boat \u201cwere likewise fragmentary and incomplete\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The Tax Court did not point out any omissions of income or errors contained in the books and records in support of the finding that they were \u201cfragmentary and incomplete\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The Tax Court specifically held that, \u201cThe large discrepancy between tho net income reported and the cost of the assets acquired, plus the living expenses, in our opinion, justified the inference that the records kept did not accurately reflect the true income from such outside activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Based upon these findings, the Tax Court held that the respondent properly determined the income of the petitioners by the increase in net worth method.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The Tax Court rejected in its entirety petitioners\u2019 testimony in respect to unde-posited cash on hand on October 1, 1942, the beginning date of the respondent\u2019s net worth computations, labeling such testimony \u201cfantastic and unrealistic\u201d, and saying that, \u201cNo oral testimony or documentary proof was presented tending to corroborate the testimony of the petitioners as to the existence of this unde-posited cash.\u201d In addition, the Tax Court said that the failure to file intangible tax returns with the State of Florida \u201cleads to the assumption\u201d that the petitioners did not have undeposited cash on hand at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The Tax Court held that the petitioners had not carried their burden of proving that the amount of $12,783.35 for cash on hand was improperly included in the respondent\u2019s computation of net worth for the taxable year ended Sept. 30, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">As to the assessment of the 50% fraud penalties, the Tax Court admitted that the record was devoid of any direct evidence as to any specific item of unreported income but said, \u201cthe respondent\u2019s computations on a net worth basis * * * disclose a large discrepancy between the income actually reported and the cost of new assets acquired plus personal living: expenses,\u201d and that \u201cthe illegal operations, the consistent concealment of large sums of cash, and the repeated understatement of income lead us to the conclusion that the 50% additions to tho tax for fraud should be sustained.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\">. As petitioners present them, the questions involved are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-14\">(1) Whether the respondent\u2019s application of the increase in net worth and expenditures method of computing income was justified, the petitioners having shown that they kept books and records for each of their income-producing activities, and tho respondent having made no attempt to discredit the petitioners\u2019 books and records either by introducing evidence of specific omissions or income, or evidence of tampering with the books, or evidence of income sources not covered by the petitioners\u2019 books and records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-15\">(2) Whether the Tax Court erred in sustaining the respondent\u2019s net worth computation showing no cash in existence at the beginning date, petitioners\u2019 testimony that they had $52,000.00 in unde-posited cash at that time being uncontra-dicted, and tho fact of petitioners\u2019 having a large amount of cash being supported and corroborated by tho testimony of disinterested witnesses and other evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-16\">(3) Whether tho Tax Court erred in sustaining respondent\u2019s net worth computation, including a cash asset item as of the closing date, it appearing that inclusion of such cash item was based solely upon an entry made in the taxpayers\u2019 books, and the taxpayers\u2019 certified public accountant having testified that such entry was erroneous in that it treated an income item as an asset item.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-17\">(4) Whether the Tax Court erred in sustaining respondent\u2019s assessment of 50% fraud penalties, the record being devoid of any direct evidence as to any specific item of unreported income.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b639-18\">.
