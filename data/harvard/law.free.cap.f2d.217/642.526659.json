J., and ALLEN and STEWART, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b694-19\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b694-20\">This is an appeal from a judgment entered upon a directed verdict for appel-lee in the district court in appellant\u2019s suit for personal injuries brought under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-21\">The appellant was injured when he stumbled over a rail and fell while crossing the appellee\u2019s tracks in the course of his employment. He contends it was error not to submit to the jury the question of whether appellee failed to use reasonable care to provide a reasonably safe place to work, by permitting a one-quarter to one-half inch flange-like protrusion on the section of rail where he fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-22\">We recognize that the authority of courts by direction of a verdict to withdraw from the consideration of a jury the question of defendant\u2019s negligence in a Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act case \u201cis now very restricted indeed.\u201d Keith v. Wheeling <em>&amp; </em>L. E. Ry. Co., 6 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 654, 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-23\">Nevertheless, negligence remains the sole basis of liability under that statute. Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 1943, 318 U.S. 54, 63 S.Ct. 444, 87 L.Ed. 610. We think the district court was not in error in directing a verdict for appellee upon the evidence in this case. There was \u201ca complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion\u201d of negligence. Lavender v. Kurn, 1946, 327 U.S. 645, 66 S.Ct. 740, 90 L.Ed. 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-24\">The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
