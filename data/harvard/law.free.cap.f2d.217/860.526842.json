Obery, appellant herein, was convicted of robbery, after trial in the District Court. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2901 (1951).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">On appeal his first claim is that his conviction was improper because the trial court did not give to the jury a cautionary instruction that \u201cthey must find the circumstances of the identification [of the accused as the criminal] were convincing, otherwise they must acquit * * No such instruction, however, was requested at the trial by appellant\u2019s then counsel. Normally, failure to give an instruction not requested does not constitute reversible error. Fed. Rules Crim.Proc. rule 30, 18 U.S.C.A.; see Villaroman v. United States, 1950, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 240, 184 F.2d 261, 21 A.L.R.2d 1074. Appellant argues that nevertheless, under the rule in Tatum v. United States, 1951, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 388-389, 190 F.2d 612, 614-615, he is entitled to \u201cinstructions which relate to his theory of the case and which will protect his substantial rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-19\"> <em>Tatum, </em>of course, was based on the established rule that the trial court must instruct on \u201c \u2018all essential questions of law involved in the case * * \u201d 88 U.S.App.D.C. at page 389, 190 F.2d at page 615. There is no essential question of law here as to which the court failed to instruct the jury. And if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the rule in Tatum extends to any crucial issue either of law or of fact of a sort with which the jury cannot properly deal without a particularized instruction from the court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> no such issue is here presented. The court\u2019s instructions, though general, ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>quately guided the jury in its task of weighing the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">We note, too, that the testimony identifying appellant as the criminal was credible and strong. At the trial, the complaining witness identified the appellant by recognizing him as the man who had robbed her at an earlier time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The witness Harold Jones testified that he had seen appellant immediately after the crime in an alley behind the establishment of the complaining witness, in the same clothes described by the complaining witness as those worn by appellant, and had recognized appellant as a man observed by him in his own neighborhood and known by the nickname of \u201cMoose.\u201d Appellant admitted to being known by that nickname. Furthermore, it appeared without denial that the appellant told the police, shortly after his arrest, that he had committed the crime. Thus the jury could readily conclude that appellant\u2019s identification was established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the court should have given an instruction that the oral confession made by the appellant to the police should be regarded with caution. Here, again, no such instruction was requested at the trial. A similar question was recently answered by this court, on facts not materially different from those at bar. Jackson v. United States, 1952, 91 U.S.App. D.C. 60, 198 F.2d 497, certiorari denied, 344 U.S. 858, 73 S.Ct. 96, 97 L.Ed. 666. We there said: \u201cWhile the cautionary instruction should have been given, * * the omission, in the circumstances of this case, was not such plain error \u2018affecting substantial rights\u2019 as leads us to reverse.\u201d The same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Appellant also complains of certain of the statements made by the prosecuting attorney in his summation to the jury. His attorney made objection to them, and moved for a mistrial. The motion was denied, but thereafter the prosecution\u2019s tone was moderated. Later, the court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury. Our reading of the record does not lead us to conclude that \u201cmisconduct was pronounced and persistent,\u201d Berger v. United States, 1935, 295 U.S. 78, 89, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314, so as to result in reversible error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"ajo-dedup-1\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-22\">. The indictment also relied on Section 22-3202 of the D.C.Code (\u201ccrimes of violence\u201d), and appellant was sentenced in accordance with that statute. Later, for reasons parallel to those stated in Thomas v. United States, 1954, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 210 F.2d 21, the case was remanded to the District Court for re-sentencing under Section 22-2901 of the D.C.Code. Order of this court of September 3, 1953 (Misc. No. 276). After a new sentence had been imposed by the District Court. the appeal came on for hearing on the merits,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aet\">. Cf. Lewis v. United States, 1 Cir., 3924, 295 F. 441, 447: \u201c * * * no party can require the court, in effect, to argue his case by giving rulings based on a part only of the evidence * * *.\u201d Certio-rari denied. 1924, 265 U.S. 594, 44 S.Ct. 636, 68 L.Ed. 1197.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b914-6\">. The charge said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">\u201cThe law is that this defendant is presumed to be innocent. The burden of proof is upon the Government to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Unless the Government sustains this burden and proves beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant has committed every element of the offense charged, then you on the jury must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-9\">\u201cIn determining whether the Government has established the charge against this defendant you must consider and weigh the testimony of all of the witnesses who have appeared before you. You are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses. In other words, you must determine what witnesses to believe and to what extent to believe them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-10\">The content of these instructions seems in itself sufficient to distinguish this case from McKenzie v. United States, 1942, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 126 F.2d 533, on which appellant relies. Other distinguishing factors are that in the McKenzie case the conviction rested largely on the testimony of the complaining witness, without substantial supporting evidence; there was no confession, but a strong case for the defense; the instructions were erroneous and imprecise, and amounted to an invitation to the jury to guess or speculate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b914-15\">.
