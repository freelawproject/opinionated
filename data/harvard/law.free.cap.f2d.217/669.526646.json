Randle the sum of $5,000 against the District of Columbia as damages for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained because of the local government\u2019s failure to maintain a sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition. A metal pole or standard for a traffic sign, which had stood in the unpaved area surrounding a tree growing in the sidewalk, had been sawed off. The plaintiff\u2019s ankle was broken when she stumbled on the remaining portion of the pole or standard which was somewhat higher than the surface of the ground in which it was embedded.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">On this appeal by the District we have carefully considered the record and find no error which seems to us sufficient to require the jury\u2019s verdict to be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
