The denial of Colonial\u2019s application was based upon its default before the hearing examiner in establishing ' its minimum qualifications. Having failed to meet the burden imposed upon it pursuant to Section 309(b) of the Communications Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Colonial lacked entitlement to contest in a comparative hearing the qualifications of WCAX or otherwise to dispute the favorable action of the Commission upon the latter\u2019s application. See Simmons v. Federal Communications Commission, 1944, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 264, 145 F.2d 578. Other contentions fall short of disclosing a denial of procedural due process.
