Boen, 10 Cir., 194 F.2d 405; for the fact that appellant was subject to the terms of a state parole did not exempt him from being taken by the Federal Government where no objection was made by the paroling State.

Squier, 9 Cir., 150 F.2d 3;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-22\">And it appearing that the failure of appellant\u2019s attorney to subpoena certain witnesses and his advice that he could not subpoena such witnesses, if erroneous, does not entitle appellant to vacate the prior judgment and to withdraw his plea of guilty. Parrino v. United States, 2 Cir., 212 F.2d 919, certiorari denied 75 S.Ct. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">And it appearing that the files and records of the court conclusively show that appellant is entitled to no relief, Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255;</p>\n<p id=\"b185-24\">It is ordered that the order of the District Court be and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
