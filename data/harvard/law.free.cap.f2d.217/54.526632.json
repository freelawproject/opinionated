The ground of the motion is that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Section 2 of Public Law 610, 81st Congress, 38 U.S.C.A.Reg.No. 1(A), Part VIII, Paragraph 11,) which created the Veterans Education Appeals Board provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">\u201cSuch Board shall be subject, in respect to hearings, appeals, and all other actions and qualifications, to the provisions of sections 5 to 11, inclusive, of the Administrative Procedure Act, approved June 11, 1946, as amended. The decision of such Board with respect to all matters shall constitute the final administrative determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009, provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">\u201cSec. 10. Except so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">\u201c(a) Right of review. \u2014 Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute, shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-15\">\u201c(b) Form and venue of action.\u2014 The form of proceeding for judicial review shall be any special statutory review proceeding relevant to the subject matter in any court specified by statute or, in the absence or inadequacy thereof, any applicable form of legal action * * * in any court of competent jurisdiction. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-17\">\u201c(c) Reviewable acts. \u2014 Every agency action made reviewable by statute and every final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in any court shall be subject to judicial review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-19\">\u201c(d) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-20\">\"(e) Scope of review. \u2014 So far as necessary to decision and where presented the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of any agency action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-21\">* * \u2022* \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-22\">The Administrator does not contend that the Administrative Procedure Act gives Schools no right at all to review, but contends solely that such jurisdiction does not exist in this court. It is apparent that the legislation creating the Veterans Administration provides no particular body in which a review may be had and that power to review, if any, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>must be based on the .Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The latter Act\u2019s pertinent provision is the one cited above, that is that \u201cAny person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action * * * shall be entitled to judicial review thereof * * * in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">It may be claimed that a district court has competent jurisdiction to entertain a suit by Schools for a declaratory judgment on its claim, disputed by the Administrator, as to the validity of the decision. If this contention be valid, which we do not determine, a court of appeals has no jurisdiction otherwise than by appeal from the judgment of the district court in such an action. 28 U.S.C. 1292, 1293. As said in A. F. of L. v. National Labor Relations Board, 308 U.S. 401, 404, 60 S.Ct. 300, 302, 84 L.Ed. 347, in construing a predecessor act, \u201cThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia [70 App.D.C. 62, 103 F.2d 933], like the several circuit courts of appeals, is without the jurisdiction over original suits conferred on district courts by \u00a7 24 of the Judicial Code, as amended. * * * Such jurisdiction as it has, to review directly the action of administrative agencies, is specially conferred by legislation relating specifically to the determinations of such agencies made subject to review, and prescribing the manner and extent of review.\u201d Cf. Sumi v. Young, 9 Cir., 83 F.2d 752; Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, 319 U. S. 21, 63 S.Ct. 938, 87 L.Ed. 1185; Credit Bureau of San Diego v. Petra-sich, 9 Cir., 97 F.2d 65; Cole v. Rust-gard, 9 Cir., 68 F.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">It further appears that the official residence of the Administrator is in Washington, D. C. Since the Administrator has appeared only to contest the jurisdiction and has not appeared generally, it is apparent we cannot obtain jurisdiction in personam over him. See Blackmar v. Guerre, 342 U.S. 512, at page 516, 72 S.Ct. 410, at page 412, 96 L.Ed. 534, where the Supreme Court said, in a similar case in which it construed the term \u201ccompetent jurisdiction\u201d of Section 1009, supra, \u201cThe courts of the District of Columbia are the only courts of \u2018competent jurisdiction\u2019 t\u00f3 reach the members of the Civil Service Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The motion to dismiss on the ground of absence of jurisdiction to consider the petition of Schools is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
