The seaman was under articles at the time and was answerable generally to the call of duty. The injury occurred in his and the ship\u2019s home port, and for that reason the shipowner contends that the decree was erroneous. '</p>\n<p id=\"b697-18\">The current trend of authority is to the contrary, as the district judge adequately pointed out in his opinion, 108 F.Supp. 946. Since we are in agreement with the trend, no good purpose would be served by adding our comments to the wealt1' of learning on the subject,</p>\n<p id=\"b697-19\">' Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
