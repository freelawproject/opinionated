Its purpose was to obtain for the petitioners an option to purchase the stock of the reorganized corporation appropriated to the payment of the secured creditors of the American Fuel &amp; Power Company, the petitioners conceiving that successful operation by the trustee had substantially increased the value of Inland\u2019s assets over that originally determined by the District Court. After full hearing, wherein the petition was opposed by committees representing the security holders of the debtors, the trustee of Inland and Kentucky Fuel, and disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the District Court, finding no merit in the effort of American\u2019s common stockholders to capture any residual equity that may exist in Inland\u2019s assets, so long as creditors are unsatisfied, entered an order, on the 7th day of September, 1954, dismissing the joint petition, Whereupon, the petitioners appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On November 16, 1954, the Green Committee, acting for the note-holders of American, moved this court to docket the appeal and to dismiss it as frivolous, a sham, and without merit, or, in the alternative, to advance the cause to an early date for \u25a0 argument, with or without briefs. All of the objectors below have filed memoranda in support of the motion to docket and dismiss, which we have carefully reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">In the Matter of Inland Gas Corporation, 6 Cir., 211 F.2d 381, we gave approval to the amended plan of reorganization adopted by the District Court. We cited the long history of the proceed* ings, the numerous appeals reviewed by us and held that \u201cin so far as the percentage assigned to American is not now needed for complete liquidation of its secured obligations, it is now available to Kentucky bondholders.\u201d Throughout our many opinions, it has been made clear that the subordination of the Columbia claims was for the benefit of the security-holders of American Fuel and Kentucky Fuel, and that until the debts to both were satisfied, there was no occasion to consider any stockholder interest in either. We declined also to direct a new evaluation of Inland assets. We see nothing to be gained except delay in further hearing or argument. The issue is clear. The appeal is without merit and it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
