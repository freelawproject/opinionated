D.C. Code, \u00a7 2-101 et seq. (1951). Application was made to them by appellant Wendel for a license to practice naturo-pathy. He relied on a diploma awarded him by the National Board of Naturo-pathic Examiners.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission notified Wendel that it had decided not to accept his application, for the reason that there was more than one national examining board in naturopathy. It added that \u201cuntil such time as the naturo-pathic profession has only one official national examining board,\u201d the Commission would not accept applications for naturopathic licenses from persons relying on diplomas. Appellant brought suit in the District Court against the Commission seeking a mandatory injunction and a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s answer to the complaint was that there were two alleged national examining boards in the field of naturopathy; that the Commission was without power and authority to make a determination as to which one was representative of the profession; that the Commission\u2019s decision to refrain from making such a determination was within its complete discretion; that the controversy was properly one for judicial determination in a suit between the two boards; and that the granting or not of licenses to practice in one of the branches of the healing art on the basis of a diploma issued by a national examining board is discretionary and not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>viewable by the courts. The District Court granted the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">It appears from the record that there are two bodies describing themselves as national examining boards in naturopathy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not consider, however, that the Commission is justified in its conclusion that it is without power and authority to grant a license upon a certificate merely because there appear to be two national examining boards. The governing statute, after all, speaks of \u201ca\u201d national examining board, not \u201cthe\u201d board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the statute tells the Commission it may grant a license upon a certificate from \u201ca national examining board\u201d it surely means that the Commission can determine whether the signatory upon a certificate presented by an applicant is or is not a national examining board. And this is true whether it is alleged by someone that there is only one such board or that there are several in a given profession. A mere allegation that there are two such boards does not deprive the Commission of power to issue any license. In our view the Commission has ample power in the premises.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">We think the Commission should reconsider appellant\u2019s application and take a position based upon the authority which it does possess rather than upon alleged lack of authority. Furthermore, we think that even assuming the Commission to have broad discretionary power to require an applicant to take a local examination rather than to admit him by diploma, that would not in itself be a defense to the maintenance of the present litigation. See Perkins v. Elg, 1939, 307 U.S. 325, at pages 349-350, 59 S.Ct. 884, 83 L.Ed. 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">For these reasons the judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. \u201cThe Commission may issue a license, without examination, to anyone holding a certificate or diploma from a national examining board: <em>Provided, </em>That the examination given by the national examining board was as comprehensive and as exhaustive as that required in the District of Columbia. * * * \u201d D.C.Code, \u00a7 2-122a (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-17\">.
