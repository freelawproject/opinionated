Simms, as partners in the ownership and operation of the Center Motion Picture Theatre, sued the corporate appellants along with Clyde G. Darden and W. A. Prewitt, Jr., owners and operators of the Lake Theatre, charging a common conspiracy to monopolize the motion picture business in Greenville, Mississippi, and to restrain trade in the distribution of films, all in alleged violation of the Sherman and Clayton Anti-Trust Acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, it was alleged, inter alia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>that appellees had built an amusement center on the outskirts of Greenville, including the Center Theatre, which they opened February 9, 1947; that at the time three other theatres' were operating in Greenville, Paramount and Delta (by Paramount Gulf) and the Lake (by Dar-den and Prewitt), all of which were in downtown Greenville; that Paramount was the largest but when built Center was larger and more modem than either Delta or Lake; further that all defendants joined immediately in a conspiracy to restrict first-run and second-run films to the exhibitor defendants, to deny them to Center, and to grant unreasonable clearance rights over Center, thereby forcing the latter to close and damaging complainants to the extent of $200,000. They prayed for treble damages of $600,-000 and trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The case was tried intermittently over a period of approximately seven months, with a record of some 5,996 pages in 21 volumes. Defendants moved for a directed verdict at the end of plaintiffs\u2019 case, but the Court reserved <em>ruling </em>until the evidence was completed. Similar motions at the end of the evidence were denied, as were motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and in the alternative for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">A claim against RKO was compromised during the trial for the sum of $10,000 and there was a verdict and judgment for defendants Darden and Prewitt, doing business as Lake Theatre.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Counsel for appellants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> state the issues on this appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201cFirst: Whether there was any substantial evidence of a conspiracy by each appellant with each and every other appellant to deprive plaintiffs of motion pictures for fii-st run in Greenville.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cSecond: Whether there was any substantial evidence that plaintiffs were injured in their business or property as a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid conspiracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The motions for a new trial (on which testimony was taken) (R. 5783, 5941) \u2019raised the following additional questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">\u201cThird: Whether the trial court erred in giving certain instructions and refusing certain instructions requested by the defendants. (All defendants duly objected to the court\u2019s action.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">\u201cFourth: Whether the verdict of the jury acquitting the Lake and holding appellants liable necessitates a new trial, not only with respect to Loew\u2019s, Universal and Columbia, but also with respect to the remaining appellants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">\u201cFifth: Whether the prejudicial and extraneous influences on, and information acquired by, the jury required that there be a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alf\">For the purposes of this decision, these points may be considered under three general headings: (1) failure to direct a verdict for defendants; (2) erroneous charges generally and undue emphasis in dealing with the special requests of plaintiffs as compared to those of appellants by the trial court; and (3) the overruling of a motion for a new trial, which, in addition to alleging insufficiency of the proof, charged misconduct of the jury, information as to the settlement with RKO and rumox\u2019s of offers of compromise by the other defendants gotten to it during the trial. These will be taken up in revei\u2019se order, since what we have to say about the thix-d will have an important bearing on the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">I.- The Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">The trial began on January 30th and ended on September 1st, 1951. It was conducted in an atmosphere undoubtedly friendly to the plaintiffs, as against the non-resident corporations. Most of the latter had been involved as defendants in the well known, nationwide suit by the Government, U. S. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., tried in the first instance by a statutory three-judge court in 1946, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>D.C., 66 F.Supp. 323, without a jury, and, on appeal, affirmed on the conspiracy and monopoly counts by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1948, same title, 334 U.S. 131, 68 S.Ct. 915, 92 L.Ed. 1260, in which the defendants therein were found guilty of violating, in many respects, the same statutes, relied on here, particularly sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The framers of the Federal Constitution believed that citizens of states other than that of plaintiffs would have a better chance of fair treatment in the National Courts, where judges are appointed for life or during good behavior, and were therefore presumably as free from partisanship as was humanly possible to make them. These considerations, combined with the control of the judges in the examination as to qualifications of jurors, their power to comment on the evidence and to advise the jury in the charge as to the relationship of the facts and the law, unquestionably create a situation, especially where a highly penal statute, as in this case, is involved, requiring him to exercise a high degree of care and diligence to see that nothing is done that may add the weight of his position to the inescapable advantage of the local citizen, in trying the case before a jury chosen from the community in which the latter lives and to whom he is usually known.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"> In a protracted trial such as this, with the jurors left free to go and come when not hearing the case, the opportunities to see and evaluate the local litigant as against the large and \u201csoulless\u201d foreign corporation, often produces a favorable attitude toward the complainant, in a damage suit, notwithstanding the honesty and integrity of those performing the important duty of determining the weight of the evidence and the consequent rights of the parties litigant. We who have had long experience with such matters recognize this as one of the weak links in the jury system, al-. though we cherish that system as one of the great pillars in the structure of our free institutions. The ordinary layman,, taken from the private walks of life, may have a sincere desire to do justice between his fellow men; but he is usually a complete stranger to the intricacies of legal problems, and every safeguard possible should be observed to see, first, that he allows nothing but the sworn testimony to influence his decision, and second, that no outside considerations are thrown into the balance to divert his attention from the testimony, in making up his mind. He has to be told that he. is the sole judge of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, and that he has the high privilege, in event of conflict, to determine which he will accept. In a case of this kind, if the jury finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover at all, the statute permits the trebling of the amount as a. penalty, and to that extent, it partakes of the nature of a criminal charge, for which reason, it would seem, the proof should be stronger than in an ordinary civil action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hence, the trial court, should impress upon the jury as clearly as possible the meaning of the phrase \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\"> In view of what has thus been said, it is highly necessary that no outside influence or circumstances should be thrown into the scale to induce a conclusion which otherwise might not be reached. We therefore find it essential to carefully review the record as to the conduct of the jury and such outside matters as could have influenced their verdict, notwithstanding the very thorough consideration which they received at the hands of the lower court. The solution of this question does not require a positive finding that the jury was actually influenced by what took place; but rather involves a determination as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>or not it was made reasonably certain that they were not. See Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140, 13 S.Ct. 50, 36 L.Ed. 917; McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 35 S.Ct. 783, 59 L.Ed. 1300; Southern Pacific Co. v. Klinge, 10 Cir., 65 F.2d 85; Bateman v. Donovan, 9 Cir., 131 F.2d 759; Wheaton v. United States, 8 Cir., 133 F.2d 522; Jorgensen v. York Ice &amp; Machinery Corp., 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 432; Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. v. Imbraguglia, D.C., 73 F.Supp. 909. As stated, the court below reviewed the many incidents complained of, and although being in doubt as to whether the jurors could lawfully be interrogated as to the effect, if any, those incidents may have had upon the verdict, yet he permitted it and found affirmatively that they had none. An appellate court is always reluctant to disagree with the trial judge in such matters, yet it has the duty to see that there is no miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">We quote in the footnote from the court\u2019s analysis and conclusions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The Court found that other than Guido, Rockwood and Delaughter, none of the jurors heard anything about the settlement with RKO and rumored offers to compromise by the other defendants for $75,000 or $100,000 until after the trial, as disclosed by the testimony of the remaining nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">There was also another incident which happened in the Courtroom during the trial on July 10, 1951, in which plaintiff Applebaum winked at Juror Rockwood and the latter smiled back. This was1 noticed by the court itself, the jury was dismissed for the day and the court recited what happened, as appears in the footnote.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All defendants at the time moved for a mistrial, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">We now proceed to review for ourselves the testimony as to the alleged misconduct, efforts of persons outside, and reports of offers by defendants to compromise which reached at least some of the jury during the trial, as alleged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the motion for a new trial. As stated earlier, the court allowed each side to present anything within its knowledge bearing upon these charges, including exhaustive and unrestricted examination of the jurors themselves. It was taken up on October 23rd following the verdict on September 1st, 1951. The first twenty pages in the record on the hearing of this motion, were consumed with objections to the use of jurors as witnesses, arguments, colloquies between the court and counsel, including the statement by those for plaintiffs that defendants had employed private detectives to investigate the charges of misconduct by the jury and who had made written reports. This was followed by a demand that they be furnished to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel before proceeding with the hearing. Counsel for defendants stated they did not have reports present but the court directed them to telephone their offices in New Orleans to send them up so opposing counsel might see them.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">When the first witness was called, and before his testimony began, the Court interrupted to say with respect to objections by counsel for plaintiff, as quoted in the footnote.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Juror Guido: After developing the fact that the witness had been a juror in the case who lived at Vicksburg where it was tried, counsel for defendants asked and the witness answered questions, among others, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cQ. Mr. Guido, while you were a member of the jury and sitting on the jury, and before the case was submitted to the jury for consideration, did at any time there come to you information concerning a compromise of this case? A. Well, one thing I heard \u2014 there was one juror among the jury, I don\u2019t know which one it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201cQ. I just want the facts. A. He said the companies wanted to compromise it for $100,000.00. I said, \u2018Where did you get your authority for that?\u2019 He said, T got it from good authority.\u2019 I didn\u2019t pay any attention to that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">\u201cQ. That was stated to you on the jury? A. No, on the outside. You know, in talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">\u201cQ. That was in the corridor? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-14\">\u201cQ. <em>And the juror who made that statement to you was whom? </em>A. <em>I couldn\u2019t tell you. That has been six or seven months ago.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-15\">\u201cQ. <em>You know it was a member of the jury? A. Yes, I know it was a member of the jury, but I don\u2019t know where he got the information.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-16\">\u201cQ. <em>Do you know what was stated to you as to the fact that he had it on good authority? A. That is what he said. I don\u2019t know.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-17\">\u201cQ. <em>The statement was definitely made to you? A. Not made to me. Well, I guess it was made to me, too, and I guess he told somebody else that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-18\">\u201cQ. <em>There were several jurors standing around? A. I know they were close. I don\u2019t know whether they heard it or not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-19\">\u201cQ. His remarks were being addressed to the ones who were standing around? A. <em>He was telling me about it. I don\u2019t know if the other fellows heard it or not.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-20\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-21\">\u201cQ. Now then, on another occasion while you were still on the jury in this case and prior to the time the case was submitted to the jury, in the Central Smoke House did you hear anything concerning a compromise in this lawsuit? A. Well, I was there one evening \u2014 that was two or three months before the case was over. I think it was during a recess. I was playing dominoes \u2014 well, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>I don\u2019t know whether I was playing or not \u2014 there are so many tables around there \u2014 it was a distance from here to maybe Mr. Thomas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">\u201cQ. <em>How far is that, </em>\u2014 ten <em>or fifteen feet? </em>A. <em>I don\u2019t know. A fellow made a remark that he understood they tried to compromise the case for $100,000.00 and they turned it down. I don\u2019t know where he got the information.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201cQ. <em>Did he make any statement as to where he got his information? </em>A. <em>I don\u2019t know if he did or not. I didn\u2019t pay any attention to it nohow.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201cQ. Was he a member of the jury? A. No, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">\u201cQ. Was he playing dominoes? A. I don\u2019t remember. It has been so long ago. <em>I don\u2019t pay attention to those kind of things. I just forgot about it.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">\u201cQ. <em>Do you recall who made the statement? </em>A. Fes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">\u201cQ. <em>Who made it? </em>A. <em>A fellow by the name of Nasey Hirsch, </em>\u2014 old <em>man Hirsch\u2019s son, who used to be a lawyer.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-14\">\u201cQ. <em>And before the jury retired to consider the case, did anyone ever attempt to talk to you about this lawsuit? </em>A. <em>Well, one man, like I told you,- </em>\u2014 a <em>fellow by the name of Freedman. I was driving by the Hotel Vicksburg and he waved at me and I stopped. He was talking to somebody but I forget who. He asked me if I was on the case. I told him I was. He said, \u2018Well, if you can </em>\u2014 \u2014I <em>don\u2019t know how he said it, but something like: \u2018If you can take care of my friend Applebaum, I will appreciate it.\u2019 I stopped him right away. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to discuss this case. I am on the jury all right.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, maybe it udll be worthwhile to you.\u2019 I said, \u2018You are talking to the wrong man.\u2019 He said, \u2018How is the case going to come out?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u2019 And I drove off.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-16\">* * 4. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-17\">\u201cQ. That was sometime before the case ended? A. Yes, sir. That was two or three months. <em>I didn\u2019t pay attention, to it. I didn\u2019t even tell anybody. I don\u2019t guess he meant anything.\u201d </em>(R. 5784-5788) (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-18\">On cross examination, in the main, the witness reiterated what he had said on direct examination, <em>but admitted he had told juror Delaughter about the approach of Freedman, </em>because, as he stated, De-laughter had reminded him of it since the trial (R. 5794), whereas on direct examination he had said in regard to the Freedman incident, as appears above, \u201c * * * <em>I did not pay attention to it. I did not even tell anybody </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b161-19\">(R. 5793). It further appears that before the trial of the motion was taken up, counsel for the plaintiffs had assembled all of the jurors together at one time in a single room, read to them the charges in the motion for new trial, and had thoroughly interrogated them about those charges, with whatever effect, as compared to interviewing them separately, it might have on their testimony, when called to testify under oath. Of course they were not sworn on that occasion, yet we must assume they were human and subject to such natural resentments as might arise from an attack upon their verdict. They were at least permitted to know what each other would say when called by defendants\u2019 counsel, who apparently had no other means of making proof of the matters which they had charged except by the testimony of the jurors themselves. Strange to say counsel for appellants apparently followed a similar course. Freedman certainly could not be expected to admit that he had attempted to bribe one of these jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-20\">Juror Liddell: Liddell was a plumber who lived in Natchez. During the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>he visited in the home of his father-in-law, Ben C. Penn, Sr. at Greenville, (where all the theatres were located) who was a witness for plaintiff but which fact Liddell said was unknown to him at the time. On his visit to Greenville he passed and observed the surroundings of all three theatres. The first trip was made to attend the wedding of his brother-in-law on June 23rd and a second one was made in August following \u201cthe week-end before the week that the case was closed\u201d after Penn, Sr. had testified. He stated the reason for the latter trip was that his wife wished to visit her parents shortly before an expected child was born. On the first trip Lid-dell discussed with his brother-in-law the possibility of joining the business of his father-in-law as agent for typewriter dealers but said nothing to Penn, Sr. about it then. However, on the second trip, shortly before the case was finished after he had seen Penn, Sr. on the witness stand, the two did discuss it. Penn, Sr. also visited Liddell in Natchez three times during the trial, two of which were after Liddell had learned that Penn was a witness for plaintiffs. While in Greenville on the second visit in August, Liddell went to the place of business of his father-in-law, which was right next door to the Lake Theatre, and he also rode around Greenville observing all of the theatres- including Paramount, Delta and Lake, as well as their surroundings. He told some of the other jurors of the relationship with Penn, Sr., but got no permission for the second visit, nor did he report it to anyone in authority after learning that his father-in-law was a witness. At the time Liddell testified on the motion for new trial, he was still negotiating with his father-in-law in regard to the typewriter business, including the idea that Liddell might either join the agency at Greenville or have a separate one at Greenwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">On cross examination, the court allowed Liddell to testify as to how the jurors stood when they first went1 out, that is, 11 for the plaintiffs and one doubtful but he did not state at the time who the doubtful one was. Further on in the cross examination he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201cQ. Do you recall whether or not after your first discussion, after the jury did indicate the vote or how they stood, whether or not Mr. Guido was first for the plaintiff or for the defendant, as best you remember? A. Well, I think, to the best of my recollection or remembrance, when we first went in his attitude was it was a bad business deal and he didn\u2019t know whether they should get anything or not, but it wasn\u2019t but two or three conversations when he said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s give them something.\u2019 \u201d (R. 5819)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">This was followed by the statement that he never heard anything of a compromise for $100,000 until the case ended.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">\u201cQ. <em>Was anything ever said in that jury room or said to you any time after your father-in-law became a witness, or that you heard either before or after you began the service as a juror, or up to the time the case was actually decided and your verdict rendered referring to any statement that haff been made that there had been an offer by the defendants to the plaintiffs in the sum of $100,000.00? Or, in any other sum? </em>A. <em>The first I heard of that was after the case was closed and the verdict given. I believe Mr. Hafter told us about it in Mrs. Short\u2019s office.\u201d </em>(R. 5819) (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Juror Rockwood: Rockwood was a retired railroad man who lived in Vicksburg. His testimony is quoted in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">\u201cQ. Now, Mr. Rockwood, during the progress of the case and before the jury retired for its consideration of the case, did you have any occasion to hear any discussion or receive any information about a compromise in this case? A. Well, as I stated before to you and to Mr. Teller, I was in the Jitney Jungle\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>I ate over there quite a bit during the trial \u2014 -I went through the cafeteria with my tray and was sitting in the booth that holds four and there were two gentlemen there. I said, \u2018Can I sit here?\u2019 They said, \u2018Certainly\u2019. I set my tray down and proceeded to eat. One of them said to the other, \u2018What are you doing down here?\u2019 And he said, T am down here on that damn picture show trial.\u2019 The other one said, \u2018What is it?\u2019, and he said, \u2018Haven\u2019t you read about it?\u2019 I don\u2019t remember whether he had or not, but he said, \u2018It must be a mighty big case, I hear they offered to compromise for <em>$75,000.00.\u2019 And </em>that is <em>all I </em>heard. By that time some lady came to the other side of the booth and I finished before the two gentlemen and the lady did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201cQ. Did anybody say anything about bringing some witnesses down ? A. He said he had to bring some witnesses for the picture show case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201cQ. From where? A. He said from Greenville. That was, I figure, about three weeks after Mr. Thomas came back from his operation, \u2014 two or three. That must have been in August, \u2014 July or August.\u201d (R. 5823-5824)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">On cross examination the witness stated he never mentioned hearing the above statement to any of the jurors, <em>nor was anything else said about a compromise. </em>We quote from further cross examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u201cQ. <em>Had you ever heard </em>\u2014 other <em>than what you have just told the Judge, which transpired in your presence under the circumstances which you have related </em>\u2014 anything <em>said about any kind of settlement being offered? A. No, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">\u201cQ. <em>Did you ever hear any member of the jury discuss any such thing? A. No, sir, I did not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">\u201cQ. <em>Did you tell this to Mr. Guido or anyone else </em>\u2014 I <em>mean what you heard about the $75,000.00 settlement? </em>A. <em>No, I did not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">\u201cQ. <em>Did anyone else tell Mr. Guido or any of the other members of the jury in your presence anything about a settlement being offered by the defendants or by the plaintiffs or anybody else?

He was further permitted to testify about a conversation with juror Guido after the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">\u201cQ. Were any of them for the defendants at all on the first ballot at the outset? A. I believe there was one for the defendants, or maybe two. Q. Do you recall who those two were,- \u2014 as best you can recall? A. <em>I think it was Mr. Delaughter, and Mike Guido.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-16\">\u201cQ. After you gentlemen of the jury discussed your conclusions on the testimony, did you all finally get together? A. We finally did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-17\">\u201cQ. Both of them came over to your viewpoint that the majority of ten originally entertained? A. That is right.\u201d (R. 5829-5830) (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-18\">He was then further interrogated on re-direct about a conversation with Mr. Burke, one of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and admitted he had said something about \u201csandhouse gossip\u201d about an offer of compromise for $75,000.00 but denied he had ever reported what he had heard at the cafeteria to the jury or that it was discussed in the jury room. Then on recross examination, he gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-19\">\u201cQ. <em>Did you say you heard that among the jurors, the discussion about the statement? I don\u2019t know what you mean by sandhouse gossip.

A. </em>That is the <em>first </em>I heard of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">\u201cQ. <em>Did you hear anything after? A.

A. The defendants offered to pay it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">\u201cQ. Is that what the fellow said in Jitney-Jungle? A. He didn\u2019t say who. He heard that they offered to pay $75,000.00.\u201d (R. 5832-5834) (Emphasis supplied. Compare this with his testimony on cross examination earlier above.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">Juror Delaughter: Juror Delaughter lived at Hermanville, southeast of Vicksburg, and traveled back and forth part of the time during the trial with jurors Ball, Marsh and Liddell. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-16\">\u201cQ. <em>Now, Mr. Delaughter, during the progress of this trial and before the case was concluded, did you receive any knowledge or information concerning the fact that one of the parties in this case had settled or compromised the case?

He is going to leave here and he won\u2019t get back before Tuesday and we will have to lay over here until the judge comes back.\u2019 That was brought into the jury room., I don\u2019t know exactly who said it. I don\u2019t believe I remember that, but it was said several times. It was said, \u2018Let\u2019s decide this thing.

Most of them wanted to give the full amount asked for. We finally come to an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">\u201cQ. On the basis of the verdict that was returned? A.

I did not.\u201d (R. 5845-5846) (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">In dealing with this witness, counsel for plaintiffs again asked the general question whether anything had happened to influence his verdict within his knowledge and he answered in the negative. A portion of the charges in the motion for a new trial were then read and the fact that all the jurors were together at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>one time to hear these charges was confirmed by this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><em>Juror Farr: </em>On direct examination Farr stated he had heard nothing about a compromise until the trial ended, but immediately thereafter he learned that RKO had settled.

Freedman said he had gone to Vicksburg about 16 years before the trial, met Guido shortly thereafter, met the woman he afterwards married at about the same time, who was working as a cashier for Guido in a restaurant. He testified further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">\u201cQ. Do you know the plaintiffs in this case, Mr. Joe Applebaum and Mr. Bert Simms? A.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-26\">On cross examination the witness first stated he learned from Guido that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>was on the jury, <em>before </em>he met Apple-baum when the latter came to Vicksburg for trial, but further on said he had seen Guido <em>after </em>running into Applebaum. The witness denied he had said anything like \u201cit would be worthwhile for Guido for the verdict to be in favor of Apple-baum\u201d. He testified that Sol Wolff was one of two people who bought the Center Building when it was sold; that Wolff\u2019s store in Hollandale, Mississippi, is next door to that of Mrs. Applebaum, the latter\u2019s place being known as The Vogue. The witness had visited both places on occasions, but had not seen Mrs. Apple-baum for several years. (R. 5916.) He represented a Houston firm and had been selling in the Mississippi territory for them about two years before he testified. Although Mrs. Applebaum\u2019s store was in his territory, he had not attempted to sell them anything during the last two years. (R. 5918.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Plaintiffs recalled Juror Rockwood, who stated that after talking with one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, that if he had testified there was a discussion of the $75,000 reported offer of settlement in the jury room, he wanted to correct the same as he had heard it only in Jitney Jungle where he ate and not in the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">At the end of the testimony of the jurors, the Court stated that he had given counsel permission to interview them to find out what they would testify to. There was no indication however that it should be done in the presence of all the jurors at the same time. The Court kept the case open for further evidence, including affidavits, stating that if there were objections he would hear the parties thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The Court then made a statement as to the extent which he thought the testimony of the jurors at the interview could be considered and that was only for the purpose of impeaching Mike Guido. It withheld ruling on the testimony of the jurors as to what happened in the jury room until counsel could brief the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Subsequently, affidavits of Joe Apple-baum (who had been injured and could not be present) and Darden Marsh were taken and filed on January 4, 1952. The former stated in substance that at no time did he discuss or attempt to discuss the case with any member of the jury, nor did he ask anyone else to do so; that he knew Sam Freedman and at one time saw him in Vicksburg during the trial, at which the case was mentioned, but that he never asked Freedman if he was acquainted with or to contact any juror trying the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Marsh swore that he was the extra juror and sat through the trial until the case was submitted to the regular jury when he was discharged, and that he heard nothing about any compromise or offer of compromise nor did anything else happen, as far as he knew, to influence the verdict of the jury, other than the evidence and the law given by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Instead of a formal opinion, the Court addressed a joint letter of considerable length to all counsel in the case, stating his findings of fact and conclusions of law, some of which have been quoted above, in which the evidence and the authorities were reviewed. The motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">We think it appears rather conclusively from the testimony, portions of which are quoted above, mainly by members of the jury, that at least three not only received information that one of the defendants had settled with the plaintiffs but also discussed with each other reports that some defendants had offered to compromise for $75,000 in one instance and $100,000 in another. These three jurors were Guido, Rockwood and De-laughter. That portion of Guido\u2019s testimony quoted above clearly discloses that another juror, whose name he could not remember, said \u201cthe companies wanted to compromise it (the case) for $100,-000\u201d and that this juror when asked \u201cwhere you got your authority\u201d stated, \u201cI got it from good authority.\u201d However, Guido added: \u201cI didn\u2019t pay attention to that.\u201d This took place in the hall and not in the jury room. He equivocated as to whether it was made .to him, but said: \u201cThere were several jurors stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ing around * * * I know they were close. I do not know whether they heard it or not.\u201d He further stated that on another occasion in the Central Smoke House \u201cI think it was during a recess * * * two or three months before the case was over * * * a fellow made a remark that he understood they (the defendants) tried to compromise the case for $100,000 and they (plaintiffs) turned it down. I don\u2019t know where he got his information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">It also appears that Juror Rockwood testified that he had heard a discussion in Jitney Jungle restaurant between two men, one of whom said he had brought witnesses down to the trial of this case from Greenville and that defendants had tried to settle for $75,000 which had been turned down. Rockwood further stated he had said nothing about it to anyone else, but on being pressed again on recross examination by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cQ. Did you say you heard that among the jurors * * *? A. I heard some of them say there was an offer of $75,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">\u201cQ. That was during the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">\u201cQ. And by the jurors? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">He could not remember whether it was before or after he had heard the discussion at Jitney Jungle but \u201cit was among the members of the panel\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Further on, also while on cross examination by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, this juror was asked specifically if it was not a fact that the $75,000 offer \u201cwas <em>not </em>discussed among the jury, and, if you hadn\u2019t heard the conversation (at Jitney Jungle), you wouldn\u2019t have heard anything about the statement?\u201d Rockwood answered, \u201cThat is the <em>first </em>I heard of it.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) This was followed by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">\u201cQ. Did you hear anything after? A. I heard it later on among the jurors. We heard there was a compromise offer of $75,000.00. There would be three or four standing in the hall gossiping and that was the extent of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">This juror was called again as a witness by plaintiffs as respondents on the motion for new trial and changed his testimony so as to eliminate everything but the Jitney Jungle incident by saying he had heard nothing about an offer of compromise anywhere else. Yet, the two statements are clearly in conflict in unmistakable detail and it is not possible to reconcile them by calling the first an honest mistake. It is more reasonable to conclude it was a deliberate attempt to conceal what really took place among the jury, along with similar incidents which came out in the testimony of jurors above.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">Juror Delaughter stated emphatically that he had heard during the trial \u201cthat one of the parties * * ' * had settled or compromised the case * * *. It was in the hall of the court building when we were excused, * * *. <em>Mr. Liddell and I were discussing the remark when we went out. He said, \u2018Well, what are you going to say now?\u2019\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Liddell was another who denied hearing anything about a compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">As stated earlier, the conditions surrounding this case from its inception were such we are impressed that the jurors were favorably inclined toward plaintiffs. We believe this is evidenced by some of the testimony quoted above, even before hearing defendants had attempted to compromise, and it is hard to accept the conclusion that such reports did not strengthen that attitude in a manner prejudicial to the defendants. The court below allowed all of the jurors to testify that they were not influenced by these reports, and, to some extent at least, apparently based its finding upon their testimony that those who admitted hearing about them insisted they were not influenced thereby. We cannot accept this conclusion. Some of the jurors claimed they heard nothing of any settlement or offer of compromise, yet a careful reading of the whole testimony on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>motion, on both direct and cross examination, leaves a rather strong conviction that such matters <em>were </em>discussed among many, if not all, and that some of them felt quite a relief of conscience when they were finally discharged and hurried to inquire if it was a fact that RKO had settled. It is also indicated that some were using this argument with the two who were said to have been either for the defendants or undecided when they first went out to consider their verdict. There is some evidence above that this condition existed when the case was still with plaintiffs, and before Applebaum had finished his testimony. We feel therefore that the record as a whole justifies the conclusion these extraneous matters had a substantial influence, prejudicial to defendants, in producing the verdict in this case. For these reasons the lower court should have set the verdict aside and ordered a new trial. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Klinge, supra; Wheaton v. United States, supra; Jorgensen v. York Ice &amp; Machinery Co., supra; Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. v. Imbraguglia, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">It is significant that, although the jury found for the plaintiffs against all of the non-resident corporate distributors, as well as Paramount Gulf (who operated both Paramount and Delta Theatres) a subsidiary of Paramount Distributing, they exonerated the owners of Lake, who, both according to the allegations of the complaint and the proof, if any, were the beneficiaries of the alleged conspiracy and monopoly of first and second run pictures, especially the latter, and depositions of both partners of Lake, Darden and Prewitt, were used as admissions of adverse parties by the plaintiffs. The affected distributor appellants argue that this had the affect of acquitting those defendants of wrong-doing who had leased their pictures to Lake. However, since we do not pass upon the merits except as to Republic, it is unnecessary to discuss that phase of the case. While of course the jury had the power to find for or against any of the plaintiffs or defendants, still courts should not shut their eyes to circumstances such as this, where the local citizen was let out, at least when called upon to determine whether the proof of extraneous matters reasonably supports the conclusion that the verdict rendered was influenced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">II. Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Appellants\u2019 first specific complaint against the Court\u2019s charge to the jury is leveled at Plaintiffs\u2019 Requested Instruction No. 1, which was the first special instruction given. It set forth appellees\u2019 theory of the case in great detail, taking up some ten pages of the printed record. Without lengthy quotation, it is sufficient to state that the instruction was written by counsel for appellees in the nature of argument. It stated, inter alia, that Center was in every respect equal or superi- or to any other theatre in Greenville; that the distributors controlled such a large proportion of films as to constitute a monopoly; that appellees were able and willing to pay rental for films equal to or higher than any other theatre; that defendants conspired among themselves to refuse appellees first and second <em>runs </em>and to grant unreasonable clearances to the other exhibitors; that the purpose of the conspiracy was to give appellees\u2019 competitors advantage over them; that the conspiracy included illegal \u201cfranchise agreements\u201d; \u201cmaster agreements\u201d and \u201cformula deals\u201d; that distributors required appellees to pay higher rentals than other exhibitors and thereby forced them to charge high admission prices; that as a result of the acts and conspiracies appellees were forced out of business with considerable loss, proximately caused by the illegal conspiracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Appellants argue that this instruction, although given as \u201cthe theory of the plaintiffs\u201d, contained inferences drawn by appellees and comments on the evidence not supported by the record or directly contradicted; that it was argumentative; and that it unfairly emphasized appellees\u2019 case because of its length and manner of composition. Further they complain that the trial judge refused to grant their special instruction prepared and presented to set forth their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>theory in an effort to offset \u201cthe terrible effect\u201d of the one given for appellees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Appellees point out that prior to reading the instruction, and again at its close, the judge cautioned the jury that it was only appellees\u2019 theory and was not evidence or law, as well as repeating some nine or ten times in the body of the instruction, \u201cit is further the theory of the plaintiffs * * * \u201d. They also contend that in the general instructions and in special instructions submitted by appellants, the judge amply covered appellants\u2019 theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In a proper case, a party may be entitled to have his theory submitted to the jury, when there is evidence to support it and a proper request therefor has been made. Stoll v. Loving, 6 Cir., 120 F. 805; Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Green, 8 Cir., 164 F.2d 55; Montgomery v. Virginia Stage Lines, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 213, 191 F.2d 770. However, such a charge should be judicial and not one-sided or argumentative; and when the judge instructs as to one party\u2019s theory, he should also instruct as to the other party\u2019s contentions. U. S. v. Messinger, 4 Cir., 68 F.2d 234; State Automobile Mut. Ins. Co. v. York, 4 Cir., 104 F.2d 730; Home Ins. Co. v. Consolidated Bus Lines, 4 Cir., 179 F.2d 768. As was said in Sperber v. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co., 8 Cir., 140 F.2d 2, 5, the judge is not required \u201cto state his recollection of the evidence with nice exactitude for both sides\u201d; yet his position is such that he must use great care, and \u201c 'deductions and theories not warranted by the evidence should be studiously avoided.\u2019 \u201d Quercia v. U. S., 289 U.S. 466, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699, 77 L.Ed. 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">It is true that the judge made preliminary and closing statements to the effect that the jury should not consider the special instructions as proof or law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is also true that in his general instructions and in several instructions requested by appellants, the judge gave to some extent summaries of appellants\u2019 contentions, commenting upon evidence favorable to the appellants. But nowhere in the charge do we find a detailed, comprehensive statement of appellants\u2019 theory comparable to the one given for appellees. We also note that this instruction was given at the very beginning of the charge, when the jury was fresh and doubtless more attentive than later; and it was immediately followed by Plaintiffs\u2019 Requested Instruction No. 2 which was an eight-page treatment of appellees\u2019 theory of the law and the evidence as to their damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, those portions dealing with appellants\u2019 theory are scattered through the lengthy charge. It would be simply unrealistic to say that the treatment accorded appellants\u2019 theory in the charge as a whole was substantially comparable to that given in Plaintiffs\u2019 Requested Instruction No. 1. We cannot escape the conclusion that the instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>complained of,- written by partisan counsel in the nature of argument, but coming-from the judge with the force of his position, must have -more - or less overwhelmed the jurors and no doubt indelibly stamped upon their minds impressions most favorable to appellees. Considering the circumstances under which the case was tried, we are doubtful if <em>any </em>subsequent instructions could have offset or balanced such impressions. Finding no comparable instructions which might possibly have had that effect, we reluctantly conclude that the trial judge erred not only in refusing appellants\u2019 counter-instruction, but in granting appellees\u2019 requested instruction in the form presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Appellants also complain specifically of Plaintiffs\u2019 Special Instruction No. 63<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> granted by the Court, as well as No. 55<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and No. 56 of similar import. Number 63 reads: \u201cIn licensing their motion picture films for exhibition on an early run at Greenville, Mississippi, distributor defendants were under a <em>duty </em>before licensing those films to any motion picture the-atre, to <em>offer every </em>other equally suitable motion picture theatre at the city of Greenville, Mississippi, an opportunity <em>to negotiate for and obtain </em>those motion picture films equal to and in all respects the same as the opportunity afforded any other exhibitor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The complaint is that the instructions are incorrect statements of law, conflicting with the basic right of a distributor to select its customers according to its own standards. Appellees seek to support the instruction upon the authority of Ball v. Paramount Pictures, 3 Cir., 176 F.2d 426,- stating that it was based upon the decree approved in that case. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">Despite the multitude of decisions against film distributors, it is still the law that ordinarily a distributor has the right to license or refuse to license his film to any exhibitor, pursuant to his own reasoning, so long as he acts independently. The anti-trust laws qualify that right only to the extent that they prohibit contracts, combinations and <em>conspiracies, with another party, </em>which have the purpose or effect of monopolizing or restraining trade in motion picture films.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As has been said or implied in so many cases, no exhibitor has an absolute right to demand an exhibition license for the films of any distributor; any illegality consists not in the refusal of any one distributor to license an exhibitor but in his <em>conspiring </em>with one or; more other persons to refuse such license.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The three instructions complained of in effect told the jury that every distributor of films <em>must as a matter of law </em>accept all equally suitable exhibitors as customers and <em>must </em>treat them all equally. Such a statement not only overlooks the peculiarities of the motion picture exhibiting business, but it also obviously conflicts with the settled law to the contrary.. The language of the decree in Ball v. Paramount Pictures, supra, may have had the force of law in the controversy there presented, wherein a conspiracy had been found to exist; but it does not state the law governing a jury whose task it is to determine whether or not a conspiracy did exist. The question here is not whether there was a duty on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>part of the distributors to license their films to appellees, but whether their refusal to do so was the <em>result of </em>an illegal <em>conspiracy. </em>Clearly, then, the trial court erred in granting the three instructions requested by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Appellees, however, contend that in reading at least four special instructions requested by appellants the court repeatedly made it clear to the jury that the duty said to rest upon appellants did not abridge their right to select their customers so long as that selection was made lawfully.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And, they argue, the effect of the instructions must be determined in the light of the charge as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The four special instructions referred to by appellees did in fact tell the jurors that no duty rested upon appellants to license the Center if they acted independently. However, we cannot agree that their presentation made it clear that they superseded the three erroneous instructions previously given. The record reflects no reference, direct or otherwise, to the three erroneous instructions, anywhere in the entire charge. There is nothing from which the jurors would necessarily conclude that the judge was qualifying or otherwise correcting the misconception which obviously resulted from the previous erroneous instructions. The propositions presented are some forty pages apart in the printed record and are completely contradictory in substance. Rather than cure or clarify the error in the three previous instructions, the giving of the four instructions requested by appellants must have resulted in additional confusion in the minds of the jurors. Certainly it cannot be said as a matter of law that the giving of later contradictory charges correctly stating the law necessarily cures previous erroneous instructions. Where the error is so fundamental as that in the three instructions given upon appellees\u2019 request, it must appear that later instructions or the charge as a whole so clearly obliterated the error as to render it reasonably certain that no prejudice resulted. The four correct instructions given at appellants\u2019 request cannot be said to have had that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">Nor can we agree that the charge as a whole renders the errors inconsequential. In the first place, the charge was so long and contained so many special instructions drafted by partisan counsel that we are doubtful if it can be considered \u201cas a whole\u201d. In addition, the special instructions so often repeated the same substance in different words<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that the charge \u201cas a whole\u201d is confusing even to one trained in law. Moreover, there are some instances wherein the judge read special instructions as submitted and then added qualifying or explanatory remarks<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which were contradictory to the substance of the instruction given. Under the circumstances of the trial as previously discussed, we reluctantly conclude that the charge as a whole was most confusing and did not clarify or remove the prejudicial effect of the erroneous instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">III. Motions for Directed Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"A37\">A. As to Republic:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">As previously indicated, appellant Republic made a separate contention in addition to those advanced by all appellants. It forcefully argues that whatever inferences might be permissible as to the other appellants, there is no evidence to support the verdict and judgment against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">Essentially, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint charged that all defendants conspired to deprive them of first and second run films during the period of Center\u2019s op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>eration \u2014 February 9 through October 11, 1947. The substance of plaintiffs\u2019 theory was that all defendants refused to license such films, that this refusal by each distributor was uniform with the action of all others and with knowledge of such uniformity and that the jury was therefore entitled to infer the refusal resulted from a conspiracy rather than from independent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Republic\u2019s executive vice-president testified that his company was unable to finance the licensing of its films separately as each was released, and that its practice was to license the exhibition of all films planned for production in a given season in one contract executed prior to the season.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He stated that all films to be produced for the 1946-1947 season, ending October or November 1947, were licensed to Paramount Gulf<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> for first and second runs at the Paramount and Delta in Greenville. This arrangement was made, according to the custom of the company, in October, 1946<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> before he had ever heard of plaintiffs<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and several months prior to the completion and opening of the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Both the executive vice-president<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and the New Orleans branch manager<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> for Republic (who was a friend of Applebaum) admitted that the company received a letter from Applebaum dated January 8, 1947, asking for first and second runs on Republic films. But each testified that this was their first knowledge<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> that appellees were operating the Center and that they wrote to Applebaum to the effect that their first and second runs had already been licensed<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to Paramount Gulf for that season. None of this testimony is contradicted, and it is clearly shown that Applebaum was offered many pictures from the two seasons ending October 1946. These he refused because they were not of the type he desired. We are unable to discover any similarity or uniformity between Republic\u2019s conduct toward appel-lees up to October or November, 1947, and that of the other appellants. Nor is there anything in the record to indicate on the part of Republic a \u201cproclivity * * * to unlawful conduct\u201d as was relied upon in Milgram v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., 3 Cir., 192 F.2d 579, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">We have previously pointed out that there was no unqualified duty on Republic (or any of the distributors) to offer or license any of its films to appellees. Certainly, then, the law did not require Republic to rescind its prior contract with Paramount Gulf and grant to appellees rights which it had already promised to others before it even knew of the Center\u2019s operation. The burden was upon plaintiffs to prove facts from which it could reasonably be inferred that Republic had <em>conspired, </em>with one or more of the defendants to refuse to grant licenses to plaintiffs. Republic admitted that it refused to license, but showed that the refusal was based upon a pre-existing contract with another exhibitor. There is not even the vague \u201cconscious parallelism\u201d and \u201cpast proclivity toward unlawful conduct\u201d from which a conspiracy can be inferred. We know of no authority which requires or allows an inference of conspiracy to be drawn from Republic\u2019s act in honoring its prior contract with Paramount Gulf.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">It is not clearly shown that Republic refused to license any 1947-1948 films to plaintiffs, since it does not appear exactly when any licenses for these films were granted. Therefore, the record is barren of proof that Republic had any first or second runs available during the Center\u2019s existence. Even if we were to assume that licenses were granted for such films prior to the Center\u2019s closing on October 11, 1947, there is nothing in the record to show that appellees re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>quested any of them, or that Republic conspired with anyone to refuse licenses to Center. Republic\u2019s branch manager testified that the last contact the company had with Applebaum was in March, 1947, and there is nothing in the record to contradict his statement. As was said in Milwaukee Towne Corp. v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., 7 Cir., 190 F.2d 561, at page 568:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201cWe know of no principle of law which authorizes a person aggrieved by the deprivation of a right either statutory or constitutional to recover for such deprivation in the absence of a demand or request for its exercise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In addition we note that Applebaum repeatedly testified directly or strongly implied that generally Republic\u2019s pictures were not of the type which he desired to exhibit in his theatre. While he did make the statement that he didn\u2019t pursue his desire for \u201ctop quality Grade A\u201d pictures from Republic because of his conviction that he couldn\u2019t get them, we think his testimony on the subject shows rather clearly that what he sought from Republic was the privilege of selecting those pictures he desired to the exclusion of other exhibitors. Failing this, to which the law gave him no right, he apparently made no serious efforts to obtain any films from Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Consequently, we conclude that there is no substantial evidence in the record from which it can be inferred that Republic conspired with anyone to refuse licenses to appellees. The trial judge should have directed a verdict for Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">B. As to all other appellants:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">We have treated Republic separately for the reason that the evidence clearly shows its conduct toward appellees was completely different from that of the other appellants, and its only reason for refusing to license its films to appellees was its prior contract with Paramount Gulf.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">We are constrained to comment that the evidence of conspiracy on the part of all other appellants is weak and that we are impressed by appellants\u2019 argument that appellees\u2019 venture was foredoomed to failure because of its financial structure, location, and the method of operation. Yet, we are of the opinion that the record as a whole contains sufficient evidence of \u201cconscious parallelism\u201d and other activities on the part of the distributors in their relations with Paramount Gulf and with ap-pellees to warrant submission to the jury. Since we have concluded that a new trial is necessary, we deem it unnecessary to comment in detail upon that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Accordingly, for the reasons assigned, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the matter is remanded with instructions to enter judgment in favor of Republic, and a new trial is granted as to all other appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\">.

I have read this entire testimony and think conclusively that the testimony of Guido shows he was not influenced by the extraneous matter, and before going further with this I will make a finding of fact because of some conflicts in the testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u201cI find as a fact that while he was a member of the jury, and before the case was submitted to the jury for consideration, that one juror stated in the hearing of Guido that the companies wanted to compromise the case for $100,000.00. Guido asked: \u2018Where did you get your authority for that?\u2019 The juror replied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u2018I got it from good authority.\u2019 This statement was made in the corridor or hallway off the courtroom and outside of the jury room. There were other jurors standing around at the time, but Guido does not know whether it was heard by them. The juror who made the statement was telling it to Guido. On another occasion when Guido was playing dominoes at a smokehouse an outsider made a remark in Guido\u2019s hearing that they had tried to compromise the case for $100,-000.00 and it was turned down. That person was not a member of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">On another occasion, when Guido was driving by the Vicksburg Hotel a man by the name of Freedman waved at him and he stopped. Freedman asked Guido if he \u2022 was on the jury and Guido replied that he was. Thereupon Freedman said: \u2018Well, if you can take care of my friend Apple-baum I will appreciate it.\u2019 Guido stopped him immediately and said: T don\u2019t want to discuss this case. I am on the jury all right.\u2019 Freedman replied: \u2018Well, maybe it will be worth while to you.\u2019 Guido replied: \u2018You are talking to the wrong man.\u2019 Freedman said, \u2018How is the case going to come out?\u2019 Guido replied, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about it\u2019, and drove off. That was two or three months before the case ended. Guido did not even tell anybody about it. In the jury room, after the case was submitted, not a word was said about either of these occurrences, nor did Guido at any time report the occurrences to the court or any ofli-cer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">\u201cJuror Liddell is a plumber and was a member of this jury. He made two trips to Greenville, Mississippi while the Center Theatre case was being tried, where this theater is located. The first trip was to attend the wedding of his brother-in-law, and his wife and daughter and a \u25a0 friend accompanied him on this trip, which was about June 23. His brother-in-law is Ben C. Penn, Jr., who is the legally adopted son of Ben C. Penn, Sr., who testified as a witness for the plaintiffs in this case. He went up on Saturday and returned on Sunday, and stayed in the home of his father-in-law. On his way there or back he saw the Center Theater, as it was on the highway he was required to travel. He made another trip in August, with his family, to visit his wife\u2019s parents, as she was expecting to give birth to a child in the near future and desired to have this visit with her family. He testified that on neither of the occasions did he discuss the lawsuit with Mr. Penn, Sr., nor did he know that Mr. Penn, Sr. was going to be a witness in the lawsuit until he walked to the witness chair. He had been considering going into business with his father-in- \u2022 law in Greenville for some two or three years and still had that under consideration; that Mr. Penn, Sr. knew he was a member of the jury and learned this in the Spring and learned this while on a visit to the home of the juror at Natchez, when they, had come to talk over the wedding plans of Penn, Jr. and they were accompanied by his fiancee. He saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>other picture shows located in Green-ville as he could not miss seeing them in driving through the main parts of town. He heard nothing in the jury room to the effect that $100,000.00 had been offered in compromise and did not learn of that until after the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cWilliam Rockwood was a member of the jury and during the progress of the case, and before the jury retired for consideration of their verdict, he heard a discussion or received information that an offer of $75,000.00 in compromise had been made. This happened in a cafeteria. He had gotten his tray in the crowded cafeteria and saw a booth where two men were sitting and he asked if he could sit there. They replied, \u2018Certainly\u2019. He put his tray down and began to eat his dinner. No conversation was addressed to him, but one of the men in his hearing asked the other fellow what he was doing down there and this man replied : \u2018I\u2019m down on the picture show trial\u2019, and said, \u2018It must be a mighty big case, I hear they offered to compromise for $75,000.00\u2019. This party further stated that he had brought some witnesses down from Greenville for the case. This was in July or August. He ate his lunch and left immediately. He did not tell Guido or anyone else about what he had heard. During the progress of the trial he heard a discussion among some of the jurors that there was an offer of $75,-000.00. He understood it to be said that the defendants had offered to pay $75,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\u201cT. J. Delaughter was a member of the jury and received or had information that one of the parties in the case had settled or compromised, having heard this in the hall, off from the court room. He said that Juror Liddell had stated that he understood the Columbia Corporation had paid off. Being asked how he knew, he said, \u2018A little bird told me.\u2019 Being asked, \u2018Do you know it to be a fact?\u2019 He said, T have heard it.\u2019 As he remembered, he had heard that $10,000 had been paid. He heard some discussion in the jury room and some member said it was RKO that was out instead of Columbia. He further testified that he did not remember who said it, but it was reported to them after they had retired: \u2018You had better settle this because the judge is going home at 11 o\u2019clock. He is going to leave here and he won\u2019t be back before Tuesday and we will have to lay over here until the judge comes back.\u2019 That was said several times and finally it was said: \u2018Let\u2019s decide this thing.

At the beginning of this trial, when I let the jury separate, I instructed the jury to remain together as far as possible, but during the recess hours to get to the end of the hall, the purpose being there should be no social contact. At this time I will not declare a mistrial, but I want to say to Mr. Applebaum that if I see that occur again, I am going to punish him very severely. I don\u2019t know what course I would take with reference to the entry of a mistrial; I am of the opinion at this time that no serious damage was done by this conduct, but it was improper and is calculated to have an effect upon the verdict of this case, and I wanted the record to show from what I observed because it was very definitely done, and I wanted to explain to the plaintiff, Mr. Applebaum, that that will not be permitted. 1 do not impute to him at this time any direct purpose of influencing the jury, but it is calculated toward a possibility of that effect; so, I just don\u2019t want it to occur again.\u201d (R. 3673)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">. \u201cThe Court: Mr. Armstrong, I think all of your objections are well taken care of, so far as the record is concerned.
