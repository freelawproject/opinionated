Appellant has through all these proceedings acted as his own counsel. The courts, including this, have been more than conscientious in dealing with him, and because of the situation have probably extended him favors beyond his technical rights. Appellant is not a lawyer and has been inclined to insist that his rights are bounded only by his desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\"> There has been a motion to dismiss this appeal because Beecher did not think it necessary to file an appeal bond as security for costs as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 73(c), 28 U.S.C.A. See Coursey v. International Harvester Co., 10 Cir., 109 F.2d 774, 777; In re Braker, 6 Cir., 127 F.2d 652; General Orders Bankruptcy No. 36, 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53. This defect was not cured by sending at a later date a personal check to the Clerk of this Court \u201cunder protest\u201d for costs. The rules cannot be improvised by the litigant. Further, Beecher did not file timely a designation of the record. This motion to dismiss was continued until the appeal was heard. It is now granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">However, in view of the situation, all matters urged upon this Court have been examined and no merit has been found in any. The findings, conclusions and order of the trial court were correct. The patience and scrupulous care of this Court in dealing with this litigant are exemplary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-12\">. Beecher v.
