They originally pleaded not guilty, but against the advice of their counsel they changed their plea to guilty when their plea of nolo contendere was rejected by the court upon objection by the government. It is quite clear that the matter of what plea they should make was not one which was hurried but was one which was under consideration for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-17\">The trial judge gave careful consideration to the question presented. There was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-18\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
