The Secretary answered the complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a trial was had, findings of fact and conclusions of law were stated, and a judgment was entered adjudging that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>lant was not a national of the United States. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The action was under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provided: \u201cIf any person who claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States is denied such right or privilege by any Department or agency, or executive official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person, regardless of whether he is within the United States or abroad, may institute an action against the head of such Department or agency in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the district in which such person claims a permanent residence for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United States. * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The complaint alleged, in substance, that appellant was born in China on November 3, 1922, and was a son of Law See Chew; that Law See Chew was a citizen of the United States at the time of appellant\u2019s birth and had resided in the United States since October 1, 1917; and that appellant was therefore a citizen of the United States under \u00a7 1993 of the Revised Statutes, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6. Thus, in effect, the complaint alleged that appellant was a national of the United States; for, although all nationals of the United States are not citizens thereof, all citizens thereof are nationals thereof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">The answer denied that appellant was a son of Law See Chew, thus, in effect, denying that appellant was a national of the United States. On the issue thus raised, appellant had the burden of proof,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which is to say, the burden of proving that he was a son of Law See Chew.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-18\">At the trial, appellant adduced evidence <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> some of which tended to show that he was a son of Law See Chew. Some of the evidence so tending was uncontradicted. However, the District Court was not required to believe such evidence or to accept it as true.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-19\">The District Court found that appellant was not a son of Law See Chew. The finding was not clearly erroneous. We therefore accept it as correct<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and conclude, as did the District Court, that appellant was not a national of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-20\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-15\">. Acheson's successor, John Foster Dulles, was substituted for Acheson on April 23, 1953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-27\">. The complaint was called a petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. Section 903 was repealed by \u00a7 403(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 279, 280, effective December 24, 1952. However, this action, having been instituted before December 24, 1952, was not affected by the repeal. See \u00a7 405(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 280. The subject matter of \u00a7 903 is now covered by 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\">.
