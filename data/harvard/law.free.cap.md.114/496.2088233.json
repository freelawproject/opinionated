J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArX\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The appellee sued the appellant for damages alleged to have been sustained by him by reason of the appellant removing the coal which supported the surface owned by him in a tract of land containing fourteen acres. The property was conveyed to the plaintiff in 1897, \u201cexcept, however, all coal and other minerals on or underlying said above granted' property to the same extent and in like manner as excepted in the said deed from Maria Reese <em>et al. </em>to Daniel Ritchey and Stewart Arnold, above described.\u201d In the deed referred to is this reservation: \u201cThe parties of the first part reserve to themselves, their heirs and assigns, all coal and other minerals that have been or' may hereafter be found on or in the said lands, together with the right to mine and remove the said coal or minerals at such place or places as may appear to them, the said first parties, their heirs or assigns, most suitable and convenient by tramroad, plane and dump houses or otherwise,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The first four bills 'of exception embrace rulings of the trial Court on the admissibility of evidence, and the fifth presents its action on the prayers. The plaintiff offered three prayers, which were granted, and the defendant offered eleven, the first, fourth, fifth, tenth and eleventh of which were granted as offered and the third and eighth as modified, and the second, sixth, 'seventh and ninth were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Before passing on the exceptions separately, it will be well to ascertain what the law is as between the owner of the surface and the owner of the minerals, when those estates have been severed by such provisions or reservations as those uow before us. This is the first time this Court has been called upon to pass on the doctrine of subjacent support, where the surface and subjacent estates are owned by differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ent persons. The general rule of law is that when the estate in minerals \u201cin place,\u201d as they are sometimes spoken of in their natural bed, is severed from the estate in the surface, the. owner of the latter has an undoubted right of. subjacent support for the surface, and the owner of the estate in the minerals is entitled to remove only so much of them as he can take without injury to the surface, unless otherwise airthorized by contract or statute. There have been some discussions in the books as to the reasons upon which the rule was founded, but we have seen no case in which it has been unqualifiedly denied. Even in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Fairmont Coal Co., </em>59 W. Va. 480, 53 S. E. Rep. 24, 2 L. R. A., N. S., 1115, which has gone as far in sustaining the right of the owner of the minerals to remove all of them as any decision we have found, the general doctrine is recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\"Without referring to the English cases upon which the/ original decisions in this country were based, the general rule announced above is sustained by many of the Courts of this country\u2014the cases in Pennsylvania, where so much mining has been done, being especially numerous. Amongst others are <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>84 Ala. 228, 4 So. Rep. 350; <em>Collinsville Granite Co. </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>123 Ga. 830, 51 S. E. 666; <em>Wilms </em>v. <em>Jess, </em>94 Ill. 464; <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Catlin Coal Co., </em>210 Ill. 460, 71 N.

R. A. 410, 50 Atl. 255; <em>Youghiogheny River Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Allegheny National Bank, </em>211 Pa. 319, 60 Atl. 924; <em>Miles </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Penn. Coal Co., </em>217 Pa. 449, 63 Atl. 1032 (annotated, in 10 <em>Am. and Eng. An. Cases, </em>874). A number of the English cases are cited in the notes to <em>Trinidad Asphalt Co. </em>v. <em>Ambard </em>(1899), A. C. 594, to be found in 6 <em>Am. and Eng. Dec. in Eq. </em>643, and in some of the cases referred to above, and we will not mate further reference to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Although the rule has been so generally adopted, the parties can modify it or avoid its application by inserting provisions in the grants or leases which, expressly or by necessary intendment, relieve the owners of the minerals of the duty to furnish subjacent support, and in many of the cases which have been before the Courts, the question has been whether that was done by the particular provisions, and, if so, to what extent. We have quoted above those which must govern in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">There are many decisions in which provisions very similar to these have been held not to be sufficient to relieve the owners of the minerals of their duty to support the surface. In <em>Mickle </em>v. <em>Douglas, supra, </em>there was a lease with the right to mine, \u201call the coal;\u201d in <em>Burgner </em>v. <em>Humphrey, supra. </em>there was a grant of \u201call the mineral, coal, iron ore, limestone, and all other minerals,\u201d with the right to enter upon the land and search and explore thereon for said minerals, coal, etc., \u201cand when found to exist on said land to dig, mine, and remove the same therefrom;\u201d in <em>Horner </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>79 Pa. 242, the grant was all the coal, with the right to enter on the lands for the purpose of \u201cmining, excavating and removing said coal;\u201d in <em>Carlin </em>v. <em>Chappel, supra, </em>the deed of the surface reserved \u201call the coal,\u201d with the right of ingress, egress and regress, \u201cfor digging, mining, excavating and conveying away said coal;\u201d in <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Berwind-White Coal Co., </em>216 Pa. 195, 65 Atl. 545, the grant was for \u201call the merchantable coal in and underlying all that tract of land\u201d for which the right of surface support was claimed, excepting five acres under the buildings and spring, the usual mining rights, were granted \u201cwith the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>right to mine and carry away all the said coal, and with all the mining rights and privileges necessary or convenient to such mining and1 removal of the same.\u201d See also <em>Dignan </em>v. <em>Altoona Coal and Coke Co., </em>222 Pa. 390, 71 Atl. 845, one of the latest on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">In those cases it was held that the right of subjacent support was not released in express terms or by necessary implication by the words used. Many others in accord with that position might he cited, hut we will only refer to the note in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Fairmont Coal Co., </em>2 L. R. A. N. S. 1115, and the note to <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Penna Coal Co., </em>10 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. An. Cases, </em>874, where many of them are collected. The case of <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Penna. Coal Co. </em>is an illustration of how such right can he released, while on the other hand that of <em>Youghiogheny River Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>198 Pa. 343, 48 Atl. 19, shows how careful that Court is to sustain the right, unless it is released by express words or necessary implication. The case of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Fairmont Coal Co., supra, </em>is the only one we have found where language similar to that in the reservation in the deed now before us was held to he a release. When the doctrine or right of subjacent support is recognized, as it is with practical unanimity by the authorities, it seems to us to he far better to require those who-desire to enter into stipulations by which the one party to-the transaction is to part with the right which the law gives-him, and the other is to be relieved of a duty which the law imposes upon him, to use language that will necessarily import or clearly express such intention. It should he either by express words or necessary implication, and in our judgment the language used in this reservation was not sufficient to relieve the appellant of its duty to support the surface. It is also held by the authorities that a failure to leave sufficient support for the surface is negligence and may he so declared on. <em>Yandes </em>v. <em>Wright, supra; Jones </em>v. <em>Wagoner, supra; Carlin </em>v. <em>Chappel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Having thus ascertained the rights and duties of the respective parties to this suit, by reason of the ownership of the surface by the plaintiff and the coal by the defendant, we will now consider the particular' grounds of complaint urged against the rulings of the Court by the appellant. The first and' second exceptions and the defendant\u2019s second prayer may be considered together. In the examination of the witness, Jacob D. Wilson, he was asked 'this question: \u201cWas there any difference in the surface as to moisture before and after the fall and breaks of the surface?\u201d That was objected to, and the plaintiff proffered to show, \u201cthat the breaks or falls were such that every time it rained the rain ran down these crevices or spaces in the breaks and ran off the surface; and the result was that the land would not hold any moisture. It would dry out immediately afterwards, and-the soil became in a hard condition that would amount to a drought, except at such times of continued rain. The land would not hold any moisture, and therefore ruined and of no value.\u201d The objection was overruled and that ruling constitutes the first bill of exceptions. The witness answered, \u201cYes, sir; it was,\u201d and then followed this testimony: \u201cQ. What was the difference ? A. The steam comes up these cracks, as I told you, and snow all melts, and it don\u2019t hold no moisture\u2014the water goes straight through. Q. Where does the water go when it rains? A. Down those cracks. Q. Do you mean to say it is drier afterwards? A. Yes, sir; it used to be two or three days before I could plow, but now I can plow the next day.\u201d He had previously described the breaks with particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">When Miss Kearney, .plaintiff\u2019s sister, was on the stand, she described the cracks, which she said they first noticed in May, 19 OR She said they \u201cstalled over towards the bam and ran across the level, and stopped for a long time.\u201d \u201cThen it started and went down behind the barn.\u201d She \u201cwas milking in the bam at the time and the wall split open and a tin cup went down sidewise into the crack. The barn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tipped over four or five inches on one side of the foundation. No other disturbance for two months, when another crack came in the foundation, one that you could stick your finger in. About a year afterwards the house began to crack. It has kept up more or less ever since. . Just a week ago the ground opened just below the house\u2014took several panels out of the fence.\u201d She was asked the question: \u201cHow does the soil seem to he now as compared to what it was before the injury as to moisture\u2014I mean the soil generally ?\u201d That was objected to and-the same proffer was made as above, in reference to the witness Wilson. The objection was overruled and the witness answered, \u201cThat the soil had dried out, was hard, much harder than formerly, and they now have to water it.\u201d She said the cows would step into the cracks and hurt their legs\u2014that the break took a whole row of trees. She also said, \u201cWhen it rains, there is no stop to it. It seems like it runs down the cracks.\u201d \u201cThe cracks are so large that a wagon could run through. - It just looks like a wagon road running through. They open up on this side, and go a little piece, and then on the other, and the middle piece drops in.\u201d \u201cSomething like steam or smoke or fog rises from the holes, or crevices at times. You can drop a rock down and hear it sound as if it came from the depths of the earth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The defendant by its second prayer asked the Court to instruct the jury \u201cthat they cannot under the pleadings and evidence in this cause allow anything for the reduction of moisture in the surface even though they should believe that the reduction of the moisture in the land was the direct result of the mining of the coal under the land of the plaintiff'.\u201d It will he observed that that prayer asked the Court to instruct the jury that they .could not \u201callow anything for the reduction of moisture in the surface.\u201d The testimony shows that- the depth of the cover was three hundred and fifty or four hundred feet, and it was admitted at the opening of the case that \u201call the coal to a depth of sis feet-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>under the plaintiff\u2019s property was removed by the defendant company after the year 1906, and that no stumps or pillars were left, and that this was done before the injuries to the surface.\u201d The rule is well established that the owner of the coal is not liable to the owner of the surface for injuries resulting from the diversion of what are spoken of as hidden streams, caused merely by the removal of the coal. In <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>80 Pa. 87, relied on by the appellant, the Court said: \u201cSo far as we can judge from the record, the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s springs was occasioned by the ordinary operation of mining, and would have occurred though no part &lt;&gt;f the surface had been broken. Mining must interfere, more or less, with those subterranean streams and percolations of water which appear upon the surface as springs; to say that the owner of the substrata shall be accountable in damage for their disturbance, is to say that he shall have no use whatever of his minerals, for, without interfering to some extent with such waters, mining is impossible.\u201d That seems to us to be a very sensible and necessary rule to adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">But the principle referred to. in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Chadwick </em>does not reach the question here involved, for, conceding to its\" full extent that no damage can be recovered for the diversion of the water, if the coal is worked in the ordinary and proper way, if it is so worked as to take away the support 'of the surface, then it is not worked in a proper way. This prayer proposed to disallow anything for the reduction of moisture in the surface, while it must be clear that if the loss of moisture is the result of the breaks in the surface, caused by want of the support which the defendant owed the plaintiff\u2019s surface, then the loss of moisture is like any other damage which is the result of that wrong done the plaintiff. The prayer was too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The cases in Pennsylvania show the distinction we have pointed out. In <em>Kistler </em>v. Thompson, 158 Pa. 139, 27 Atl. 874, the Court said: \u201cNothing could be more clear or more correct than the charge of the learned Court below to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>jury on all the legal aspects of the case.\u201d Judge Yc-Ilvaiwe, in the lower Court, in speaking of a spring which the plaintiff claimed was valuable to her property, said: \u201cIn 1889 this spring disapjDeared, and she alleges that the spring disapioeared by reason of the subsidence of the surface, and the cracking of it, on account of the support being withdrawn by those that mined the coal, they having failed to leave sufficient coal to support the surface.\u201d He then-went on to explain the duties and liabilities of the owner of the coal when the title to the surface is in another party, and he said he had the right to remove the coal, \u201cand if, in so doing, he should interfere with the hidden streams of water that may be running through the earth, and thus drain the spring o\u2019f another, he would not be liable for damages, if the spring-failed simply because, in the ordinary operation of the mine, some subterranean stream was tapped, and by this means the water, in place of flowing to the opening in the ground where the spring was, flowed to some other place.\u201d He then went on to say however, that notwithstanding his right to remove the coal, he is required to leave enough to support the surface, or if he takes all of it out, he must substitute sufficient supports to keep the surface in place, and he added: \u201cHow, if he fails to leave sufficient support, * * * and by reason of this failure to leave sufficient support the ground sinks, subsides and cracks, and that sinking and cracking divert a stream of water, then he would be liable, because that would be the direct result of his wrongfully withdrawing the support that is necessary and sufficient to sustain the surface.\u201d In <em>Rabe </em>v. <em>Shoenberger Coal </em>Co., 213 Pa. 252, 62 Atl. 854, annotated in 5 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. An. </em>Cases, 216, the plaintiff had a dairy farm which was usually well supplied with water. It had twelve springs on it, with water in every field. The plaintiff claimed that five of the springs were destroyed by the cracks in the land. The question was, \u201chow much was the farm depreciated in value by the loss of the springs?\u201d The controversy there was as to the measure of damages, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the Court expressed no doubt about the right to recover for the loss of the springs destroyed by the cracks in the land. In <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Berwind-White Coal Co., supra, </em>the rig\u2019ht of the plaintiff to recover for loss of springs, which resulted from the removal of the surface supports, was fully recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">So without further discussing that question we think there was no error in the rulings in the first and second bills of exception, or in rejecting the defendant\u2019s second prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We do not find any error in rejecting the sixth prayer. In the first place, Mr. Brophy, the president of the appellant company, who is a skilled and intelligent mining engineer and familiar with the property, testified that he did not know whether the removal of the coal by the Davis Coal and Coke Co. had any effect on this property. The jury certainly could have done nothing but make a pure guess on that subject. But regardless of that, the prayer does not exclude the defendant\u2019s participation in the injury. If the tendency was, as the piiayer proposed to submit to the jury, for the starta under the plaintiff\u2019s property, which dipped towards the land of the Davis Coal and Coke Co., on a grade of from ten to twenty feet in the hundred, to slip in that direction, there would seem to be all the more reason for the appellant to leave such support as was necessary to protect the surface of the plaintiff. It might be that with a surface of 350 or 400 feet, there would not ordinarily be so much damage by the excavation of six feet, but if that coal was so situated that upon the removal of the coal from the Davis Coal and Coke Company\u2019s property the ground would slide in that direction, the removal of the support in the Kearney property would probably be more disastrous than it would otherwise have been. So without further discussing that, we think the appellant got all it was entitled to by the granting of its third, fourth, fifth, eighth, tenth and eleventh prayers, and cannot complain of the rejection of its sixth, seventh and ninth prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Xor do we. think that the appellant was injured by the use of the word \u201cpremises\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s prayers, instead of in terms reminding the jury that the defendant owned the mineral rights. We cannot assume that a jury engaged in hearing a case for three or four days would not better understand what they were trying\u2014especially when other prayers, which were granted, explained it fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">It must be admitted that the rulings on the questions presented by the third and fourth exceptions and the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer were not so free from doubt as the others, but when they are carefully considered, they do not seem to be subject to the objections that have been urged against them. The question in the third exception was, \u201cWhat was the market value of that house of Mr. Kearney\u2019s before it was damaged by those breaks and falls ?\u201d Just before it was propounded to Mr. Duckworth, the witness, he had testified that, \u201cI am familiar with market value of houses in that vicinity, and have worked as a carpenter occasionally and am generally familiar with prices paid for houses of that kind. Have been in Kearney house before damage was done, walls were broken, plastering cracked and house out of plumb.\u201d He said in answer to the above question, \u201cWell, I suppose it was worth about $1,000.\u201d The question in the fourth bill of exceptions was, \u201cWhat was the value of the house at the time you examined it last fall by reason of the damage which was inflicted upon it by breaks and cracks in the walls?\u201d To which he answered, \u201cWell, I guess it would be about half the value. About $500.\u201d It will be observed that the last question was as to the value of the house by reason of the damage which was inflicted upon it by breaks and cracks in the walls. It was in reality simply an effort to show the depreciation by reason of the injuries, and the prayer, which we will ask the reporter to publish, directed the attention of the jury to that particular question.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">It was undoubtedly proper to show what the injuries to the house were. Its condition had been described by pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>vieras witnesses.. One of them had said, \u201cSince 1907 the Kearney house has been going down; the house is leaking, walls are cracked, base broken, foundations broken in several places, house two or three inches out of plumb?\u201d A sister of the plaintiff who had lived with him said, \u201cWe are not living in the house now, because it is dangerous. When we first came here, me and my mother and father and three brothers lived here, and now there is only me and my mother and my brother living here until last November. My brother remains in the house still * * *. We left it because it was dangerous, but my brother stays there in one room in the back of the house. We stood it as, long as we could. It has been getting worse ever since. In some places the cracks in the foundation were big enough for a wagon to pass through.\u201d That same witness testified, after speaking of the barn tipping over four or five inches, and also of another crack, \u201cAbout a year afterwards the house began to crack. It has kept up more or less ever since. J'ust a week ago the ground opened just below the house\u2014took several panels out of' the fence.\u201d Mr. Rrophy, the president of the defendant, said he had sent Mr. Fahey to the Kearney house and to the Wilson house (another one injured) and testified, \u201cI instructed him to wedge them up, and keep them in plumb, so as to do as little damage as possible. We felt that we were probably responsible for the damages, and were willing to make it good, but we did not repair it. They would not accept any settlement for repairs.\u201d There was testimony that the land alone had decreased in value $2,000 to $2,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">There was, therefore, ample evidence tending to show that the farm was seriously and permanently injured, and that the house was likewise not only seriously injured, but was, up to the time of the trial, continuing to crack and get worse. Under those circumstance it would seem strange if the law furnished no relief but repairing the house. There was apparently no attempt on the part of the defendant to show that it could be repaired. The statement of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Brophy above referred to rather indicates that it could not be, beyond possibly checking the damage, although no question was raised as to whether that could be or ought to have been done. If it could have been repaired, unquestionably a house on a tract.of fourteen acres, as fertile and productive as this was before the subsidence, would not be worth as much as it formerly was, when the tract was in such condition as the testimony shows this was in after the subsidence, and up to the trial was even getting worse. If the house had not been injured, it would not have been worth as much as it formerly was, when the land was cracking near it to the extent this was, the barn was injured, and the soil no longer fertile. Under all these circumstances there can be no doubt that the evidence showed that both the land and house were permanently injured, and it was practically impossible to restore the house to its former condition by repairs. Does the law then, under those circumstances, deny a recovery for the house for anything but the cost of repairs? Or, to state it another way, does the law require one whose house is thus injured, either to do a useless thing, or let the wrongdoer go unpunished? Eor, although those interested in the defendant doubtless greatly regret that the plaintiff was injured, and would not willingly have injured his property, the law treats the company as a wrongdoer, as it had no right to remove the supports.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">We have no case in this State applicable to such conditions. It is true that in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Werner, </em>40 Md. 15, which was an action for negligently injuring the plaintiff\u2019s house by digging too near the wall, while deepening the cellar on the adjoining lot, it was. said, \u201cThe action was for a <em>tort, </em>and the plaintiff was entitled to recover for all damages naturally or necessarily flowing from the wrongful acts of the defendants; and if his house was injured by the careless and negligent manner in which the appellants improved the adjoining house, he was entitled to recover such damages as would be sufficient to reinstate the wall and the house in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>as good condition as they were prior to the injury.\u201d And in <em>Con. Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Getty, </em>96 Md. 691, which was a suit for damages to a house, caused by an explosion of gas, the same rule was stated. But in neither of those cases was there any difficulty in restoring the house to its former condition. When that can be done, and the injured house can be put in as good condition as it was before the injury, it is undoubtedly the safer and better rule of damages, but when the injury is of a permanent character, and repairing will not condensate the owner for the injury it would' be a denial of justice to limit his recovery to something that would be of no practical use. As was said in the <em>Redemptorists </em>v. Wenig, 79 Md. 348: \u201cThe injury was, in the judgment of the witnesses, permanent, and thereby affecting the value of his land, and under such circumstances the jury had the right, in estimating the damages to taire into consideration the loss suffered by the appellee in the depreciation in the value of his land.\u201d In <em>Belt R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Sattler, </em>102 Md. 595, the distinction between permanent and temporary depreciation in the value of property is also recognized. So although, when repairs can restore the property to its former condition, that is the safe, and proper measure of damages, yet if the testimony shows that cannot be done, and at the same time jirstice be done to the injured one it is propen to adopt another rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The distinction is well illustrated by the Pennsylvania cases in actions of .this character. In <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Pardee, supra, </em>the plaintiff had erected a dwelling house\u2014\u201cthe ground under it and in the neighborhood subsided, leaving a saucer-like depression about three feet deep in the middle, and extending over about two acres.\u201d The Court said: \"If plaintiff be entitled to recover, his measure of damages is the actual loss he has sustained to his land, including the building thereon, by reason of the cave-in. _ The difference in the market value before and after the injury in this class of cases is not the true rule. In this case, under the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>deuce, perhaps it worked' no injustice; but in many cases it would do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">But in <em>Rabe </em>v. <em>Shoenberger Coal Co., supra, </em>the Court said: \u201cIt is sufficient to say that the sound rule is, that where there is a permanent injury to real estate, the extent of the damages caused thereby is to be measured by the resulting depreciation in the value of the property. Permanency of injury is the proper test for the application of this rule.\u201d It is true it is also said: \u201cThe principal injury of which complaint was made was the destruction of five springs of water. This injury was permanent and irremediable, as was also any damage to the surface which might render it less available for building purposes. Other injuries, such as the sinking of the dwelling house and the opening of cracks across the private right of way, were remediable. For the latter, the costs of repair or restoration is obviously the measure of the damage.\u201d But the Court pointed out the distinction and statecj clearly that when the injury was permanent the depreciation of the market value was the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Then in <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Berwind-White Coal Co., supra, </em>it was said: \u201cThe rule is settled that the measure of damages for permanent and irremediable injuries to land caused by failure to give surface support is the actual loss in the depreciation of the value thereof. The permanence of the injury is the test for the application of the rule, <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Pardee, </em>* * *. If the injury is reparable the cost of repairing maybe recovered, and if the cost of repairing is greater than the diminution in the market value, the latter is the true measure of damages. In all such cases just compensation for the loss sustained by the trespass is what the injured party is entitled to recover. When the injury is permanent, the measure of damages is the difference in market value before and after the injury\u201d\u2014citing <em>Vanderslice </em>v. Philadelphia, 103 Pa. 102; <em>Fulmer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>122 Pa. 191; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Fulmer, </em>151 Pa. 405; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Traction Co., </em>181 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>131. It then said: \u201cIn the case at bar the principal injury complained of was the destruction of the springs of water, although subsidence in the surface and disturbance of the buildings entered into the elements of damage claimed * * *. On the whole we think the testimony produced on the part of the plaintiff came fairly within this rule. It was directed to the point' of showing the actual loss to the owners by reason of injury to the surface, loss of the springs, and damage to the buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">There is a note to <em>Rabe </em>v. <em>Shoenberger Coal Co., </em>in 5 <em>A. &amp; E. An. </em>Cases, 219, where many cases on both sides are collected, and that author says: \u201cThe prevailing rule in the United States for measuring the damage to real property for an injury to its lateral or subjacent support, and the rule which formerly obtained in England, appears to be, as announced in the reported case, the diminution in the market \u25a0value of the property injured.\u201d In 18 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of </em>Law, 552, it is said,: \u201cIt has been held that the rule as to \u25a0the measure of damages where a building has been injured by the negligent removal of its lateral support is the same \u2022as where the recovery is for the removal of the support of the land in its natural state; that is, the measure of damages is the diminution ip value of the property injured, and not the cost of repairing or restoring it.\u201d In 13 <em>Cyc. </em>150, it is said: \u201cAs a general rule the measure of damages in actions for injuries to real property is the difference in value before and after the injury to the premises, although some of the Courts have considered the'measure of damages as the difference in the rental value of the property injured * * *. In some cases the cost of repair or restoration has been adopted as the measure of damages; but in such event the cost of repair must be reasonable and bear some proportion to the injury sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">This opinion has already reached such length that we will not cite other cases (many of which can be found in the references we have given), or discus.s the English cases, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>cept briefly to refer to <em>Tunnicliffe </em>v. <em>West Leigh Colliery Co. </em>(1906), 2 Ch. 22, and to that case in the House of Lords, where the parties names are reversed, (1908) A. C. 27. In the former the Court of Appeal held that in suits of this character, \u201cthe depreciation in the market value of the property attributable to the risk of future subsidence is a proper element of the damages recoverable.\u201d But in the latter, the House of Lords reversed the case, and adopted the contrary view and directed that the judgment of the lower Court be restored. In that judgment the learned Judge said: \u201cEven after the expenditure of the amount allowed by the official referee for repairs, the appearance and condition of both mills will be very different from what they were before the subsidence.\u201d The House of Lords approved of the action of the lower Court, and in the opinion of Lord Ashbourne he said: \u201cI am glad, however, to note that Swineen Eady, J., did not limit his judgment to the 1300\u00a3 for repairs, but has sanctioned a reference back to the official referee to \u2018assess the damages in respect of depreciation of the premises.\u2019 As the learned Judge says: \u2018A mill which has been much cracked and injured, and with walls bulging and out of plumb, although repaired, is manifestly not of the same selling value as before it was injured. The repairs are very far from entirely reinstating it, and the loss to the plaintiffs is the same, whether the mill be sold and the loss realized, or whether the mill be retained by the plaintiffs, its value being reduced'.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">As will be seen by one of the cases cited above <em>(Weaver's case), </em>and there are many others to the same effect: \u201cIf the injury is reparable the cost of repairing may.be recovered, and if the cost of repairing is greater than the diminution in the market value, the latter is the true measure of damages.\u201d So in a case where the cost of repairing exceeds or approaches (as indicated by the evidence) the diminution in the market value, it must be relevant to prove that value, for otherwise there would be no way of determining whether the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>requiring was greater than the diminution in value, and hence for that reason it was not error to allow it to be proved\u2014indeed justice to the defendant might require it, under the above rule, if the cost of repairing exceeded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">So under all the circumstances we are of the opinion that there was no reversible error in admitting the testimony embraced in the third and fourth bills of exception, and that the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer was sufficiently guarded to prevent doing the defendant injustice. As the testimony shows that the injury to the land is not only of a permanent character, but depreciates the value considerably more than one-half, which of itself must affect the value of the house, and as it also shows, with no evidence to the contrary, that the house was permanently injured, and was still continuing to develop such conditions as to make repairs of little, if of any, use, we are of the opinion that the difference between the market value of the premises (taken as a whole), before the injury and their present market value, in so far as the jury found it \u201chas been reduced by injuries to the surface and to the improvements thereon,\u201d was the correct measure of damages. It follows that the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed, <em>the appellant to pay the costs, above and, below.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
