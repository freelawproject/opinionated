In such case, a Court of equity would -enjoin the prosecution of a suit or the enforcement of a judgment on the writing obligatory, and consequently the plea is good by way of equitable defense.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b502-11\">When the question is whether certain oyster lots sold by the plaintiff to the defendant were within' the State of Maryland or in the State of Virginia, a witness may be asked where the lots are located, where the line runs between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>two States in the waters where the oyster grounds in question were situated, and what was recognized by the community generally as the dividing line between the two States.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJl\">Hearsay testimony and evidence of general reputation are admissible to show what the boundaries of land are.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>Decided January 11th, 1911.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-6\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Worcester County (Jokes and Toadvih, JJ.).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b503-7\">The cause was argued before Botd, C.

The 'defendants then called Turner F. Disharoon, one of the defendants, \u201cwho testified that prior to the execution and delivery of the aforesaid bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>obligatory to the plaintiff, the latter wanted to sell and we wanted to buy certain oyster grounds near Ohincoteague Isl- and, and he represented to the witness the said oyster grounds were within the waters of Maryland, and induced the defendants to purchase the said oyster grounds, on the faith of plaintiff\u2019s representations that they were located in the State of Maryland, and that upon this representation and inducement so made the defendants signed and delivered the aforesaid bill obligatory to the plaintiff in settlement of the purchase money therefor; and that all the parties to this case were, at the time of the purchase of said oyster grounds as aforesaid, and ever since have been, residents of the State of Maryland.\u201d The witness was then asked the following question: \u201cAs a matter of fact where are said oyster grounds located? State to the Court, if you can?\u201d The plaintiff objected to the question, and the Court refused to allow the witness to answer. The witness was .then asked the following question: \u201cState, if you know, the line between the State of Maryland and the State of Virginia, in the waters where the oyster grounds which you purchased of Mr. Waters are located?\u201d and upon objection by the plaintiff the Court refused to allow the question to be answered. The witness was then asked the further question: \u201cState, if you know, what is recognized by the community generally in the neighborhood where these oyster lots are located as the line dividing the waters over there, the State of Maryland from the State of Virginia?\u201d and the objection of the plaintiff to this question was also sustained by the Court. The witness was further asked the following question: \u201cState, if you know, the division line between the State of Maryland and the State of Virginia in the waters where said oyster grounds are located, and if yea, state whether or not said oyster grounds are on the Virginia side or on the Maryland side of said line ?\u201d but the Court refused to permit the question to be answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Ho further evidence was offered, and the finding and judgment of the Court was in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The only exceptions in the record are to the rulings of the Court below to which we have referred, and we think there was error in its refusal to allow the questions to be answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In the second plea the defendants relied upon fraud, and the third plea, as we understand it, set up the equitable defense of a total failure of consideration for the writing obligatory. It is said in 3 <em>Pomeroy\u2019s Equity, </em>sec. 1293 (2 ed.): \u201cEquity will never enforce an executory agreement unless there was an <em>actual </em>valuable consideration; and, unlike the common law, it does not permit a seal to supply the place of a real consideration. Disregarding mer\u00e9 forms, and looking at the reality, it requires an actual valuable consideration as essential in every such agreement, and allows the want of it to be shown, notwithstanding the seal, in the enforcement of covenants, settlements and executory contracts of every description.\u201d In <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>10 Md. 412, Hobbs agreed to sell to Bussard a house and lot in Montgomery County, and Bussard agreed to pay therefor the sum of eleven hundred and fifty dollars. \u25a0 At the time of the contract Hobbs was not seized of the property and never acquired title thereto. The single bill given by Bussard for the sum he agreed to pay for the property came due and Hobbs obtained judgment thereon. Pending the suit on the single bill, a bill was filed for an injunction to restrain the proceedings at law, the injunction was granted, but was subsequently dissolved, and from the latter order the complainant appealed. In disposing of the case Chief Judge LeGkahd said: \u201cIn regard to such a case as this, it appears to us there ought to be no doubt on the mind of anyone as to what should be the decision on obvious principles of equity and common sense. It presents simply this question, whether a person may sell a thing to which he has no title, and recover the purchase money without transferring the title to the thing sold? It would seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>that the hare stating' of the question is to resolve it in the \u25a0 negative. * The contract is an <em>unexecuted </em>one. In speaking of such an one, the Court in <em>Buchanan </em>v. Lorman, 3 Gill, 77, hold the following language which is conclusive of this case: \u2018A vendee of an estate in an unexecuted contract is entitled to have that for which he contracts, before he can be compelled to part with the consideration he agreed to pay.\u2019 \u201d In conclusion the Court said: \u201cWe think the Circuit Court erred in not continuing the injunction to the whole claim.\u201d If the plaintiff had no title to the oyster lots in question, and did not convey them to the defendants, a Court of Equity would enjoin the collection of the writing obligatory sued on, and the third plea sets up a good equitable defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In order to establish this defense, it was necessary to show that the lots were located in the State of Virginia, and we see no objection to any of the questions objected to. It is a uniform practice in this State in the trial of criminal cases, in order to show the jurisdiction of the Court, to ask a witness where the crime was committed. The answer to such a question necessarily involves a knowledge on the part of the witness of the limits of the county or city within which the case is being tried. This character of evidence is not conclusive, of course, and it may be shown that the witness does not know the boundaries of the particular county or city. In 1 <em>Greenleaf on Ev., </em>sec. 136 (13th ed.), the learned author says: \u201cIn matters of public right, all persons are presumed to possess that degree of knowledge which serves to give some weight to their declarations concerning them, because all have a common interest.\u201d The witness was properly allowed to state that he and the plaintiff resided in the State of ^Maryland, which necessarily involved some knowledge of the boundaries of the State. Hpon the same principle he should have been permitted to answer the first, second and fourth questions.. As a further ilustration of the numerous exceptions to the rule against hearsay evidence, a witness may testify to his own age. 1 <em>Ency. of Ev., </em>735. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>It is said in 1 <em>Greenleaf on Ev., </em>sec 430k: \u201cIn strictness, a person\u2019s belief as to his own age rests upon hearsay only, not on actual observation and recollection. Nevertheless, such belief, sufficient as it is for action in the practical affairs of life, ought also be admissible to judicial inquiries, and such is the conclusion generally accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">It is now the settled rule that boundaries may be established hy hearsay testimony and by general reputation, and for that reason the evidence referred to in the third bill of exceptions was admissible. In the case of <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Tilghman, </em>111 Md. 227, the Court said: \u201cDefendants-\u2019 fifth prayer permitted the jury to consider the evidence of the \u2018general understanding and reputation among the owners, neighbors and others who have been tenants or employes on the said respective lands as to which is the line between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 lands,\u2019 and we think there was no error in the legal proposition asserted.\u201d In <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Shuey, 5 </em>Md. 540, \u201cit was objected that the line, boundaries, and location of Greyhound Forest could not be established by general reputation, but the Court overruled the objection.\u201d In the case of <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Packer, </em>125 U. S. 309, Me. Justice Lamab quotes the statement of Me. Justice McLean, in <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Lessees of Reed, </em>6 Pet. 328: \u201cThat boundaries may be proved by hearsay testimony is a rule well settled; and the necessity or propriety of which is not now questioned.'- Some difference of opinion may exist as to the application of this rule, but there can he none as xo its legal force.\u201d See also 1 <em>Greenleaf on Ev., </em>sec 128 (16 ed.); 2 <em>Ency. of Ev., </em>722-723.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">For the reasons we have stated the judgment of the Court below must be reversed and the case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellants, mid a new trial awarded</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
