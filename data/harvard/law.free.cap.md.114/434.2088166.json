In such case it is not necessary that the plaintiff\u2019s title to the land should be fully stated in the bill, nor that evidence of the title should be filed as an exhibit.

The bill asked for an injunction.

It is alleged, and admitted by the demurrer, that she is in possession of the premises exposed to the nuisance which is threatened by the defendants\u2019 wrongful acts, and that she is in the actual use of the drain with which they have unwarrantably interfered. If her right to the relief sought could be held to be depen lent upon her title, there would he no question as to the necessity for clear and certain allegations as to that essential fact and for the production, if procurable, of an appropriate exhibit. But a bare possessor of property is entitled to he protected against a mere trespasser without reference to the question of title. This principle has been repeatedly applied in actions of trespass at law; <em>Tyson </em>v. Shuey, 5 Md. 540; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Hinsley, </em>13 Md. 64; <em>New Windsor </em>v. <em>Stocksdale, </em>95 Md. 196; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Md. &amp; Pa. R. Co., 112 </em>Md. 599; <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Lapp, </em>113 Md. 324; and it is equally applicable to suits in equity where the conditions are such in other respects as to justify the granting of equitable relief. 28 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. Law, </em>2nd Ed., 595, 573; 2 <em>Waterman on Trespass, </em>346, 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The rule in reference to the filing of exhibits in proceed ings of this nature is that \u201cwhere the right to an injunction is based upon a written instrument in the possession of the complainant, or to which he has ready access, the instrn ment itself, or a copy, ought to be filed with the hill, in order that the Court may see whether the complainant is entitled to the relief prayed.\u201d <em>Baltimore </em>v. <em>Keyser, </em>72 Md. 115; <em>Gottschalk </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>69 Md. 51; <em>Nagengast </em>v. <em>Alz, </em>93 Md. 525. But where such a necessity is not present the production of exhibits is not required. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Ridgely, </em>38 Md. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In the case now under consideration the reason for the rule stated does not- exist, because the plaintiff\u2019s equity does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>not depend upon any documentary or other evidence of title or ownership hut is fully supported by the fact of her possession of the premises and appurtenant drain in reference to which the trespass charged against the defendants is alleged to have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The case of <em>Stinson </em>v. <em>Ellicott City &amp; Clarksville Turnpike Co., </em>109 Md. 111, specially relied upon by the appellants in this connection, involved a question of title, and the plaintiff relied in her bill upon a grant which was not authenticated by an exhibit. In that situation the rule was plainly enforceable; but in the present case we find no ground upon which it can be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">It is urged that the bill of complaint does not clearly show the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the drain affected by 1he trespass, as to whether it amounts to ownership or merely to a right of user. This distinction, under the circumstances, is entirely immaterial. The plaintiff has alleged her possession of the premises to which the drain is appurtenant and her actual user of the drain for many years, and that the defendants without lawful right, but wilfully intending to trespass on the property of the plaintiff, have made the connection described in the bill. The possession thus alleged, and admitted by the demurrer, to have been wrongfully invaded by the defendants, must be regarded as including at least an easement in the drain, and as such it is entitled to protection by a Court of Equity. <em>Jay </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>92 Md. 198; <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Caples, </em>17 Md. 183; <em>Roman </em>v. <em>Strauss, </em>10 Md. 89; 14 <em>Cyc., </em>1223, 1219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The remaining objection offered to the bill is that its averments are vague and uncertain in respect to the particular injury of which the plaintiff complains as a result of the alleged trespass. It is a familiar rule that the facts upon which reliance is placed for relief by injunction must be clearly stated. <em>Miller\u2019s Eq. Proc., </em>687. We think, however, that in this case the rule has been substantially observed-The bill describes the conditions existing prior to the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of the drain by the defendants. It shows that even then the capacity of the drain was overtaxed, and that repeated stoppages and overflows occurred producing special damage to the plaintiff by reason of the lower grade of her property as compared with the adjoining premises. The charge is then distinctly made that the defendants\u2019 wrongful and extensive appropriation of the use of the drain has increased its liability to become choked and to discharge its contents upon the plaintiff\u2019s lot, and that she is thus exposed to the danger of recurring nuisances. We have no doubt as to the sufficiency of these allegations to entitle the plaintiff to relief by injunction. It is not necessary that she should, wait for the actual occurrence of the injury which it is thus shown may be reasonably anticipated. <em>Brauer </em>v. <em>Refrigerating Co., </em>99 Md. 381, and it is obvious that an action at law would not afford an adequate remedy, <em>Long </em>v. <em>Ragan, </em>94 Md. 464; <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Ritter, </em>7 Md. 408; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>30 Md. 29; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>14 Md. 156. The demurrer to the bill of complaint was, therefore, properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In its decree, thus disposing of the demurrer, the Court below granted immediately and in absolute terms the writ of injunction as prayed in the bill, without providing an opportunity for the filing of an answer. There is no suggestion in\u2018the record, and none was given in the argument, as to the reason for this action, but as it involves a departure from the established practice and the requirements of the Equity Rule of this Court on the subject, it is necessary that the decree be reversed in this particular. It is provided by Rule Eo. 22, embodied in the Code as section 153 of Article 16, that \u201cif upon the hearing, any plea or demurrer is overruled unless the Court or judge thereof hearing the same be satisfied that it was intended for-vexation and delay, the defendant shall be required to answer the bill, or so much thereof as may be covered by the plea or demurrer, at such time as, consistently with justice and the rights of the defendant, the same can be reasonably done;- in default whereof, the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>shall be taken, as against him, <em>pro confesso, </em>and the matter thereof proceeded in and decreed accordingly; and such decree shall also be made when the Court or judge thereof shall be satisfied that the plea or demurrer was interposed for vexation or delay merely, and is frivolous or unfounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The demurrer in this case was accompanied by an affidavit that it was not intended for delay, and the decree does not indicate that the truth of this statement was doubted by the Court. TVe see nothing in the record or in the character of the demurrer to disentitle the defendants to their right to answer the bill and be heard on the merits in accordance with the rule quoted and the uniform practice. <em>Stinson </em>v. <em>Ellicott, etc., Co., </em>109 Md. 114; <em>Trego </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>42 Md. 426; <em>Miller's Eq. Proc., </em>174.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The cause will be remanded in order that this opportunity may be afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed in part and reversed in part and cause remanded, the appellee to pay the costs of this appeal, the costs below to abide the result of the suit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
