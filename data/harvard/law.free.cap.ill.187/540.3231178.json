The decree there rendered was in conformity with the prayer of petitioner as to the interpretation and construction of the will, finding, in effect, that under each clause the devisees \"who took the estate were the persons who, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, were the heirs, generally, of the ancestors named in the several items. From that decree this appeal is prosecuted, and the only construction here insisted upon by the appellants, different from that placed upon it by the chancellor, is* that under the language, \u201cto the legal and direct descendants,\u201d all who have descended directly from the ancestors named in items 2, 3 and 4 take as devisees, and that the several gifts are not affected by the subsequent words, \u201cthe heirs of their bodies begotten and their heirs.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b544-5\" pgmap=\"544(168) 545(165)\">Although the rights of appellants arise under item 3 of the will, in construing the several gifts it will be sufficient for the present to give attention, first, to item 2, the language of .each, except the last, being in substance the same. What is the proper construction to be given to the language of this item, \u201cI give and bequeath to the legal and direct descendants\u2014the heirs of their bodies begotten and their heirs\u2014of my eldest brother, William P. Lancaster, and his wife, Mary Lancaster, (now both deceased,) the one-fourth part of my estate so divided as above mentioned?\u201d The clause \u201cto the legal and direct descendants,\u201d would, if standing alone, undoubtedly be interpreted as designating a large class; but it is clearly qualified by the language which follows: \u201cThe heirs of their bodies begbtten and their heirs.\u201d This latter clause is a parenthetical expression, and is to be understood as explaining or qualifying the clause immediately preceding. Interpreted as such parenthetical clauses are generally understood, the sentence would read as though it had been written, \u201cI give and bequeath to the legal and direct descendants,\u2014that is to say, the heirs of their bodies and their heirs,\u2014of my eldest brother, William P. Lancaster, and his wife,\u201d etc. This construction is made without adding to the language employed, but by simply setting out in words what is actually expressed by the grammatical construction and punctuation of the sentence. Nor does it result in rejecting the first clause, as claimed by appellants, but it gives effect to both clauses. \u201cThe heirs of their bodies\u201d are, in fact, \u201clegal and direct descendants,\u201d but it cannot be said that all the \u201clegal and direct descendants\u201d are \u201cheirs of their bodies.\u201d The interpretation insisted upon by appellants would necessarily reject the second clause, and violate the well known general rule of construction which requires the giving effect to every part of a written instrument in its interpretation, if it can be done.</p> <p id=\"b545-5\" pgmap=\"545(195) 546(208)\">The next consideration is, who, under the foregoing construction, shall take under item 2 of the will? Manifestly, only those who, singly or as a class, come within the description of \u201cheirs of the bodies\u201d of the ancestors named. Being a simple devise to a class, and the will not expressly or by necessary implication fixing a time when the devisees are to be ascertained or when the division is to be made, the law will fix it at the testator\u2019s death, that being the time when the will first speaks. (McCartney v. Osburn, 118 Ill. 403. See, also, Kellett v. Shepard, 139 id. 433.) From the evidence in the record we find the only person living at the testator\u2019s death who comes within the description \u201cheirs of the bodies\u201d of William P. and Mary Lancaster, to be the defendant John E. Lancaster, the son. The decree below, however, divides the part of the estate mentioned in that item into two parts, giving one to John E. Lancaster and the other to the heirs, generally, of his deceased sister, Mrs. Jane Grubbs, they being the only children of the ancestors mentioned: and it is contended by appellee that the estate should be divided, according to the Statute of Descent, among the heirs, generally,-of the ancestors mentioned in the several items. The position cannot be sustained. Jane Grubbs was living at the time of the making of the will but not at the date of the testator\u2019s death, and was therefore not in being at the time the estate vested. Had the devise been to Jane Grubbs and John E. Lancaster, specifically, as \u201cthe heirs of the bodies\u201d of the ancestors, then the share of Mrs. Grubbs, she being dead at the time of the vesting of the estate, would have lapsed, and her heirs generally, even in that case, could not have taken. The devise here being to a class, the death of one of them before the testator will not cause a lapse of any part of the gift, \u201cbut those of the described class who survive the testator will take the whole.\u201d (Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 13,\u20141st ed.\u201433, and cases cited.) John E. Lancaster is the sole person coming within the designated class, and the children and grandchildren of Mrs. Grubbs can by no proper construction of the will be included therein.</p> <p id=\"b546-5\" pgmap=\"546\">It is unnecessary to enter into a discussion of items 3 and 4 of the will, as the language of each is the same as in item 2, and the same rules of construction and interpretation necessarily apply. Item 5 is unlike the others, but it is a direct gift for life to Mrs. Edmonia P. Guard, with remainder to the class named in that devise. (See Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1897, sec. 6, p. 391.) The life estate being at an end, Mrs. Guard having died, the \u201cheirs of her body\u201d living at the death of the testator take that part of the estate, and take it not as her heirs generally, but by virtue of the original gift to them as a class, to be ascertained when the will should take effect.</p> <p id=\"b546-6\" pgmap=\"546\">For the error indicated the decree below will be reversed and the cause remanded, with direction to the superior court to make partition of the lands in conformity with the views herein expressed.</p> <p id=\"b546-7\" pgmap=\"546\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
