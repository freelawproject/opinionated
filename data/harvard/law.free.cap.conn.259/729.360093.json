We answer both questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The District Court\u2019s certification order reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The plaintiff, Michael Perodeau, Sr., is employed by the named defendant, the city of Hartford (city), in its police department. He is a single parent. The individual defendants, Joseph Croughwell, Robert Casati, Paul Cherniak and James Blanchette, were at all relevant times, respectively, the chief, the deputy chief, a sergeant and a lieutenant in the Hartford police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The plaintiff was hired by the Hartford police department as a police officer in 1979. In 1989, he was promoted to detective in the narcotics division. In 1992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>he transferred from the narcotics division to the evidentiary services division where he worked until January, 1998, when the department transferred him to the north police services area as a burglary detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The plaintiff claims that his transfer to the north police services area was in response to his alleged refusal to be available for callbacks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He contends that Cherniak, his direct supervisor, falsely and maliciously claimed that he refused nine callbacks from July, 1997, to December, 1997. The plaintiff also claims that it was a policy and custom of the evidentiary services division to accommodate officers when they could not cover a callback shift, that many officers in other divisions were allowed to limit their availability to work callback shifts when they had business or family demands, and that female and single mother officers in other divisions were not forced to take callbacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">In June, 1998, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the commission on human rights and opportunities against the city, Casati and Cherniak, alleging age and sex discrimination. In the present case, the plaintiff claims that Blanchette subsequently retaliated against him for filing the complaint by verbally disparaging him in front of other officers and by falsely accusing him of smoking in a photography laboratory at the police department. The plaintiff also claims that all of the defendants condoned or acquiesced in his wrongful treatment, refused to protect him from harassment and unlawful discipline, and refused to ascertain the true facts and to punish wrongdoers.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">On April 30, 1999, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the District Court alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>(Sup. 1999)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the individual defendants; violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by the city; violations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by all of the defendants; retaliation by all of the defendants; violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 46a-60 by all of the defendants; negligent infliction of emotional distress by all of the defendants; and intentional infliction of emotional distress by all of the defendants. The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs claim against the city pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; his claim against the individual defendants pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq.; his claim against the individual defendants pursuant to \u00a7 46a-60; and his claims of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress as to all of the defendants. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to all claims except the claim against the individual defendants pursuant to \u00a7 46a-60 and the claim against the individual defendants for negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to those claims, the District Court recognized that this court has never considered whether \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) imposes liability on individual employees or whether individual employees may be held liable for negligent infliction of emotional distress for conduct arising in a continuing employment relationship. Accordingly, the District Court certified those questions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">We first consider whether \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) imposes liability on individual employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>tends that, because the term \u201cemployer\u201d in \u00a7 46a-60 is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 (10)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>to encompass any \u201cperson,\u201d which is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 (14)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to include an individual, an individual employee may be liable for violations of \u00a7 46a-60. This contention is contingent upon his claim that the phrase \u201cwith three or more persons in his employ\u201d in \u00a7 46a-51 (10) modifies only the word \u201cemployer\u201d and not the word \u201cperson.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Whether \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) imposes liability on individual employees is a matter of statutory interpretation \u201cover which this court\u2019s review is plenary. ... In construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>mon law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>252 Conn. 79, 84, 743 A.2d 156 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">We begin our analysis with a review of the relevant statutory provisions. Section 46a-60 (a) (1) provides in relevant part that \u201c [i]t shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section . . . [f]or an employer, by himself or his agent, except in the case of a bona fide occupational qualification or need, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment any individual or to discriminate against him in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of the individual\u2019s race, color, religious creed, age, sex, marital status, national origin, ancestry, present or past history of mental disorder, mental retardation, learning disability or physical disability, including, but not limited to blindness . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 (10) provides that the term \u201c \u2018[ejmployer\u2019 includes the state and all political subdivisions thereof and means any person or employer with three or more persons in his employ . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 (14) provides in relevant part that the term \u201c l[p]erson\u2019 means one or more individuals . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">\u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). \u201cTo ascertain the commonly approved usage of a word, it is appropriate to look to the dictionary definition of the term.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>250 Conn. 188, 200 n.12, 736 A.2d 790 (1999). The dictionary defines the word \u201cemployer\u201d to mean \u201c[o]ne who employs, esp. for wages or salary . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.). It would defy common sense to conclude that the legislature intended in \u00a7 46a-51 (10) to change the common meaning of the word \u201cemployer\u201d to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>\u201cpersons\u201d who do not employ anyone, while excluding \u201cemployers\u201d who employ fewer than three employees. Indeed, the very fact that the legislature used the term \u201cemployer\u201d within its definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in \u00a7 46a-51 (10) indicates that it intended the word to have its common meaning, and that the definition was intended merely to narrow the class of \u201cemployers\u201d\u2014understood in its ordinary sense\u2014to which the Fair Employment Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 et seq., applies. Otheiwise, the definition would be internally inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">We further note that the legislature recently amended \u00a7 46a-51 (10) by substituting the phrase \u201cperson\u2019s or employer\u2019s\u201d for the word \u201chis,\u201d so that, effective October 1, 2001, that section provides: \u201c \u2018Employer\u2019 includes the state and all political subdivisions thereof and means any person or employer with three or more persons in <em>such person\u2019s or employer\u2019s </em>employ . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 2001, No. 01-28, \u00a7 1. The legislative history is silent on the reason for this change, but we reasonably may assume that it was made to render the language of the statute gender neutral, and not to change the scope of the statute. In light of this fact, it appears that the legislature intended the term \u201chis\u201d in the prior version of the statute to mean \u201cperson\u2019s or employer\u2019s.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase \u201cwith three or more persons in his employ\u201d in \u00a7 46a-51 (10) was intended to modify both \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cemployer\u201d and, consequently, that \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) does not impose liability on individual employees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">In support of our conclusion, we note that when the legislature has intended for the provisions of the Fair Employment Practices Act to apply to persons other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>than employers, it has made its intention clear. For example, in \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (4), (5) and (6),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by contrast to \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1), the legislature specifically referred to persons as well as to employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The weight of federal authority further bolsters our conclusion that individuals who are not employers may not be held liable under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1). This court previously has recognized that in construing the Fair Employment Practices Act \u201cwe are properly guided by the case law surrounding federal fair employment legislation . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 108, 653 A.2d 782 (1995). The majority of the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals that have considered the issue, including the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, have concluded that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (b), which defines \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201ca person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees . . . and any agent of such a person,\u201d does not provide for individual liability.

Ct. 666, 130 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1994) (holding that similar definition of employer in Age Discrimination in Employment Act; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq.; does not provide for individual liability); but <em>see Paroline v. Unisys Corp., </em>879 F.2d 100, 104 (4th Cir. 1989) (when employee exercises sufficient supervisory authority over plaintiff, employee is employer for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e [b]), aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, 900 F.2d 27 (1990); <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>791 F.2d 439, 442-43 (5th Cir. 1986) (person is agent of employer if person participated in decision-making process that forms basis of discrimination and agent is individually liable).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In <em>Tomka </em>v. <em>Seiler Corp., </em>supra, 66 F.3d 1314, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the plaintiffs argument that individual employees who are agents of an employer may be held individually liable, concluding that it was \u201cinconceivable that a Congress concerned with protecting small employers would simultaneously allow civil liability to run against individual employees.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., citing <em>Miller v. Maxwell\u2019s International, Inc., </em>supra, 991 F.2d 587 n.2; see <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>F.3d 901 (same); <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Lone Star Co., </em>supra, 21 F.3d 652 (same). The court in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Maxwell\u2019s International, Inc., </em>supra, 587, had concluded that \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of this [agent] provision was to incorporate respondeat superior liability into the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3:96CV01987 (D. Conn. July 16, 1997), however, the court distinguished \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) from the federal statute. Specifically, the court concluded that, because the federal statute applies to employers with fifteen or more employees, while \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) applies to employers with three or more employees, the inconsistency, noted in <em>Tomka, </em>between protecting small employers while allowing individual employees to be sued, did not arise under the Connecticut statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also <em>Lueneburg </em>v. <em>Mystic Dental Group, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New London, Docket No. 535839 (August 1, 1996) (17 Conn. L. Rptr. 219, 221), amended (August 22,1996) (17 Conn. L. Rptr. 409) (concluding that because \u00a7 46a-60 [a] [1] \u201cimposes liability on business entities with very small numbers of employees, there was no intent by the legislature to protect supervisory employees from individual liability\u201d). We do not agree. Both the Congress and the Connecticut legislature have evinced an intention to protect employers with fewer than a certain number of employees from suit under their respective fair employment statutes. The reasoning in <em>Tomka </em>is no less compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>merely because that number is smaller under the Connecticut statute than under the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">We recognize that the ambiguity in the federal statute arises from the phrase \u201cand any agent of such a person\u201d; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (b); and not from any analog to the phrase \u201cperson or employer\u201d in \u00a7 46a-51 (10), on which the plaintiff in this case exclusively relies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we conclude that the reasoning of the federal cases concerning the individual liability of agents is equally applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s argument that \u201cpersons\u201d who are not employers may be held liable under \u00a7 46a-60 (a). If it is incongruous to hold an employer\u2019s agent individually liable, it is equally incongruous to hold an employee who is not an agent liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Our review of case law from other jurisdictions construing state statutes similar to \u00a7 46a-51 (10)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and \u00a7 46a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>60 (a) (1) also bolsters our conclusion. The majority of courts that have considered the issue have concluded that individuals may not be held hable under the relevant state\u2019s employment discrimination statute.

The statute under review in that case defined \u201c \u2018[ejmployer\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany person regularly employing five or more persons, or any person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly . . . .\u201d Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12926 (d) (Deering Sup. 2001). The court first noted that California courts often look to federal cases construing federal discrimination law for guidance in interpreting the state statute and that, in a previous case, the California Court of Appeal had recognized the \u201c \u2018clear and growing consensus\u2019 \u201d among the federal courts that individuals may not be held liable. <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>supra, 648; <em>Janken </em>v. <em>GM Hughes Electronics, </em>46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 67, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996). It concluded, as we have, that the reasoning of those cases\u2014that it would be incongruous to exempt small employers from liability while imposing liability on individual nonemployers\u2014was equally applicable to the California statute. <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>supra, 662-63. It also concluded that the legislature did not intend for individuals to be subject \u201cto the ever-present threat of a lawsuit each time they make a personnel decision.\u201d Id., 663. Accordingly, the court held that individuals could not be held liable under California\u2019s employment discrimination law.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The court in <em>Reno </em>also noted that the California Court of Appeal previously had rejected the \u201cchamber of horrors\u201d argument that barring individual liability would \u201copen the floodgates of discrimination, would give supervisors a free pass to discriminate, would liberate supervisors to discriminate with impunity, and the like. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 654, quoting <em>Janken </em>v. <em>GM Hughes Electronics, </em>supra, 46 Cal. App. 4th 76. That argument was also rejected in <em>Lenhardt </em>v. <em>Basic Institute of Technology, Inc., </em>supra, 55 F.3d 381. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Both the <em>Janken </em>court and the <em>Lenhardt </em>court concluded that \u201c[a]n employer subjected to well-founded claims of employment discrimination as a result of an employee\u2019s intentional acts of discrimination is not likely to look favorably upon the offending employee. To the contrary, the employer, to protect its own interests and to avoid further liability, almost certainly will impose some form of discipline upon the offending employee. That discipline may include a free pass to the unemployment line, a result that would seem particularly likely if the employee engages in repeated acts of intentional discrimination against fellow employees.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>supra, 18 Cal. 4th 654-55, quoting <em>Janken </em>v. <em>GM Hughes Electronics, </em>supra, 76-77, and <em>Lenhardt </em>v. <em>Basic Institute of Technology, Inc., </em>supra, 381. We find this reasoning persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 46a-60a (a) (1) does not impose liability on individual employees. Accordingly, we answer the first certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">We next consider whether an individual municipal employee may be found liable for negligent infliction of emotional distress arising out of actions or omissions occurring within the context of a continuing employment relationship, as distinguished from actions or omissions occurring in the termination of employment. We decline to extend that tort so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Before addressing the merits of this question, however, we must consider a threshold question, namely, whether, in excluding emotional distress claims that do not arise from physical injury or occupational disease from the compensability provisions of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\u00a7 31-275 et seq., the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), the legislature indicated an intent to preclude such claims altogether. The plaintiff asserts that, because his claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is not compensable under the act, he is not barred by the exclusivity provisions of the act from making this claim. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-284 and 31-293a.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We first note that \u00a7 31-293a provides that the act applies only \u201c[i]f an employee . . . has a right to benefits or compensation under this chapter on account of injury . . . .\u201d In this case, the plaintiff has no right to compensation for his alleged emotional injury under the act. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, the plain language of the act indicates that its exclusivity provisions do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">We also note that, although this court previously has not considered directly the question of whether an employee may bring a common-law tort claim for an emotional injury arising out of his employment that is not covered by the act, we addressed it indirectly in <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>General Nutrition Corp., </em>252 Conn. 215, 752 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>A.2d 1069 (2000). In that case, the plaintiff, who had been sexually assaulted in her workplace, sought to bring a claim against her employer for negligent infliction of emotional distress. We concluded that the plaintiffs emotional injury arose from the physical assault upon her and that the injury was, therefore, covered by the act. Id., 226. It is clear from our analysis in that case, however, that we assumed that, if the injury had not been compensable under the act, the plaintiff would have been entitled to bring a common-law tort claim against her employer. Id., 223-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In addition, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut has concluded in a number of cases that tort actions for emotional injuries that are not compensable under the act are not barred by the exclusivity provisions of the act. See <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Circuit-Wise, Inc., </em>130 F. Sup. 2d 341, 345-46 (D. Conn. 2001) (claim for emotional injuries that did not arise from physical touchings not barred by act); <em>Bimler v. Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., </em>965 F. Sup. 292, 302 (D. Conn. 1997) (claim for damages for emotional distress arising out of termination of employment not barred by act); <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Beiersdorf, Inc., </em>889 F. Sup. 46, 51 (D. Conn. 1995) (dismissing negligent infliction of emotional distress claim without prejudice to plaintiff to replead so as to exclude injuries for which act provides remedy); but see <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>896 F. Sup. 78, 84 (D. Conn. 1994) (claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is precluded by act); <em>Vorvis </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>821 F. Sup. 851, 856 (D. Conn. 1993) (same). Likewise, a number of Connecticut courts have determined that tort actions for noncompensable emotional injuries are not barred by the act. See <em>Karanda </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV 98582025S (May 10, 1999) (24 Conn. L. Rptr. 521) (employee may bring common-law tort action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>against employer for mental or emotional impairment arising out of and in course of employment that does not arise from physical injury or occupational disease); <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Devereux Foundation, Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Litchfield, Docket No. CV 950067464 (September 6,1995) (same); <em>Stepney </em>v. <em>Devereux Foundation, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Litchfield, Docket No. CV 0065885 (July 17, 1995) (14 Conn. L. Rptr. 483) (same); <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport, Docket No. CV 920295633 (Januaiy 12, 1993) (same); cf. <em>Fulco </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., 21 </em>Conn. App. 800, 807-809, 609 A.2d 1034 (1992), appeal dismissed, 226 Conn. 404, 627 A.2d 931 (1993) (claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress arising out of termination not barred by act because termination does not arise out of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In <em>Stepney </em>v. <em>Devereux Foundation, </em>supra, 14 Conn. L. Rptr. 485, the trial court reasoned that \u201c [t]he Workers\u2019 Compensation Act compromises an employee\u2019s right to a common-law tort action for work-related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation. . . . When an injuiy is expressly excluded from coverage under the act, the employe [e]\u2019s right to pursue a common-law remedy for the injury is no longer compromised. The exclusivity provided by the workers\u2019 compensation statute is a quid pro quo, and a right of action should only be deemed taken away from an employee where something of value has been put in its place.\u201d (Citation omitted.) We agree with this reasoning. Accordingly, we conclude that the act itself does not preclude the plaintiff from bringing a common-law tort claim against the individual defendants for negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We now consider the merits of the second certified question, namely, whether individual municipal employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>ees may be found liable for negligent infliction of emotional distress arising out of actions or omissions occurring within the context of a continuing employment relationship, as distinguished from actions or omissions occurring in the context of termination of employment. We conclude that they may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We begin our analysis with a review of our case law pertaining to claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the employment context. In <em>Montinieri </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>175 Conn. 337, 345, 398 A.2d 1180 (1978), this court recognized for the first time that \u201crecovery for unintentionally-caused emotional distress does not depend on proof of either an ensuing physical injury or a risk of harm from physical impact.\u201d We concluded, rather, that, in such cases, \u201cthe defendant would not be liable unless the defendant should have realized that its conduct involved an unreasonable risk of causing emotional distress and that that distress, if it were caused, might result in illness or bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">In <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>200 Conn. 676, 513 A.2d 66 (1986), we considered the plaintiffs claim that he had been wrongfully discharged and that the discharge constituted negligent infliction of emotional distress. We concluded that the discharge did not vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>late any Important public policy and, accordingly, did not fall within any exception to the employment at will doctrine. Id., 678-81. We also concluded that, despite the fact that the termination was not wrongful, there was \u201cnothing in that doctrine ... to preclude an action for unintentional infliction of emotional distress based upon unreasonable conduct of the defendant in the termination process.\u201d Id., 681-82. Thus, <em>Morris </em>stands for the proposition that a wrongful termination is not a necessary prerequisite for a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the employment context.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>243 Conn. 66, 700 A.2d 655 (1997), we again considered claims of wrongful discharge and negligent infliction of emotional distress. In that case, we concluded that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of wrongful discharge; id., 86-87; but, relying on <em>Morris, </em>we also concluded that \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress in the employment context arises only where it is \u2018based upon unreasonable conduct of the defendant in the termination process.\u2019 \u201d Id., 88. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201c[t]he mere termination of employment, even where it is wrongful, is therefore not, by itself, enough to sustain a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The mere act of firing an employee, even if wrongfully motivated, does not transgress the bounds of socially tolerable behavior.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 88-89. We found that \u201cthe actions that the defendant took in terminating the employment of the plaintiff, as alleged in his complaint, were not so unreasonable as to support a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\u201d Id., 89. Thus, <em>Parsons </em>stands for the proposition that a wrongful termination is not, in and of itself, a sufficient basis for a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Accordingly, read together, <em>Morris </em>and <em>Parsons </em>merely stand for the proposition that, in cases where the employee has been terminated, a finding of a wrongful termination is neither a necessary nor a sufficient predicate for a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress. The dispositive issue in each case was whether the defendant\u2019s conduct during the termination process was <em>sufficiently wrongful </em>that the \u201cdefendant should have realized that its conduct involved an unreasonable risk of causing emotional distress and that [that] distress, if it were caused, might result in illness or bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 88; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>supra, 200 Conn. 683; <em>Montinieri </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 175 Conn. 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The defendants concede that neither <em>Morris nor Parsons </em>stands for the proposition that a termination is a prerequisite for an employment-related negligent infliction of emotional distress claim, but, relying in part on a number of cases that have imposed that limitation, they urge this court to adopt that bright line rule in this case. Accordingly, we turn to a review of the cases that have considered this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In <em>Malik </em>v. <em>Carrier Corp., </em>202 F.3d 97, 103-104 n.1 (2d Cir. 2000), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals concluded in dicta that, after <em>Morris </em>and <em>Parsons, </em>\u201c[w]hether a viable emotional distress claim for negligent acts in the employment context exists under Connecticut law is . . . unclear.\u201d The court noted in <em>Malik </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>that in <em>Karanda </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CV 98582025S, the court had reasoned that, because emotional distress injuries are no longer covered by the act, \u201cthe Supreme Court [of Connecticut] would permit a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim against an employer when no termination is alleged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Malik </em>v. <em>Carrier Corp., </em>supra, 103-104 n.1. The court in <em>Malik </em>was not required to determine whether such a claim would be allowed, however, because it concluded that, even if the claim were permitted under some circumstances, it would not be permitted under the circumstances of that case, in which the claim arose out of the employer\u2019s conduct during a legally mandated investigation into charges of sexual harassment. Id., 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Circuit-Wise, Inc., </em>supra, 130 F. Sup. 2d 346-47, the court acknowledged the decision in <em>Malik, </em>but, relying on <em>Parsons, </em>concluded that, as a matter of law, \u201ca claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress in the employment context arises only when it is based on unreasonable conduct of the defendant in the termination process . . . .\u201d Id., 346. Because the plaintiff had not been terminated, the court dismissed the claim. In reaching its conclusion, the court in <em>Abate </em>relied on, inter alia, <em>Gomez-Gil </em>v. <em>University of Hartford, </em>63 F. Sup. 2d 191, 194 (D. Conn. 1999) (granting motion for summary judgment on claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress in employment context because no termination of employment), <em>Williams </em>v. <em>H.N.S. Management Co., </em>56 F. Sup. 2d 215, 221 (D. Conn. 1999) (same), and <em>White </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>23 F. Sup. 2d 203, 208 (D. Conn. 1998) (dismissing claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress because no termination of employment), aff'd sub nom. <em>White </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>198 F.3d 235 (2d Cir. 1999). <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Circuit-Wise, Inc., </em>supra, 346; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>also id., 346-47 n.2, citing <em>Ferraro </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV 96038803 IS (May 24, 2000) (concluding that there is no claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress when plaintiff has not been terminated); <em>Dollard </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Ansonia-Milford at Milford, Docket No. CV 99067338 (February 2, 2000) (striking claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress where plaintiff did not allege unlawful termination); <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Meriden Housing Authority, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV 950377376 (October 29, 1999) (stating in dicta that negligent infliction of emotional distress claim must arise out of termination); <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Knights of Columbus, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV 980417112S (August 17,1999) (25 Conn.

Accordingly, we must consider, as a matter of first impression, the extent of the legal duty of individuals to avoid the infliction of emotional distress on others in the course of an ongoing employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201cDuty is a legal conclusion about relationships between individuals, made after the fact, and imperative to a negligence cause of action. The nature of the duty, and the specific persons to whom it is owed, are determined by the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the individual. 2 D. Pope, Connecticut Actions and Remedies, Tort Law (1993) \u00a7 25:05, p. 25-7. Although it has been said that no universal test for [duty] ever has been formulated; W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, [Torts (5th Ed. 1984)] \u00a7 53, p. 358; our threshold inquiry has always been whether the specific harm alleged by the plaintiff was foreseeable to the defendant. The ultimate test of the existence of the duty to use care is found in the foreseeability that harm may result if it is not exercised.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kieman, </em>241 Conn. 399, 405, 696 A.2d 332 (1997). In negligent infliction of emotional distress claims, unlike general negligence claims, the foreseeability of the precise \u201cnature of the harm to be anticipated [is] a prerequisite to recovery even where a breach of duty might otherwise be found . . . .\u201d <em>Maloney </em>v. Conroy, 208 Conn. 392, 398, 545 A.2d 1059 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">We concluded in <em>Morris </em>and <em>Parsons </em>that a termination may give rise to a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress if the conduct under review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u201cinvolved an unreasonable risk of . . . emotional distress . . . that . . . might result in illness or bodily harm. \u201d <em>Monlinieri </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 175 Conn. 345. Implicit in this conclusion is a recognition that emotional distress that might result in illness or bodily harm is a foreseeable consequence of particularly egregious conduct involving a termination, which would, in turn, give rise to a duty to avoid such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The defendants contend, however, that individuals engaged in an <em>ongoing </em>employment relationship have no such duty because variations in individual sensitivity make emotional distress claims arising in that context unforeseeable. Specifically, the defendants claim that \u201ca well-meaning reprimand inflicts no emotional injury on one employee, but wounds another employee to the quick. Or, to take another scenario, a supervisor who places a great deal of pressure on his supervisees to meet deadlines may be met with stoic endurance by the thick-skinned, but hurt feelings by the more delicate.\u201d We have no quarrel with the defendants\u2019 factual premise that individual sensitivities vary, but we reject their legal conclusion. An individual making an emotional distress claim must show that a <em>reasonable person </em>would have suffered \u201cemotional distress . . . that . . . might result in illness or bodily harm\u201d; <em>Montinieri </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 175 Conn. 345; as the result of the defendant\u2019s conduct. See 3 F. Harper, F. James, &amp; O. Gray, Torts (2d Ed. 1986) \u00a7 18.4, p. 691 (\u201cGenerally defendant\u2019s standard of conduct is measured by the [emotional] reactions to be expected of normal persons. . . . Activity may be geared to a workaday world rather than to the hypersensitive.\u201d). We cannot conclude that it is more difficult to foresee the emotional reactions of reasonable persons to wrongful conduct in the workplace than in other contexts. Consequently, emotional distress can be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>foreseeable injury in an ongoing employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\u201cA simple conclusion that the harm to the plaintiff was foreseeable, however, cannot by itself mandate a determination that a legal duty exists. Many harms are quite literally foreseeable, yet for pragmatic reasons, no recovery is allowed. See, e.g., <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>[supra, 208 Conn. 400-401] (looking beyond foreseeability, this court imposed limitations on the right of a bystander to recover for emotional distress that allegedly resulted from medical malpractice of doctors in their treatment of the plaintiffs . . . mother). A further inquiry must be made, for we recognize that duty is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection. W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 53, p. 358. While it may seem that there should be a remedy for every wrong, this is an ideal limited perforce by the realities of this world. Every injury has ramifying consequences, like the ripplings of the waters, without end. The problem for the law is to limit the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree. . . . The final step in the duty inquiry, then, is to make a determination of the fundamental policy of the law, as to whether the defendant\u2019s responsibility should extend to such results.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 406; see also <em>Zamstein </em>v. <em>Marvasti, </em>240 Conn. 549, 558, 692 A.2d 781 (1997) (test for existence of legal duty of care includes \u201ca determination, on the basis of a public policy analysis, of whether the defendant\u2019s responsibility for its negligent conduct should extend to the particular consequences or particular plaintiff\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In <em>Jaworski, </em>this court recognized four factors to be considered in determining the extent of a legal duty as a matter of policy: (1) the normal expectations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>participants in the activity under review; (2) the public policy of encouraging continued vigorous participation in the activity, while protecting the safety of the participants; (3) the avoidance of increased litigation; and (4) the decisions of other jurisdictions. <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We first consider the normal expectations of individuals in the context of an ongoing employment relationship. It is clear that such individuals reasonably should expect to be subject to routine employment-related conduct, including performance evaluations, both formal and informal; decisions related to such evaluations, such as those involving transfer, demotion, promotion and compensation; similar decisions based on the employer\u2019s business needs and desires, independent of the employee\u2019s performance; and disciplinary or investigatory action arising from actual or alleged employee misconduct. In addition, such individuals reasonably should expect to be subject to other vicissitudes of employment, such as workplace gossip, rivahy, personality conflicts and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Thus, it is clear that individuals in the workplace reasonably should expect to experience some level of emotional distress, even significant emotional distress, as a result of conduct in the workplace. There are few things more central to a person\u2019s life than a job, and the mere fact of being demoted or denied advancement may be extremely distressing. That is simply an unavoidable part of being employed. We recognize, however, that that does not mean that persons in the workplace should expect to be subject to conduct that \u201ctransgress [es] the bounds of socially tolerable behavior\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 89; and that involves \u201can unreasonable risk of causing emotional distress . . . that ... if it were caused, might result in illness or bodily harm.\u201d <em>Montinieri </em>v. <em>Southern </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number><em>New England Telephone Co., </em>supra, 175 Conn. 345. Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we conclude that, when the employment relationship is ongoing, the public policies enumerated in <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 407, outweigh the interests of persons subject to such behavior in the workplace in being compensated for their emotional injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">First, in an ongoing employment relationship, employees who fear lawsuits by fellow employees may be less competitive with each other, may promote the interests of their employer less vigorously, may refrain from reporting the improper or even illegal conduct of fellow employees, may be less frank in performance evaluations, and may make employment decisions such as demotions, promotions and transfers on the basis of fear of suit rather than business needs and desires. All of this conduct would contribute to a less vigorous and less productive workplace. We conclude that such a pervasive chilling effect outweighs the safety interest of employees in being protected from negligent infliction of emotional distress. In cases involving a termination of employment, on the other hand, the employee can no longer use the threat of a lawsuit to influence the conduct of his employer and fellow employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Second, in light of the inherently competitive and stressful nature of the workplace and the difficulties surrounding proof of emotional distress, extending the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress to ongoing employment relationships would open the door to spurious claims. We recognize that the line that we draw in the present case is somewhat arbitrary. This court previously has been willing to draw lines limiting liability, however, when \u201c[t]here are fears of flooding the courts with spurious and fraudulent claims; problems of proof of the damage suffered; exposing [potential defendants] to an endless number of claims; and economic burdens on industry.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 50-51, 675 A.2d 852 (1996); id., 51 (recognizing that limits that this court placed on cause of action for bystander emotional distress were \u201csomewhat arbitrary,\u201d but concluding that they were \u201cnecessary in order not to leave the liability of a negligent defendant open to undue extension by the verdict of sympathetic juries\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We conclude that, although the rule that we adopt in this case may allow some legitimate emotional injuries to go uncompensated, the social costs of allowing such claims would outweigh the social benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">With respect to the fourth <em>Jaworski </em>factor, the case law of our sister states, the approaches of the various jurisdictions may be divided into four general categories: (1) jurisdictions that categorically do not recognize the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (2) jurisdictions that categorically do not recognize such claims in the employment context;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (3) jurisdictions holding that such claims are precluded by the respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and (4) the majority of jurisdictions that consider employment-related claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress on the basis of whether the claim meets the elements of the claim under the relevant state\u2019s law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the majority of states that recognize negligent infliction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>of emotional distress claims as a general matter apply the same standard to such claims arising in the employment context. We note, however, that, in a majority of these jurisdictions, the standard for claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress is much narrower than the <em>Montinieri </em>standard, requiring the plaintiff to prove some objective element such as physical injury, property damage, presence in the zone of danger or the existence of an independent tort. As is apparent from the large number of cases in which the employee\u2019s claim was dismissed for failure to meet the relevant standard, these limitations provide an automatic safeguard against spurious claims in the employment context that <em>Montinieri </em>does not provide. Accordingly, those cases do not affect our conclusion that, for the previously stated policy reasons, the societal costs of allowing claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress in the context of ongoing employment are unacceptably high.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We conclude, therefore, that an individual municipal employee may not be found liable for negligent infliction of emotional distress arising out of conduct occurring within a continuing employment context, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>distinguished from conduct occurring in the termination of employment.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9k\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur with parts I and II A of the majority opinion. I respectfully disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion in part IIB that individual employees may not be held liable for negligent infliction of emotional distress claims arising in the context of ongoing employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">The majority, citing \u201c \u2018fears of flooding the courts with \u201cspurious and fraudulent claims\u201d; problems of proof of the damage suffered; exposing [potential defendants] to an endless number of claims; and economic burdens on industry\u2019 \u201d; <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 50, 675 A.2d 852 (1996); concludes that the cause of action recognized by this court in <em>Montinieri </em>v. <em>Southern New England \"Telephone Co., </em>175 Conn. 337, 398 A.2d 1180 (1978), is not cognizable in the context of ongoing employment,. I would conclude that, for all of these policy reasons, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Montinieri, </em>in which we upheld a jury instruction by the trial court that expanded the preexisting standard for negligent infliction of emotional distress claims to include claims in which the plaintiff has not alleged a resulting bodily injury or illness or a risk of harm from physical impact; id., 345; was misguided. The policy concerns cited by the majority arise in many contexts other than the context of ongoing employment. It is clear to me, for example, that the daily activities of doctors, police officers and teachers are no less chilled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>by the fear of spurious lawsuits based on <em>Montinieri </em>than the activities of employees in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Recognizing, however, that the majority is not disposed to reconsider <em>Montinieri </em>in this case, as I am, I believe that the distinction drawn by the majority between negligent infliction of emotional distress claims involving a termination of employment and claims arising in an ongoing employment context is arbitrary. The majority concludes that the interest of workers in being protected from negligent infliction of emotional distress is outweighed by other public policy considerations. In my view, however, the same public policy considerations that arise in an ongoing employment context arise in the context of an employment termination. An employer who wishes to terminate an inept employee is faced with the same risk of a spurious lawsuit as an employer who wishes to reprimand an inept employee. Accordingly, I cannot perceive any principle on which to make the distinction made by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Indeed, I do not believe that this issue ever would have arisen in the District Court if not for the mere fortuity that a number of other courts simply have misinterpreted our statement in <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>243 Conn. 66, 88, 700 A.2d 655 (1997), that \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress in the employment context arises only where it is \u2018based upon unreasonable conduct of the defendant in the termination process\u2019 \u201d to mean that a termination is a condition precedent to a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the workplace. As I already have indicated, I can perceive no reason to adopt that misreading in this case. Although the decision of the majority may reduce the number of claims brought under <em>Montinieri, </em>I do not believe that it will reduce the percentage of spurious claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>I further note that Connecticut apparently is now the only jurisdiction to draw a distinction between negligent infliction of emotional distress claims arising in the context of ongoing employment and claims involving termination of employment. I recognize, as the majority points out, that most of our sister states have a more restricted cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress than the standard we adopted in <em>Montinieri. </em>I do not believe, however, that this court should adopt an expansive cause of action and then attempt to mitigate the resulting public policy concerns by imposing arbitrary, piecemeal restrictions on its cognizability. See <em>Mendillo </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 456, 485, 717 A.2d 1177 (1998) (declining to recognize cause of action for loss of parental consortium on ground that \u201cwe would have to impose arbitrary limitations on the scope of the cause of action in order to avoid the creation of a practically unlimited class of potential plaintiffs\u201d). \u201cCourts operating in the quintessential common-law context . . . function best, and command the most respect, when their decisions can be defended on grounds of reason and principle. Although courts are, like legislatures, often in the business of drawing lines, how we are expected to draw lines differs significantly from how the legislature is expected to draw lines. Whereas legislatures often draw arbitrary lines, we are expected to draw lines based on reason and principle, and to rely on arbitrary limits only when the policy reasons are sufficiently persuasive to justify performing such an extraordinary task.\u201d Id., 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">I would conclude that the cause of action recognized by this court in <em>Montinieri </em>is cognizable both in the context of ongoing employment and in cases involving termination of employment. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b785-7\">NORCOTT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFX\">concurring and dissenting. I concur with parts I and IIA of the majority opinion. I also join, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>in part, the Chief Justice\u2019s dissent with respect to part II B of the majority opinion. I agree with the dissent that the majority\u2019s distinction between claims involving termination and claims in an ongoing employment context is arbitrary. In my opinion, employers have a legal duty to avoid subjecting their employees to the negligent infliction of emotional distress whether the claim arises in the ongoing employment context or through a termination event. I write separately, however, because I am not prepared, at this point, to conclude that our decision in <em>Montinieri </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>175 Conn. 337, 398 A.2d 1180 (1978), was, as the Chief Justice writes, \u201cmisguided.\u201d As the majority opinion notes, we do not address <em>Montinieri </em>because neither party asked for our opinion on the issue in that case. While I would be willing, in a proper case, to revisit the question of whether a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress requires proof of an ensuing physical injury or risk of harm from physical impact, I believe it is premature to offer my opinion on that issue without the full exploration of it in another case. Our decision in <em>Montinieri </em>may or may not have been \u201cmisguided.\u201d Whichever comes to be the case, I reserve my opinion on that issue for a future appeal before this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
