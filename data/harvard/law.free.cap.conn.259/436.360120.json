We agree with the state that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s prescription records and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The state filed an information charging the defendant with thirty-two counts of obtaining Tylenol with codeine No. 3 (Tylenol 3), a controlled substance,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by forging a prescription in violation of \u00a7 2 la-266 (a) (2), and thirty-two counts of forgery in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-139 (a) (4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant moved to suppress certain records of his prescriptions that the state had obtained from several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>pharmacies without a warrant and without the defendant\u2019s prior consent. The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was predicated on his contention that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his prescription records and, therefore, that the state had obtained those records in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. See <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The trial court conducted a preliminary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, limited to the issue of whether the defendant had standing to seek the suppression of prescription records in the possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>pharmacy. After that hearing, the court issued a written decision in which it concluded that the defendant had a constitutionally protected privacy interest in those records and, consequently, that he had standing to challenge the state\u2019s use of such records in its case-in-chief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Thereafter, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court made the following factual findings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At all times relevant to this case, the defendant was a detective with the Hartford police department. The defendant\u2019s supervisor, Lieutenant David Kenary, was the commander of the Hartford police department\u2019s crimes against persons and property unit. Marcus Brown was a diversion investigator with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, assigned to conduct regulatory inspections of pharmacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On or about September 9,1997, Kenary called Brown to arrange a meeting at the Hartford police department. The purported purpose of the meeting was to exchange information about Santo Buccheri, a Hartford physician, and his issuance of prescriptions for controlled substances. At the meeting, Kenary informed Brown that he believed that Buccheri was overprescribing controlled substances and dispensing samples to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>patients without maintaining proper records. Kenary asked Brown to notify him if the defendant\u2019s name surfaced during any investigation of Buccheri and provided Brown with the defendant\u2019s date of birth and home address.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Beginning on October 31, 1997, Brown went to pharmacies located in the vicinity of both Buccheri\u2019s office and the defendant\u2019s home and, without a search warrant, asked each of the pharmacies to provide him with the defendant\u2019s prescription records.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The records contained information about prescriptions that each pharmacy had filled for the defendant, including the name of the prescribing physician, the date on which the defendant had submitted the prescription to the pharmacy, the type and quantity of drug prescribed and the price of the drug.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The pharmacies complied with Brown\u2019s requests.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Brown later returned to each pharmacy and, again by request, obtained copies of the actual prescription forms that the defendant had presented to the pharmacies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The trial court noted that, although Brown\u2019s testimony suggested that his puipose in obtaining the defendant\u2019s pharmacy records was to rule out the defendant as a target of the investigation, other evidence presented at the hearing indicated that the defendant was the focus of the investigation. Specifically, the trial court alluded to a report prepared by Brown on November 19, 1997, that identified the defendant as the target <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>of Brown\u2019s investigation. The court also noted that, prior to preparing that report, Brown had not requested <em>records of Buccheri\u2019s prescribing practices </em>but, instead, had requested only <em>the defendant\u2019s prescription records. </em>The trial court found that the purpose of Brown\u2019s investigation was to determine whether the defendant had been abusing controlled substances, and that Buccheri was under investigation only because he was the defendant\u2019s physician. Accordingly, the trial court determined that Brown was not conducting an administrative inspection of the pharmacy pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> when he obtained the defendant\u2019s pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>scription records but, rather, was acting in pursuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>a criminal investigation of the defendant in cooperation with the Hartford police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The trial court further concluded that, inasmuch as Brown\u2019s conduct in obtaining the defendant\u2019s prescrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tion records constituted a search in the course of a criminal investigation, Brown was required to obtain either a search warrant or the defendant\u2019s prior consent. Because Brown had obtained neither, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Thereafter, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the information for lack of sufficient evidence. The trial court also granted the state\u2019s motion for permission to appeal. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-96.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">On appeal, the state does not challenge the trial court\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rather, the state contests the legal conclusions rendered by the trial court on the basis of those factual findings. In particular, the state claims that Brown legally obtained the defendant\u2019s prescription records without a warrant or the defendant\u2019s consent, upon the consent of the pharmacists who voluntarily turned those records over to Brown. The state further claims that the defendant\u2019s fourth amendment rights were not violated when Brown, acting as a criminal investigator in concert with the Hartford police, requested and received those prescription records without a search warrant or the defendant\u2019s consent. Although we acknowledge that, in general, the defendant has a constitutionally protected privacy interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>in his prescription records, we nevertheless conclude that his privacy rights were not violated in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We first address the issue of whether Brown, acting in conjunction with the Hartford police, had statutory authority to obtain records of the defendant\u2019s prescriptions for controlled substances in connection with the criminal investigation of the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, the state claims that a law enforcement official legally may obtain records of prescriptions for controlled substances from a pharmacist upon that pharmacist\u2019s consent, without a warrant and without the consent of the person for whom the prescription has been issued. The defendant, in contrast, maintains that law enforcement personnel are not vested with the authority to review prescription records without a warrant. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The state\u2019s claim raises an issue of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. E.g., <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 26, 717 A.2d 77 (1998). \u201cOur resolution of [this claim] is governed by well established principles. [I]t is axiomatic that the process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 394, 403, 780 A.2d 903 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 2 1a-265<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provides in relevant part that \u201c[prescriptions . . . shall be open for inspection only to federal, state, county and municipal officers, whose duty it is to enforce the laws of this state or of the United States relating to controlled substances, and to third party payors having a formal agreement or contract to audit such prescriptions ... in connection with claims submitted to such payors. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 21a-265 further provides that \u201c[n]o such officer or third party payor having knowledge by virtue of his office of any such prescription . . . shall divulge such knowledge, except in connection with a civil action or criminal prosecution in court or before a licensing or registration board or officer, to which action, prosecution or proceeding the person to whom such prescriptions . . . relate is a party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">By its plain language, \u00a7 2 la-265 affirmatively authorizes federal, state and local law enforcement personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>to review prescription records, in direct contravention of the construction that the defendant advances.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In light of the trial court\u2019s finding that Brown was acting in concert with the Hartford police when he obtained the defendant\u2019s prescription records, Brown was authorized, under \u00a7 2 la-265, to obtain those records with the pharmacists\u2019 consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-265 broadly provides that prescription records shall be <em>\u201copen for inspection </em>... to federal, state, county and municipal officers, whose duty it is to enforce the [federal and state drug laws] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the legislature has not defined the words \u201copen for inspection,\u201d we look \u201cto the common understanding of [those words] as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Oxford Tire Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>253 Conn. 683, 696, 755 A.2d 850 (2000); see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201c[i]nthe construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u201cOpen\u201d is defined as \u201cso arranged or governed as to permit ingress, egress, or passage . . . completely free from concealment: exposed to general or particular perception or knowledge . . . available to us . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. \u201cInspection\u201d is \u201cthe act or process of inspecting\u201d and \u201cinspect\u201d means \u201cto view closely and critically (as in order to ascertain quality or state, detect errors, or otherwise appraise): examine with care: scrutinize . . . .\u201d Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Therefore, in construing the language of \u00a7 21a-265 according to its plain and ordinary meaning, as we must, we find it apparent that the legislature intended for both criminal law enforcement officials and regulatory personnel to have access to prescription records in connection with the lawful discharge of their duties.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, we note the absence in \u00a7 2 la-265 of any limitation on access to such records by law enforcement personnel who have obtained a search warrant. We conclude that the legislature did not intend such a limitation because if it had, it easily could have expressed that intent. E.g., <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 410. Indeed, the legislature has deemed it appropriate, in certain circumstances, to relax statutory confidentiality requirements when the information sought is the subject of a search warrant. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-128f (2) (employer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>disclose employee\u2019s otherwise confidential personnel or medical records pursuant to search warrant); General Statutes \u00a7 36a-44 (8) (financial institution authorized to disclose otheiwise confidential information regarding customer records pursuant to search warrant); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-988 (h) (insurer may disclose otherwise confidential information concerning insured pursuant to search warrant). Finally, and importantly, the legislative history of \u00a7 2 la-265 contains no suggestion that the legislature intended for that statutory provision to be construed in a manner other than according to its plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Our conclusion that \u00a7 2 la-265 allows law enforcement officials access to records of prescriptions for controlled substances is buttressed by other provisions of the statutory scheme regulating the lawful dispensing and use of controlled substances. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-250 (a)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> provides in relevant part that a prescription must be \u201cretained on file by the proprietor of the pharmacy in which it is filled for a period of three years, so as to be <em>readily accessible for inspection by any public officer or employee engaged in the enforcement of </em>. . . chapter [420b of the General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>utes]. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Because chapter 420b of the General Statutes includes, inter alia, this state\u2019s criminal drug laws, it is evident that a central purpose of the record retention requirement of \u00a7 21a-250 (a) is to ensure that prescriptions will be \u201caccessible for inspection\u201d by law enforcement officials responsible for enforcing those laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 20-626,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which mandates the confidentiality of pharmacy records, contains seven separate exceptions to the general rule. One such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>exception authorizes pharmacists to \u201cprovide pharmacy records or information to . . . any governmental agency with statutory authority to review or obtain such information . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-626 (b) (5). When \u00a7 20-626 (b) (5) is read in conjunction with \u00a7 2 la-265, it is apparent that this exception is applicable to law enforcement officials charged with enforcing the criminal laws relating to controlled substances. Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 20-626 (b) (6) authorizes pharmacists to provide prescription records to \u201cany individual, the state or federal government or any agency thereof or court pursuant to a subpoena . . . .\u201d It would have been illogical for the legislature to require state and federal law enforcement officials to obtain a search warrant for prescription records under \u00a7 2 la-265, as the defendant maintains it did, and, at the same time, broadly authorize the dissemination of those records under \u00a7 20-626 (b) (6) to <em>any </em>person or state or federal agency seeking discovery of such information pursuant to a subpoena. See, e.g., <em>Modem Cigarette, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 105, 120, 774 A.2d 969 (2001) (statutes are construed using common sense and assuming legislature intended reasonable and rational result).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-274<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> provides that the commissioners of public health and consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>protection, police officers and all state prosecutors shall cooperate with each other and exchange investigative information relating to criminal violations of the drug laws. This broad statutory mandate is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 21a-265:<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> it is unlikely that the legislature would have severely restricted a law enforcement official\u2019s access to records of prescriptions for controlled substances by requiring that official to obtain a search warrant, but nevertheless would have granted regulatory personnel full and open access to those records without the need to obtain a warrant; see General Statutes \u00a7 21a-261;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> when \u00a7 21a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>274 authorizes those same regulatory officials to provide law enforcement officials with any and all information regarding possible violations of the drug laws that they may obtain from their review of the prescription records. Moreover, the fact that the regulatory officers <em>themselves </em>have criminal investigatory and arrest powers further undermines the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 21a-265. See General Statutes \u00a7 21a-261 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 2 la-265 is fundamentally flawed for another important reason: that interpretation renders the entire first sentence of \u00a7 21a-265 superfluous. In the defendant\u2019s view, \u00a7 21a-265 simply limits access to records of prescriptions for controlled substances to federal, state, county and municipal officers. The legislature, however, already has provided for the confidentiality of prescription records under \u00a7 20-626; see footnote 23 of this opinion; the provisions of which accomplish what the defendant contends that the legislature sought to achieve with the first sentence of \u00a7 2 la-265. In light of the well established principle that statutoiy provisions should not be read so as to render them meaningless, unnecessary or superfluous; see, e.g., <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 196, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>239 Conn. 638, 654, 687 A.2d 134 (1997); we conclude that the defendant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 21a-265 is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In support of his construction, the defendant contends that reading \u00a7 2 la-265 to authorize the warrantless access by law enforcement officials to records of prescriptions for controlled substances would raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>constitutional concerns under <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691, 107 S. Ct. 2636, 96 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1987), in which the United States Supreme Court concluded that pervasively regulated businesses are subject to warrantless inspections by regulatory personnel as long as those inspections are accomplished in a reasonable manner. See id., 703. This argument is without merit. As we have indicated; see footnote 20 of this opinion; the standards enunciated in <em>Burger </em>are in place to protect the fourth amendment rights of the <em>proprietors </em>of pervasively regulated businesses; see <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>supra, 702-703; who, in the present case, are the pharmacists who voluntarily complied with Brown\u2019s requests for the defendant\u2019s prescription records. Thus, \u00a7 2 1a-265 does not violate the pharmacist\u2019s rights because it merely authorizes law enforcement personnel to review records of prescriptions for controlled substances upon lawfully obtaining them from a pharmacist; \u00a7 21a-265 <em>does not require </em>a pharmacist to comply with a request by law enforcement officials to review prescription records in the pharmacist\u2019s possession.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, our interpretation of \u00a7 21a-265 in accordance with its plain language, which distinctly authorizes federal, state and local enforcement personnel to review prescription records in carrying out their official duties, is not contrary to the dictates of <em>Burger </em>because \u00a7 21a-265 simply does not implicate the fourth amendment rights of a pharmacist who, as in the present case, <em>voluntarily </em>complies with a law enforcement official\u2019s request for prescription records.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>In sum, we conclude that \u00a7 21a-265 authorizes law enforcement officials to obtain records of prescriptions for controlled substances from a pharmacist without a warrant, subject, of course, to consideration of the pharmacist\u2019s constitutional rights. Although, arguably, as a matter of public policy, the law enforcement officials <em>should </em>be required to obtain prior court approval or the prior consent of the person whose prescription records are sought before gaining access to those records, it is not this court\u2019s prerogative to adopt such a policy in the face of an unequivocal legislative mandate to the contrary. In light of our conclusion, however, it remains for this court to determine whether \u00a7 2 la-265 gives rise to an unconstitutional invasion of the defendant\u2019s privacy rights by having authorized pharmacists to release to Brown records of the defendant\u2019s prescriptions for controlled substances.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We now turn to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The state claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of privacy was violated when Brown obtained the defendant\u2019s prescription records without a search warrant and without the defendant\u2019s consent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In <em>Griswold </em>v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 485, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965), the United States Supreme Court first recognized a constitutionally pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>tected right of privacy. In <em>Griswold, </em>the court concluded that a state law barring the use of contraceptives by married couples violated that right. Id. The United States Supreme Court subsequently confirmed that that right of privacy \u201cis founded in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s concept of personal liberty . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 598-99 n.23, 97 S.

Ed. 2d 147 (1973) (right of privacy \u201cfounded in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action\u201d). \u201cAlthough the [United States Supreme] [C]ourt has . . . construed this right to privacy narrowly ... it has held that personal rights that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty ... or deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition are included in this guarantee of personal privacy.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Michaela Lee R., </em>253 Conn. 570, 599, 756 A.2d 214 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Though the boundaries of the constitutional right of privacy have not been delineated clearly, cases involving that right generally have addressed two distinct interests: \u201c[o]ne is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 599-600; see also <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Administrator of General Services, </em>433 U.S. 425, 457, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867 (1977) (reaffirming right of privacy in avoiding disclosure of personal matters).

Contra <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Wellman, </em>52 F.3d 125, 126 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that constitutional right of privacy does not apply to medical records). Moreover, some courts specifically have concluded that prescription records are the type of medical record that falls within the zone of privacy protected by the constitution. E.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, </em>supra, 1138; <em>State </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>160 Vt. 70, 78, 624 A.2d 1105 (1992); cf. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 432 U.S. 600-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Because prescription records may contain information of a private nature regarding a person\u2019s physical or mental health,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> we agree with the defendant that, as a general matter, a person reasonably may expect that his or her prescription records or information contained therein will not be disseminated publicly. The privacy protection afforded such records or information, however, is not absolute. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, </em>supra, 72 F.3d 1138; see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 15 F.3d 269; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney General of the United States, </em>supra, 941 F.2d 796. \u201c[R]ather, it is a conditional right which may be infringed upon a showing of proper governmental interest.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney General of the United States, </em>supra, 796; see also <em>Statharos </em>v. <em>New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission, </em>198 F.3d 317, 323 (2d Cir. 1999) (\u201c[t]his confidentiality interest is not absolute . . . and can be overcome by a sufficiently weighty government purpose\u201d); <em>Doe v.

In other words, the reasonableness of a person\u2019s expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>that his or her personal or intimate medical information will not be disclosed depends upon the circumstances underlying the particular disclosure. Indeed, in the present case, the defendant does not claim that his right of privacy with respect to his prescription records is absolute, for he expressly acknowledges the right of the state to authorize systematic reviews of such records by third party payors <em>and </em>regulatory personnel, the latter of whom have, in addition to their administrative responsibilities, investigatory and arrest authority pursuant to \u00a7 2 la-261 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Courts generally have applied a balancing test to determine whether the disclosure of personal or confidential information is constitutionally permissible under the particular facts and circumstances presented. For example, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has concluded that \u201csome form of intermediate scrutiny or balancing approach is appropriate as a standard of review . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) <em>Barry </em>v. <em>New York, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>712 F.2d 1554, 1559 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1017, 104 S.

The Courts of Appeals for the Third and Fifth Circuits also apply this intermediate balancing approach. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, </em>supra, 72 F.3d 1139; <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of the Treasury, </em>25 F.3d 237, 243 n.2 (5th Cir. 1994); cf. <em>In re Crawford, </em>194 F.3d 954, 959 (9th Cir. 1999), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Ferm </em>v. <em>United States Trustee, </em>528 U.S. 1189, 120 S.

See id., 591. The United States Supreme Court, after considering the pertinent factors, determined that the challenged disclosure of prescription information did not invade \u201cany right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>604. In <em>Whalen, </em>a group of patients and physicians, among others, challenged the constitutionality of a New York statutory scheme requiring physicians to forward records of prescriptions for schedule II drugs, which contained detailed patient information, to a centralized database maintained by the state department of health.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See generally id., 593-95. Although public disclosure of the identity of the patient was prohibited under the statutory scheme; id., 594; certain state regulatory employees and personnel responsible for investigating violations of New York\u2019s controlled substance laws<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> were afforded access to that information. See id., 595. A unanimous United States Supreme Court concluded, first, that the statutory scheme \u201cwas a reasonable exercise of New York\u2019s broad police powers\u201d; id., 598; and enacted in furtherance of \u201cthe [s]tate\u2019s vital interest in controlling the distribution of dangerous drugs . . . .\u201d Id. In addition, the court concluded that, in light of the statutory prohibition against the public dissemination of the prescription information, the risk of such dissemination was insufficient to invalidate the challenged statutory scheme. See id., 600-602. Although the court acknowledged that, under the statutory scheme, \u201cprivate [prescription] information must be disclosed to . . . authorized [state] employees\u201d; id., 602; it nonetheless observed that \u201c[s]uch disclosures . . . are not . . . meaningfully distinguishable from a host of other unpleasant invasions of privacy that are associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>many facets of health caxe. Unquestionably, some individuals\u2019 concern for their own privacy may lead them to avoid or to postpone needed medical attention. Nevertheless, disclosures of private medical information to doctors, to hospital personnel, to insurance companies, and to public health agencies are often an essential part of modem medical practice even when th[ose] disclosure [s] may reflect unfavorably on the character of the patient[s].\u201d Id. The court then concluded that the challenged statutory scheme, in mandating the disclosure of the prescription information to representatives of the state having responsibility for the health and welfare of the community, did not create an impermissible invasion of privacy. Id., 603-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>Whalen </em>is indistinguishable from the present case. Our statutory scheme, like the New York statutory scheme considered in Whalen, safeguards the privacy interests of persons who obtain prescriptions for controlled substances by restricting access to those records to a limited class of persons; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-626 (b) and 21a-265; including public officials responsible for the enforcement of the federal and state drug laws. General Statutes \u00a7 21la-265. Both states\u2019 regimes prohibit the dissemination of such information to the general public. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-626; cf. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 600. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently has observed, \u201c[t]he degree of intrusion stemming from public exposure of the details of a person\u2019s life is exponentially greater than [that stemming from] disclosure to government officials.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statharos </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>v. <em>New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission, </em>supra, 198 F.3d 326, quoting <em>Barry </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 712 F.2d 1561; see also <em>American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Dept. of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>118 F.3d 786, 793 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (\u201cwe hold that the individual interest in protecting the privacy of the information sought by the government is significantly less important where the information is collected by the government but not disseminated publicly\u201d); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stow, </em>64 Ohio St. 3d 156, 166, 593 N.E.2d 294 (1992) (\u201c[w]hatever privacy interest . . . patients and physicians possess in . . . prescription records is limited to the right not to have the information disclosed to the general public\u201d). Moreover, as in <em>Whalen, </em>nothing in the record of the present case suggests that the law enforcement officials authorized pursuant to \u00a7 21a-265 to obtain records of the defendant\u2019s prescriptions for controlled substances without a warrant have failed to abide by the stringent statutory nondisclosure provisions, or that they likely will flout those provisions in the future.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> See <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 601 (refusing to assume that standards of nondisclosure will be violated).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Furthermore, because the pharmaceutical industry is pervasively regulated, prescription information and records are legitimately subject to regular scrutiny by federal and state inspectors and, consequently, the expectation of privacy that the public has in that information or those records, in contrast to other types of information that are not subject to such intensive review and regulation, necessarily is reduced drastically.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>California </em>v. <em>Carney, </em>471 U.S. 386, 392, 105 S. Ct. 2066, 85 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1985) (due to pervasive regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on public highways, public has reduced privacy expectation in motor vehicles); <em>Condon </em>v. <em>Reno, </em>155 F.3d 453, 464-65 (4th Cir. 1998) (same), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 528 U.S. 141, 120 S. Ct. 666, 145 L. Ed. 2d 587 (2000). Indeed, the fact that \u00a7 21a-265 expressly authorizes law enforcement officials to obtain records of prescriptions for controlled substances without a warrant reflects a considered public policy judgment that, in and of itself, serves to diminish a person\u2019s expectation of privacy in such records. See, e.g., <em>Yin </em>v. <em>California, </em>95 F.3d 864, 871 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1114, 117 S. Ct. 955, 136 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1997) (statute explicitly authorizing medical examinations of state civil service employees places those employees on notice that they can be subject to such examination, thereby diminishing their expectation of privacy accordingly); see also, e.g., Doe v. <em>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, </em>supra, 72 F.3d 1140 (existence of express statutory mandate or articulated public policy favoring disclosure of particular information is factor militating against conclusion that such disclosure constitutes cognizable invasion of privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>It is telling that the defendant has cited to no case, and we are aware of none, in which a court has held that a law enforcement official\u2019s access to prescription records violates the patient\u2019s light of privacy. Indeed, in light of <em>Whalen </em>and its progeny, it is not surprising that the only courts to have considered such a claim squarely have rejected it. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stow, </em>supra, 64 Ohio St. 3d 166; <em>State </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>supra, 160 Vt. 83-84. The reason is plain: <em>Whalen </em>makes it perfectly clear that a legitimate request for prescription information or records by a public official responsible for safeguarding public health and safety is a valid exercise of the state\u2019s police powers and, consequently, does not constitute an impermissible invasion of privacy. <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>902 F.2d 208, 212 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 897, 111 S. Ct. 250, 112 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1990); <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>826 F.2d 1534, 1539 (6th Cir. 1987). In other words, a person does not have an <em>objectively reasonable </em>expectation that records of his or her prescriptions for controlled substances will not be disclosed to law enforcement personnel, subject to safeguards against further dissemination of those records, upon an appropriate request for those records by such personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Although the defendant concedes that he has a reduced expectation of privacy in records of his prescriptions for controlled substances owing to the existence of a regulatory scheme authorizing state and federal regulatory personnel to conduct regular inspections of those records, he nevertheless maintains that his reasonable expectation of privacy in those records is reduced only to the extent necessary to accomplish that regulatory purpose. In essence, the defendant\u2019s claim devolves into the proposition that the inspection of records of prescriptions for controlled substances by <em>law enforcement </em>personnel, as opposed to <em>regulatory </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>personnel, violates a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">This contention simply ignores <em>Whalen. </em>In <em>Whalen, </em>the United States Supreme Court expressly acknowledged that the prescription information submitted to the state database by prescribing physicians was subject to review by state officials <em>authorized to investigate violations of the laws governing the dispensing of prescription medication-, Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 595; see footnote 34 of this opinion and accompanying text; but nevertheless concluded that the statutory scheme did not contravene the patients\u2019 privacy rights. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 602. In so holding, the court drew no distinction between the patients\u2019 rights vis-\u00e1-vis the investigators, on the one hand, and the patients\u2019 rights vis-\u00e1-vis the regulatory personnel of the New York department of health, on the other hand. See generally id. Moreover, the court in <em>Whalen </em>noted that the central reporting system at issue in that case was established to prevent <em>criminal </em>misconduct by doctors, pharmacists <em>and patients.</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See generally id., 591-92, 592 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Moreover, employees of the department of consumer protection who are responsible for the routine, administrative inspection of prescription records in the possession of pharmacies have full police power to enforce the state\u2019s criminal drug laws, including the authority to make arrests and seize evidence, pursuant to \u00a7 21a-261 (d). This fact underscores the artificial nature of the distinction that the defendant necessarily must draw between his conclusion that a person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his or her records of prescriptions for controlled substances in the context of regulatory inspections, on the one hand, and his conclusion that a person does have such an expectation of privacy in the context of inspections by law enforcement personnel, on the other hand. Both the dictates of <em>Whalen </em>and common sense compel this court to reject the defendant\u2019s claim that any such distinction is <em>constitutionally </em>significant.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>This court\u2019s analysis in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 620 A.2d 746 (1993), highlights the illogic of the distinction that the defendant urges. In <em>DeFusco, </em>we upheld the constitutionality of a warrantless search of garbage that the defendant, Paul DeFusco, had placed at the curb in front of his home for collection by the garbage collector. Id., 639. We explained that DeFusco could not have had a reasonable expectation of privacy from inspection of that garbage by the police in light of the \u201cmyriad of intruders, purposeful or errant, [who] could legally have sorted through his garbage.\u201d Id., 636. We explained that \u201c[a] person\u2019s reasonable expectations as to a particular object cannot be [so] compartmentalized . . . .\u201d Id., 637. In the present case, the defendant concedes that he has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his prescription records protecting him against the warrantless inspection of those records by state regulatory agents and others, including third party payors. Under the reasoning of <em>DeFusco, </em>the defendant does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in those records protecting him against warrantless inspections by <em>law enforcement officials </em>either. In other words, although an individual legitimately may expect that his records of prescriptions for controlled substances will not be disclosed to the <em>general </em>public\u2014an expectation that the legislature has recognized as reasonable; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-626 and 2 la-265\u2014that same individual cannot reasonably expect that certain government officials responsible for safeguarding public health and safety <em>will </em>be permitted to review those records while other government officials with the same responsibility <em>will not. </em>It is precisely this kind of compartmentalized, bifurcated expectation of privacy that we rejected in <em>DeFusco. </em>This expectation is especially unreasonable in the present case in light of the broad law enforcement powers that \u00a7 21a-261 (d) bestows upon department of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>sumer protection agents who are responsible for inspecting prescription records.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In light of the state\u2019s strong interest in regulating and policing the distribution of potentially harmful drugs<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>a category into which controlled substances indisputably fall<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>\u2014and in light of the restrictions that the statutory scheme places upon the disclosure of prescription information and records, the conclusion is inescapable that, under the holding and rationale of <em>Whalen, </em>the defendant\u2019s privacy rights were not violated when Brown obtained records of the defendant\u2019s prescriptions for controlled substances in the course of assisting the Hartford police in investigating the defendant.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s prescription records.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In this opinion KATZ and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-139 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of forgery in the second degree when, with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another, he falsely makes, completes or alters a written instrument or issues or possesses any written instrument which he knows to be forged, which is or purports to be, or which is calculated to become or represent if completed ...

Because the present case involves prescriptions for controlled substances only, it is unnecessary to decide whether law enforcement officials lawfully may obtain records of prescriptions for medications that do not fall within a controlled substance category of drugs. See, e.g., <em>Bortner v. Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 251 n.13, 736 A.2d 104 (1999) (court need not decide issues unnecessary to resolution of case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-265 provides: \u201cPrescriptions, orders and records required by sections 21a-243 to 21a-282, inclusive, and stocks of controlled substances shall be open for inspection only to federal, state, county and municipal officers, whose duty it is to enforce the laws of this state or of the United States relating to controlled substances, and to third party payors having a formal agreement or contract to audit such prescriptions, orders and records in connection with claims submitted to such payors. No such officer or third party payor having knowledge by virtue of his office of any such prescription, order or record shall divulge such knowledge, except in connection with a civil action or criminal prosecution in court or before a licensing or registration board or officer, to which action, prosecution or proceeding the person to whom such prescriptions, orders or records relate is a party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> The defendant construes \u00a7 21a-265 as authorizing only <em>regulatory </em>personnel to inspect prescription records in accordance with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-261; see footnote 26 of this opinion; and its federal analogue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880. See footnote 13 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b470-5\"> Of course, the state\u2019s interest in reviewing prescription records in the possession of a pharmacist is subject to the right of the <em>pharmacist </em>to be free from an unreasonable search of his business premises. See, e.g., <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691, 699, 107 S. Ct. 2636, 96 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1987). It is undisputed, however, that the pharmaceutical industry is pervasively regulated, and, therefore, warrantless administrative inspections of pharmacies are permissible as long as those inspections are conducted subject to reasonable legislative or administrative standards. See, e.g., id., 703; <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>452 U.S. 594, 599, 101 S. Ct. 2534, 69 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1981). Thus, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880; see footnote 13 of this opinion; and General Statutes \u00a7 21a-261; see footnote 26 of this opinion; were enacted to protect pharmacists from unreasonable, warrantless intrusions by federal and state regulatory personnel responsible for administrative inspections of pharmacy records and stocks of controlled substances. These provisions entitle such personnel to enter apharmacy without a search warrant to audit the pharmacy\u2019s records and its stock of controlled substances only at reasonable times and within reasonable limits. See generally 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880 (b) (1994); General Statutes \u00a7 21a-261 (b). In the present case, however, the pharmacists who voluntarily complied with Brown\u2019s requests for the records of the defendant\u2019s prescriptions for controlled substances make no claim that Brown\u2019s lawful entry into their pharmacies, during working hours, violated <em>their </em>rights, thereby entitling <em>them </em>to suppression of the records. Because the defendant\u2019s rights, and not the pharmacists\u2019 rights, are at issue in the present case, the administrative inspection provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880 and \u00a7 21a-261 provide no support for the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-250 (a) provides: \u201cA pharmacist, in good faith, may sell and dispense controlled substances to any person upon a prescription of a physician or dentist, podiatrist, optometrist, veterinarian, physician assistant licensed pursuant to section 20-12b, advanced practice registered nurse, or nurse-midwife to the extent that they are authorized to prescribe such controlled substances. Except as otherwise provided by regulations adopted pursuant to section 21a-244, the person filling or refilling the prescription shall include the date of filling and the person\u2019s signature or initials on any prescription for controlled substances, and the prescription shall be retained on file by the proprietor of the pharmacy in which it is filled for a period of three years, so as to be readily accessible for inspection by any public officer or employee engaged in the enforcement of this chapter.

In response to a concern that such drags were being diverted into unlawful channels, in 1970 the New York Legislature created a special commission to evaluate the State\u2019s drug-control laws. The commission found the existing laws deficient in several respects. There was no effective way to prevent the use of stolen or revised prescriptions, to prevent unscrupulous pharmacists from repeatedly refilling prescriptions, to prevent users from obtaining prescriptions from more than one doctor, or to prevent doctors from over-prescribing, either by authorizing an excessive amount in one prescription or by giving one patient multiple prescriptions. In drafting new legislation to correct such defects, the commission consulted with enforcement officials in California and Illinois where central reporting systems were being used effectively.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 591-92. The court further noted that the chairman of the temporary state commission to evaluate the drag laws, in his summary of the commission\u2019s findings, explained that \u201c[l]aw enforcement officials in both California and Illinois ha[d] been consulted in considerable depth about the use of multiple prescriptions, since they ha[d] been using them for a considerable period of time.

We agree that it reasonably may be presumed that such a review is more likely to reveal criminal conduct than a routine regulatory inspection and, therefore, more likely to result in the filing of criminal charges. That fact, however, is irrelevant to the issue of whether a law enforcement official\u2019s inspection of records of a person\u2019s prescriptions for controlled substances gives rise to a privacy invasion of <em>constitutional </em>magnitude. As we discussed previously, records of an individual\u2019s prescriptions for controlled substances lawfully are subject to review by a host of different people, including state consumer protection agents empowered to investigate and arrest persons for criminal violations of the drug laws. See General Statutes \u00a7 21a-261 (d). Consequently, that individual has a greatly reduced privacy expectation in those records, and, thus, any marginal loss of privacy that an individual may suffer as a result of an inspection of his or her records of prescriptions for controlled substances in connection with a criminal investigation is insignificant in relation to the privacy invasion to which he <em>already </em>has been subjected. It is the minimal nature of that additional intrusion, not the added potential for arrest and prosecution, that governs the determination of whether the intrusion has constitutional implications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\"> The dissent\u2019s assertion that footnote 32 of the majority opinion in <em>Whalen v. Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 604, supports the conclusion that <em>Whalen </em>is distinguishable from the present case\u2014a claim that the defendant himself has not raised\u2014is entirely without merit. In that footnote, the court noted that the plaintiffs, relying on <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), and <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967), had alleged that a constitutionally protected privacy right in their prescription information emanated not only from the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, but also from the fourth amendment. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 604 n.32. After distinguishing the nature of the privacy rights at issue in <em>Terry </em>and Katz\u2014cases that involved state intrusions into core fourth amendment values\u2014from the confidentiality interest asserted under the facts of <em>Whalen, </em>the court then <em>rejected </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the fourth amendment provided a separate and independent basis for their claim of a constitutional right of privacy in their prescription information. Id. The dissent turns this conclusion on its head by asserting that the <em>refusal </em>of the court in <em>Whalen </em>to acknowledge a separate and distinct fourth amendment underpinning to the plaintiffs\u2019 privacy claim somehow lends support to the contention that <em>Whalen, </em>does not control the present case. In misconstruing footnote 32 as it does, the dissent misperceives the import of the fourth and fourteenth amendments in relation to the defendant\u2019s claims: the defendant has a qualified right of privacy in his prescription records emanating from the fourteenth amendment; to the extent that his qualified privacy right in those records allegedly gives rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy in the particular context of a <em>criminal </em>case, he may seek to invoke the protections of the fourth amendment to suppress the <em>state\u2019s use </em>of those records against him at a criminal trial. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s reading of footnote 32 of the majority opinion in <em>Whalen </em>is wrong for yet another, more fundamental reason: it simply cannot be squared with the holding of <em>Whalen </em>that the New York statutory scheme did not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights even though, under that scheme, the prescription information was subject to warrantless inspections by state investigators responsible for enforcing the state\u2019s <em>criminal </em>drug laws.

This reliance is misplaced. First, the dissent points to nothing in the special needs cases that casts any doubt on the continued vitality of <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 589, which, as we have explained, is legally indistinguishable from the present case. Furthermore, the special needs doctrine simply does not bear upon the issue raised in the present case, in which the defendant, like the patients in <em>Whalen, </em>cannot prevail on his constitutional claim because he has a drastically reduced expectation of privacy in records of his prescriptions for controlled substances in light of the extent to which those records properly are subject to inspection. See id., 602. Under the special needs doctrine, the government does not seek to justify a warrantless search or seizure on the ground that the individual subject to that intrusion already has a sufficiently reduced expectation of privacy such that a further privacy intrusion by the government is not constitutionally meaningful. To the contrary, the claimed justification for breaching the individual\u2019s <em>otherwise reasonable expectation of privacy </em>under a special needs rationale is a special need to do so that is <em>beyond the needs of ordinary law enforcement. </em>See, e.g., <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, </em>supra, 666. By contrast, in <em>Whalen, </em>the court expressly approved a statutory scheme designed specifically to assist the state in enforcing its criminal drug laws because the means chosen by the state did not violate the patients\u2019 <em>already reduced </em>expectation of privacy in their prescription records. See <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 602.

See footnote 27 of the majority opinion. If that is the case, I cannot perceive what affirmative authority \u00a7 2 la-265 provides, nor can I perceive how the majority\u2019s reading of the statute differs from my reading that it is intended to be a shield for pharmacy owners and operators, and other persons with privacy interests in pharmacy records, not a sword for government officials seeking access to those records. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ingly, I do not see why it is necessary to consider the constitutionality of that statute or of the only statutes that, in my view, do provide government officials with affirmative authority to inspect pharmacy records, namely, \u00a7 21a-261<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that statute\u2019s federal counterpart, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of those statutes purports to authorize a warrantless search of pharmacy records for criminal law enforcement proposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Rather, I would conclude that the question to be answered is whether, under the fourth amendment, the government may compel disclosure of sensitive personal information for a valid regulatory purpose and then use that information for criminal law enforcement purposes. The majority, relying on <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 591, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1977), concludes that it may. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In <em>Whalen, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality, under the fourteenth amendment, of the New York State Controlled Substances Act of 1972; N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3300 et seq. (McKinney Sup. 1976-1977). The statute required the recording, in a centralized computer file, of the names and addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>of all persons who had obtained certain drugs pursuant to prescriptions from physicians. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 591. The law had been enacted to correct defects in the preexisting law, under which \u201c[t]here was no effective way to prevent the use of stolen or revised prescriptions, to prevent unscrupulous pharmacists from repeatedly refilling prescriptions, to prevent users from obtaining prescriptions from more than one doctor, or to prevent doctors from over-prescribing . . . .\u201d Id., 592. The law was challenged by a group of patients regularly receiving prescriptions for Schedule II drugs, which include opium and opium derivatives, cocaine, methadone, amphetamines and methaqualone, by doctors who prescribed such drugs and by two associations of physicians. Id., 593 n.8, 595. They claimed that the \u201cthe statute threaten[ed] to impair their interest in the nondisclosure of private information\u201d in violation of the fourteenth amendment. Id., 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The court noted that \u201c [t]he concept of a constitutional right of privacy still remains largely undefined. There are at least three facets that have been partially revealed, but their form and shape remain to be fully ascertained. The first is the right of the individual to be free in his private affairs from governmental surveillance and intrusion. The second is the right of an individual not to have his private affairs made public by the government. The third is the right of an individual to be free in action, thought, experience, and belief from governmental compulsion. . . . The first of [these] facets .. . is directly protected by the Fourth Amendment; the second and third correspond to the two kinds of interests referred to in [this opinion].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 599 n.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The court also explicitly rejected the appellees\u2019 claim, based on language in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 9, 22, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), and <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Ed. 2d 576 (1967), \u201cthat a constitutional privacy right emanates from the Fourth Amendment . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 604 n.32. The court concluded that \u201cthose cases involve affirmative, unannounced, narrowly focused intrusions into individual privacy during the course of criminal investigations. We have never carried the Fourth Amendment\u2019s interest in privacy as far as the Roe appellees would have us. We decline to do so now.\u201d Id. In other words, where there is no government surveillance and intrusion for criminal law enforcement purposes, the mere disclosure of personal information does not constitute an invasion of privacy under the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Thus, the court in <em>Whalen </em>explicitly distinguished fourth amendment privacy interests from fourteenth amendment privacy interests and made it clear that there was no colorable fourth amendment claim in that case. Id. The court did recognize, however, that the government typically has a duty to avoid unwarranted disclosure of personal information in government files and that that duty \u201carguably has its roots in the Constitution . . . .\u201d Id., 605. The court concluded that, because the New York statute adequately protected the confidentiality of the records; id.; the \u201crecord [did] not establish an invasion of any right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id., 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The majority concludes that, under <em>Whalen, </em>because state and federal regulatory agents have access to the defendant\u2019s pharmacy records under their respective regulatory inspection schemes, he has no privacy interest in those records vis-a-vis criminal law enforcement officials. See footnote 39 of the majority opinion. In my view, however, the majority ignores the language in <em>Whalen </em>limiting the holding of that case to fourteenth amendment privacy interests. It also ignores the United States Supreme Court cases decided under the special needs doctrine that have developed and clarified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>distinction, merely referred to in Whalen, between the privacy interest in nondisclosure of personal information and the privacy interest in being free from government surveillance and intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In special needs cases, the question is whether a wan-antless and suspicionless search is nevertheless reasonable under the fourth amendment because \u201cspecial needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives \u2019 Assn., </em>489 U.S. 602, 619, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 103 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1989). In <em>Skinner, </em>the court considered the constitutionality of a regulation providing for the suspicionless and warrantless toxicological testing of railway workers. The court concluded that such testing was justified and did not violate the fourth amendment when the purpose was \u201cnot to assist in the prosecution of employees, but rather \u2018to prevent accidents and casualties in railroad operations that result from impairment of employees by alcohol or drugs.\u2019 \u201d Id., 620-21. The court noted, however, that the regulation under review provided in part that \u201c[e]ach sample provided under [Sub-part C] is retained for not less than six months following the date of the accident or incident and may be made available to ... a party in litigation upon service of appropriate compulsory process on the custodian . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 621 n.5. The court further noted that \u201c[w]hile this provision might be read broadly to authorize the release of biological samples to law enforcement authorities, the record does not disclose that it was intended to be, or actually has been, so used. Indeed, while respondents aver generally that test results might be made available to law enforcement authorities . . . they do not seriously contend that this provision, or any other part of the administrative scheme, was designed as \u2018a \u201cpretext\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>enable law enforcement authorities to gather evidence of penal law violations.\u2019 <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691, [716-17 n.27, 107 S. Ct. 2636, 96 L. Ed. 2d 601] (1987). Absent a persuasive showing that the [Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s] testing program is pretextual, we assess the . . . scheme in light of its obvious administrative purpose. We leave for another day the question whether routine use in criminal prosecutions of evidence obtained pursuant to the administrative scheme would give rise to an inference of pretext, or otherwise impugn the administrative nature of the [Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s] program.\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn., </em>supra, 621 n.5. Thus, the court in <em>Skinner </em>clearly recognized that the purpose of a search may be constitutionally significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In <em>Vernonia School District 47J </em>v. <em>Acton, </em>515 U.S. 646, 650-51, 115 S. Ct. 2386, 132 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1995), the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a school policy under which students who wished to play sports were required, under monitored conditions, to provide urine samples that were then tested for drugs. The court recognized that \u201c[w]here a search is undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrongdoing, this Court has said that reasonableness generally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 653. It also criticized the dissenting opinion in that case for \u201clump[ing] this search together with \u2018evidentiary\u2019 searches, which generally require probable cause\u201d; id., 658-59 n.2; and emphasized that \u201cthe search here is undertaken for prophylactic and distinctly <em>non-</em>punitive purposes . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 658 n.2. Thus the court again clearly suggested that the purpose of the search is constitutionally significant. The court concluded that the government interest in protecting high school athletes from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>adverse effects of drug use and ensuring a drug-free school justified the warrantless drug tests. Id., 664-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, </em>489 U.S. 656, 660, 109 S. Ct. 1384, 103 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1989), the court considered the constitutionality of a program promulgated by the United States Customs Service that required drag testing of employees who applied for or occupied certain positions within the service. The court noted that \u201c [i]t is clear that the Customs Service\u2019s drag-testing program is not designed to serve the ordinary needs of law enforcement. Test results may not be used in a criminal prosecution of the employee without the employee\u2019s consent.\u201d Id., 666. It concluded that the government\u2019s interest in ensuring the physical health and unimpeachable integrity and judgment of customs agents involved in interdiction of drag traffic justified the warrantless searches. Id., 670; see also <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 875, 107 S. Ct. 3164, 97 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1987) (warrantless search of probationer\u2019s home is justified by purposes of probation, i.e., rehabilitation of probationer and protection of public); <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T. L.

See <em>National \"Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 659-60. Accordingly, the same persons who had authority to view the drag test results had authority to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the drug laws. The United States Supreme Court found it constitutionally significant, however, that the test results could not be used for criminal law enforcement purposes without the employee\u2019s consent. Id., 666. Thus, even though it is clear that the employees had no protectible fourteenth amendment privacy interest in the test results vis-a-vis the service, the court clearly suggested that the employees retained a fourth amendment privacy interest in that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Charleston, </em>532 U.S. 67, 70, 121 S.

Ed. 2d 205 (2001), the court considered \u201cwhether the [state\u2019s] interest in using the threat of criminal sanctions to deter pregnant women from using cocaine can justify a departure from the general rule that an official nonconsensual search is unconstitutional if not authorized by a valid warrant.\u201d A task force consisting of representatives of a university hospital, the police, a local substance abuse commission and the state\u2019s department of social services had adopted a policy concerning the management of drug abuse during pregnancy. Id., 71. Under the policy, a pregnant patient was to be tested for cocaine use if she met one of nine specified criteria. Id. The policy also provided that patients who tested positive would be referred to a substance abuse clinic. Id., 72. If the patient tested positive a second time, the police were to be notified, and the patient arrested. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Ten women who had been arrested after testing positive for cocaine use challenged the policy, claiming that the warrantless and nonconsensual drug tests were unconstitutional searches. Id., 73. The respondent task force members claimed that the petitioners had consented to the searches and that, as a matter of law, the searches were reasonable because they were justified by special purposes not related to law enforcement. The court did not resolve the respondents\u2019 claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the patients had consented to the searches, because the issue had not been addressed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Id., 76. As to the respondents\u2019 claim that the searches were justified by \u201cspecial non-law-enforcement\u201d purposes; id., 74; the court recognized that, \u201cin limited circumstances, a search unsupported by either warrant or probable cause can be constitutional when \u2018special needs\u2019 other than the normal need for law enforcement provide sufficient justification.\u201d Id., 75 n.7. It also recognized, however, that \u201c[i]n . . . special needs cases, we have tolerated suspension of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant or probable cause requirement in part because <em>there was no law enforcement purpose behind the searches in those cases, and there was little, if any, entanglement with law enforcement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 79 n.15. It concluded that \u201cthe purpose actually served by [these] searches is ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 81. \u201cWhile the ultimate goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment and off of drugs, the immediate objective of the searches was to generate evidence <em>for law enforcement purposes </em>in order to reach that goal. The threat of law enforcement may ultimately have been intended as a means to an end, but the direct and primary purpose of [the] policy was to ensure the use of those means. In our opinion, this distinction is critical. Because law enforcement involvement always selves some broader social purpose or objective, under respondents\u2019 view, virtually any nonconsensual suspicionless search could be immunized under the special needs doctrine by defining the search solely in terms of its ultimate, rather than immediate, purpose.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 82-84. The court concluded that the case \u201csimply does not fit within the closely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>guarded category of \u2018special needs.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 84 see also <em>Indianapolis </em>v. <em>Edmond, </em>531 U.S. 32, 42-43, 121 S. Ct. 447, 148 L. Ed. 2d 333 (2000) (\u201csevere and intractable nature of the drug problem\u201d did not justify establishment of vehicle checkpoints when purpose was general crime control). Thus, the court in <em>Ferguson </em>recognized that the special needs balancing test is not applicable in cases where the search is undertaken for general law enforcement purposes. See <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Charleston, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 74 n.7 (recognizing that balancing test should be applied only in exceptional cases where special needs make obtaining warrant impracticable).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The majority concludes that, under <em>Whalen, </em>because a large number of government officials may look at the defendant\u2019s pharmacy records, he has no privacy interest in those records vis-a-vis the government and, therefore, a government official\u2019s motive for looking at the records is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether a search has taken place. I simply do not see how that conclusion can be reconciled with the special needs cases. In <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn., </em>supra, 489 U.S. 621 n.5, the court explicitly stated that it was leaving to another day \u201cthe question whether routine use in criminal prosecutions of evidence obtained pursuant to the administrative scheme would give rise to an inference of pretext, or otherwise impugn the administrative nature of the [Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s] program.\u201d In <em>Vernonia School District 47J </em>v. <em>Acton, </em>supra, 515 U.S. 658 n.2, the court emphasized that the search under review in that case was reasonable because it was \u201cundertaken for prophylactic and distinctly nowpunitive purposes . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) In <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>v. <em>Von Raab, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 666, the drug test results were scrutinized by government officials with criminal law enforcement authority and the court found it constitutionally significant that the drug test results \u201cmay not be used in a criminal prosecution of the employee without the employee\u2019s consent.\u201d Finally, in <em>Ferguson v. Charleston, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 82-84 the court held that a government program the primary purpose of which was to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes was unconstitutional even when the ultimate purpose of the program was to improve public health.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In my view these cases clearly indicate that the government cannot collect for an administrative purpose sensitive personal information in which an individual would otherwise have a reasonable expectation of pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>vacy and then, claiming that the expectation of privacy has been vitiated because the information has been collected, use the information in a criminal investigation. I do not believe that if the government policies under review in <em>Skinner </em>and <em>Vemonia School District 47J </em>had provided that the drug test results routinely would be provided to the police, or if the drug testing program in <em>National Treasury Employees Union </em>had provided that the customs service could use the test results for general criminal law enforcement purposes without the consent of the employee, those policies would have been found to be constitutional. Nor do I believe that even if the primary purpose of the government program under review in <em>Ferguson </em>had been to identify babies needing special medical attention at birth, but the program had provided that the test results routinely would be provided to the police, such a policy would have been found to be constitutional. I cannot perceive any reason that the government\u2019s practice of obtaining such information for a criminal law enforcement purpose in the absence of specific regulatory authority should be treated any differently. Accordingly, I do not believe that such a practice is constitutional. In concluding in this case that it is,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the majority essentially has adopted the reasoning of the dissenting opinions in <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Charleston, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 100 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (arguing that existence of criminal law enforcement purpose cannot invalidate otherwise lawful search); and <em>Indianapolis </em>v. <em>Edmond, </em>supra, 531 U.S. 52 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>that subjective intent of person performing search is irrelevant and that \u201c[i]t is the objective effect of the State\u2019s actions on the privacy of the individual that animates the Fourth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">I recognize that the special needs cases, unlike this case, involve intrusions into a person\u2019s body or home. In my view, however, that distinction is not significant. As recognized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 389 U.S. 353, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people\u2014and not simply \u2018areas\u2019 . . . .\u201d Id. (rejecting view that fourth amendment applies only to intrusion into given enclosure and seizure of tangible items and concluding that it applies to words spoken in public telephone booth). Furthermore, I do not see why the government should be able to do in two or three or four steps what it cannot do in one. If the government cannot collect private materials or information without obtaining a warrant if it intends to use the information for a criminal law enforcement purpose, it cannot compel private entities to collect such information and then obtain it from the private entities and use it for such a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In short, I believe that an individual\u2019s fourth amendment interest in being free from governmental surveillance and intrusion for criminal law enforcement purposes is, as recognized by the court in <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 599 n.24, distinct from and, in cases where the government has compelled the disclosure for a legitimate regulatory purpose, broader than the fourteenth amendment privacy interest in being free from the disclosure of sensitive personal information. See also Ante v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 389 U.S. 350 (\u201c[the Fourth] Amendment protects individual privacy against certain kinds of governmental intrusion, but its protections go further, and often have nothing to do with privacy at all\u201d). This is especially so in cases, like this one, where the records are not required to be kept in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>a format that reveals information about specific individuals and, consequently, where there has not necessarily been any prior invasion of an individual\u2019s fourteenth amendment privacy interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the government has a legitimate interest in regulating the distribution of Schedule II drugs by pharmacies and physicians that justifies the regulatory inspection scheme, that interest does not require that the government have access to records designed to reveal information about individual consumers, and it would not be undermined by requiring probable cause and a warrant before criminal law enforcement officials are allowed to search such records. Accordingly, I would conclude that the fourth amendment requires probable cause and a search warrant to search an individual\u2019s pharmacy records.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Finally, I note that, under the majority\u2019s decision in this case, individuals will have even less protection from egregious government conduct than the pervasively regulated pharmacies. The state can now conduct a flagrantly illegal inspection of pharmacy records and use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>any materials seized in a criminal prosecution of an individual, even though it could not use the information in proceedings against the pharmacy, because the conduct simply will not constitute a search as to the individual. This point was made very clearly in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Payner, </em>447 U.S. 727, 100 S. Ct. 2439, 65 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1980). In that case, the government engaged in egregious conduct that the United States Supreme Court characterized as \u201cunconstitutional and possibly criminal,\u201d in order to obtain evidence against the defendant. Id., 733. Nevertheless, the court held that, because evidence had been in possession of a third party, the defendant had no expectation of privacy in the materials seized and he had no protectible fourth amendment interest. Id., 731-32. Therefore, the court held that the exclusionary rule did not apply. Id., 734. In my view, the special needs cases clearly indicate that this principle does not apply when the government has compelled the disclosure of the object of the search in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">I would conclude that the defendant\u2019s pharmacy records were properly suppressed as having been obtained in the course of a warrantless search unsupported by any recognized exception to the warrant requirement. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-10\"> See footnote 18 of the majority opinion for the text of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-265.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> See footnote 26 of the majority opinion for the text of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-261.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> See footnote 13 of the majority opinion for the text of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> The majority states that, while \u00a7 21a-265 \u201caffirmatively authorizes\u201d inspection of pharmacy records, \u00a7 21a-261 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880 \u201cwere enacted to protect pharmacists from unreasonable, warrantless intrusions by federal and state regulatory personnel . . . .\u201d Footnote 20 of the majority opinion. In my opinion, this reading stands the statutes on their heads. Section 21a-261 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 880 constitute the regulatory scheme that <em>reduces </em>the pharmacists\u2019 expectation of privacy for fourth amendment purposes. Admittedly, those statutes contain restrictions on the authority to inspect that are dictated by the fourth amendment, but, in the absence of the statutes, the fourth amendment would prohibit <em>any </em>intrusion by the government without a warrant or the consent of the pharmacists. On the other hand, in my view, the only purpose of \u00a7 21a-265 is to protect pharmacists and other persons with privacy interests in pharmacy records from the unwarranted disclosure of the records to unauthorized persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\"> The court also concluded that \u201c[w]hile state hospital employees, like other citizens, may have a duty to provide the police with evidence of criminal conduct that they inadvertently acquire in the course of routine treatment, when they undertake to obtain such evidence from their patients <em>for the specific purpose of incriminating those patients, </em>they have a special obligation to make sure that the patients are fully informed about their constitutional rights, as standards of knowing waiver require.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Charleston, </em>supra, 532 U.S. 84-85. I assume that a hospital does not \u201cinadvertently acquire\u201d evidence of cocaine use when it deliberately administers a test for such use, and, accordingly, I interpret this statement to mean that, if the hospital intends, either under a specific policy or in performance of its perceived civic duty, to inform the police if the results of the test are positive, it must obtain the prior consent of the patient. See <em>Vemonia School District 47J </em>v. <em>Acton, </em>supra, 515 U.S. 650-51, 664-65 (warrantless drug testing of athletes by school officials is reasonable under fourth amendment when test results are used only for school purposes and are not provided to law enforcement officials); <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 666 (warrantless drug testing of customs agents by customs agency is reasonable under fourth amendment when testing program is used for internal purposes and is not designed to serve ordinary needs of law enforcement). Furthermore, I interpret the court\u2019s statement that a patient has a reasonable privacy expectation that the results of diagnostic tests will not be disclosed to nonmedical personnel without the patient\u2019s consent; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Charleston, </em>supra, 84-85; to mean that, under the fourth amendment, the police are not authorized to go on fishing expeditions into patients\u2019 records, even though, when a state hospital does \u201cinadvertently acquire\u201d evidence of a crime, e.g., evidence of child abuse acquired during treatment of a child\u2019s irquries or evidence of drug abuse acquired while treating a patient for an apparent drug overdose, it must preserve medical records pertaining to the crime and may have a duty to disclose that information to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b504-5\"> I recognize that the majority concludes that the searches are specifically authorized by \u00a7 21a-265 and focuses its analysis on whether that statute is constitutional. As I have already indicated, I disagree with that analysis. Because the majority believes, however, that the defendant forfeited any expectation of privacy in his pharmacy records vis-a-vis the government when it disclosed the information to the pharmacy, it presumably would conclude that the search of the defendant\u2019s records was constitutional even in the absence of \u00a7 21a-265.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\"> In particular, I note the intangible and divisible nature of the information contained in prescriptions and the nature of the information storage systems used by the pharmacies. The use of an automated data processing system for the storage and retrieval of prescription information allows the pharmacy to produce the information in a variety of formats, not all of which are required by statute, not all of which are calculated to facilitate enforcement of the regulatory scheme, and not all of which reveal information about particular consumers. For example, the state has pointed to nothing in the governing statutes or regulations that specifically requires the pharmacy to maintain patient profiles, and it has not articulated any regulatory reason for Brown to have obtained the profiles in this case. Rather, it would appear that these profiles are maintained for the convenience of the patient and his physician. Furthermore, I note that an individual\u2019s potential privacy interest is implicated only if the information is disclosed in a format that reveals information about him personally, not, for example, when it appears anonymously in a record indicating how much of a particular controlled substance a pharmacy distributed in a particular month. I cannot conclude that, by assuming the risk that his prescription information would be used to further the regulatory scheme, the defendant assumed the risk that the government would inspect his patient profiles without a warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
