In connection with the death of Bobbie Gallo during an alleged armed robbery at Gallo\u2019s Liquor Store in Danbury on January 18, 1999, the plaintiff was charged with and convicted of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, first degree robbery in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2), and five counts of tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 (a). Following his sentence to a total effective sentence of ninety years imprisonment, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of conviction to this court. That appeal is still pending.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Thereafter, in connection with the same events, the state proceeded to trial in the case against the plaintiffs codefendant, Tommie Martin, charging that he had conspired with the plaintiff to commit robbery in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>degree. During that trial, the state filed a motion to compel the plaintiffs testimony, contending that, because he previously had waived the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination during his own trial, at which he was convicted of charges arising from Gallo\u2019s homicide, the privilege was no longer viable. In response, the plaintiff filed a brief raising essentially four arguments in opposition to the state\u2019s motion. First, the plaintiff claimed that he retained the right to invoke his fifth amendment privilege at Tommie Martin\u2019s trial because that proceeding was separate from his own criminal trial. Second, the plaintiff maintained that, because his judgment of conviction was on appeal, it was not yet final, and consequently, if his conviction were to be overturned, anything that he stated in the trial of Tommie Martin could be used against him at his retrial. Third, the plaintiff contended that he was entitled to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination based upon his legitimate concern that the testimony that the state sought to compel might furnish a link in the chain to other evidence supporting charges against him either for having committed perjury in his previous testimony or for having given a false sworn statement to the police, or for both. Finally, the plaintiff argued that he was entitled to invoke his fifth amendment privilege because the testimony the state possibly would seek to elicit could expose him to prosecution for other offenses, including conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The court permitted the state to call the plaintiff as a witness at Tommie Martin\u2019s trial, but ordered that the initial questioning take place outside the presence of the jury. Before the state began its questioning, the trial court advised the plaintiff \u201cthat in regard to . . . your testimony connected to the January 18, 1999 robbery and shooting at Gallo\u2019s Liquor Store, you don\u2019t have a fifth amendment privilege. And, I\u2019m ordering you to answer questions that are put to you. If you fail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>answer appropriate questions, then I\u2019m going to hold you in contempt of court and give you a jail sentence, which will be consecutive to the time you\u2019ve already gotten. You have your lawyer sitting next to you. If you feel or he feels that some question might elicit information that\u2019s inciiminating in another case or another crime, and I believe that\u2019s appropriate, then I\u2019ll make a decision about whether you should . . . answer those questions. OK? But, I\u2019m telling you that you have to testify here. If you don\u2019t, you may be found in contempt of court and get an additional jail sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Following some preliminary questions, the state asked the plaintiff the following question: \u201cDid you go to 32 Fairfield Ridge in Danbury, Connecticut in the early morning hours of January 18, 1999?\u201d When the plaintiff refused to answer, the court found him in contempt and sentenced him to six months imprisonment. The state then asked the plaintiff whether he had \u201ctestified] previously that [he], Tommie Martin, and Nicole Hams drove to the BP gas station on January 18,1999, in the early morning hours?\u201d He again refused to answer, resulting in a second contempt finding and an additional sentence of six months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The court thereafter cautioned the plaintiff: \u201cI\u2019m going to remind you once again, you do not have a fifth amendment privilege in regard to the events of January 18, 1999, at Gallo\u2019s Liquor Store, and I\u2019m warning you to testify, and if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to hold you in contempt of court.\u201d Thereafter, the state asked the plaintiff a series of questions, to which the plaintiff again invoked his privilege against self-incrimination and refused to answer. The questions were as follows: (1) \u201c[D]id Tommie Martin, your cousin, come out of the house when you pulled up\u2014when you got to 32 Fairfield Ridge?\u201d; (2) \u201cTommie [Martin] was with you at this time, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d; (3) \u201cDid you change your story <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>and tell [Detective Daniel Trompetta of the Bridgeport police department] that you were with Tommie Martin at the BP gas station next to Gallo\u2019s [Liquor Store]?\u201d; (4) \u201c[D]id you testify previously at your trial that you initially didn\u2019t tell [Detective] Trompetta that you were with Tommie Martin because you wanted to protect him?\u201d; (5) \u201c[D]id you tell the police that Tommie Martin wasn\u2019t there in order to protect him?\u201d; (6) \u201cDid you testify previously that you . . . initially told the police Tommie [Martin] wasn\u2019t there in order to protect him? Did you testify to that?\u201d; (7) \u201c[W]as [the .25 caliber Titan handgun, the alleged murder weapon] in your apartment in early January\u2014when it was in your apartment in early January of 1999, was Tommie Martin in the apartment [at] the same time?\u201d; and (8) \u201cThese [letters that were being shown by the state] are the letters that Tommie Martin gave you while you [and he] were incarcerated together at Walker correctional facility. Isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d Each time the plaintiff refused to answer a question, the court ordered him to answer and held him in contempt of court for thereafter refusing. The court imposed a fine each of the eight times it held the plaintiff in contempt. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Later that afternoon, the state called the plaintiff as a witness before the jury. During his testimony, the plaintiff invoked the privilege against self-incrimination eight more times in response to the following questions: (1) \u201c[W]hen you saw [the gun that was the alleged murder weapon] in your apartment in early January of 1999, was . . . Tommie Martin . . . present at the time?\u201d; (2) \u201c[H]ave you testified previously that that gun was in your apartment at the same time Tommie Martin was in your apartment?\u201d; (3) \u201cDid you testify previously that [Tommie Martin] didn\u2019t have a ride in a prior court proceeding?\u201d; (4) \u201cDid you testify previously . . . that when you got to [Harris\u2019] house, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Tommie Martin was coming out of the house. Did you testify to that . . . ?\u201d; (5) \u201cDid you testify previously that Tommie Martin got in the car after he was coming out of the house . . . [stating that] \u2018He met me coming to the house, got back in the car and drove off?\u2019 (6) \u201cDid you testify previously . . . [that] Tommie Martin got in the car with you and the three of you went to the BP gas station?\u201d; (7) \u201c[D]id you testify previously that when you got to the BP gas station, Tommie Martin was pumping the gas and Nicole Harris went to go and pay for the gas?\u201d; and (8) \u201cDid you testify previously . . . that you initially told the police Tommie Martin wasn\u2019t with you in order to protect Tommie Martin?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">At the conclusion of the plaintiffs testimony, the trial court, outside the presence of the jury, imposed fines for each of its eight additional contempt findings. Therefore, in total, the trial court found the plaintiff in contempt eighteen times and sentenced him to twelve months imprisonment and $1600 in fines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court remitted all the fines, but left intact the sentences of imprisonment based upon the first two contempt findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that he properly exercised his privilege against self-incrimination and that the trial court therefore, improperly held him in contempt. In support of his claim, the plaintiff reiterates the arguments that he had made before the trial court. The trial court, however, did not address all of the plaintiffs claims, focusing instead on only one factor\u2014 that, by testifying at his own trial, the plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>waived his privilege against self-incrimination. The state does not argue in support of the trial court\u2019s reasoning, but, rather, submits a variety of alternate grounds supporting the ultimate findings of contempt. The state\u2019s primary position is that the plaintiff properly was compelled to testify because he could not be punished any further for testifying, either for perjury, conspiracy or felony murder, were his conviction to be overturned. Essentially, the state contends that, because the trial court <em>compelled </em>the plaintiff to testify, the testimony would be inadmissible against him in any subsequent prosecution. In addition, the state claims that some of the questions the plaintiff refused to answer were merely foundational, and that, by answering previous questions in this proceeding, the plaintiff had waived his privilege. We conclude that the plaintiff properly invoked his privilege and, accordingly, that the trial court improperly held him in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u201cThe present case, which involves a review of a summary criminal contempt proceeding, comes before us on a writ of error which is the sole method of review of such proceedings. <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>State, </em>148 Conn. 77, 78-79,167 A.2d 450 (1961); <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>84 Conn. 60, 63, 78 A. 853 (1911). The scope of our review reaches only those matters appearing as of record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 347, 429 A.2d 900 (1980); <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 217, 223, 175 A. 582 (1934). In a review of summary criminal contempt, the inquiry is limited to a determination of the jurisdiction of the court below. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Hamersley, </em>44 Conn. 393, 413 (1877). Subsumed in this inquiry are three questions, namely, (1) whether the designated conduct is legally susceptible of constituting a contempt; <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra [63]; (2) whether the punishment imposed was authorized by law; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>147 Conn. 167, 169, 158 A.2d 166 (1960); and (3) whether the judicial authority was qualified to conduct the hearing. <em>May-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>berry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 465-66, 91 S.

Ed. 2d 532 (1971). <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 257, 440 A.2d 969 (1982). <em>In re Dodson, </em>214 Conn. 344, 346-47, 572 A.2d 328, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 896, 111 S. Ct. 247, 112 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>221 Conn. 498, 500-501, 605 A.2d 1350, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 875, 113 S. Ct. 216, 121 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">This case implicates only the first question set forth in <em>Jackson, </em>that is, whether the plaintiffs conduct was legally susceptible of constituting a contempt. Id., 500. The plaintiff claims that under the circumstances of this case, he properly refused to answer the questions, and, accordingly, that the trial court improperly determined, based upon his prior conviction of felony murder, that the plaintiff no longer could invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. Therefore, we begin our analysis with our well settled law regarding a witness\u2019 invocation of the fifth amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">A court may not deny a witness\u2019 invocation of the fifth amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination unless it is \u201cperfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] cannot possibly have [a] tendency to incriminate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>200 Conn. 310, 319, 511 A.2d 1000 (1986), quoting <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 488, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951). \u201cTo sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 486-87; <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>170 Conn. 206, 209, 365 A.2d 821, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 954, 96 S. Ct. 1732, 48 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1976). In appraising a fifth amendment claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>by a witness, a judge \u201cmust be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly concluded that he no longer could invoke the privilege against self-incrimination as a result of having testified in a prior proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, he contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination at his own trial did not extend beyond that proceeding. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">It is well settled that a waiver of the self-incrimination privilege in one proceeding does not affect the rights of a witness in another, separate proceeding. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>153 Conn. 26, 34, 211 A.2d 674 (1965)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (\u201cIt is settled law that even if an accused waives his privilege against self-incrimination by voluntarily testifying [at his own trial], the waiver is limited to the particular proceeding in which he volunteers the testimony. 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2276 (4), p. 470 [McNaughton Rev. 1961].\u201d); 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (5th Ed. 1999) \u00a7 134 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>(\u201c[a] witness\u2019s loss of the privilege by testifying . . . applies throughout but not beyond the \u2018proceeding\u2019 in which the witness has [testified]\u201d). Indeed, virtually all the federal circuits recognize this principle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It similarly is established in numerous states that have addressed the issue that a person who has waived his privilege in one proceeding is not estopped from asserting the privilege in a subsequent proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Given the weight of this authority, the state does not defend the trial court\u2019s reasoning for its decision, but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>rather, raises several arguments in the alternative to support the contempt findings. First, the state claims that, by answering some questions before invoking his fifth amendment privilege, the plaintiff essentially waived his right to withhold testimony in connection with any other questions. This court previously has held that \u201c[a] testimonial waiver is not lightly to be inferred . . . [and] should be inferred only in the most compelling circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Altrui, 188 Conn. 161, 169, 448 A.2d 837 (1982). In the present case, before any questions were asked, the trial court issued a <em>directive </em>to the plaintiff to either answer <em>any and all </em>questions related to the robbery of Gallo\u2019s Liquor Store or face contempt. An inference that the plaintiff waived the privilege would require a determination that he began his testimony freely and voluntarily, knowing that his answers to any questions would be interpreted as a waiver. Id., 168. That supposition is not supported by the record here.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The state\u2019s second argument\u2014that the questions relating to the plaintiffs prior testimony were merely foundational questions and were, therefore, not incriminatory in nature\u2014is equally unavailing. Again, the court drew no distinction between foundational and other questions. It did not rule on a question-by-question basis, but, rather, the court issued a preliminary blanket ruling that required the plaintiff to answer <em>any and all </em>questions pertaining to the robbery. Moreover, the mere confirmation of the existence and accuracy of former incriminating testimony, albeit by implication, could itself be incriminating. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranti, </em>253 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>F.2d 135, 138 (2d Cir. 1958). Indeed, the acknowledgment of his prior testimony that the state sought in the present case would undoubtedly become part of the state\u2019s evidence, in any subsequent prosecution for conspiracy or on retrial after a successful appeal, either as part of its chain of proof or as a means of bolstering the credibility of the prior testimony. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Finally, the state argues that the trial court\u2019s contempt findings were proper because the plaintiffs testimony had been compelled, and consequently, the testimony could not be used against him for any purpose, either in connection with a retrial, should he prevail on appeal, or any other trial. Therefore, according to the state, because his compelled testimony could not be used, the plaintiff could not invoke his fifth amendment privilege to not testify. This argument is flawed both as a matter of logic and law. The court properly cannot compel testimony from a witness who has a legitimate fifth amendment privilege. A court properly can compel a witness to testify only when there is no legitimate privilege. Accordingly, when a court orders a witness cloaked with the privilege to testify, that witness retains the right to exercise the privilege, to refuse to testify, and to thereafter test the validity of the privilege on appeal if the court finds him in contempt. The state\u2019s argument here suggests that when a court improperly orders a witness to testify, it essentially grants him use immunity, notwithstanding the otherwise proper exercise of the privilege, the trial court\u2019s lack of power to grant such use immunity, and the state\u2019s failure to invoke General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Moreover, the trial court in the present case never intended to provide any immunity, nor did it suggest to the state that it should consider immunity as an option because the court improperly concluded that the plaintiff no longer held a fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Therefore, any representation now by the state that it could not use the plaintiffs testimony at any subsequent proceeding because it was compelled reflects a consideration that it should have, but did not, express at the trial. Finally, the same argument expressed by the state herein was rejected expressly by the Supreme Court in <em>Pillsbury Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Conboy, </em>459 U.S. 248, 261-63, 103 S. Ct. 608, 74 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1983), when it held that the federal District Court could not hold the witness in contempt for properly exercising his privilege against self-incrimination based upon the trial court\u2019s prediction that a future court would suppress that testimony and thereby not allow it to be used against the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We conclude that the trial court in the present case improperly determined that the plaintiff could no longer invoke the privilege against self-incrimination because of his testimony in a prior proceeding, and we reject the state\u2019s alternate grounds for affirming the judgment of contempt. Accordingly, we conclude that each of the contempt findings must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to vacate the contempt findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-33 provides: \u201cAny court, including a family support magistrate, may punish by fine and imprisonment any person who in its presence behaves contemptuously or in a disorderly maimer; but no court or family support magistrate may impose a greater fine than one hundred dollars or a longer term of imprisonment than six months or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\"> The appeal of the plaintiffs criminal conviction pending in this court is captioned <em>State </em>v. Martin, Docket No. SC 16448.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> The trial court originally had imposed a $500 fine pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-33a for each of the sixteen contempt findings for which the plain! iff did not receive a term of imprisonment. In a subsequent correction, however, the trial court noted that the proper authority for the contempt findings was General Statutes \u00a7 51-33, which allows a maximum fine of $100 per finding. Thereafter, the court corrected the amount of the fines imposed accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> Although it was not the basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling, the state had stated in its motion in limine that the plaintiff no longer could invoke the privilege because he already had been convicted and sentenced for felony mmder and first degree robbery arising out of the incident at Gallo\u2019s liquor Store. The plaintiff claims in his brief to this court that, with respect to those events, he continues to retain his privilege against self-incrimination until the judgment of conviction becomes final. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The weight of authority permits a witness whose conviction has not been finalized on direct appeal to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination and to refuse to testify about the subject matter which formed the basis of his conviction. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 326, 119 S. Ct. 1307, 143 L.
