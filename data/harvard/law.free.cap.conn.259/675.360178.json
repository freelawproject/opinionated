The plaintiffs appealed the board\u2019s denial of their applications to the trial court, which dismissed their appeal, and the plaintiffs, on the granting of certification, appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We conclude that the board was required to make an express collective statement, concurrent with its decision denying the applications, that its denial was predicated on the industrial zone exemption. We further conclude that, because the board invoked the exemption for the first time on appeal to the trial court, the trial court improperly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The record discloses the following undisputed pertinent facts. In June, 1999, the plaintiffs submitted to the board six related zoning applications,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>proposed the construction of a 248 unit assisted living residential complex that included affordable housing on 22.6 acres on Woodmont Road in Milford. The subject property is bisected by two zoning districts. The front portion, comprising approximately 5.6 acres, is located in an area designated by Milford\u2019s zoning regulations as a light industrial zoning district. The rear portion of the subject property, comprising approximately seventeen acres, is located in an area designated by the regulations as a residential zoning district.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Thereafter, on September 21 and 28, 1999, the board commenced public hearings to address the plaintiffs\u2019 applications. At the hearings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiffs submitted a comprehensive packet that included copies of \u00a7 8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>30g, including the industrial zone exemption contained therein; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and Milford\u2019s zoning regulations that provide for a residential use exception to limited industrial zones.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In their presentation to the board, the plaintiffs raised the issue of the \u00a7 8-30g (c) exclusive industrial zone exemption, which contravened the usual presumption in favor of affordable housing land use applications, and explained from their perspective why it did not apply to their applications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At no time during the hearing did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>board, its members, or its professional staff make comments or ask questions regarding the application of the industrial zone exemption, or in any way challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the exemption did not apply to their applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">At the hearing, the plaintiffs also presented several witnesses who addressed specifics of the development, including traffic considerations, safety concerns, tax revenue issues, impact on Milford\u2019s industrial zoned property inventory and issues of density and consistency with Milford\u2019s comprehensive plan. This testimony was countered by opposition to the assisted living development voiced by neighbors and local politicians. On November 3,1999, after some of the board members stated their opposition to the applications because the proposed site development would adversely impact Milford\u2019s tax base and the proposed site development would generate traffic that would adversely impact public safety, the board denied the plaintiffs\u2019 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs appealed from the board\u2019s denial to the trial court, contending that the reasons given by the board did not satisfy the requirements for denying affordable housing applications pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (c). Specifically, they claimed that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>sons given, that the board had not established that the reasons clearly outweighed the need for affordable housing in Milford, and that the board had not established that any legitimate interests embodied in those reasons could not be protected by reasonable modification of the plaintiffs\u2019 proposal. The board responded by raising jurisdictional and substantive grounds for affirming its decision. Specifically, the board contended that JPI Partners was not aggrieved by the board\u2019s decision because it had no ownership interest in the property and that JPI Development lacked standing to appeal under \u00a7 8-30g because it had not joined in the applications. The board also asserted, for the first time, that the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1) did not apply in the present case because the applications placed affordable housing in an industrial zone that did not permit residential uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The plaintiffs countered that the court should not consider the industrial zone exemption because it had not been raised by the board at the administrative level. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that, by asserting a new basis for its denial of the applications for the first time on appeal, the board effectively denied the plaintiffs\u2019 right under \u00a7 8-30g (d) to submit, within the statutory appeal period, a modified plan locating all site development on the residentially zoned area of the subject property. See footnote 1 of this opinion. In connection with this claim, the plaintiffs requested permission from the trial court to supplement the record with such a modified site plan. The plaintiffs further argued that, even if the court properly could consider this new basis for the board\u2019s denial of the applications, the industrial zone exemption did not apply because the Milford zoning regulations allow residential uses in the type of light industrial zone at issue. See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In addressing the board\u2019s jurisdictional claims, the trial court examined the status of each of the plaintiffs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The trial court first determined that Hudak, while aggrieved, was \u201cnot an applicant who proposed to develop affordable housing\u201d and thus lacked standing to bring an appeal under \u00a7 8-30g. The court further determined however, that the other two plaintiffs\u2014JPI Partners, as the agent for JPI Development, and JPI Development itself, as the proposed developer\u2014did have standing to appeal. With regard to the substantive claims of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the trial court next determined that the board properly could raise, for the first time on appeal, the industrial zone exemption in subsection (c) (2) of \u00a7 8-30g as a reason for its decision denying the applications because the requirement in subsection (c) (1), that a municipal land use board state its reasons on the record for denying an affordable housing application, was inapplicable when the (c) (2) exemption was at issue. In reaching that conclusion, the trial court considered our decision in <em>Christian Activities Council, Congregational </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>249 Conn. 566, 735 A.2d 231 (1999), and concluded that our determination in that case, namely, that the zoning commission has the burden to state collectively its reason when denying an affordable housing application, was inapplicable because: (1) that case did not expressly address the industrial zoning exemption; and (2) the reasons we articulated therein were not relevant to this exemption. Moreover, the trial court determined that, although \u00a7 8-30g recently had been amended to impose the same collective statement requirement when the board\u2019s decision was predicated on the industrial zoning exemption,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the statute in effect at the time of the board\u2019s decision did not impose such a requirement. Therefore, the trial court considered itself free to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>board\u2019s reliance on the industrial zone exemption. The trial court thereafter determined that the board\u2019s reliance on the exemption was proper because, pursuant to the Milford zoning regulations, the affordable housing project proposed by the plaintiffs did not fall within either of the two exceptions to the industrial zone exemption, namely, the proposed housing was not \u201cassisted housing\u201d within the meaning of the statute; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (3) (defining assisted housing); and, pursuant to the Milford zoning regulations, the industrial zone in question did not permit residential uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Finally, the court considered the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to supplement the record to allow them to submit a modified site development plan that would locate the entire housing development within the residentially zoned portion of the property. The trial court recognized that the board\u2019s tardy invocation of the industrial zone exemption had in fact prevented the plaintiffs from including a revised site development in the record for the trial court to review. It nevertheless concluded that, because the exemption was predicated on the concern that affordable housing developments in industrial zones deprived towns of much needed tax revenues, and because the plaintiffs knew of the exemption and were aware of the residential use issue as to the industrial zone, they could not claim that they were prejudiced unfairly by the board\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, the trial court exercised its discretion and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to supplement the record. The trial court thereafter dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly: (1) determined that the board was not required to state its reasons for denying the plaintiffs\u2019 affordable housing application at the time it rendered its decision; (2) concluded that an assisted living resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>dential facility, which, pursuant to the Milford zoning regulations, is permitted in an industrial use zone, is not a residential use that falls within the \u00a7 8-30g (c) exception to the industrial zone exemption; (3) refused their request to supplement the record to allow them to introduce a modified site development plan that would have located the entire housing development on the portion of the property that is residentially zoned;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (4) determined that Hudak did not have standing to bring the appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiffs that the trial court improperly concluded that the board was not obligated, pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2), to state its reasons on the record, concurrent with its decision, for denying an affordable housing application.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim raises issues of statutory construction, over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 26, 717 A.2d 77 (1998). Our resolution of this claim is governed by well established principles. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 587 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>258 Conn. 733, 741, 785 A.2d 197 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In resolving this question we do not write on a clean slate. In <em>Christian Activities Council, Congregational </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 575-77, we outlined the differences that this court had identified previously between an affordable housing land use appeal brought pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g and a traditional zoning appeal. \u201cFirst, an appeal under \u00a7 8-30g (b) may be filed only by an applicant for an affordable housing development whose application was denied or [was] approved with restrictions which have a substantial adverse impact on the viability of the affordable housing development or the degree of affordability of the affordable dwelling units ....</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u201cSecond, the scope of judicial review under \u00a7 8-30g (c) requires the town, not the applicant, to marshal the evidence supporting its decision and to persuade the court that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the town\u2019s decision and the reasons given for that decision. By contrast, in a traditional zoning appeal, the scope of review requires the appealing aggrieved party to marshal the evidence in the record, and to establish that the decision was not reasonably supported by the record. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\u201cThird, if a town denies an affordable housing land use application, <em>it must state its reasons on the record, and that statement must take the form of a formal, official, collective statement of reasons for its actions. </em>... By contrast, in a traditional zoning appeal, if a zoning agency has failed to give such reasons, the court is obligated to search the entire record to find a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the [agency\u2019s] decision.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">As we stated in <em>Christian Activities Council, Congregational: </em>\u201cWe reach this conclusion based on the text and the purpose of the statute. The text requires that the town establish that sufficient record evidence supports the decision from which such appeal is taken and the reasons cited for such decision .... General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1) (A). Thus, textually the statute contemplates reasons that are cited by the town. This strongly suggests that such reasons be cited by the zoning agency at the time it took its formal vote on the application, rather than reasons that later might be culled from the record, which would include, as in a traditional zoning appeal, the record of the entire span of hearings that preceded the vote. Furthermore, the statute requires that the town establish that: its decision [was] necessary to protect substantial public interests in health, safety, or other matters which the [agency] may legally consider; General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1) (B); those interests clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing; General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1) (C); and those public interests cannot be protected by reasonable changes to the plan. General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1) (D). These requirements strongly suggest that the town be obligated, when it renders its decision, to identify those specific public interests that it seeks to protect by that decision, so that the court in reviewing that decision will have a clear basis on which to do so. Furthermore, the key purpose of \u00a7 8-30g is to encourage and facilitate the much needed development of affordable housing throughout the state. <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>[228 Conn. 498, 511, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994)]. Requiring the town to state its reasons on the record when it denies an affordable housing land use application will further that purpose because it will help guard against possibly pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>textual denials of such applications. We therefore read the statute, consistent with its text and purpose, to require the town to do so.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Christian Activities Council, Congregational </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Thereafter, in <em>Quarry Knoll II Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>256 Conn. 674, 719, 780 A.2d 1 (2001), we examined a public act that was enacted during the pendency of the appeal in that case, namely, P.A. 00-206, \u00a7 1; see footnote 1 of this opinion; which amended \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to determine \u201cwhether [the] textual change to the statute affects our scope of review in determining whether the commission ha[d] met its burden under \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1) (B), (C) and (D), and whether the amendment to \u00a7 8-30g (c) ha[d] retroactive application.\u201d <em>Quarry Knoll II Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 719. We concluded therein that the amendment was intended to clarify the original intent of that statute, namely, that there are two standards of judicial review under \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1) (A) through (D), and, therefore, that it had retroactive application.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 722, 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Although we did not have occasion in that case to examine whether the requirements of then (c) (1) were intended to apply as well to then subsection (c) (2), we note that the statutory language upon which <em>Christian Activities Council, Congregational </em>relied for imposing these requirements, although now prefatory, was not changed substantially.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, as we noted in <em>Quarry Knoll II Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 729, following our review of the legislative history of the amendments to \u00a7 8-30g, that portion of our decision in <em>Christian Activities Council, Congregational </em>that required the town to state its reasons on the record when denying an application was unaffected by the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Indeed, we find no principled reason for distinguishing between what were then subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 8-30g (c) with regard to the board\u2019s obligation. The statute contemplates that the zoning commission will have made certain factual determinations in the zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>proceedings, and the court is obligated to review those factual determinations pursuant to the scope of review set forth in the statute. The requirement that the commission make a collective statement of its reasons on the record when it denies an affordable housing land use application equally furthers the goals of the statute when the application falls either under then subdivision (1) or (2) of \u00a7 8-30g (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Furthermore, we agree with the plaintiffs that the trial court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 8-30g (c) denies applicants the opportunity to resubmit, within the statutory appeal period, a modified proposal pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (d). See footnote 1 of this opinion. The resubmittal procedure, unique to affordable housing applications, both supports the purpose of the statute to encourage and facilitate the development of much needed affordable housing and eliminates wasteful litigation and delay of such development by permitting an applicant effectively to address reasons for a denial at the administrative level. We therefore read \u00a7 8-30g, consistent with its text and purpose, to require the board to make a collective statement of its reasons on the record when it denies an affordable housing land use application. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s determination that the board did not have to disclose the industrial zone exemption as a reason for denying the applications and its conclusion that such reason could be raised by the board for the first time on appeal were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">As the trial court itself noted, \u201cbut for the location of a portion of the affordable housing complex in an industrial zone not permitting residential uses, the court would have had no option but to sustain the appeals.\u201d Because we have determined that the trial court improperly determined that the board could invoke the exemption for the first time on appeal, we need not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 8-30g provides: \u201c(a) As used in this section: (1) \u2018Affordable housing development\u2019 means a proposed housing development (A) which is assisted housing or (B) in which not less than twenty-five per cent of the dwelling units will be conveyed by deeds containing covenants or restrictions which shall require that such dwelling units be sold or rented at, or below, prices which will preserve the units as affordable housing, as defined in section 8-39a, for persons and families whose income is less than or equal to eighty per cent of the area median income or eighty per cent of the state median income, whichever is less, for at least thirty years after the initial occupation of the proposed development; (2) \u2018affordable housing application\u2019 means any application made to a commission in connection with an affordable housing development by a person who proposes to develop such affordable housing; (3) \u2018assisted housing\u2019 means housing which is receiving, or will receive, financial assistance under any governmental program for the construction or substantial rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing, and any housing occupied by persons receiving rental assistance under chapter 319uu or Section 1437\u00cd of Title 42 of the United States Code; (4) \u2018commission\u2019 means a zoning commission, planning commission, planning and zoning commission, zoning board of appeals or municipal agency exercising zoning or planning authority; and (5) \u2018municipality\u2019 means any town, city or borough, whether consolidated or unconsolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u201c(b) Any person whose affordable housing application is denied or is approved with restrictions which have a substantial adverse impact on the viability of the affordable housing development or the degree of affordability of the affordable dwelling units, specified in subparagraph (B) of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section, contained in the affordable housing development, may appeal such decision pursuant to the procedures of this section.

Now what\u2019s important there, I just would like to point out, because I have heard or I saw a memo from your City Attorney, I\u2019m not quite sure where I\u2019ve heard this issue brought up by some individual neighbors, and with regard to an industrial zoning district, I would like to just quickly refer you back to Exhibit K in my package and if you would go to the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>page please, which is the second page of \u00a7 8-30g, and right in the middle we have subparagraph c. Now if you go about half way down paragraph c or two thirds of the way, you\u2019ll see a number 2 and an A, both in parens; and what this says is that certain applications shall not be subject to the act, and what this, and I would just ask you to read it, the applicant, with me, the application, which was the subject of the decision from which such appeal was taken, in other words this is where it will not, it is not applicable, would locate affordable housing in an area which is zoned for industrial use and which does not permit residential uses and as we\u2019ll hear in a moment, the front portion is indeed zoned limited Industrial 30 and as indicated in your regulations for the [Limited Industrial 30] zone, a residential assisted living use is a permitted use in that zone so it does not fall, this application does not fall within that exemption of the statutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b705-5\"> The trial court observed that, \u201c[i]n the 2000 legislative session, the General Assembly modified this portion of the statute to require the collective statement of reasons for rejecting an affordable housing application on the industrial zone exception.\u201d See footnote 13 of this opinion for the current revision of the statutory provision at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> Although the plaintiffs attempted to introduce a modified site plan before the trial court, the board had only one plan before it for consideration. Because of the board\u2019s late disclosure of its reliance on the industrial zone exemption, the plaintiffs reasonably did not perceive the need to avail themselves of their right under \u00a7 8-30g (d) to submit within the statutory appeal period a modified plan locating all site development on the residentially zoned area of the subject property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b707-13\"> The plaintiffs withdrew at oral argument before this court the jurisdictional issue of Hudak\u2019s standing because JPI Development, the contract purchaser of the property, has standing to bring the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\"> In <em>Quarry Knoll II Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 678-80 n.3, the 1997 revision of \u00a7 8-30g was the governing statute.

Subsection (c) of the earlier revisions of the statute is now codified at subsection (g), which provides: \u201cUpon an appeal taken under subsection (f) of this section, the burden shall be on the commission to prove, based upon the evidence in the record compiled before such commission that the decision from which such appeal is taken and the reasons cited for such decision are supported by sufficient evidence in the record. The commission shall also have the burden to prove, based upon the evidence in the record compiled before such commission, that (1) (A) the decision is necessary to protect substantial public interests in health, safety, or other matters which the commission may legally consider; (B) such public interests clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing; and (C) such public interests cannot be protected by reasonable changes to the affordable housing development, or (2) (A) the application which was the subject of the decision from which such appeal was taken would locate affordable housing in an area which is zoned for industrial use and which does not permit residential uses, and (B) the development is not assisted housing, as defined in subsection (a) of this section. If the commission does not satisfy its burden of proof under this subsection, the court shall wholly or partly revise, modify, remand or reverse the decision from which the appeal was taken in a manner consistent with the evidence in the record before it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
