J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aei\">This certified appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arises from a petition by the department of children and families (department) for, inter alia, a determination of neglect as to the minor child, Candace H. (child). By agreement of the parties, the child was adjudicated neglected and was committed to the temporary custody of the department. On December 3, 1999, the department filed a motion with the trial court pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>(Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 46b-129 (k) (1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for review and approval of a permanency plan with respect to the child. On February 3, 2000, the respondent mother of the child (respondent) filed a motion for visitation. After conducting a hearing, the trial court granted the department\u2019s motion for approval of the permanency plan and denied the motion for visitation. In denying the motion for visitation, the trial court determined that court ordered visitation was not in the child\u2019s best interests, but it did not bar future visitation entirely. Rather, the court concluded that the department might, in its discretion, together with the foster parents, permit future visitation by the respondent. On June 1, 2000, the department filed a petition for termination of parental rights as to the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On March 30, 2000, the respondent appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for visitation with the child. The Appellate Court reversed, in part, the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the trial court properly had denied the respondent\u2019s motion for visitation; <em>In re Candace </em>II., 63 Conn. App. 493, 502, 776 A.2d 1180 (2001); but impermissibly had delegated to the department and to the child\u2019s foster parents<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cits independent obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>determine and further the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d Id., 504. The department then filed its petition for certification to appeal to this court, which we granted. <em>In re Candace H., </em>257 Conn. 907, 777 A.2d 686 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On October 10,2001, the respondent voluntarily relinquished her parental rights to the child. Thereafter, this court, sua sponte, ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue of whether the respondent\u2019s voluntary relinquishment of her parental rights rendered the appeal moot, and, if so, whether the appeal qualified for review under the \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 \u201d exception to the mootness doctrine. <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 382, 383-88, 660 A.2d 323 (1995). The department, which had filed a supplemental brief arguing that the issue was capable of repetition, yet evading review, subsequently filed a motion requesting, in the event that this court determines the appeal to be moot that this court vacate the judgment of the Appellate Court to the extent that it reversed the trial court\u2019s decision empowering the department and the foster parents to determine the propriety of any future visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">After examining the record and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we conclude that this appeal has been rendered moot and should be dismissed. See <em>In re Jessica M., </em>250 Conn. 747, 749, 738 A.2d 1087 (1999). \u201cWhen, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481,493, 778 A.2d 33 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>248 Conn. 64, 70, 726 A.2d 520 (1999); <em>In re Romance M., </em>229 Conn. 345, 357, 641 A.2d 378 (1994). We further determine that the issue presently before the court is not capable of repetition, yet evading review and, therefore, does not qualify for review under the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>to the mootness doctrine as enunciated in <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 382-88. We conclude, moreover, that the judgment of the Appellate Court in this matter should be vacated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Vacatur is appropriate when the public interest is served. See <em>U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Bonner Mall Partnership, </em>513 U.S. 18, 26, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L.
