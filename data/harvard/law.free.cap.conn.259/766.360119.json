We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On July 16, 1997, the plaintiff, Webster Bank (bank), brought an action seeking to foreclose a mortgage on three parcels of land in Clinton, of which the named defendant, Joanna V. Zak (Zak), was the titleholder of record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 24, 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the trial court, <em>Arena,, J., </em>rendered a judgment of foreclosure by sale. After determining the amount of the debt due on the note and the costs associated with the foreclosure action, the court scheduled the sale date for July 18, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The bank subsequently assigned its interest in the note and mortgage to EMC Mortgage Corporation (EMC). Thereafter, EMC moved to substitute itself as the plaintiff in the foreclosure action and Zak moved to extend the foreclosure sale date. On July 13, 1998, the trial court granted both motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court also opened the November 24, 1997 judgment and rendered a new judgment of foreclosure by sale with a sale date of September 19, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">On September 17, 1998, Zak filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut for protection under chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which was later converted to a chapter 7 bankruptcy. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. The filing of the bankruptcy petition stayed the trial court proceedings, and the foreclosure sale did not occur as scheduled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, EMC filed in the Bankruptcy Court a motion for relief from the bankruptcy stay. On January 5,1999, the Bankruptcy Court granted EMC\u2019s motion for relief from the stay on the condition that Tracy M. Saxe, the trustee of Zak\u2019s bankruptcy estate, be cited in as a party defendant in the foreclosure action. EMC subsequently moved in the trial court to open the judgment of foreclosure and to amend the complaint to cite in Saxe as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>party defendant. On February 8, 1999, the trial court opened the judgment and granted EMC\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint. EMC subsequently filed an amended complaint naming Saxe as a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">On March 31, 1999, Zak conveyed all of her right, title and interest, including her equity of redemption, in the foreclosed property to MFR by quitclaim deed. Saxe was not a signatoiy to the deed. Thereafter, MFR moved to be cited in as a party defendant, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-107 and Practice Book \u00a7 9-6, claiming that it was \u201cthe record titleholder of the property that is the subject of the foreclosure, and any judgment of foreclosure will necessarily affect it by foreclosing out its interest as the titleholder . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MFR furnished a copy of the quitclaim deed in support of its motion. On May 4, 1999, without objection from EMC or Saxe, the trial court granted MFR\u2019s motion. EMC subsequently filed a second amended complaint in which it named MFR as a party defendant, stating: \u201cBy her Quitclaim Deed dated March 31,1999, and recorded April 1, 1999 ... on the Clinton Land Records, [Zak] conveyed her interest in the mortgaged premises to [MFR].\u201d MFR is the only defendant involved in this certified appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">MFR filed an answer and special defense to EMC\u2019s second amended complaint. In its special defense, MFR claimed that EMC\u2019s failure to provide the appropriate notice of default pursuant to the requirements of the mortgage agreement barred it from instituting foreclosure proceedings. No other party filed a pleading in response to EMC\u2019s second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>On October 8, 1999, EMC filed a motion for summary judgment. EMC claimed that MFR was bound by the trial court\u2019s November 24, 1997 judgment as Zak\u2019s successor in interest, and was precluded, therefore, from asserting new defenses to liability that Zak had not asserted prior to that judgment. Similarly, EMC contended that MFR was bound by the amount of the mortgage debt as determined by the trial court in connection with that judgment. MFR opposed the motion for summary judgment as to both the issue of liability and the amount of the debt. On February 8, 2000, the trial court granted summary judgment on the issue of liability, and scheduled a hearing on the amount of the debt for May 31, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">At that hearing, EMC claimed that the trial court should calculate the amount by adding to the debt established at the November 24,1997 judgment the per diem interest that had accrued on that debt since that date. MFR contended, in response, that EMC\u2019s second amended complaint citing in MFR opened the pleadings and, thereby allowed MFR to assert new defenses to liability, as well as to contest the amount of the debt established by the trial court\u2019s November 24,1997 judgment. Therefore, MFR claimed, the court should hear evidence regarding the amount of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">In its memorandum of decision, dated June 5, 2000, the trial court determined that \u201ceach opening of the original judgment of foreclosure, dated November [24], 1997, was for a limited purpose: on July 13, 1998, to substitute EMC as successor plaintiff to [the bank]; on July [13], 1998, to set a new sale date of September 19, 1998; on February 8, 199[9], to cite in [Saxe] as trustee of the bankruptcy estate of [Zak]. \u201d It further determined that \u201c[n]othing in the record indicates that the judgment of foreclosure by sale was ever vacated.\u201d The court concluded \u201cthat the debt established by the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>of November [24], 1997, is [therefore] the controlling debt in this [foreclosure] action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Following its discussion of the merits, the trial court questioned MFR\u2019s standing in the action as the successor to Zak\u2019s interest. In particular, the corut questioned whether Zak had the authority to convey any interest in the property to MFR by quitclaim deed in March, 1999, when the property had become part of Zak\u2019s bankruptcy estate following her petition for bankruptcy in September, 1998.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, the court noted that, although Saxe, as the trustee of Zak\u2019s bankruptcy estate, had authority to convey the property to MFR, there was no evidence presented, nor any indication in the record, that Saxe had, in fact, done so. Despite its apparent concern regarding the legitimacy of MFR\u2019s title, the trial court rendered a judgment of foreclosure by sale, and calculated the amount of the debt using the amount of the debt established at the November 24,1997judgment and adding the per diem interest that had accrued since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">MFR appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of foreclosure to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court had improperly concluded that the amount of debt established in the November 24, 1997 judgment was the controlling debt in the foreclosure action. No party contested MFR\u2019s standing to appeal. On January 16, 2001, without reaching the merits of MFR\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Court, sua sponte, reversed and remanded the case to the trial court \u201cfor the purpose of making factual findings to determine whether the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>[MFR] has standing to assert its claim to an interest in the property under foreclosure and to otherwise participate in the proceedings.\u201d <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Zak, </em>61 Conn. App. 402, 403, 763 A.2d 1090 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">MFR subsequently filed a petition for certification to appeal to this court, which we granted, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for factual findings regarding the standing of the defendant MFR of East Hampton, LLC?\u201d <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Zak, </em>255 Conn. 946, 769 A.2d 61 (2001). This appeal followed. We conclude that, although the Appellate Court was required to address any questions regarding the standing of the parties before it, its decision to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to that court for further findings regarding MFR\u2019s standing was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Before addressing the substantive issue in this appeal, we address briefly the scope of our review. The facts underlying MFR\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the trial court are undisputed. Therefore, the implicit conclusion of the Appellate Court that the record was insufficient for a determination that MFR had standing to participate in the foreclosure action involves a question of law, subject to plenary review. See <em>AvalonBay Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 557, 565, 775 A.2d 284 (2001) (conclusions based on undisputed facts are conclusions of law, over which our review is plenary); <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>254 Conn. 145, 156, 757 A.2d 14 (2000) (recognizing that plenary review applies to questions of law). Thus, \u201c[w]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>In re David W., </em>254 Conn. 676, 686, 759 A.2d 89 (2000); and whether they \u201cfind support in the facts that appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Powers v. Olson, </em>252 Conn. 98, 105, 742 A.2d 799 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">We begin our analysis by underscoring that a party must have standing to assert a claim in order for the court to have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim. <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 808, 761 A.2d 705 (2000). \u201cStanding is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson </em>Cow., 258 Conn. 313, 347, 780 A.2d 98 (2001). \u201cThis court has often stated that the question of subject matter jurisdiction, because it addresses the basic competency of the court, can be raised by any of the parties, or by the court sua sponte, at any time.\u201d <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>215 Conn. 14, 27-28, 574 A.2d 194, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 982, 111 S. Ct. 513, 112 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1990). \u201c[T]he court has a duty to dismiss, even on its own initiative, any appeal that it lacks jurisdiction to hear.\u201d <em>Sasso </em>v. <em>Aleshin, </em>197 Conn. 87, 89,495 A.2d 1066 (1985). Moreover, \u201c[t]he parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court, either by waiver or by consent.\u201d <em>Sadloski </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>228 Conn. 79, 83, 634 A.2d 888 (1993), on appeal after remand, 235 Conn. 637, 668 A.2d 1314 (1995). \u201cStanding [however] is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harris </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number><em>New Milford, </em>259 Conn. 402, 409-10, 788 A.2d 1239 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">On appeal, MFR contends that a remand to the trial court for the purpose of making factual findings regarding MFR\u2019s standing as Zak\u2019s successor in interest is unnecessary because MFR had made the requisite showing of \u201ca legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the [foreclosure action]\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 347; to establish standing in the trial court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">In the trial court, MFR moved, pursuant to \u00a7 52-107; see footnote 4 of this opinion; to be cited in as a party defendant as the owner of the equity of redemption in the foreclosed property. Section 52-107 provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f a person not a party has an interest or title which the judgment will affect, the court, on his application, shall direct him to be made a party.\u201d In <em>Washington Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>241 Conn. 734, 699 A.2d 73 (1997), this court had occasion to consider the showing required for a party seeking to establish a sufficient interest or title in the property that the judgment would affect for puiposes of intervening in a foreclosure action. This court stated that \u201c[a] proposed intervenor must allege sufficient facts, through the submitted motion and pleadings, if any, in order to make a showing of his or her right to intervene. The inquiry is whether the claims contained in the motion, if true, establish that the proposed intervenor has a direct and immediate interest that will be affected by the judgment.\u201d Id., 747. Thereafter, we concluded in <em>Washington Trust Co. </em>that John Holstein, trustee of City Discount Oil Nominee Trust (Holstein), a proposed intervening defendant who was the owner of the equity of redemption in the property that was the subject of the foreclosure action, had alleged sufficient facts to support his motion to intervene. Id., 736, 748. Holstein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>had moved to intervene for the purpose of protecting his interest in the foreclosed property following the trial court\u2019s judgment of foreclosure by sale on the property, but prior to its confirmation of the sale. Id., 738. In his motion to intervene, Holstein had \u201calleged that he [had] purchased the equity of redemption from the owner of the property subject to foreclosure and that he wanted to redeem the mortgage.\u201d Id., 748. In addition, this court noted that, \u201calthough unnecessary, but prudent, Holstein\u2019s motion was supported by documentation corroborating his interest in the foreclosed property . . . .\u201d Id., 748 n.9. In reversing the Appellate Court\u2019s decision that had affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Holstein\u2019s motion to intervene, this court stated that \u201cthe burden of proving [an interest in the foreclosure action], <em>by way of testimony or other evi</em>dence, in order to be allowed to intervene ... is too high a hurdle for purposes of establishing a right to intervene.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 747. The court concluded that \u201cHolstein [was] entitled to prove [his] interests, if any, as [a defendant] in the foreclosure action before the foreclosure sale was confirmed, and at that time [the plaintiffs] would have been entitled to dispute the validity of . . . Holstein\u2019s interests on the merits.\u201d Id., 748. We held, therefore, that Holstein had established the factual predicate for a determination, as a matter of law, that he had standing to intervene because \u201cif true, the allegations in [his motion] . . . would constitute the required [showing] of direct and substantial interests that would be impaired by the foreclosure action.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In the present case, as in <em>Washington Trust </em>Co., MFR alleged in its motion to be cited in as a party defendant that it had purchased the property that was the subject of the foreclosure action and that, consequently, it was the owner of the equity of redemption in the foreclosed property. MFR further alleged that any judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>foreclosure would necessarily affect its interest in the property by foreclosing out its interest as the owner of the equity of redemption. Additionally, MFR furnished a copy of the quitclaim deed corroborating its alleged interest in the property. The trial court granted MFR\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">After MFR filed its motion to be cited in, EMC had the opportunity to contest the merits of MFR\u2019s alleged interest in the mortgaged property. EMC did not do so. To the contrary, EMC filed a second amended complaint naming MFR as a party defendant in the foreclosure action because \u201c[Zak had] conveyed her interest in the mortgaged premises to MFR . . . .\u201d It is well established that \u201c[f] actual allegations contained in pleadings upon which the case is tried are considered judicial admissions\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Pringle, </em>255 Conn. 330, 345, 766 A.2d 400 (2001); which \u201c[dispense] with the production of evidence by the opposing party as to the fact admitted, and [are] conclusive upon the party making [them].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William v. Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 690, 695 n.7, 651 A.2d 1286 (1995); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 396, 429 A.2d 919 (1980) (\u201c[t]he vital feature of a judicial admission is universally conceded to be its conclusiveness upon the party making it, i.e. the prohibition of any further dispute of the fact by him, and any use of evidence to disprove or contradict it\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Therefore, by virtue of its second amended complaint, EMC conceded that MFR was the successor in interest to the property that is the subject of the foreclosure action. This concession conclusively established the factual predicate necessary for a deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>mination, as a matter of law, that MFR had standing to protect its interests in the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The record further reveals that no other party, either in the trial court or in the Appellate Court, contested MFR\u2019s interest in the foreclosed property. Although the trial court questioned MFR\u2019s standing in its memorandum of decision, it expressly stated that \u201cZak, the record owner of the property, conveyed all her right, title and interest in the premise[s] to [MFR].\u201d Because the court thereafter rendered judgment against MFR on the merits, its decision necessarily was predicated on a conclusion that MFR did not lack standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">EMC claims, however, that the Appellate Court\u2019s remand was proper because, following the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, the foreclosed property became part of Zak\u2019s bankruptcy estate pursuant to \u00a7 541 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541. Therefore, according to EMC, Zak did not have the authority to transfer the property to MFR.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>As such, EMC contends, only Saxe, as trustee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>bankruptcy estate, had the authority to transfer the property to MFR. Moreover, EMC asserts, Saxe had the authority to void any transfer made by Zak for two years from the date of Zak\u2019s transfer to MFR pursuant to \u00a7 549 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the time of the proceedings in the Appellate Court, the two year time period had not yet expired. Therefore, EMC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>contends that the Appellate Court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to remand the case to the trial court for further findings regarding MFR\u2019s standing was appropriate \u201cbecause the possibility that further proceedings could be taken by [Saxe] remained alive.\u201d Although we acknowledge that EMC\u2019s assumption about the rationale underlying the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion may be accurate, we disagree with its import.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Section 549 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides in relevant part that \u201cthe trustee [of a bankruptcy estate] may avoid a transfer of property of the estate ... (1) that occurs after the commencement of the [bankruptcy] case; and (2) . . . (B) that is not authorized under [the Code] or by the court.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549 (a) (1) and (2) (B). Section 549 (d) provides that such an action by a trustee \u201cmay not be commenced after the earlier of . . . (1) two years after the date of the transfer sought to be avoided; or (2) the time the case is closed or dismissed.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 549 (d). \u201cSection 549 exists as a protection for creditors against unauthorized debtor transfers of estate property.\u201d <em>In re Schwartz, </em>954 F.2d 569, 574 (9th Cir. 1992). Accordingly, \u201c[i]n most circumstances, [\u00a7] 549 applies to transfers in which the debtor is a willing participant. . . . For example, in a transfer unrelated to any antecedent debt, the debtor may sell a portion of the estate\u2019s property to a third person.\u201d Id. It is well established that \u00a7 549 achieves its purpose, not by rendering postpetition transfers of property by the bankruptcy debtor void, but rather by rendering them <em>voidable </em>upon timely action of the trustee. See <em>In re Home America T.V.-Appliance Audio, Inc., </em>232 F.3d 1046, 1051 (9th Cir. 2000), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Shallry </em>v. <em>United States, </em>534 U.S. 814, 122 S. Ct. 39, 151 L.

Ct. 1011, 117 L. Ed. 2d 181 <em>(1992); In re Photo Promotion Associates, Inc., </em>881 F.2d 6, 10 (2d Cir. 1989); <em>In re Ward, </em>837 F.2d 124, 127 (3d Cir. 1988); <em>In the Matter of Allen, </em>816 F.2d 325, 327-28 (7th Cir. 1987); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mark Twain National Bank, </em>805 F.2d 278, 293 (8th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In the present case, it is undisputed that the transfer from Zak to MFR took place following Zak\u2019s petition for bankruptcy, and that Saxe was not a signatory to the quitclaim deed transferring Zak\u2019s interest in the foreclosed property to MFR. Because the bankruptcy case remained open, however, Saxe had two years from March 31,1999, the date that Zak quitclaimed her interest in the foreclosed property to MFR, to make a timely objection to that transfer. Saxe never raised an objection to the transfer to MFR, however, although he had been made a party to the foreclosure action and, in that capacity, had been served with a copy of MFR\u2019s motion to be cited in as Zak\u2019s successor in interest. Nor did Saxe challenge the transfer following EMC\u2019s second amended complaint citing in MFR as the titleholder of the foreclosed property or when the trial court expressly questioned MFR\u2019s standing as Zak\u2019s successor in interest. Thus, twenty-two of the twenty-four months during which Saxe could have avoided the transfer of the property from Zak to MFR had expired without an objection from Saxe, when, on January 16, 2001, the Appellate Court remanded the case for further proceedings regarding MFR\u2019s standing, without reaching the merits of MFR\u2019s appeal. Finally, we note that Saxe did not object to MFR\u2019s presence in the case before the Appellate Court. In the absence of any indication that Saxe intended to take any action to avoid the transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>in the future, we reject EMC\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision remanding MFR\u2019s appeal was warranted by the <em>possibility </em>that Saxe <em>might </em>object to MFR\u2019s standing in the last two months prior to the expiration of his right to do so. Finally, we note that, on January 15, 2002, the date of oral argument before this court, the time period during which Saxe could have avoided the transfer had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that MFR had made the requisite factual showing to establish itself as the successor in interest to Zak as owner of the foreclosed property. In the absence of any evidence of an intent by Saxe to avoid that transfer, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded MFR\u2019s appeal to that court for factual findings regarding MFR\u2019s standing as the owner of the foreclosed property.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for consideration of the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-11\"> Also included as defendants in the bank\u2019s foreclosure action were Kenneth A. Zak, an original mortgagor of the property who had since transferred his interest to Zak, and the following parties, all of which claimed some interest in the mortgaged properly: GTT Corporation, as trustee of Oregon Properties Realty Trust (GTT); Jonathan Googel; Stephen J. Dellaquila; New Haven Savings Bank; Femdale Condominium Association, Inc.; Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company; the state of Connecticut; and the United States of America. The trial court subsequently granted motions to cite in MFR, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Zak\u2019s successor in interest to the property, and Tracy M. Saxe, the trustee of Zak\u2019s bankruptcy estate, as defendants and a motion to substitute Donald Mondani as a defendant for GTT.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-9\"> EMC is the only plaintiff in this certified appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b789-10\"> Pursuant to \u00a7 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a bankruptcy petition creates an automatic stay of execution against the commencement or continuation of all actions against the debtor that were, or could have been, filed against the debtor prior to the bankruptcy filing.
