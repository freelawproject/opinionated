(Pathways), and the defendant, the planning and zoning commission of the town of Greenwich (commission). On appeal, Brookridge claims, inter alia, that the trial court improperly: (1) applied a \u201cnecessary and indispensable party\u201d test in denying its motion to intervene as a matter of right; and (2) concluded that Brook-ridge\u2019s motion to intervene was untimely. Pathways contends that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Brookridge\u2019s appeal inasmuch as the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene is not an appealable final judgment because Brookridge subsequently has intervened pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree that this court lacks subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>matter jurisdiction and, accordingly, dismiss Brook-ridge\u2019s appeal. We therefore do not reach the merits of Brookridge\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. Pathways applied to the commission for a special permit and site plan approval to build a group living facility for recovering psychiatric patients at 509 East Putnam Avenue in Greenwich. The commission voted to deny Pathways\u2019 application, and Pathways appealed to the trial court from the commission\u2019s decision to deny its application. Subsequently, Pathways and the commission entered into discussions to settle the case. At the conclusion of a public hearing held by the commission on January 28, 2000, the commission voted to approve a settlement and to enter into a stipulated judgment that had been proposed by Pathways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Amid settlement discussions, and before the commission voted to approve the proposed settlement, Brook-ridge, which opposed Pathways\u2019 proposed project, moved to intervene in Pathways\u2019 appeal pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-102<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 52-107,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 \u00a7 9-18<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 9-19.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 14,2000, Pathways filed an objection to Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene, and, on March 3, 2000, the commission filed a similar objection. On March 27, 2000, the trial court, <em>Hon. Robert Satter, </em>judge trial referee, denied Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene. On April 17, 2000, Brookridge simultaneously filed a petition for certification to appeal to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to intervene and a verified pleading in the trial court seeking to intervene pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On May 24, 2000, the Appellate Court granted Brookridge\u2019s petition for certification to appeal. On October 23,2000, we transferred Brookridge\u2019s appeal to this court pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene is an appealable final judgment. We previously have stated that \u201c[t]he test for determining whether an order denying a motion to intervene constitutes a final judgment is whether the would-be intervenor can make a colorable claim to intervention as a matter of right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 536, 582 A.2d 1174 (1990). Under the unique factual circumstances of this case, however, the test set forth in <em>Winslow </em>is not dispositive. In addition to the <em>Winslow </em>test, we must consider whether the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene was an appealable final judgment in light of Brook-ridge\u2019s subsequent intervention pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene is not an appealable final judgment because Brookridge successfully intervened pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983), we set forth the test for determining when an otherwise interlocutory order or ruling of the Superior Court constitutes an appealable final judgment. \u201cAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene is not an appealable final judgment because it does not meet the requirements of either prong of the <em>Curdo </em>test. First, the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene did not terminate a separate action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>or proceeding. Pathways\u2019 appeal from the commission\u2019s decision to deny Pathways\u2019 application for a special permit and site plan approval was not terminated as a result of the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene. Second, because Brookridge successfully intervened pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19, the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s earlier motion to intervene did not conclude Brookridge\u2019s rights so that further proceedings will not affect it.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Section 22a-19 \u201cpermits any person, on the filing of a verified pleading, to intervene in any administrative proceeding for the limited purpose of raising environmental issues.\u201d <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 248 n.2, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984). In <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 400 A.2d 726 (1978), we concluded that a prospective intervenor that had filed a verified pleading pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 became a party to an administrative proceeding upon doing so; id., 489; and had \u201cstatutory standing to appeal for the limited purpose of raising environmental issues.\u201d Id., 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Although Brookridge has standing only as to the environmental issues that it has raised in its verified pleading, it nevertheless is an intervenor pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 22a-19. Consequently, Brookridge\u2019s rights have not been disposed of such that any further proceedings cannot affect them. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Curdo, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31. Brookridge has retained its intervenor party status, and, therefore, the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene does not resolve Brookridge\u2019s rights with respect to Pathways\u2019 appeal from the decision of the commission denying Pathways\u2019 application for a special permit and site plan approval. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s denial of Brookridge\u2019s motion to intervene in Pathways\u2019 appeal is not an appealable final judgment, and, therefore, we lack sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ject matter jurisdiction to entertain Brookridge\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 provides in relevantpart: \u201c(a) In any administrative, licensing or other proceeding, and in any judicial review thereof made available by law, the Attorney General, any political subdivision of the state, any instrumentality or agency of the state or of apolitical subdivision thereof, any person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity may intervene as a party on the filing of a verified pleading asserting that the proceeding or action for judicial review involves conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\"> On September 29, 2000, Brookridge appealed to the trial court, from the commission\u2019s decision to settle Pathways\u2019 appeal by entering into the proposed stipulated .judgment. On October 11,2000, Pathways filed amotion to dismiss Brookridge\u2019s appeal. On January 8,2001, the trial court, <em>Cohn, X, </em>granted Pathways\u2019 motion and rendered judgment dismissing Brookridge\u2019s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, from which Brookridge appealed to the Appellate Court. We subsequently granted Brookridge\u2019s motion to transfer the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2. In the companion case also released today, <em>Brookridge District Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 607, 618-19, 793 A.2d 215 (2002), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing Brookridge\u2019s appeal, holding that because a planning commission\u2019s decision to settle a pending appeal by entering into a stipulated judgment is not a decision within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (b), an appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (b) does not lie from that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-102 provides: \u201cUpon motion made by any party or nonparty to a civil action, the person named in the party\u2019s motion or the nonparty so moving, as the case may be, (1) may be made a party by the court if that person has or claims an interest in the controversy, or any part thereof, adverse to the plaintiff, or (2) shall be made a party by the court if that person is necessary for a complete determination or settlement of any question involved therein; provided no person who is immune from liability shall be made a defendant in the controversy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-107 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court may determine the controversy as between the parties before it, if it can do so without prejudice to the rights of others; but, if a complete determination cannot be had without the presence of other parties, the court may direct that such other parties be brought in. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 9-18 provides: \u201cThe judicial authority may determine the controversy as between the parties before it, if it can do so without prejudice to the rights of others; but, if a complete determination cannot be had without the presence of other parties, the judicial authority may direct that they be brought in.
