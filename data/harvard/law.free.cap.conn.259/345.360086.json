The principal issues in this appeal are whether: (1) the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>court properly instructed the jury with respect to the unreasonableness element of the common-law private nuisance claim; (2) a property owner may testify as to the reason for the diminution in value of his or her property; (3) the trial court properly admitted, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule, evidence from a livestock waste management handbook; and (4) the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the operation of the defendants\u2019 farm was the proximate cause of the offensive odors that affected the plaintiffs\u2019 property. We answer all four questions in the affirmative. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The plaintiffs, James Pestey and Joan Pestey, brought this action against the defendants, Nathan R. Cushman, Nathan P. Cushman and Cushman Farms Limited Partnership, seeking money damages and injunctive and declaratory relief. After a lengthy trial, the jury returned a partial verdict for the plaintiffs for $100,000 in damages. See footnote 2 of this opinion. The trial court denied all of the defendants\u2019 posttrial motions, and rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The plaintiffs\u2019 home is situated on property they own located along the west side of Route 87 in North Franklin. The defendants own and conduct farming operations on a large tract of land on the opposite side of Route 87, approximately one third of one mile north of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. In 1990, the defendants constructed a 42,000 square foot free stall barn and milking parlor on their land to house a herd of dairy cows and a pit in which to store the manure generated by the herd.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The plaintiffs first noticed objectionable odors emanating from the defendants\u2019 farm in early 1991, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the construction of the new bam. The odors were, at first, nothing more than the typical stercoraceous odors generated by a farm containing livestock. Over time, however, the odors became substantially more pungent and their character changed as they took on a sharp, burnt smell. In 1997, the defendants installed an anaerobic digestion system on their farm to process the manure generated by the dairy herd. The system was designed to mimic in a controlled manner the anaerobic process that occurs in nature. Under this process, manure is fed into the digester, which, through the use of high temperature and bacteria, breaks the organic compound into its constituent parts. The end result of a properly functioning anaerobic digestion process is the production of a low odor biosolid and a gaseous mixture that can be used as an energy source to power the digester\u2019s generators. Following the installation of the digester, the character of the odors affecting the plaintiffs\u2019 property changed again, becoming more acrid and evincing the smells of sulphur and sewage. This change was caused by the digester being either undersized or overloaded, which resulted in partially digested, higher odor manure being released at the end of the anaerobic digestion process. At times, the odors emanating from the defendants\u2019 farm were so strong that the smell would awaken the plaintiffs during the night, forcing them to close the windows of their home. Further facts will be set forth where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The plaintiffs commenced this action in three counts seeking monetary damages and injunctive and declaratory relief. In the first count of the amended complaint, sounding in common-law private nuisance, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants\u2019 farm generated offensive odors that unreasonably interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property. The plaintiffs further alleged in this count that the defendants\u2019 farm operation was not entitled to the protections of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 19U-341,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which concerns the right to farm and protects farms from nuisance claims, because the odors resulted from the defendants\u2019 negligent operation of their farm. Only this first count was ultimately submitted to the jury to decide.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In addition to returning a plaintiffs\u2019 verdict, the jury answered interrogatories demonstrating that it specifically found that the offensive odors emanating from the defendants\u2019 farm unreasonably interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of their property, that the interference was continuous, and that the odors had a natural tendency to inflict harm by interfering with the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tiffs\u2019 use of their property. The jury further found that the defendants\u2019 farm operation was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss of enjoyment of their property and that the defendants\u2019 use of their property was either unreasonable or unlawful. Lastly, the jury found that \u00a7 19a-341 did not apply because the plaintiffs had proven that the offensive odors produced by the defendants\u2019 farm were the result of the defendants\u2019 negligence in the operation of their farm. After the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The defendants raise six claims on appeal. They assert that the trial court improperly: (1) instructed the jury with regard to the unreasonableness element of the private nuisance claim; (2) admitted the testimony of the plaintiff James Pestey regarding the diminution in value of the plaintiffs\u2019 property as a result of the nuisance; (3) admitted, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule, a portion of a certain livestock waste management handbook; (4) found the cumulative evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants\u2019 farm operation was the cause of the offensive odors experienced by the plaintiffs; (5) instructed the jury with regard to the application of \u00a7 19a-341; and (6) excluded, based on the best evidence rule, certain expert testimony concerning a second livestock waste management handbook. With respect to the first four claims raised by the defendants, we conclude that they are without merit. With respect to the last two claims, we do not reach their merits because, for the reasons explained hereinafter, we conclude that they were not properly preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We first address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly instructed the jury with regard to the unreasonableness element of the nuisance claim. Specifically, the defendants argue that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the juiy was improper because it failed to instruct the jury adequately with respect to the balancing of interests that must be performed in deciding whether a use of property is unreasonable. The defendants contend that, although the trial court correctly instructed the jury to consider a multiplicity of factors in determining whether the defendants\u2019 use of their property was unreasonable, the court did not adequately instruct the juiy to consider the defendants\u2019 legitimate interest in using their property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury on this issue was proper under the law both as expressed in our prior decisions and as clarified herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The standard of review for a challenge to the propriety of a jury instruction is well established. \u201c[J]ury instructions are to be read as a whole, and instructions claimed to be improper are read in the context of the entire charge. ... A juiy charge is to be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding it to a correct verdict. . . . The test to determine if a jury charge is proper is whether it fairly presents the case to the juiy in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hi-Ho Tower, Inc. </em>v. <em>Com-Tronics, Inc., </em>255 Conn. 20, 27, 761 A.2d 1268 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In order to analyze properly the defendants\u2019 claim, we must reexamine and clarify the elements that a plaintiff must prove to prevail on a claim for damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>in a common-law private nuisance cause of action. Specifically, we must clarify two sources of confusion. First, we must distinguish the concept of unreasonable <em>interference </em>with the use and enjoyment of property from the concept of an unreasonable <em>use </em>of property. Second, we must reaffirm the distinction between private and public nuisance actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u201cA private nuisance is a nontrespassory invasion of another\u2019s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.\u201d 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 821D (1979); see also <em>Herbert </em>v. Smyth, 155 Conn. 78, 81, 230 A.2d 235 (1967). The law of private nuisance springs from the general principle that \u201c[i]t is the duty of every person to make a reasonable use of his own property so as to occasion no unnecessary damage or annoyance to his neighbor.\u201d <em>Nailor </em>v. <em>C. W. Blakeslee &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>117 Conn. 241, 245, 167 A. 548 (1933). \u201cThe essence of a private nuisance is an interference with the use and enjoyment of land.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 87, p. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The defendants\u2019 claim is based on the principle of private nuisance law that, in determining unreasonableness, \u201c[consideration must be given not only to the interests of the person harmed but also [to] the interests of the actor and to the interests of the community as a whole.\u201d 4 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 826, comment (c); see also <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>250 Conn. 443, 456-57, 736 A.2d 811 (1999). \u201cDetermining unreasonableness is essentially a weighing process, involving a comparative evaluation of conflicting interests . . . .\u201d4 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 826, comment (c); <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 456; <em>Maykut </em>v. <em>Plasko, </em>170 Conn. 310, 314, 365 A.2d 1114 (1976); <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., </em>156 Conn. 613, 617-18, 244 A.2d 372 (1968). Unreasonableness cannot be determined in the abstract, but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>rather, must be judged under the circumstances of the particular case. <em>Wetstone </em>v. <em>Cantor, </em>144 Conn. 77, 80, 127 A.2d 70 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In determining the propriety of the jury instructions regarding the unreasonableness element in this case, we look to our recent decision in <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 443, in which the plaintiff had sought damages in common-law private nuisance for odors and insects emanating from a sewage treatment plant owned by the defendant town. With regard to this element, the trial court in <em>Walsh </em>had instructed the jury as follows: \u201c[Y]ou must decide whether the use the town was making of the property was a reasonable use. . . . Now, that\u2019s not to suggest that the mere use of the property for a [sewage] treatment plant is reasonable or unreasonable. Clearly, that\u2019s a reasonable use of property and the plaintiffs don\u2019t claim otherwise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 450. The trial court further explained: \u201cIf you find that the plant is producing odors\u2014or was or is producing odors or insects, that is the use of the property that you will find that is either reasonable or unreasonable. [The] [plaintiffs must prove that the use of the property as they have proven the property to . . . have been used was unreasonable . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. On appeal, this court held that the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury was proper because the instructions \u201cconveyed to the jury that it was to take into consideration and weigh the conflicting interests involved.\u201d Id., 457; accord <em>Maykut </em>v. <em>Plasko, </em>supra, 170 Conn. 315 (trial court applied proper test where facts described in findings included consideration of interests of both plaintiff and defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In the present case, the trial court instructed the jury with respect to the unreasonableness element of the nuisance claim in the following manner: \u201cYou must also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ask yourselves whether the defendants\u2019 use of their property [was] reasonable. A use which is permitted or even required by law and which does not violate local land use restrictions may nonetheless be unreasonable and create a common-law nuisance. You must . . . consider and weigh . . . the location of the defendants\u2019 dairy farm, the size of the farm, the manner in which they operate the farm, including their handling and maintenance of the manure, the free stall barn, the milking parlors and the anaerobic manure digester and associated equipment and any other circumstance which you find proven which indicates whether the defendants [were] making a reasonable use of their property.\u201d The court stated further: \u201cThe question is not whether the plaintiffs or the defendants would regard the condition as unreasonable, but whether reasonable persons generally looking at the whole situation impartially and objectively would consider it [to] be reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As the charge indicates, the trial court instructed the jury to consider a multiplicity of factors in determining the unreasonableness element. The defendants\u2019 argument that the instruction did not adequately instruct the jury to consider the defendants\u2019 interests assumes that the factors set forth by the trial court only regard the pla.iutiffs\u2019 interests. Such an assumption is unwarranted. The jury, for instance, was instructed to consider the location of the farm in making its finding regarding reasonableness. The location of the farm as a factor inherently includes the interests of both the plaintiffs and the defendants, and the jury was just as entitled to find that the location of the farm tended to show that the defendants\u2019 use was reasonable as it was to find that the location tended to show that the defendants\u2019 use was unreasonable. In addition, the trial court explicitly instructed the jury to consider any other circumstances that it found proven that would indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cwhether the defendants [were] making a reasonable use of their property.\u201d This instruction underscored the trial court\u2019s previous instruction that the jury was to consider various factors in reaching its decision, including factors relating to the interests of both the plaintiffs and the defendants. Although the trial court did not instruct the jury that the mere use of the property for a dairy farm was clearly a reasonable use if considered in a vacuum, as had the trial court in <em>Walsh </em>with respect to the wastewater treatment plant in that case; see <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 450; the trial court\u2019s charge nonetheless provided the jury with adequate guidance with which to reach its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Although the trial court\u2019s jury charge was proper under <em>Walsh </em>and the decisions upon which <em>Walsh </em>relied, a thorough review of the law of nuisance reveals that this area of the law has been prone to confusion, and our case law has been no exception. Our nuisance jurisprudence has become muddled and is in need of clarification. Only after we clarify this area of the law can we determine fully whether the jury charge in this case was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u201cThere is perhaps no more impenetrable jungle in the entire law than that which surrounds the word \u2018nuisance.\u2019 \u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 86, p. 616. This court has stated often that a plaintiff must prove four elements to succeed in a nuisance cause of action: \u201c(1) the condition complained of had a natural tendency to create danger and inflict injury upon person or property; (2) the danger created was a continuing one; (3) the use of the land was unreasonable or unlawful; [and] (4) the existence of the nuisance was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and damages.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 449 n.4, quoting <em>Filisko </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>176 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>33, 35-36, 404 A.2d 889 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton, </em>204 Conn. 177, 183, 527 A.2d 688 (1987); see also <em>Kostyal </em>v. <em>Cass, </em>163 Conn. 92, 99-100, 302 A.2d 121 (1972). These elements developed through a long line of cases that can be described best as public nuisance cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>DeLahunta </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>134 Conn. 630, 631, 59 A.2d 800 (1948) (passengers in automobile brought nuisance action for damages against defendant municipality for injuries sustained when car in which they were riding struck concrete traffic stanchion installed by defendant); <em>Prifty </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>133 Conn. 654, 655, 54 A.2d 260 (1947) (plaintiffs brought nuisance claim against defendant municipality for injuries sustained by child when ornamental cannon in public park fell); <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>113 Conn. 386, 387, 155 A. 499 (1931) (plaintiff brought nuisance claim against defendant municipality seeking to recover for injuries sustained from jumping off diving board in shallow water at pond owned and maintained by defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Despite its grounding in public nuisance law, this four factor analysis has since been applied without distinction to both public and private nuisance causes of action. See, e.g., <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 449 n.4; <em>Quinnett </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>213 Conn. 343, 348-49, 568 A.2d 786 (1990); <em>Marchitto </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>150 Conn. 432, 437, 190 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>597 (1963). Although there are some similarities between a public and a private nuisance, the two causes of action are distinct. Indeed, Professors Prosser and Keeton in their treatise on the law of torts have stated: \u201cThe two have almost nothing in common, except that each causes inconvenience to someone, and it would have been fortunate if they had been called from the beginning by different names.\u201d W. Prosser <em>&amp; </em>W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 86, p. 618. Public nuisance law is concerned with the interference with a public right, and cases in this realm typically involve conduct that allegedly interferes with the public health and safety. See, e.g., <em>Keeney v. Old Saybrook, </em>237 Conn. 135, 162-63, 676 A.2d 795 (1996) (public nuisance law encompasses conduct detrimental to public health and safety); <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>129 Conn. 506, 507, 29 A.2d 775 (1942) (plaintiff brought nuisance action against defendant municipality for injuries sustained in fall allegedly caused by defectively constructed sidewalk).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Private nuisance law, on the other hand, is concerned with conduct that interferes with an individual\u2019s private right to the use and enjoyment of his or her land. Showing the existence of a condition detrimental to the public safety, or, as the first two elements of the four factor analysis discussed previously require, showing that the condition complained of had a natural tendency to create a continuing danger, is often irrelevant to a private nuisance claim. In light of the fundamental differences between these two distinct causes of action, we conclude that further attempts to employ the four part test discussed previously herein in the assessment of private nuisance causes of action would be imprudent; private nuisance claims simply do not fit comfortably within the same analytical rubric as public nuisance claims. We must restate, therefore, the elements that a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>must prove to prevail on a claim for damages in a common-law private nuisance action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In prescribing these specific elements, we look to the leading authorities in the field of common-law private nuisance for guidance. According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) there was an invasion of the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of his or her property; (2) the defendant\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of the invasion; and (3) the invasion was either intentional and unreasonable, or unintentional and the defendant\u2019s conduct was negligent or reckless. 4 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 822. Although the language used in this third element does not make the point clearly, under this test, showing unreasonableness is an essential element of a private nuisance cause of action based on negligence or recklessness. See id., \u00a7 822, comment (k). Professors Prosser and Keeton define the plaintiffs burden in a similar manner. According to their view, a plaintiff in a private nuisance action must demonstrate that: (1) the defendant acted with the intent of interfering with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of his or her property; (2) the interference with the use and enjoyment of the land was of the kind intended; (3) the interference was substantial; and (4) the interference was unreasonable. W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 87, p. 622-25. In the context of a private nuisance, they define a defendant\u2019s intent as meaning merely that \u201cthe defendant has created or continued the condition causing the interference with full knowledge that the harm to the plaintiffs interests are occurring or are substantially certain to follow.\u201d Id., 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>This requirement of unreasonableness, a part of the third element in the test set forth in the Restatement (Second) and the fourth element in the test enunciated by Professors Prosser and Keeton, often has been stated, not in terms of whether the <em>interference </em>was unreasonable, but, rather, in terms of whether the defendant\u2019s <em>conduct </em>was unreasonable. See, e.g., <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 446 (determining whether defendants\u2019 operation of wastewater treatment plant was \u201c \u2018unreasonable use\u2019 \u201d). In its charge to the jury, the trial court in the present case framed the inquiry in such a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Although similar, \u201c[t]he two concepts\u2014unreasonable interference and unreasonable conduct\u2014are not at all identical.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 87, p. 623. \u201cConfusion has resulted from the fact that the . . . interference with the plaintiff\u2019s use of his property can be unreasonable even when the defendant\u2019s conduct is reasonable. . . . Courts have often found the existence of a nuisance on the basis of unreasonable use when what was meant is that the interference was unreasonable, i.e., it was unreasonable for the defendant to act as he did without paying for the harm that was knowingly inflicted on the plaintiff. Thus, an industrial enterprise who properly locates a cement plant or a coal-burning electric generator, who exercises utmost care in the utilization of known scientific techniques for minimizing the harm from the emission of noxious smoke, dust and gas and who is serving society well by engaging in the activity may yet be required to pay for the inevitable harm caused to neighbors.\u201d Id., \u00a7 88, p. 629. As this example amply demonstrates, while an unreasonable use and an unreasonable interference often coexist, the two concepts are not equivalent, and it is possible to prove that a defendant\u2019s use of his property, while reasonable, nonetheless constitutes a common-law private nuisance because it unreasonably interferes with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>use of property by another person. That was the situation in <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control </em>Authority, supra, 250 Conn. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In <em>Walsh, </em>this court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument on appeal that their operation of the wastewater treatment plant in question could not constitute a nuisance since the operation of such a plant was clearly a reasonable use of property. Id., 457. This court held that the production of odors by the defendants\u2019 plant could constitute a nuisance, notwithstanding the fact that operating a wastewater treatment plant was clearly a reasonable use of the property in question. Id. Although the proposition was not stated expressly in <em>Walsh, </em>our holding in that case demonstrates that, while the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s conduct is a factor in determining whether an interference is unreasonable, it is <em>not </em>an independent element that must be proven in order to prevail in all private nuisance causes of action. The inquiry is cast more appropriately as whether the defendant\u2019s conduct unreasonably interfered with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of his or her land rather than whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was itself unreasonable. <em>Quinnett </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 348 (nuisance refers to condition that exists and not to act that creates it). The proper focus of a private nuisance claim for damages, therefore, is whether a defendant\u2019s conduct, i.e., his or her use of his or her property, causes an unreasonable interference with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of his or her property. <em>Herberts.

The interference may be either intentional; <em>Quinnett </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 348 (nuisance is created intentionally if defendant intends act that brings about condition found to be nuisance); or the result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. Id., 348-49. Whether the interference is unreasonable depends upon a balancing of the interests involved under the circumstances of each individual case. In balancing the interests, the fact finder must take into consideration all relevant factors, including the nature of both the interfering use and the use and enjoyment invaded, the nature, extent and duration of the interference, the suitability for the locality of both the interfering conduct and the particular use and enjoyment invaded, whether the defendant is taking all feasible precautions to avoid any unnecessary interference with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of his or her property, and any other factors that the fact finder deems relevant to the question of whether the interference is unreasonable. No one factor should dominate this balancing of interests; all relevant factors must be considered in determining whether the interference is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The determination of whether the interference is unreasonable should be made in light of the fact that some level of interference is inherent in modern society. There are few, if any, places remaining where an individual may rest assured that he will be able to use and enjoy his property free from all interference. Accordingly, the interference must be substantial to be unreasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>See 4 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 822, comment (g); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 88, p. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Ultimately, the question of reasonableness is whether the interference is beyond that which the plaintiff should bear, under all of the circumstances of the particular case, without being compensated. See <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 458-59; see also 4 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 822, comment (g), and \u00a7 826, comment (e); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 88, p. 629. With these standards in mind, we turn to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In reaching its verdict, the jury completed a set of interrogatories provided by the trial court. Each interrogatory asked the jury whether the plaintiffs had proven a specific element of the private nuisance claim, and the jury answered each interrogatory affirmatively. The first interrogatory asked: \u201cDid the plaintiffs prove [that] the defendants\u2019 dairy farm produced odors which unreasonably interfered with [the] plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of their property?\u201d This interrogatory correctly captured the crux of a common-law private nuisance cause of action for damages, i.e., whether the defendants\u2019 conduct unreasonably interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property. It correctly stated that the focus in such a cause of action is on the reasonableness of the interference and not on the use that is causing the interference. In light of this conclusion, the fourth interrogatory, which involved the unreasonable use element that is at issue in this case, was superfluous. The fourth interrogatory asked: \u201cDid the plaintiffs prove the defendants\u2019 use of their property is either unreasonable or unlawful?\u201d As our previous discussion herein demonstrates, a plaintiff seeking damages in a common-law private nuisance cause of action is not required to prove that the defendant\u2019s conduct was unreasonable. Rather, the plaintiff must show that the interference with his or her property was unreasonable. The fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>interrogatory, therefore, in effect, required the plaintiffs to prove an additional, nonessential element to prevail on their claim. We conclude that the jury interrogatories and the jury charge, considered together, properly informed the jury of the necessary elements of a common-law private nuisance cause of action for damages and provided the jury with adequate guidance with which to reach its verdict. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s jury charge was proper under the law as clarified herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We next address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the testimony of James Pestey regarding the diminution in value of his property. Specifically, the defendants claim that, although it was proper for the trial court to allow James Pestey to give his opinion as to the value of his property both before and after the defendants began their farm operation, it was improper to allow him to testify that, in his opinion, the offensive odors created by the defendants\u2019 farm were the cause of the property\u2019s diminution in value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">At trial, James Pestey testified that, in his opinion, the value of his property had been $585,000 in 1990, before the defendants began their farm operation, but was only $330,000 at the time of trial, in 1999. He testified further that the diminution in value of his property was, in his opinion, the result of the offensive odors emanating from the defendants\u2019 farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In deciding this issue, we are guided by our decision in <em>Tessmann </em>v. <em>Tiger Lee Construction Co., </em>228 Conn. 42, 634 A.2d 870 (1993). In <em>Tessmann, </em>the plaintiffs brought an action alleging that the defendants\u2019 substandard construction of the plaintiffs\u2019 house diminished its value. After the trial court excluded the testimony and report of the plaintiffs\u2019 only expert witness on the issue of the diminution in value, the plaintiffs testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>themselves as to their opinion regarding the value of their house as it was, compared to what it would have been worth had the defendants properly constructed it. Id., 46. In determining whether it was proper for the trial court to allow such testimony, this court reiterated the long established rule that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that homeowners are qualified to testify as to their personal opinion regarding the value, or diminution in value, of their properties.\u201d Id., 47; <em>see McCahill v. Town &amp; Country Associates, Ltd., </em>185 Conn. 37, 41, 440 A.2d 801 (1981). This rule \u201creflects . . . the common experience that an owner is familiar with her property and knows what it is worth.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 120, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The plaintiffs in <em>Tessmann </em>were allowed to testify as to the value of their property as it then existed, compared to what its value would have been <em>if the defendants had properly constructed the house. Tessmann </em>v. <em>Tiger Lee Construction Co., </em>supra, 228 Conn. 46. Implicit in the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony in <em>Tessmann </em>was the fact that the defendants\u2019 substandard construction of the plaintiffs\u2019 house was the cause of its decreased value. In the present case, James Pestey was allowed to testify as to his opinion of the value of his property both before and after offensive odors began emanating from the defendants\u2019 farm. After testifying that the value of his property had diminished since the odors began, he made explicit the causal connection implied by his testimony by testifying further that, in his opinion, the offensive odors were the cause of his property\u2019s diminished value. We conclude that under <em>Tessmann </em>it was proper for the trial court in the present case to allow James Pestey to testify in this manner regarding the cause of the diminution in the value of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Next, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule, a section of a certain livestock waste management handbook published by the Midwest Planning Service. The defendants argue specifically that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a section of the handbook titled \u201cControl of Odors and Gases Leaving the Livestock Area,\u201d which provided, among other things, that a farm operation should be located at least one-half mile away from neighboring houses, without the handbook first having been qualified as a learned treatise on the issue of odor control.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Preliminarily, we address the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the defendants have failed to preserve properly this claim for appeal. The standard for the preservation of a claim alleging an improper evidentiary ruling at trial is well settled. \u201cThis court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial. ... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. ... In objecting to evidence, counsel must properly articulate the basis of the objection so as to apprise the trial court of the precise nature of the objection and its real purpose, in order to form an adequate basis for a reviewable ruling. . . . Once counsel states the authority and ground of his objection, any appeal will be limited to the ground asserted. \u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>249 Conn. 423, 427-28, 735 A.2d 778 (1999); Practice Book \u00a7 5-5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants in this case have properly preserved this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>When the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel initially attempted to introduce the section of the Midwest Planning Service handbook (Midwest handbook) at issue, the defendants\u2019 counsel objected on the ground that it had not been qualified as a learned treatise. The trial court sustained the objection, ruling that the appropriate foundation had not been established in order to qualify the Midwest handbook as a treatise on this particular question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After further interrogation, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel again sought to have the text from the Midwest handbook admitted. Before deciding whether to admit the evidence, the trial court asked the defendants\u2019 counsel for his position on the issue, and the defendants\u2019 counsel reiterated his belief that the Midwest handbook had not been established as a learned treatise. The court disagreed with the defendants\u2019 counsel and allowed the section of the Midwest handbook at issue to be read into evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the defendants\u2019 counsel did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>not use the term \u201cobjection\u201d at either time that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sought to introduce the handbook into evidence, a review of the transcript reveals that the trial court understood the defendants\u2019 counsel to be making an objection each time. As a result, it is clear that the trial court effectively was alerted to a claim of potential error while there was still time for the court to act. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 428; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 88, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984). The defendants, therefore, have properly preserved this claim for appeal. We therefore turn to the merits of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Under the rules of evidence in this state, text from a published work \u201con a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art\u201d may be admitted into evidence under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule if two foundational requirements are satisfied. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (8).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> First, the work must be \u201crecognized as a standard authority in the field by the witness, other expert witness or judicial notice,\u201d and, second, the work must either be brought to the attention of the witness on cross-examination or have been relied on by that expert during direct examination. Id.; see also <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Huttenlocher, </em>185 Conn. 390, 395, 440 A.2d 952 (1981); C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 8.23, pp. 654-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In the present case, the plaintiffs twice sought to introduce the section of the Midwest handbook at issue during the cross-examination of Richard Vetter, the designer of the anaerobic digestion system on the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>dants\u2019 farm. The defendants\u2019 counsel objected to the initial attempt on the ground that the Midwest handbook had not been qualified as a learned treatise. The trial court agreed and sustained the objection, ruling that the Midwest handbook had been established as a learned treatise only on the issue of livestock manure production. Subsequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attempted to establish the appropriate foundation so as to qualify the Midwest handbook as a learned treatise on the issue of odor control. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked Vetter whether the Midwest handbook was recognized as a standard reference work by people in Vetter\u2019s profession with respect to animal waste characteristics. Vetter responded affirmatively and stated that it contained general references and recommendations. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel next asked whether the Midwest handbook also was used as a reference with respect to controlling the spread of odors and gases from livestock areas, and Vetter again responded that it contained general recommendations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At that point, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked the trial court to allow the section of the Midwest handbook at issue to be read into evidence by Vetter. The trial court ruled that Vetter had recognized the Midwest handbook as a general reference on this topic and allowed the testimony over the objection of the defendants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">It is well settled that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are entitled to great deference. <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Aetna </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>249 Conn. 766, 789, 734 A.2d 112 (1999). The trial court is given broad latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will not disturb such a ruling unless it is shown that the ruling amounted to an abuse of discretion. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 229-30, 733 A.2d 156 (1999). We conclude that Vetter\u2019s testimony, although not an unequivocal endorsement of the Midwest handbook as a leading authority in the field, was nonetheless sufficient to establish the necessary foundation to qualify it as a learned treatise. In response to questions posed by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Vetter acknowledged that the Midwest handbook was a standard reference in his profession in which one could find general references and recommendations with respect to animal waste characteristics and controlling the spread of odors and gases from livestock areas. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the introduction of the section of the Midwest handbook at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The defendants next claim that the evidence introduced at trial was not sufficient to support the juiy\u2019s finding that the defendants\u2019 farm operation was the source of the offensive odors at the plaintiffs\u2019 property. The standard of review for such a claim is well established. A party challenging the validity of the jury\u2019s verdict on grounds that there was insufficient evidence to support such a result carries a difficult burden. \u201cIn reviewing the soundness of a jury\u2019s verdict, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict.\u201d <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>234 Conn. 660, 681, 662 A.2d 1269 (1995). We do not ask whether we would have reached the same result. \u201c[R]ather, we must determine . . . whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the jury\u2019s verdict . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 693, 646 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>A.2d 147 (1994). \u201cIf the jury could reasonably have reached its conclusion, the verdict must stand.\u201d <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 681-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants\u2019 farm operation was the source of the offensive odors at the plaintiffs\u2019 property. Several witnesses testified that the defendants\u2019 farm was the source of the odors that affected the plaintiffs\u2019 property, and the plaintiffs themselves both testified that the defendants\u2019 farm was the source of the odors affecting their property. This testimony was based in part on the fact that the odors were present whenever the wind blew from a northerly direction, the direction of the defendants\u2019 farm, toward the plaintiffs\u2019 property. The plaintiffs each also testified that they were aware of other sources of odor in North Franklin but that none of those sources generated the type of odors that were affecting their property. The plaintiffs\u2019 testimony was corroborated by the testimony of their four sons, each of whom testified that the defendants\u2019 farm generated the offensive odors. Three of the four sons also testified that they were familiar with other odor producing establishments in North Franklin and that none of those establishments was the source of the odors present on the plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The plaintiffs also introduced the testimony of two experts, Lawson Safley, a livestock waste management expert, and Richard Duffee, an odor expert. Safley testified about the anaerobic digestion system at the defendants\u2019 farm based on his inspection of the site and his review of documents regarding the design and operation of the digester. He testified that, in his opinion, the digester was a probable source of the odors at the plaintiffs\u2019 property. First, Safley testified that the gaseous mixture produced by the digester was not being utilized to power the digester\u2019s engine generators. Rather, these odorous gases were simply being vented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>into the air. Second, Safley opined that the digester was either undersized or overloaded, which resulted in the incomplete digestion of manure. The release of this incompletely digested manure from the system resulted in the generation of an odor unlike that typically found on farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Duffee testified that he smelled objectionable odors while on the plaintiffs\u2019 property. He testified that the odors were present only in the vicinity of the defendants\u2019 farm and downwind therefrom, which led him to believe that the defendants\u2019 farm, specifically the manure pit and the anaerobic digester, was the source of the odors. He testified further that he traced the odors he experienced at the plaintiffs\u2019 property to the defendants\u2019 farm. Furthermore, in addition to the testimony of the plaintiffs, their four sons, and the expert testimony of Safley and Duffee, the plaintiffs offered the testimony of several other witnesses who had observed objectionable and offensive odors in the vicinity of the defendants\u2019 farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Although not free from contest, the evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants\u2019 farm was the proximate cause of the odors that interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property. Whether we would have reached a contrary conclusion had we been seated as the jury is not relevant to our determination in this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our inquiry is limited to whether the jury reasonably could have reached its finding based on the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>dence before it, including any inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. We conclude, on the basis of our review of the evidence introduced at trial, that the jury\u2019s finding was reasonably supported by the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Lastly, we address the claims the defendants raise on appeal that were not properly preserved at trial. The first issue involves the trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to \u00a7 19a-341, the statute concerning the right to farm, and the second issue involves the trial court\u2019s exclusion of testimony, based on the best evidence rule, with regard to a certain livestock waste management handbook published by the Northeast Regional Agricultural Engineering Service, which contradicted the Midwest handbook that was admitted into evidence. These issues were not properly preserved at trial, and, accordingly, we do not reach their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">First, the defendants claim that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding the application of \u00a7 19a-341 was improper because it permitted the jury to avoid application of the statute based on the defendants\u2019 negligence in the location of their farm rather than in its operation. Specifically, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly structured the jury charge by first instructing the jury on the elements of \u00a7 19a-341 and thereafter instructing the jury that the statute would not apply if the plaintiffs had proven any of the allegations of negligence contained in the their complaint, one of which claimed negligence in the location of the defendants\u2019 farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">A party may preserve for appeal a claim that a jury instruction was improper either by submitting a written request to charge or by taking an exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>charge as given. Practice Book \u00a7 16-20.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If counsel follows the latter course, he or she must \u201cstate distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of objection.\u201d Id. \u201cThe purpose of the rule is to alert the court to any claims of error while there is still an opportunity for correction in order to avoid the economic waste and increased court congestion caused by unnecessary retrials.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 658, 443 A.2d 906 (1982). The defendants in this case neither submitted a written request to charge nor excepted to the charge as given to the jury on the issue of negligent location as opposed to negligent operation. Instead, as the defendants\u2019 conceded at oral argument, this issue was raised for the first time on appeal. We will not reach the merits of an issue under such circumstances, in the absence of plain error. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, we will not review an underlying claim for plain error unless the request for relief under that doctrine has been adequately briefed. <em>HLO Land Ownership Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. Hartford, 248 Conn. 350, 361, 727 A.2d 1260 (1999). The defendants in this case have failed to engage in any analysis to demonstrate that plain error has occurred under the circumstances of this case. Rather, they merely assert in their brief that the instruction constituted plain error. The defendants, therefore, have failed to brief this issue adequately. Accordingly, we decline to reach the merits of the defendants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Second, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly excluded, based on the best evidence rule, the testimony of Dwaine Bundy, the defendants\u2019 odor expert, regarding the fact that the livestock waste management handbook published by the Northeast Regional Agricultural Engineering Service did not contain any reference to the proper distance a farm should be located from surrounding neighbors, as did the Midwest handbook that was admitted into evidence. During direct examination, the trial court allowed Bundy to testify, over the plaintiffs\u2019 objection on best evidence grounds, that the Northeast Regional Agricultural Engineering Service handbook did not contain any recommendation regarding a minimum distance from neighboring houses that a farm operation should be located. Subsequently, during the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-examination of Bundy, the trial court, sua sponte, reversed its earlier ruling and ordered that Bundy\u2019s testimony on this issue be stricken from the record. The defendants did not object. Because the defendants\u2019 counsel never raised this issue in the trial court and does not claim plain error, we decline to entertain this claim on appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cator, </em>256 Conn. 785, 801 and n.13, 781 A.2d 285 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19a-341 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any general statute or municipal ordinance or regulation pertaining to nuisances to the contrary, no agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment or facility, or any of its appurtenances, or the operation thereof, shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance, either public or private, due to alleged objectionable (1) odor from livestock, manure, fertilizer or feed . . . provided such agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment or facility has been in operation for one year or more and has not been substantially changed, and such operation follows generally accepted agricultural practices.

Since neither party requested, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 16-10, that the jury determine the factual issues of the equitable claim, the court retained its authority as the fact finder with respect to the second count, which the trial court decided in favor of the defendants. In the third count, the plaintiffs alleged that the odors were the result of the defendants\u2019 wilful, reckless and wanton misconduct.

Doctor, would you read me what the</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">recommendations are for control of odors and gasses leaving the livestock area according to the Midwest Planning Service?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u201c[Defendants\u2019 Counsel]: Your Honor, I don't believe that, and perhaps I missed it, the court has determined that this is a treatise\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, the witness has testified that this particular-\u2014on a question from [the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] that the [Midwest handbook] is a standard reference work.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">\u201cNow, it is a standard reference work that was qualified as such as to how much manure to figure on depending on the size of the cow. In that area, it\u2019s been qualified by this witness as a standardized reference work, and so that in that regard, I would permit the witness to testify on this topic is not within the ken of what the witness said. He acknowledged it as a standard reference work [on this issue only] so the objection\u2019s sustained.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\"> The following exchange occurred prior to the court\u2019s ruling on the evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">\u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019Counsel]: Your Honor, I think he\u2019s now put it back in play. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">\u201c[Defendants\u2019 Counsel]: Your Honor, he indicated that was the place that you could find information, and he never asked whether it was considered a standard reference work.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">\u201cThe Court: I think [the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] did say it\u2019s a general reference. I think he did. I think he said it\u2019s general reference. I think he has expanded it into\u2014I\u2019ll permit it, counsel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> Connecticut Code of Evidence \u00a7 8-3 (8) provides that the following evidence is not excluded by the hearsay rule: \u201cTo the extent called to the attention of an expert witness on cross-examination or relied on by the expert witness in direct examination, a statement contained in a published treatise, periodical or pamphlet on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, recognized as a standard authority in the field by the witness, other expert witness or judicial notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The following colloquy between the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and Vetter occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u201c[Q]. Doctor, this [handbook] is also recognized as a standard and referred to by people in your profession and accepted with respect to animal waste characteristics; isn\u2019t that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u201c[A]. This is general references, general recommendations, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\u201c[Q]. Okay. And it\u2019s recommended also for people who want to find information with respect to gas control and control of odors and gasses leaving the livestock area; isn\u2019t that true?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u201c[A]. Again, general recommendations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"> In its memorandum of decision on the second count of the amended complaint seeking equitable relief, the trial court\u2019s factual findings were in contrast with the jury\u2019s findings on the nuisance count. Although the trial court was \u201cunwilling to infer that the odors claimed by the plaintiffs and their witnesses emanated from the defendants\u2019 farm,\u201d the court stated correctly that \u201c[t]here was [however] sufficient evidence for the jury to decide that odors did emanate from the defendants\u2019 operation and constitute^] an unreasonable interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b393-5\"> Practice Book \u00a7 16-20 provides: \u201cAn appellate court shall not be bound to consider error as to the giving of, or the failure to give, an instruction unless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or exception has been taken by the party appealing immediately after the charge is delivered. Counsel taking the exception shall state distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of objection. The exception shall be taken out of the hearing of the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.
