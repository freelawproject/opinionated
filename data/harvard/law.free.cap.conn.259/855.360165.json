The habeas court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim under \u00a7 18-98d, and the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the habeas court. <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>54 Conn. App. 11, 18, 734 A.2d 571 (1999). We conclude that the petitioner is not entitled to the presentence credit that he seeks and, consequently, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>The following relevant facts axe undisputed. On August 25, 1985, the petitioner was arrested in Boston, Massachusetts, pursuant to a fugitive warrant issued by the state of Connecticut in connection with crimes that he allegedly had committed earlier that month. After initially contesting this state\u2019s efforts to extradite him, the petitioner waived extradition on January 2, 1986. At that time, he was transported to Connecticut, where he was held at the Bristol police department from January 6, 1986, until his arraignment on January 8, 1986. On January 8, 1986, the petitioner was placed in the custody of the respondent, the commissioner of correction (commissioner).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, the petitioner was convicted of the crimes of murder and kidnapping in the second degree<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and was sentenced on June 9, 1986. The petitioner has remained in the custody of the commissioner since his arraignment on January 8,1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The commissioner awarded the petitioner 152 days of presentence confinement credit under \u00a7 18-98d (a) for the period from January 8, 1986, to June 9, 1986, during which he was confined in a department of correction facility prior to sentencing. The commissioner also awarded the petitioner fifty days of presentence good time credit under \u00a7 18-98d (b) on the basis of his good conduct dining the 152 days of presentence confine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>ment. The petitioner, however, did not receive credit for the period from August 25,1985, to January 2,1986, during which he was incarcerated in Massachusetts prior to his extradition to this state. The petitioner also did not receive credit for the period from January 2, 1986, to January 6,1986, during which he was in transit from Massachusetts to this state, or for the period from January 6, 1986, to January 8, 1986, during which he was confined at the Bristol police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In 1996, the petitioner commenced this habeas corpus action, claiming that he is entitled to presentence confinement and presentence good time credit under \u00a7 18-98d for the period from August 25, 1985, to January 8, 1986. The habeas court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim and dismissed his petition, relying on <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 312, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986), and <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>196 Conn. 572, 575, 494 A.2d 1195 (1985), appeal dismissed, 475 U.S. 1002, 106 S. Ct. 1172, 89 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1986), in which this court concluded that the habeas petitioners in those cases were not entitled to presentence confinement credit for time spent incarcerated in another state pending extradition to this state. The petitioners in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>based their claims for presentence credit on General Statutes \u00a7 18-98,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which, though linguistically similar to \u00a7 18-98d; cf. footnote 2 of this opinion; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>addresses presentence credit for prisoners arrested for offenses committed <em>prior </em>to July 1, 1981. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 573; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">On appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the habeas court. <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 18. With respect to the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was entitled to presentence credit for the time that he had been incarcerated in Massachusetts while contesting extradition to this state, the Appellate Court agreed with the habeas court that that claim was foreclosed by this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor. </em>Id., 16. With respect to the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was entitled to presentence credit for the period from January 2, 1986, to January 8, 1986, the Appellate Court declined to consider that claim on the ground that it had not been briefed adequately. Id., 16 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">We granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification limited to two issues, namely: (1) whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the petitioner is not entitled to presentence confinement and presentence good time credit under \u00a7 18-98d for the time that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts while contesting this state\u2019s efforts to extradite him; and (2) whether the Appellate Court properly rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that he is entitled to such credit for the period from January 2, 1986, to January 8, 1986, on the ground that the claim had been briefed inadequately. <em>See Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>251 Conn. 919, 920, 742 A.2d 358 (1999). We agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner is not entitled to credit pursuant to \u00a7 18-98d for the time that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts. Although we disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner failed to brief adequately his claim that he is entitled to credit for the period from January 2, 1986, to January 8, 1986, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>we reject that claim on its merits. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The petitioner first claims that the Appellate Court improperly determined that he is not entitled to credit pursuant to \u00a7 18-98d for the time that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts. The petitioner advances two arguments in support of his claim. First, he argues that such credit is expressly authorized under the language of \u00a7 18-98d. Second, he argues that any possible ambiguity in the statutory language must be resolved in the petitioner\u2019s favor because the contrary construction adopted by the Appellate Court renders \u00a7 18-98d unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by the petitioner\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Whether \u00a7 18-98d authorizes presentence confinement and presentence good time credit for time that a pretrial detainee remains in custody in a sister state while contesting extradition to this state is an issue of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory interpretation is a matter of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. ... In construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>tive history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., 252 </em>Conn. 79, 84, 743 A.2d 156 (1999). With these principles in mind, we turn to the petitioner\u2019s claim that he is entitled to presentence credit for the period of time during which he was incarcerated in Massachusetts prior to his extradition to this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The petitioner contends, first, that \u00a7 18-98d, by its terms, authorizes presentence credit for the period of time dining which a pretrial detainee is incarcerated in an out-of-state facility while challenging this state\u2019s efforts to extradite him. Because the language of \u00a7 18-98d is similar to the language of \u00a7 18-98; see footnotes 2 and 5 of this opinion; our interpretation of \u00a7 18-98 in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 309, and <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 572, informs our construction of \u00a7 18-98d. We therefore begin our analysis of the petitioner\u2019s claim with a review of those two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>we held that, under \u00a7 18-98, presentence credit is available only to pretrial detainees who are incarcerated in a facility administered by the commissioner; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 312, 317-19; or who otherwise are subject to the control of the commissioner. See id., 317-18 and n.9. In rejecting the claim of the petitioner, Samuel Lewis Johnson, that he was entitled to presentence credit for the time that he was incarcerated in a Florida facility while contesting extradition to this state on the charge of escape from custody, we concluded that Johnson\u2019s claim was foreclosed by \u201cthe plain, straightforward language of \u00a7 18-98 . . . .\u201d Id., 317. We noted, in particular, \u201cthat \u00a7 18-98 as written has no language about \u2018while awaiting extradition,\u2019 but rather clearly specifies \u2018while awaiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., 315. We explained that it was \u201cobvious that the \u2018awaiting trial\u2019 criterion is critical in determining credits for those so entitled.\u201d Id. We also focused on the requirement of \u00a7 18-98 that the pretrial detainee seeking presentence credit be confined in a community correctional center. See id., 317-18. We reasoned that \u201c[a] \u2018community correctional center\u2019 is a \u2018correctional institution\u2019; General Statutes [Rev. to 1985] \u00a7 1-1 (w);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and encompasses institutions situated in Connecticut rather than those outside Connecticut in which one awaiting extradition is confined. . . . [U]nder such a view Connecticut authorities have complete control over inmates confined in Connecticut, including those confined outside Connecticut pursuant to \u00a7 18-102,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>contrast to the lack of control over an inmate wanted in Connecticut who is confined elsewhere awaiting extradition.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 317-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">We also rejected Johnson\u2019s claim that a literal interpretation of \u00a7 18-98 would render it unconstitutional under the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With respect to his equal protection claim, Johnson maintained that the denial of presentence credit for the time that he had been incarcerated in Florida while contesting extradition to this state \u201ceffectively lengthened] \u201d the sentence that he would have been required to serve relative to a similarly situated detainee who had committed the same crime and had received the same sentence but who had been arrested and incarcerated in this state pending disposition of his case. Id., 319. We concluded that, because Johnson had been incarcerated outside this state\u2019s borders, his claim simply did not implicate constitutional principles of equal protection. See id., 320-21. We explained: \u201cA state\u2019s equal protection constitutional obligation [m]anifestly . . . can be performed only where its laws operate, that is, <em>within its own jurisdiction. </em>It is there that the equality of legal right must be maintained. That obligation is imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>by the Constitution upon the States severally as governmental entities . . . each responsible for its own laws establishing the rights and duties of persons <em>within its borders.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 320, quoting <em>Missouri ex rel. Gaines </em>v. <em>Canada, </em>305 U.S. 337, 350, 59 S. Ct. 232, 83 L. Ed. 208 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">We further stated that, \u201ceven if [Johnson] could overcome this equal protection obstacle, the rational basis standard, and not the compelling state interest standard, would be applicable. We perceive no fundamental right requiring that this nonindigent petitioner be credited with his Florida confinement time while awaiting extradition. . . . There is no invidious classification involved. The credit sought by the petitioner under \u00a7 18-98, statutorily created, is a matter of legislative grace. . . . While not requiring identical treatment, equal protection does require that a distinction made must have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made. . . . [Section] 18-98 satisfies such a test. The classification it makes is between those persons who are confined within the control of the Connecticut correctional system and those who are not. As to the former, the appropriate Connecticut authorities have control over where they are, their availability for such matters as trials, hearings, release, and the like, and from their control emerges their responsibility for them. As to the latter [category of persons], Connecticut has no such control. This legislative classification has a fair and substantial relation to the object of \u00a7 18-98; it entitles those who do come within its ambit to receive credit for their Connecticut-controlled confinement \u2018while awaiting trial.\u2019 . . . This certainly rationally advances the legitimate state interest of authorizing credit to those so held when the . . . commissioner has determined that a person so confined has \u2018conformed to the rules of the institution\u2019 in which [that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>person] is confined.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 321-23 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Johnson also asserted that construing \u00a7 18-98 to deny him presentence credit would violate his due process rights, \u201cfirst, [because] such a denial operates as an unconstitutional chill to the assertion of his fundamental right to contest extradition by habeas corpus and, second, [because] it unconstitutionally punishes him for doing so by effectively lengthening the subsequent sentence imposed upon him for the crime for which he was being extradited.\u201d Id., 322. Although we acknowledged that, as a general matter, principles of due process prohibit the state from penalizing a person for exercising his or her constitutional rights; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 372, 102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982); <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1978); we noted that \u201cit is also clear that the . . . constitution does not forbid every government-imposed choice in the criminal process that has the effect of discouraging the exercise of constitutional rights.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 327, quoting <em>Chaffin </em>v. <em>Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 30, 93 S. Ct. 1977, 36 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1973). After emphasizing that the commissioner did not deny Johnson presentence credit for any improper reason but, rather, because \u201cthe requested credit [could not] be given [under] . . . the plain statutory command of \u00a7 18-98\u201d; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 325; we rejected Johnson\u2019s due process claim in light of \u201cthe narrowness of the permissible inquiry in the habeas corpus hearing in Florida; see <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>439 U.S. 282, 289, 99 S. Ct. 530, 58 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1978); <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Bourbeau, </em>193 Conn. 270, 275, 477 A.2d 636 (1984); the plain command of \u00a7 18-98 that no credit can be given to one in [Johnson\u2019s] circumstances, and the absence of any legitimate basis suggesting any interdicted vindic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>tiveness, punishment or the like for the choice exercised . . . .\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Justice Shea, joined by Judge Satter,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> dissented from the majority opinion in <em>Johnson. </em>Justice Shea acknowledged that \u201c[t]he interpretation of \u00a7 18-98 adopted by the [majority was] undeniably consistent with the language of the statute that authorizes commutation of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u2018by the number of days <em>which he spent in a community correctional </em>center\u2019 and that requires a certification of such commutation by \u2018the supervising officer of <em>the correctional center where such person wa,s confined </em>while awaiting trial ....\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 329 <em>(Shea, </em>,/., dissenting). Justice Shea noted, however, that the majority had \u201csanctionfed] several . . . departures from the literal requirements of [\u00a7 18-98].\u201d Id., 329-30 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). For example, Justice Shea noted that the majority had acknowledged that pretrial detainees who had been transferred to penal institutions outside Connecticut pursuant to the New England Interstate Corrections Compact; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-102 through 18-104;* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> were entitled to presentence credit even though those detainees were not awaiting trial in a \u201ccommunity correctional center,\u201d a prerequisite to receiving presentence credit based on a literal interpretation of \u00a7 18-98.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 330 <em>(Shea, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number><em>J., </em>dissenting). Justice Shea asserted that the majority had approved such \u201cdeviations from the strict language of the statute ... in order to accommodate longstanding practices of the commissioner which forestall equal protection claims that would otherwise be raised by prisoners denied the credit for time served prior to sentence, not in a community correctional center, as \u00a7 18-98 appears to dictate, but elsewhere.\u201d Id., 330-31 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Furthermore, in Justice Shea\u2019s view, under the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 18-98, the \u201cdifference in treatment accorded to those who contest extradition as compared to other prisoners who are incarcerated prior to sentence is a denial of equal protection of the laws that is prohibited by [the fourteenth amendment to the] federal constitution . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 328 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). According to Justice Shea, \u201c[t]he discrimination sanctioned by the majority [could not] be justified on any rational basis and thus fail[ed] a criterion essential to the validity of any classification. ... It also impinge[d] upon the free exercise of the fundamental constitutional right to challenge the legality of a person\u2019s confinement by [seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>a writ of] habeas corpus . . . ,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> [This impact] upon [a] basic constitutional [right] can be justified only by [demonstrating] that the classification approved by the majority ... is necessary to meet a compelling state interest, the most difficult hurdle to surmount in the face of an equal protection challenge. ... No contention has been made, either by the state or the majority, that this exalted criterion for constitutional validity, if applicable, has been satisfied by the record . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 328-29 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 572, this court, in a plurality opinion, rejected a claim identical to the one that we had considered just two months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>earlier in Johnson, concluding that \u201c[o]ur . . . decision in <em>Johnson . . </em>. require[d] this result.\u201d Id., 575. Justice Shea dissented for the reasons that he set forth in his dissenting opinion in <em>Johnson. </em>Id., 579 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting); see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 328-41 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). Chief Justice Peters, joined by Justice Santaniello, issued a concurring opinion in which she expressed her agreement with Justice Shea that the interpretation of \u00a7 18-98 adopted by the majority in <em>Johnson </em>rendered that provision constitutionally infirm. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 577 <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>concurring). Although persuaded by Justice Shea\u2019s dissent in <em>Johnson, </em>Chief Justice Peters nevertheless concluded that she was bound to follow the construction of \u00a7 18-98 adopted by the court in <em>Johnson </em>because, she explained, \u201c[a] change in the constituency of this corut is not a sufficiently compelling reason to warrant departure from a recently established construction of a state statute.\u201d Id., 578 <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>concurring). Justice Peters stated that, \u201c[b]ecause the [majority\u2019s] holding in <em>Johnson . . . </em>rest[ed] squarely on construction of the language of \u00a7 18-98, it [was then] up to the legislature to decide whether this court [was] correct in its view of the credit properly to be afforded pretrial detainees held in other jurisdictions.\u201d Id. <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>concurring). Justice Peters then \u201curge[d] the legislature . . . to reexamine in their entirety the principles that should govern credits for pretrial incarceration.\u201d Id. <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The petitioner claims that this court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 18-98 in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>does not govern our interpretation of \u00a7 18-98d. Specifically, the petitioner contends that: (1) linguistic differences between \u00a7 18-98d and \u00a7 18-98 support his claim that he is entitled to presentence credit under \u00a7 18-98d for the period of his incarceration in Massachusetts while contesting extradition to this state; (2) in any event, our construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>of \u00a7 18-98 in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>was incorrect; and (3) notwithstanding this court\u2019s contrary conclusion in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>it is constitutionally impermissible to deny statutory presentence confinement credit for the time that a person is incarcerated in another state while contesting extradition to this state. We reject the petitioner\u2019s contentions, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The petitioner\u2019s linguistic argument is predicated on the fact that \u00a7 18-98d, in contrast to \u00a7 18-98, contains no express requirement that the pretrial detainee be incarcerated \u201cwhile awaiting trial.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The petitioner maintains that this distinction between \u00a7\u00a7 18-98 and 18-98d is crucial to our interpretation of \u00a7 18-98d because, in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 315-16, we had relied on the \u201cwhile awaiting trial\u201d language in concluding that \u00a7 18-98 did not authorize credit for the period of time during which Johnson was incarcerated in Florida while contesting <em>extradition </em>to this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">We agree with the petitioner that the absence of the phrase \u201cwhile awaiting trial\u201d from \u00a7 18-98d provides some support for his contention that \u00a7 18-98d is distinguishable from \u00a7 18-98. As we expressly noted in <em>Johnson, </em>however, \u201cin 1980 the General Assembly enacted ... \u00a7 18-98d .... Despite the opportunity to do so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>the legislature did not at that time include any language that suggested [that \u00a7 18-98d] was to be applied to a person confined outside Connecticut who was contesting extradition to this state.\u201d Id., 325 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">More importantly, certain language in \u00a7 18-98d severely undermines the petitioner\u2019s contention that he is entitled to the presentence credit that he seeks. In particular, General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (a) authorizes presentence credit for those persons \u201cconfined to a <em>community correctional center or a correctional institution </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Massachusetts facility at which the petitioner was incarcerated pending his extradition to this state is neither a \u201ccommunity correctional center\u201d nor a \u201ccorrectional institution\u201d as those terms are defined under General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (w).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See footnote 7 of this opinion. Thus, the petitioner has failed to satisfy a prerequisite to the entitlement of presentence confinement credit under \u00a7 18-98d (a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The petitioner\u2019s attempt to distinguish \u00a7\u00a7 18-98 and 18-98d is further undermined by the dictates of General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (b), which authorizes an award of presentence good time credit at a rate of ten days per thirty days of presentence confinement \u201cif [the pretrial detainee] obeys the rules of the facility . . . .\u201d Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>the petitioner\u2019s construction of \u00a7 18-98d, he would be entitled to such good time credit for the time that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts. It is unlikely, however, that the legislature intended to make such credit available to a person who, like the petitioner, is incarcerated in another state and over whom the commissioner has no control.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For these reasons, we are not persuaded that the linguistic differences between \u00a7\u00a7 18-98 and 18-98d warrant a conclusion that a pretrial detainee who is incarcerated in another state while contesting extradition to this state is entitled to credit under the latter provision notwithstanding our contraiy conclusion with respect to the entitlement to credit under the former provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The petitioner also claims that our construction of \u00a7 18-98 in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>should not guide our interpretation of \u00a7 18-98d because those two cases were wrongly decided. In essence, the petitioner claims that our holdings in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>reflect a fundamental misperception of the intent of the legislature regarding the availability of presentence credit to a person who, like the petitioner, was arrested in another state pursuant to a warrant issued by this state and was incarcerated in that foreign state while contesting extradition to this state. Whatever merit we might find in the petitioner\u2019s construction of \u00a7 18-98 were we writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>on a clean slate, we are constrained to reject his argument because <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>were decided over sixteen years ago, and the legislature has failed to take any steps to amend either \u00a7 18-98 or \u00a7 18-98d in response to the clear holdings of those two cases. \u201cWhile we are aware that legislative inaction is not necessarily legislative affirmation ... we also presume that the legislature is aware of [this court\u2019s] interpretation of a statute, and that its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation. . . . Time and again, we have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action as manifesting the legislature\u2019s acquiescence in our construction of a statute. . . . Once an appropriate interval to permit legislative reconsideration has passed without corrective legislative action, the inference of legislative acquiescence places a significant jurisprudential limitation on our own authority to reconsider the merits of our earlier decision.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>254 Conn. 214, 252, 756 A.2d 1264 (2000). Indeed, the inference of legislative acquiescence in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>is especially strong in light of the fact that Chief Justice Peters, in her concurring opinion in <em>Taylor, </em>expressly urged the legislature \u201cto reexamine in their entirety the principles that should govern credits for pretrial incarceration\u201d; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 578 <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>concurring); \u201c[i]n light of the seriousness of the issues raised\u201d; id. <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>concurring); including the issue of \u201cwhether this court [was] correct in its view of the credit properly to be afforded pretrial detainees held in other jurisdictions [while contesting extradition].\u201d Id. <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>concurring). We therefore are not persuaded by the petitioner\u2019s contention that our holdings in <em>Johnson </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>Taylor </em>were predicated upon an erroneous determination of legislative intent.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Our reaffirmance of the construction of \u00a7 18-98 that we adopted in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>provides strong support for the habeas court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 18-98d: in the absence of any evidence of contrary legislative intent, we see no reason why the legislature would have denied presentence credit under \u00a7 18-98 to a person incarcerated in another state while contesting extradition for an offense committed prior to July 1, 1981, and have granted such credit under \u00a7 18-98d to a person incarcerated in another state while contesting extradition for an offense committed on or after July 1, 1981. To conclude otherwise would be to ignore the obvious similarity of purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 18-98 and 18-98d. Although it is true that those two provisions are not identical, we will not read the provisions to accomplish different results unless there is something in the pertinent statutory language or history to indicate that the legislature intended such a result. See, e.g., <em>Derwin </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 411, 420, 661 A.2d 1025 (1995) (because legislature is presumed to have created harmonious and consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>body of law, we read statutes together when they relate to same subject matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Finally, the petitioner claims that construing \u00a7 18-98d to deny him credit for the time that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts while contesting extradition to this state renders \u00a7 18-98d unconstitutional as applied under the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The petitioner recognizes that he can prevail on his claim only if we adopt a position contrary to the view expressed by this court in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor. </em>Indeed, the petitioner urges us to adopt the constitutional analysis undertaken by Justice Shea in his dissenting opinion in <em>Johnson.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\"><em>\u201cWe </em>conduct our review of this claim mindful that legislative enactments carry with them a strong presumption of constitutionality . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. McMahon, 257 Conn. 544, 551, 778 A.2d 847 (2001). Consequently, \u201ca party challenging the constitutionality of a validly enacted statute bears the heavy burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We conclude that the petitioner has failed to meet his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>We turn first to the petitioner\u2019s equal protection claim. \u201cWe begin by providing the relevant constitutional framework for adjudicating such claims. When a statute is challenged on equal protection grounds . . . the reviewing court must first determine the standard by which the challenged statute\u2019s constitutional validity will be determined. If, in distinguishing between classes,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the statute either intrudes on the exercise of a fundamental right or burdens a suspect class of persons, the court will apply a strict scrutiny standard [under which] the state must demonstrate that the challenged statute is necessary to the achievement of a compelling state interest. ... If the statute does not touch upon either a fundamental right or a suspect class, its classification need only be rationally related to some legitimate government purpose in order to withstand an equal protection challenge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ramos </em>v. Vernon, 254 Conn. 799, 829, 761 A.2d 705 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The petitioner contends that the denial of presentence credit under \u00a7 18-98d for the time that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts while contesting extradition to this state unduly burdens his fundamental right to liberty and impermissibly chills his right to contest extradition by means of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner claims, therefore, that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>may deny him such credit only in furtherance of a compelling state interest. The petitioner further maintains that the state can demonstrate no such compelling justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 319-21, we rejected an identical claim, concluding that constitutional principles of equal protection are inapplicable when the person seeking to invoke those protections to obtain presentence credit is physically outside the jurisdiction of this state for the period in question. We do not find this logic persuasive, however, because, as Justice Shea observed in his dissenting opinion, Johnson had been held in Florida solely at this state\u2019s request. Id., 333 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). In such circumstances, we agree with Justice Shea that any \u201cdenial of equal protection . . . occurred while [Johnson] was in this state at the time of sentencing when the time he served in Florida was not credited.\u201d Id., 332 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting); see footnote 13 of this opinion. We also held in <em>Johnson, </em>however, that, even if Johnson\u2019s claim implicated the equal protection clause, he nevertheless could not prevail because the rational basis standard, as opposed to the compelling state interest standard, would be applicable. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 321 n.12. We explained that the \u201ccredit sought by [Johnson] under \u00a7 18-98, statutorily created, is a matter of legislative grace\u201d; id.; and, therefore, does not give rise to a fundamental right. Id. We concluded that, in such circumstances, the state need only demonstrate a rational basis for treating Johnson differently from those who are entitled to credit under \u00a7 18-98. See id., 321-22 n.12. We further determined that \u201c[t]he classification [created by \u00a7 18-98] between those persons who are confined within the control of the Connecticut correctional system and those who are not\u201d is a rational one that bears \u201ca fair and substantial relation to the object of \u00a7 18-98 . . . .\u201d Id. The petitioner challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>this alternative conclusion, claiming, first, that the effective extension of his sentence occasioned by the denial of presentence credit under \u00a7 18-98d implicates a liberty interest that the constitution recognizes as fundamental. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">It is well established that presentence credit is a creature of statute and that, as a general rule, such credit is not constitutionally required.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Travis </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>925 F.2d 1095, 1097 (8th Cir. 1991<em>);Boutwell </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>861 F.2d 1530, 1532 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>denied, 490 U.S. 1099, 109 S.

Because such credit is not constitutionally mandated, it is not one of those few rights deemed so fundamental that the state cannot impinge upon it in the absence of a compelling reason. \u201cIt is not the province of [the courts] to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws.\u201d <em>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 33, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1973). Rather, \u201c[t]he key to discovering whether a right is fundamental is in assessing whether the right is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the [constitution. . . . Such rights include first amendment rights, which are explicitly provided for by the [c]onstitution, see, e.g., <em>Mt. Healthy City Board of Educations. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 284-85, [97 S.

Credit for presentence incarceration does not fall within this exalted group of rights that are recognized as fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">It is true, as the petitioner contends, that denying him credit for the four months that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts effectively lengthens his sentence by that amount of time.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the fact that a legislative classification may serve to increase one\u2019s period of imprisonment is insufficient, standing alone, to implicate an interest so fundamental as to require the state to establish a compelling justification for the statutory scheme. Thus, even though the denial of statutory good time credit results in an effectively longer sentence, it is settled that the equal protection clause does not prohibit the government from awarding good time credit only to sentenced prisoners, and not to prisoners incarcerated prior to trial, as long as a rational basis exists to do so. See <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 268, 273-74, 93 S. Ct. 1055, 35 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1973) (statute authorizing good time credit for time served following imposition of sentence but not for presen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>tence incarceration passes muster under equal protection clause if reason for distinction is rationally based); cf. <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>703 F.2d 30, 34 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 934, 104 S. Ct. 339, 78 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1983) (statutory scheme under which some sentenced prisoners are awarded more good time than others does not violate equal protection clause if rational basis exists for classification). It is not surprising, therefore, that the petitioner has identified no case, and we are aware of none, in which a pretrial detainee has prevailed on a claim that the denial of presentence credit, without more, implicates a fundamental right. Indeed, the cases that we have found have reached a contrary determination. See, e.g., <em>Beauchamp </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>37 F.3d 700, 707, 708 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1019, 115 S. Ct. 1365, 131 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1995); <em>Boutwell </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>supra, 861 F.2d 1531-32. We therefore reject the petitioner\u2019s claim that the commissioner\u2019s denial of presentence credit for the period of his confinement in Massachusetts while contesting extradition to this state implicates a fundamental right.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The petitioner also claims that the denial of presentence credit for the four months that he was incarcerated in a Massachusetts facility implicates yet another fundamental right, namely, his right to challenge his extradition to this state by means of a petition for a writ of habeas coipus. In support of this claim, the petitioner relies on Justice Shea\u2019s assertion in his dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>senting opinion in <em>Johnson </em>that, \u201c[s]ince the essential issue in a habeas corpus proceeding, such as an extradition hearing, is the legality of the petitioner\u2019s confinement, it follows that nothing less than the fundamental constitutional right of liberty is at stake in such an inquiiy. ... It is beyond cavil that the different treatment . . . accorded those who seek to contest extradition must inevitably operate to discourage the free exercise of that constitutional right . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 335 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Although the denial of presentence credit may be characterized as implicating a \u201cliberty interest\u201d in the broadest sense of that term, credit for presentence incarceration is not a fundamental right. Under Justice Shea\u2019s view, however, the denial of such credit effectively would be elevated to a fundamental right simply because the act of challenging the state\u2019s attempt to extradite happens to take the form of a petition for a writ of habeas coipus. We are not persuaded that presentence credit may be bootstrapped in order to elevate its status to that of a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">As Justice Shea noted in <em>Johnson, </em>the writ of habeas corpus is constitutionally based. Id., 334-35 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). Ordinarily, however, a habeas petition is filed following conviction and exhaustion of appellate remedies. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, a habeas petition is the sole remaining means by which a defendant may challenge the legality of his confinement. Under those circumstances, it is true, as Justice Shea noted, that \u201c[i]t must never be forgotten that the writ of habeas coipus is the precious safeguard of personal liberty and there is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 334 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting), quoting <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>306 U.S. 19, 26, 59 S. Ct. 442, 83 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1939). In the extradition context, by contrast, a detainee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>fundamental purpose in seeking a writ of habeas corpus is not to challenge his confinement in the asylum state but, rather, to contest the extradition efforts of the requesting state.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Indeed, because a habeas petition is the appropriate vehicle for contesting extradition; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-166;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the petitioner would have been required to file a habeas petition to challenge this state\u2019s efforts to extradite him even if he had been released on bail in Massachusetts. See <em>Engel </em>v. <em>Bourbeau, </em>201 Conn. 162, 163 n.3, 513 A.2d 688 (1986). Moreover, an extradition hearing, which takes place before the start of formal adversarial judicial proceedings; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>196 Conn. 557, 561-62, 494 A.2d 1190 (1985); \u201cis only a summary proceeding, limited to determining whether the necessary documents are in order, whether the petitioner has been charged with a crime, is the person named in the extradition request and is a fugitive from justice.\u201d Id., 564; see also <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>supra, 439 U.S. 289. Finally, in the event that a detainee fails to defeat extradition, he retains the full panoply of rights and protections guaranteed under the constitution and the laws of the requesting state to challenge his arrest and confinement. Under these circumstances, it reasonably cannot be main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>tained that the alleged impairment of the writ of habeas corpus owing to the denial of presentence credit constitutes an impermissible infringement on any fundamental right or liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the equal protection clause does not prohibit the state from denying presentence credit to a pretrial detainee for the time that he or she is incarcerated in another state while contesting extradition to this state provided a rational basis exists for the denial of such credit.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We now turn to the issue of whether a rational basis exists for the denial of such credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">\u201c[E]qual protection is not alicense for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness or logic of legislative choices.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Ducci Electrical Contractors, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 793, 817, 730 A.2d 1149 (1999). Thus, in areas of social and economic policy that neither proceed along suspect lines nor infringe fundamental constitutional rights, \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see <em>United States Railroad Retirement [Board] </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174, 179 [101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 2d 368] (1980), the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker, see <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 464 [101 S. Ct. 715, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659] (1981), and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. [432, 446, 105 S.

In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 321-22 n. 12, we determined that it was reasonable for the legislature, under \u00a7 18-98, to distinguish between pretrial detainees on the basis of whether their confinement was under the control of Connecticut authorities. We agree with our conclusion in <em>Johnson, </em>which is equally applicable to \u00a7 18-98d.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">That conclusion finds strong support in <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 115 S.

In concluding that such confinement did not constitute \u201c \u2018official detention\u2019 \u2019\u2019within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 (b); id.; the court explained: \u201cIt is . . . true that under the [statutory interpretation adopted by the court] a defendant \u2018released\u2019 to a community treatment center could be subject to restraints which do not materially differ from those imposed on a \u2018detained\u2019 defendant committed to the custody of the Attorney General, and thence assigned to a treatment center. But this fact does not undercut the remaining distinction that exists between <em>all </em>defendants committed to the custody of the Attorney General on the one hand, and <em>all </em>defendants released on bail on the other. Unlike defendants \u2018released\u2019 on bail, defendants who are \u2018detained\u2019 or \u2018sentenced\u2019 <em>always remain subject to the control of the Bureau [of Prisons </em>(Bureau)]. . . . This is an important distinction, as the identity of the custodian has both legal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>practical significance. A defendant who is \u2018released\u2019 is not in [the Bureau\u2019s] custody, and he cannot be summarily reassigned to a different place of confinement unless a judicial officer revokes his release ... or modifies the conditions of his release .... A defendant who is \u2018detained,\u2019 however, is completely subject to [the Bureau\u2019s] control. And \u2018[t]hat single factor encompasses a wide variety of restrictions.\u2019 . . . \u2018Detained\u2019 defendants are subject to [the Bureau\u2019s] disciplinary procedures; they are subject to summary reassignment to any other penal or correctional facility within the system . . . and, being in the legal custody of [the Bureau], the Bureau has full discretion to control many conditions of their confinement.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 62-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">These observations by the court in <em>Koray </em>are equally applicable to the present case. When a detainee is not under the control of Connecticut authorities, he is neither subject to this state\u2019s disciplinary procedures nor subject to reassignment to other facilities under this state\u2019s control. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 321-23 n.12. Moreover, he is not subject to the conditions of confinement established by the commissioner. To credit the petitioner\u2019s sentence for the time that he spent in Massachusetts while challenging extradition would \u201c[defeat] the very interest that underlies the no-credit rule: that [this state] fixes the place of imprisonment, not the prisoner.\u201d <em>Beauchamp </em>v. <em>Mur</em>phy, supra, 37 F.3d 705; see also <em>Boutwell </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>supra, 861 F.2d 1532. Accordingly, we conclude that the classification created by \u00a7 18-98d passes muster under the equal protection clause because that classification is reasonably related to a legitimate state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Finally, the petitioner claims that the denial of credit under \u00a7 18-98d for the time that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts violates his right to substantive due process. Specifically, the petitioner contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>denial of credit that he would have received if he immediately had waived extradition and submitted to the custody of the commissioner constitutes an impermissible burden on his right to contest extradition by means of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The analytical framework for reviewing substantive due process claims is well established. If the petitioner can demonstrate that the denial of credit under \u00a7 18-98d implicates a fundamental right, we must apply strict scrutiny to that statutory provision and require the state to show that the denial of presentence credit for the period that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts furthers a compelling state interest. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 561, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406, 145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999). If, however, the petitioner\u2019s claim does not implicate a fundamental right, we review \u00a7 18-98d under a rational basis test. E.g., <em>Ramos v. Vernon, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 840. In such circumstances, the state must show only that the law is not arbitrary or capricious, that is, that it bears a reasonable relation to some legitimate state purpose. See, e.g., <em>State v. Matos, </em>240 Conn. 743, 749-50, 694 A.2d 775 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Although \u201c \u2018due process\u2019 has never been, and perhaps can never be, precisely defined\u201d; <em>Lassiter v.

The petitioner\u2019s claim is predicated solely on the contention that the denial of presentence credit impermissibly penalizes him for exercising his right to contest, by means of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, this state\u2019s efforts to extradite him.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We reject the petitioner\u2019s claim for the same reason that we rejected his similar contention under the equal protection clause: the petitioner\u2019s limited right to contest extradition is not a fundamental right or liberty interest protected by the due process clause, and it cannot be transformed into one merely because a habeas petition is the statutorily designated means pursuant to which extradition is contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Consequently, the state must establish only that a rational basis exists for denying the petitioner credit under \u00a7 18-98d for the four months that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts while contesting extradition to this state. We already have concluded that the denial of such credit is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. See <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 841 (\u201c[e]qual protection rational basis review is for all material purposes . . . indistinguishable from . . .

The Appellate Court declined to consider the petitioner\u2019s claim because \u201cthe petitioner [had] failed to make a separate argument with regard to this claim\u201d; <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 54 Conn.

Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">To the extent that this claim was predicated on the same equal protection and due process arguments that the petitioner had raised in support of his claim of entitlement to credit for the time that he was incarcerated in Massachusetts, we agree with the petitioner that his claim was sufficiently briefed. We reject the petitioner\u2019s claim on its merits, however, because, as we indicated in part I of this opinion, \u00a7 18-98d, like \u00a7 18-98, applies only to pretrial detainees whose confinement is subject to the control of the commissioner, and, further, construing \u00a7 18-98d in that manner does not violate constitutional principles of equal protection or due process. Because the petitioner was not within the custody or control of the commissioner either when he was in transit to this state from Massachusetts or when he was confined at the Bristol police department, he is not entitled to presentence credit under \u00a7 18-98d for those periods of time.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ and VERTEFEU-ILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">MCDONALD, C.

The petitioner further claims that he was incarcerated at the Bristol police department from January 6,1986, until January 8, 1986, when he was transferred to the custody of the commissioner. In support of these factual assertions, the petitioner relies on a transfer report that was admitted into evidence during the habeas proceeding. Upon review of that report, however, we agree with the commissioner that it does not disclose the precise dates on which the petitioner was in LeBeau\u2019s custody or on which he was confined at the Bristol police department. Nevertheless, because those dates are not material to our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s claims, we assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the dates asserted by the petitioner are accurate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-8\"> See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 18-98 provides: \u201cAny person who has been denied bail or who has been unable to obtain bail and who is subsequently imprisoned for an offense committed prior to July 1,1981, is entitled to commutation of his sentence by the number of days which he spent in a community correctional center from the time he was denied or was unable to obtain bail to the time he was so imprisoned. The Commissioner of Correction shall, if such person has confonned to the rules of the institution, credit such person with the number of days to which the supervising officer of the correctional center where such person was confined while awaiting trial certifies such person was confined between the denial of bail to him or his inability to obtain bail and his imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b881-9\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of tire laws. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">The petitioner also claims a violation of equal protection under article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution.

See generally <em>Johnson v. Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 332-34 <em>(Shea,J., </em>dissenting). Justice Shea reasoned that, \u201c[although it may be true that a state\u2019s equal protection obligations \u2018can be performed only where its laws operate, that is, within its own jurisdiction\u2019; <em>Missouri ex rel. Caines </em>v. <em>Canada, </em>[supra, 305 U.S. 350]; the denial of equal protection in [Johnson] occurred while [Johnson] was in this state at the time of sentencing when the time he served in Florida was not credited.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 332 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\"> In support of his contention that \u00a7 18-98 should be interpreted to authorize presentence credit for persons incarcerated in another state while contesting extradition to this state, Justice Shea observed that the construction of \u00a7 18-98 advanced by the majority \u201coperate[d] principally upon a suspect class composed of those prisoners too indigent to provide bail during the pendency of the extradition proceeding.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 329 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). As Justice Shea acknowledged, however, Johnson was not a member of that purported class because his incarceration during the extradition proceedings resulted from a denial of bail and not from his inability to post bail. Id., 337 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). There also was nothing in the record of <em>Johnson </em>to establish that Johnson was indigent. Id., 319 n.10. In view of the fact that Johnson had remained in jail in Florida because he was denied bail and not because he was indigent, the majority in <em>Johnson </em>did not have occasion to address the issue of whether its interpretation of \u00a7 18-98 might render it unconstitutional as applied to an indigent petitioner who is unable to post bail in the asylum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Although the petitioner in the present case urges us to adopt the reasoning of Justice Shea\u2019s dissent, the petitioner has not established that he was indigent when he was arrested and incarcerated in Massachusetts. Furthermore, neither the record of the present case nor the record of the petitioner\u2019s underlying criminal case contains any indication as to whether bail was set or denied in Massachusetts. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 568, 580 n.15, 587 A.2d 116 (1991) (this court may take judicial notice of files of Superior Court in same or other cases). Because the petitioner has not demonstrated that his failure to obtain release while contesting extradition was the result of indigency, we, like the majority in <em>Johnson, </em>do not address the constitutionality of denying statutory presentence credit to a prisoner whose indigency makes it impossible for him or her to post bail in the asylum state while challenging extradition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\"> The petitioner also notes that \u00a7 18-98d, unlike \u00a7 18-98, contains no language requiring the supervising officer of the correctional center at which the detainee is confined to certify the number of days of the detainee\u2019s confinement. The petitioner, however, has failed to articulate any reason, and we are aware of none, why the absence of that language bears upon the issue of statutory interpretation raised by the petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The petitioner further notes that, under \u00a7 18-98, which authorizes day-for-day credit for presentence confinement but not good time credit for such confinement, a detainee may not receive presentence credit unless he \u201chas conformed to the rules of the institution [at which he is detained]\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 18-98; whereas, under \u00a7 18-98d, only presentence good time credit is conditioned upon a detainee\u2019s adherence to the rules of the institution. See General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (b). Again, however, the petitioner has not explained why this distinction supports his claim, and we do not see how it does so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b892-8\"> Moreover, the petitioner was not otherwise under the control of the commissioner while he was incarcerated in Massachusetts. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 317-18 and n.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b892-9\"> We note that the commissioner has statutory authority to transfer inmates to out-of-state facilities. E.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-87, 18-102 and 18-106. As the court in <em>Johnson </em>suggested, any pretrial detainee who has been transferred to an out-of-state facility is entitled to presentence credit for the time that he or she was confined in that facility pending trial. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 317-18 and n.9 (transfer under \u00a7 18-102). The court in <em>Johnson </em>reasoned that the commissioner\u2019s use of this statutory authority did not undermine the court\u2019s reliance on the plain language of \u00a7 18-98 in ascertaining the meaning of that statutory section. See id. We agree with this reasoning, which is equally applicable to our construction of \u00a7 18-98d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\"> Of course, pretrial detainees who have been transferred by the commissioner to an out-of-state facility do receive presentence credit for the time that they are incarcerated outside this state under the commissioner\u2019s transfer authority. Before deciding to exercise his authority to transfer a pretrial detainee to a particular out-of-state institution, however, the commissioner has the opportunity to gather information concerning, inter alia, the rules and regulations of the out-of-state institution, the enforcement of those rules and regulations, and the extent to which the institution is prepared to apprise the commissioner of the detainee\u2019s compliance with institutional rules and regulations. No similar opportunity is available to the commissioner when, as in the present case, the pretrial detainee is incarcerated in an out-of-state facility simply because he was arrested in another state on a fugitive warrant issued by this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b895-7\"> Established principles of stare decisis also militate against the petitioner\u2019s claim. As we frequently have stated, \u201c[t]he doctrine of stare decisis counsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. . . . Stare decisis is justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency. . . . It is the most important application of a theory of decisionmaking consistency in our legal culture and it is an obvious manifestation of the notion that decisionmaking consistency itself has normative value.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>George </em>v. <em>Ericson, </em>250 Conn. 312, 318, 736 A.2d 889 (1999). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n assessing the force of stare decisis, our case law has emphasized that we should be especially cautious about overturning a case that concerns statutory construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 202, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b896-8\"> See also footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b896-9\"> In support of his claim, the petitioner notes that four of the seven panel members who comprised the two different, five member panels of this court in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>expressed the view that construing \u00a7 18-98 to deny presentence credit to the petitioners in those cases rendered \u00a7 18-98 unconstitutional. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 577 <em>(Peters, C. J., </em>with whom, <em>Santaniello, J., </em>joined, concurring) (agreeing with Justice Shea\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Johnson)-, Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 328 <em>(Shea, J., </em>with whom, <em>Satter, J., </em>joined, dissenting). Although neither of the petitioners prevailed in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>it is true that a collective majority of the panel members assigned to those two cases, namely, Chief Justice Peters, Justices Shea and Santaniello, and Judge Satter, were persuaded by the merits of the claims raised by the two petitioners in those cases. We agree with the petitioner that the views expressed by the various panel members in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>militate in favor of a careful review of the constitutional issues addressed by this court in those two cases and raised by the petitioner in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\"> Thus, \u201c[t]o implicate the equal protection [clause] ... it is necessary that the state statute [or statutory scheme] in question, either on its face or in practice, treat persons standing in the same relation to it differently. . . . [Consequently], the analytical predicate [of consideration of an equal protection claim] is a determination of who are the persons similarly situated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>City Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 Conn. 429, 448, 778 A.2d 77 (2001). In the present case, the petitioner describes the similarly situated persons as those pretrial detainees like the petitioner, who are incarcerated in another state on Connecticut charges while contesting extradition to this state, on the one hand, and those pretrial detainees who are incarcerated in this state while awaiting trial, on the other hand. We assume, without deciding, that these two groups are similarly situated for equal protection purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\"> Courts have held that the equal protection clause entitles a defendant to presentence confinement credit if the defendant is held for a bailable offense, is unable to make bail as a result of his indigency and receives the statutory maximum sentence for that offense. See, e.g., <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Dugger, </em>833 F.2d 253, 255-56 (11th Cir. 1987); <em>Hook </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>496 F.2d 1172, 1173-74 (9th Cir. 1974). The rule of these cases is predicated upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 240-41, 244, 90 S. Ct. 2018, 26 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1970), that, the equal protection clause prohibits a state from incarcerating a person for longer than the statutory maximum prison term on the basis of his or her inability to pay a fine because of indigency. See <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Dugger, </em>supra, 256; <em>Hook </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 1173-74. Although Justice Shea, in his dissenting opinion in <em>Johnson, </em>relied principally on this line of cases in urging a construction of \u00a7 18-98 that authorizes presentence credit for the period of time during which an indigent pretrial detainee is incarcerated in another state while contesting extradition to this state; see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 338-39 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting); the holdings of those cases were not directly applicable to Johnson\u2019s claim because Johnson was denied bail in the asylum state. Id., 319 n.10. The petitioner in the present case likewise has failed to establish that bond was set and that he failed to post it as a result of indigency. Consequently, the petitioner, like Johnson, cannot avail himself of the rule set forth in the foregoing cases that is predicated on the holding in <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Several other courts have held that an indigent defendant is constitutionally entitled to presentence credit if he was unable to post bond even though he did not receive the maximum sentence. See, e.g., <em>Faye </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>541 F.2d 665, 668-69 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>King </em>v. <em>Wyrick, </em>516 F.2d 321, 323, 325 (8th Cir. 1975). We note, however, that Justice Shea did not articulate this view in his dissent in <em>Johnson, </em>and the petitioner himself has raised no such claim in the present case. Indeed, this line of cases provides no support for the petitioner\u2019s equal protection claim because he has failed to establish that he was unable to post bail as a result of indigency. See footnote 14 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\"> Of course, in circumstances in which a detainee has no constitutional or statutory entitlement to credit for a period of pretrial incarceration, as in the present case, the sentencing judge nevertheless has the inherent discretionary authority, in fashioning an appropriate sentence, to credit the detainee with any such period of pretrial incarceration. There is nothing in the record of the present case, however, to indicate whether the trial court considered that four month period at sentencing. We assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the trial court, did not consider that four month period. Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Prast, </em>548 F.2d 699, 703 (7th Cir. 1977) (unless state established that sentencing judge had given credit to defendant for period that defendant was incarcerated prior to trial, calculation of defendant\u2019s sentence must include credit for such incarceration). But cf. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>498 F.2d 625, 627 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 963, 95 S. Ct. 1951, 44 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1975) (in cases \u201cin which the sentence imposed plus time spent in pre-sentence custody totals less than the maximum for the offense, there is a conclusive presumption that the sentencing judge gave [the defendant] credit for the pre-sentence custody\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b902-7\"> In his dissent in <em>Johnson, </em>Justice Shea relied on <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 540, 363 A.2d 1063 (1975), to support his contention that denying Johnson credit under \u00a7 18-98 violated the equal protection clause. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 339 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). In <em>Laden, </em>this court held that the equal protection clause prohibited the state from denying statutory presentence confinement credit to an <em>indigent </em>defendant who had failed to conform to the rules of the institution. See <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 540, 549. Because our conclusion in <em>Laden </em>apparently was predicated on the petitioner\u2019s indigency; see id., 543-4; our holding therein does not bear on our resolution of the issues presented by this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b904-6\"> Of course, if a pretrial detainee who is incarcerated in the asylum state is successful in defeating extradition, he will be released from custody in that state. His release under those circumstances, however, is merely a necessary consequence of his successful extradition challenge, which, as we have explained, is the essential purpose of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the extradition context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-166 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person arrested upon [an arrest] warrant shall be delivered over to the agent whom the executive authority demanding him has appointed to receive him unless he is first taken forthwith before a judge of any court having criminal jurisdiction in this state, who shall inform him of the demand made for his surrender and of the crime with which he is charged, and that he has the right to demand and procure legal counsel; and if the prisoner or his counsel states that he or they desire to test the legality of his arrest, the judge of such court shall fix a reasonable time to be allowed him within which to apply for a writ of habeas corpus. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b905-8\"> As we have indicated, this general rule is subject to one or more exceptions.
