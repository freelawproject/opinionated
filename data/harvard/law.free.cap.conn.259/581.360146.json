We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 26, 1994, at approximately 8:35 p.m., the defendant, Luis Carrasco, arrived at a housing project in Hartford and attempted to sell to the victim, Jose Vasquez Molina, a bundle of napkins assembled to resemble a package of heroin. An argument over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>payment for the package erupted, a scuffle ensued, and the defendant fatally shot the victim once in the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The record reveals the following relevant procedural history. The state charged the defendant in a substitute information with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and criminal use of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-216.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The defendant pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and elected a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Jury selection commenced on September 27, 1999. Eight venire panels were drawn from the Hartford judicial district, from which twelve jurors and three alternates ultimately were selected to serve on the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When each panel was first brought into the courtroom, the trial court provided the venirepersons with the names of the parties, the attorneys, and the potential witnesses, and requested that any venireperson who believed that this information would compromise his or her ability to serve impartially alert the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">On October 5,1999, in response to these instructions, a venireperson on the fifth panel, R.R.,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> raised his hand. R.R., a Hispanic male, was the first Hispanic venireperson who was eligible to serve on the defendant\u2019s jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, during individual voir dire, R.R. explained that he had raised his hand because he thought that he had read about the crime in the newspaper when the incident first occurred, that the defendant \u201clook[ed] familiar\u201d to him and that, although he had \u201cnever met him,\u201d he had \u201cseen [the defendant] most likely in the streets.\u201d R.R. further indicated that his recollection of the crime from the newspaper would not affect his ability to be impartial and that, although he recognized the defendant \u201cin a positive way,\u201d \u201cif he\u2019s guilty, he\u2019s guilty . . . .\u201d Thereafter, R.R. returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the jury room, and the state asserted that R.R. should be excused for cause. The defendant disagreed, and the court ordered that R.R. return the following day for further questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">When voir dire of R.R. resumed the next day, he stated that he had thought overnight about his familiarity with the defendant and thought that he may have known the defendant\u2019s family approximately twenty-seven or twenty-eight years prior. He further elaborated that this knowledge would \u201cmake it a little bit harder\u201d to return a guilty verdict, but that if the state proved its case, he \u201c[didn\u2019t] think it [would] take [him] out of [his] actual duty as a juror to convict [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Thereafter, R.R. again retired to the jury room. The defendant stated that R.R. was an acceptable juror, but the state exercised a peremptory challenge to remove him. The defendant challenged the state\u2019s exercise pursuant to <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 96-98, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), claiming that R.R. was \u201cthe first Hispanic venireperson that [the parties had] questioned and that . . . there just [hadn\u2019t] been enough people up to [that] point ... to take a chance on letting [R.R.] go.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state asserted that R.R.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>admission that he might have more difficulty returning a guilty verdict because he possibly had known the defendant\u2019s family undermined R.R.\u2019s impartiality, thereby motivating the state\u2019s decision to remove him from the panel. The trial court concluded that the state\u2019s peremptory challenge was race neutral, and overruled the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge. The court then called R.R. back to the courtroom and excused him from jury service in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Jury selection concluded on October 15, 1999. The petit jury was comprised of one white male, four white females, one Hispanic male, one Hispanic female, and two males and three females of unidentified race and ethnicity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the unidentified jurors were not Hispanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The jury returned a verdict finding the defendant guilty of felony murder, criminal use of a firearm, and the lesser included offense of attempted robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See footnotes 2 through 5 of this opinion. The trial court vacated the conviction of criminal use of a firearm; see footnote 5 of this opinion; and rendered a judgment of guilty of felony murder and attempted robbery in the first degree, sentencing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>defendant to a total effective term of forty-eight years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the fair cross section requirement pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution is broader than that under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that his state constitutional right to a venire panel composed of a representative cross section of the community extends to the petit jury. The defendant claims, therefore, that this court should reverse his conviction because the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge to remove R.R., the first Hispanic male venireperson who was eligible to serve, deprived the defendant of a fair opportunity to select a jury composed of a representative cross section of the community.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The defendant concedes that he did not assert this claim before the trial court and, therefore, may prevail on this claim only if he satisfies the criteria established by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>inadequate for our review and, accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the first prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the removal of R.R. improperly deprived him of a fair opportunity to select a petit jury composed of a representative cross section of the community necessarily is predicated on two legal assumptions: (1) that the defendant has a right under our state constitution to a petit jury comprised of a representative cross section of the community; and (2) that the fair cross section to which the defendant is entitled includes a certain number of Hispanic males. Therefore, before we consider the general issue of whether the fair cross section requirement under our state constitution extends to the petit jury, and, accordingly, the more specific issue of whether the removal of R.R. deprived the defendant of a petit jury composed of a fair cross section, we first must consider the narrower question of whether the defendant has established that the fair cross section to which he claims he is entitled necessarily includes a certain number of Hispanic males.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In order to establish a violation of his right to a fair cross section of the community, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating the following: \u201c(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018distinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\u201d <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1979); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>254 Conn. 578, 588, 758 A.2d 327 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 450, 680 A.2d 147 (1996). In accordance with the first prong of this test, therefore, the defendant must demonstrate that Hispanic males constitute a distinctive group for purposes of fair cross section analysis. While this court previously has held that Hispanic persons, in general, comprise a distinctive group; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>supra, 588; we have never so held with the respect to the subcategory of Hispanic males, in particular. \u201cWhile there is no precise definition of the term distinctive group . . . such a group must have, first, some factor which defines and limits the group; second, a basic similarity in attitudes or ideas or experience which is present in members of the group and which cannot be adequately represented if the group is excluded from the jury selection process; and third, there must be a possibility that exclusion of the group will result in partiality or bias on the part of juries hearing cases in which group members are involved.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>220 Conn. 487, 496-97, 600 A.2d 738 (1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1207, 112 S. Ct. 3000, 120 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In the present case, the defendant fails to allege directly that Hispanic males are a distinctive group.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the record reveals no evidence, particularly no statistical or sociological data, demonstrating that Hispanic males share experiences, ideas or attitudes so distinct from Hispanic persons, in general, that their underrepresentation as jurors would tend to result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>bias and partiality on the part of juries hearing cases. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant has failed to satisfy his evidentiary burden under the first prong of the <em>Duren </em>test.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the defendant had established that Hispanic males constitute a distinctive group for fair cross section purposes, the defendant has failed to meet his evidentiary burden with respect to both the second and third prongs of the <em>Duren </em>test. The defendant has not proffered any evidence of the size of the class of Hispanic males in the Hartford judicial district. Therefore, we have no basis upon which to conclude whether the representation of Hispanic males in this case was unfair and unreasonable in relation to their representation in the community. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 422, 481 A.2d 56 (1984) (prima facie showing of fair cross section violation successfully established through use of voter registration lists demonstrating proportions of Hispanic persons eligible to serve relative to Hispanic persons residing in relevant community) with <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 452 (fair cross section claim based on lack of affluent individuals failed for lack of sufficient evidence when defendant did not present evidence of number of affluent individuals residing in relevant community) and <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>218 Conn. 309, 316-17, 589 A.2d 343 (1991) (fair cross section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>claim for lack of Jewish jury members failed for lack of sufficient evidence when defendant did not present evidence of number of Jewish persons residing in particular judicial district). Similarly, the defendant has failed to allege or to provide evidence that Hispanic males have been excluded systematically in the jury selection process. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 498 (allegation of systematic exclusion insufficient without proof that questionable selection procedure actually followed); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 317 (claim of systematic exclusion failed for lack of sufficient evidence when defendant could have, but failed to, offer evidence that Jewish persons, in fact, postponed jury service because of Passover).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of making an adequate record to support a challenge to a jury array. . . . A challenge to a jury array will fail if the defendant presents no evidence to the court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 496. Moreover, \u201c[a] representation by counsel does not meet this evidentiary requirement.\u201d Id. In the absence of evidence that the fair cross section to which the defendant claims he is entitled includes a requisite number of Hispanic males, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge to remove R.R., the first Hispanic male venireperson eligible to serve, deprived him of a representative cross section of the community on his petit jury in violation of our state constitution must fail under <em>Golding </em>for want of an adequate record.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-11\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to . . . trial by an impartial jury. . . .\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>251 Conn. 671, 697, 741 A.2d 913 (1999) (stating article first, \u00a7 8, of Connecticut constitution encompasses American tradition of trial by jury, which contemplates impartial jury drawn from cross section of community).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, sexual assault in the first degree, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime: (1) Causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; or (2) is armed with a deadly weapon; or (3) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or (4) displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-216 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal use of a firearm or electronic defense weapon when he commits any class A, B or C or unclassified felony as defined in section 53a-25 and in the commission of such felony he uses or threatens the use of a pistol, revolver, machine gun, shotgun, rifle or other firearm or electronic defense weapon.
