We answer the first certified question in the affirmative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The named plaintiff, David Israel (plaintiff),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> brought this breach of contract action individually and as personal representative of the estate of his wife, Susan Israel, in the Superior Court after the defendants, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, denied the plaintiffs claim for underinsured motorist benefits. The defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The District Court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants, from which the plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals then certified two questions of law to this court, which we accepted. See footnote 2 of this opinion. We conclude that the insurance policy in question is ambiguous and, therefore, we construe the policy so as to afford the plaintiff underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The following stipulated facts are relevant to our resolution of the certified questions. The plaintiff was injured, and his wife was killed, when their automobile, which he was driving and in which his wife was a passenger, collided with a vehicle driven by an underinsured motorist. The underinsured motorist had automobile liability insurance, but his coverage fell short of fully compensating the plaintiff and the estate of his wife. Following exhaustion of the underinsured motorist\u2019s coverage, the plaintiff filed a claim for underinsured motorist benefits under a personal liability umbrella insurance policy issued by the defendants to the plaintiffs mother, with whom he lived on a part-time basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants denied the claim because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>inter alia, the plaintiff had failed to maintain underlying uninsured motorist coverage on his automobile, as allegedly required by his mother\u2019s insurance policy. The plaintiff thereafter initiated the underlying litigation and appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review that governs our resolution of the certified question. \u201c[Construction of a contract of insurance presents a question of law for the court which this court reviews de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>239 Conn. 537, 543, 687 A.2d 1262 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The issue that we must resolve is whether the umbrella policy issued by the defendants is ambiguous because it is inconsistent regarding the consequences of the plaintiffs failure to maintain the underlying coverage required by the policy. Specifically, we must decide if the policy is ambiguous as to whether such failure vitiates the umbrella coverage, or merely results in the insured being personally responsible for the amount of the required underlying coverage before the umbrella coverage takes effect. We conclude that the policy is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The policy at issue in the present case consists of four parts: a nine page booklet entitled \u201cPersonal Liability Umbrella Policy\u201d (umbrella booklet), an addendum to that booklet entitled \u201cUninsured Motor Vehicle Coverage\u201d (uninsured addendum), a declarations page, and four pages of endorsements. The umbrella booklet provides in relevant part: \u201cYOUR DUTIES TO US. These are things you must do for us. We may not provide coverage if you refuse to .... 4. maintain your under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>lying insurance. All insurance listed in the Declarations must be maintained at all times. The limits listed in the Declarations are the minimum you must maintain. <em>If the required underlying limits are not maintained, you will be responsible for the underlying limit amount of any loss. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The uninsured addendum provides in relevant part as follows: \u201cCoverage U\u2014Uninsured Motor Vehicle . . . These conditions apply: 1. You must maintain underlying limits for uninsured motorist motor vehicle coverage equal to the limits listed in the Declarations. <em>If these underlying limits are not maintained, this coverage will not apply. . . . </em>All other provisions of this policy apply.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The plaintiff claims that these provisions conflict, creating an uncertainty as to the status of the umbrella coverage when the underlying coverage is not maintained and rendering the policy ambiguous. The plaintiff therefore claims that the policy must be construed so as to provide him with coverage. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Our analysis of the language of the insurance contract is governed by the well established principle of insurance law that \u201cpolicy language will be construed as laymen would understand it and not according to the interpretation of sophisticated underwriters, and that ambiguities in contract documents are resolved against the party responsible for its drafting; the policyholder\u2019s expectations should be protected as long as they are objectively reasonable from the layman\u2019s point of view. . . . The premise behind the rule is simple. The party who actually does the writing of an instrument will presumably be guided by his own interests and goals in the transaction. He may choose shadings of expression, words more specific or more imprecise, according to the dictates of these interests. ... A further, related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>rationale for the rule is that [s]ince one who speaks or writes, can by exactness of expression more easily prevent mistakes in meaning, than one with whom he is dealing, doubts arising from ambiguity are resolved in favor of the latter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 544. This canon, commonly styled contra proferentem, is more rigorously applied in the context of insurance contracts than in other contracts. Id., 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The doctrine of contra proferentem applies, however, only if we conclude that the language of the insurance policy is ambiguous. Thus, we must decide whether, reading the policy \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable layperson in the position of the purchaser of the policy,\u201d the policy is ambiguous. <em>Ceci </em>v. <em>National Indemnity Co., </em>225 Conn. 165, 168, 622 A.2d 545 (1993). In construing the document, we \u201clook at the [policy] as a whole, consider all relevant portions together and, if possible, give operative effect to every provision in order to reach a reasonable overall result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 545-46. Utilizing this approach, we conclude that the policy language is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The \u201cYour Duties to Us\u201d provision of the umbrella booklet and the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section of the uninsured addendum provide the defendants with inconsistent remedies for the plaintiffs failure to maintain the requisite underlying insurance on his automobile. The first provision indicates that in the event of an insured\u2019s failure to maintain underlying coverage, the insured will be responsible for any loss up to the amount of the required underlying coverage before the umbrella coverage takes effect. The latter provision provides that the insured forfeits umbrella coverage completely if he or she does not maintain the requisite underlying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The language of the policy does not resolve this conflict in any manner that is comprehensible to a lay insured. It simply is unclear from the language of the policy whether the provision of the umbrella booklet or the section of the uninsured addendum is controlling in the event of an insured\u2019s failure to maintain the necessary underlying coverage. Thus, it is not possible to give effect to both of these provisions in a manner that resolves the ambiguity created by the policy language. \u201c[L]eaving a layperson to sort out the ambiguities and misleading inconsistencies in the present policy is precisely the problem that the rules of insurance policy construction were designed to avoid.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 546-47. We therefore conclude that the conflict between the language in the \u201cYour Duties to Us\u201d provision of the umbrella booklet and the language in the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section of the uninsured addendum renders the policy ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The defendants concede that the umbrella booklet provision applies generally to the entire policy, including the uninsured addendum. They claim, however, that because the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section of the uninsured addendum is an endorsement, it controls other, more general policy provisions. We reject the defendants\u2019 argument because we disagree with their assertion that the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section is an endorsement. It is clear from the text of the policy that when the defendants issued a policy endorsement, they explicitly labeled the endorsement as such. There are two endorsements in the policy at issue in the present case, and they are entitled, respectively, \u201cPolicy Endorsement\u201d and \u201cAmendatory Endorsement.\u201d In accordance with then-status as policy endorsements, these sections clearly and unambiguously indicate to the reader that then-terms supersede other terms in the policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In contrast, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the word endorsement does not appear in the uninsured addendum, and the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section of that addendum in no way suggests that its terms control over other policy terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The defendants further argue that, even if the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section of the uninsured addendum is not an endorsement, the language of that section clearly indicates to the reader that the condition contained therein is specific to that section and thus controls over the more general \u201cYour Duties to Us\u201d provision in the umbrella booklet. Specifically, the defendants claim that the following language unambiguously indicates that the conditions contained in the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section control over more general policy provisions: <em>\u201cThese conditions apply: </em>1. You must maintain underlying limits for uninsured [motorist] motor vehicle coverage equal to the limits listed in the Declarations. If these underlying limits are not maintained, this coverage will not apply. . . . <em>All other provisions of this policy apply.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In advancing this argument, the defendants rely upon the well established principle of contractual interpretation that \u201cthe particular language of a contract must prevail over the general.\u201d <em>Miller Bros. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>113 Conn. 504, 514, 155 A. 709 (1931). This canon is of no help to the defendants in the present case, however, because the language upon which the defendants rely does not support the claim that the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section of the uninsured addendum is \u201cspecific.\u201d Indeed, the use of the phrase \u201c[a]ll other provisions of this policy apply,\u201d without accompanying language indicating that the provisions of the \u201cCoverage U\u201d section control over other generally applicable policy provisions, exacerbates the ambiguity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>by seemingly giving effect to the conflicting language in the umbrella booklet, leaving no basis for the plaintiff to determine which provision is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Because we conclude that the policy language is ambiguous, the doctrine of contra proferentem properly is applicable. Thus, we must construe the policy in a manner that affords coverage to the insured. See <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The first certified question that we were asked to answer is: \u201cWhere an umbrella insurance policy providing uninsured motorist coverage states that (1) coverage will not apply if underlying insurance is not maintained; (2) coverage may not be provided if the insured fails to maintain underlying coverage; and (3) if underlying coverage is not maintained, the insured will be responsible for the underlying limit amount of any loss, is the policy ambiguous as to whether it completely denies uninsured motorist coverage to an insured who fails to maintain underlying insurance or whether in that event it only requires the insured to bear responsibility for the loss up to the underlying limit amount, and should the policy therefore be interpreted to provide umbrella uninsured motorist coverage in whole or in part to an insured who has failed to maintain underlying coverage?\u201d Our answer is: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">No costs shall be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199b, the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, provides in relevant part,: \u201c(d) The Supreme Court may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States ... if the answer maybe determinative of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court and if there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute of this state. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-10\"> The Second Circuit Court of Appeals asked this court to answer the following two questions: (1) \u201cWhere an umbrella insurance policy providing uninsured motorist coverage states that (1) coverage will not apply if underlying insurance is not maintained; (2) coverage may not be provided if the insured fails to maintain underlying coverage; and (3) if underlying coverage is not maintained, the insured will be responsible for the underlying limit amount of any loss, is the policy ambiguous as to whether it completely denies uninsured motorist coverage to an insured who fails to maintain underlying insurance or whether in that event it only requires the insured to bear responsibility for the loss up to the underlying limit amount, and should the policy therefore be interpreted to provide umbrella uninsured motorist coverage in whole or in part to an insured who has failed to maintain underlying coverage?\u201d (2) \u201cWhere the declarations page of an insurance policy states, \u2018If this policy is terminated we will give you and the Mortgagee/ Lienholder written notice in compliance with the policy or as required by law\u2019 and the definitions section of the policy defines \u2018you\u2019 as any insured, is the policy ambiguous as to whether \u2018you\u2019 refers to the named insured only or to all insureds and should the policy therefore be interpreted to require only the named insured to maintain underlying insurance?\u201d <em>Israel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>v. <em>State Farm, Mutual Automobile Ins.
