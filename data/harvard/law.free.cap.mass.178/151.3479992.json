Writ dated March 16,1895.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-9\">The defendant was the proprietor of a place of amusement in Boston called the Grand Dime Museum. On his application the Board of Police Commissioners of the city of Boston had appointed one Mead, by whom the assault was alleged to have been committed, a special police officer under St. 1878, c. 244, \u00a7 6, to serve without pay from the city. The defendant had given to the city treasurer the bond required by the section named, to be liable to parties aggrieved by any official misconduct of such police officer to the same extent as for the torts of agents and servants in his employment. The section provides that \u201c proceedings may be had upon said bonds in the same manner as upon the bonds of constables.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-10\">At a previous stage of this case, in a decision reported in 171 Mass. 263, this court decided that Mead was not the servant of the defendant. After that decision the plaintiff amended his declaration by adding a second count setting forth the facts about the appointment of Mead as a special police officer and the giving of the bond by the defendant, and alleging that Mead under said appointment and while in the discharge of his.duties as such officer assaulted the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>At a new trial in the Superior Court, <em>Maynard, </em>J. ruled that on the evidence the action could not be maintained on either count.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkqR\">This is an action of tort against the keeper of a place of amusement in Boston, seeking to make him liable for alleged official misconduct of a special police officer upon his premises. The first count is for an assault and battery on the plaintiff, treating the special policeman as the defendant\u2019s servant. That- was disposed of when this case was here before. 171 Mass. 263. There was no evidence put in or offered which tended to show that the officer was acting as the defendant\u2019s servant apart from the statute. After the decision by this court the plaintiff added another count setting forth the appointment of the special police officer on the defendant\u2019s written application and bond, (under St. 1878, c. 244, \u00a7 6, now repealed, St. 1898, c. 282, \u00a7 4,) and alleging an assault and battery by the officer while in the discharge of his duties in the defendant\u2019s theatre. In other words the plaintiff attempted to evade the former decision by a slight change in the words of his declaration, .and by suggesting that although the police officer was not the defendant\u2019s servant the defendant was liable for his official misconduct to the same extent as if he were. The scope of our decision was wider, and disposes of the new count as well as of the old one. The only remedy against the defendant for the misconduct as such is on his bond. Whether or not it is necessary to get a judgment against the police officer before proceeding upon the bond, as in the case of a Boston constable, (St. 1814, c. 165; <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>7 Allen, 387,) there is no such necessity for a judgment against the defendant, and, as we once before have decided, there is no ground for a judgment against him in the act.
