Mansfield mortgaged the house and lot in question to the respondent, Charles J. Mansfield, her son, and on February 20, 1896, leased the same property for eighty-eight years to the respondent, Joanna F. Mansfield, wife of Charles J. All of the instruments mentioned were recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">Charles J. Mansfield was not in possession of the property as mortgagee, and had only such rights as were given him by his mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">The rent was paid to the petitioners by Mary A. Mansfield, under the indenture of April 1, 1885, up to the time of the taking hereafter mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">On January 5,1897, the Boston Terminal Company, acting under the provisions of St. 1896, c. 516, took the property for the South Terminal Station, and by agreement of all the parties deposited $9,000, as compensation for the property, to be disposed of according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\">It was agreed that the parties to this proceeding stood in the same relation to this sum as though it had been awarded by a jury as entire damages. The respondents contended that the above named sum should be apportioned as provided by Pub. Sts. c. 49, \u00a7\u00a7 20-25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">The petitioners filed the following objections to the decree of the Probate Court dismissing their petition : \u201c 1. They were, at the time of the taking mentioned in their petition, the owners of the property mentioned therein, and the remainder or reversion in fee belonged to them. 2. The respondent Mary A. Mansfield had, at the time of said taking, an estate for years in said property. 3. No other person or persons had, at the same time, any estate or interest in said property. 4. The facts alleged and proved present a case for the appointment of a trustee, as provided in chapter 49 of the Public Statutes, secs. 18,19. 5. The parties cannot agree upon the choice of such trustee.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-10\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0C\">This is a petition to the Probate Court under Pub. Sts. c. 49, \u00a7 19, for the appointment of a trustee to receive the sum paid by the Boston Terminal Company for the taking of certain land under St. 1896, c. 516, and to hold the said sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>for the benefit of the parties according to Pub. Sts. c. 49, \u00a7 18. The Probate Court dismissed the petition, and the petitioners appealed. The case was reported by a single justice to the full court. It is not denied that these sections of the Public Statutes are adopted by reference. Sts. 1896, c. 516, \u00a7 23. Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 95, 100, 107. But it is denied that the petitioners have a standing under them because it is denied that they have any property in the land taken. It is contended further that if the petitioners are entitled to any interest in the said sum there should be an apportionment under Pub. Sts. c. 49, \u00a7 22, instead of a trust under \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The petitioners demised the premises for one hundred years to one Wheeler, without words of inheritance, reserving a certain rent. There was given also a perpetual right of renewal at the choice of the tenants, with provision for fixing the rent which never was to be less than that originally reserved. Wheeler conveyed to the respondent Mary A. Mansfield, who made a mortgage\" and sublease. The respondents contend that Wheeler took a base fee, leaving in the petitioners a mere possibility of reverter, or right of re-entry, citing <em>Jamaica Pond Aqueduct, </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>9 Allen, 159, 167, <em>Robb </em>v. <em>Beaver, </em>8 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 107, and <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>16 Ohio St. 478. But in those cases the so called leases contained words of inheritance in the habendum, and it does not need argument' or authority to show that an instrument like the present cannot convey a fee at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The only argument needing consideration is based on Pub. Sts. c. 121, \u00a7 1, and that may be disposed of in a few words. The earlier part-of the section provides, that when land is demised for a term of one hundred years or more, the term, so long as fifty years of it remain unexpired, shall be regarded as an estate in fee simple as to everything concerning its descent and various other incidents not affecting this case. The section then ends with the words, \u201c and whoever holds as lessee or assignee under such a lease shall, so long as fifty years of the term are unexpired, be regarded as a freeholder for all purposes.\u201d But this does not give the lessee a fee, it simply gives to his interest a dignity and quality equal to a life estate. It is not intended to destroy or impair the reversion.of the lessor or to make it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>any degree less an estate than it was before. The respondents\u2019 principal contention seems to us entirely unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\">The deed of Wheeler to Mansfield did contain words of inheritance, and it might possibly be argued, although it was not, that this was a disseisin of the petitioners, and that if the petitioners were disseised they had no standing to make a claim against this fund. We mention the suggestion simply to show that it was not overlooked. Taking the deed as a whole, and seeing that it conveyed the premises subject to the rent reserved, and covenanted that the grantor was \u201c seised in leasehold,\u201d we are of opinion that it should be construed as a conveyance of the interest created by the demise rather than as \"one wrongful and paramount to it, the language suggestive of a fee being used pretty evidently merely to express the effects of the statute just cited, as to long terms. See <em>Hollenbeck </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>112 Mass. 247, 249, 250.</p>\n<p id=\"Axg\">When the petitioners are shown to stand as at common law, owners of a reversion subject to a term, they present the case expressly contemplated by Pub. Sts. c. 49, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 19, and their right is made out. The provisions for apportionment in \u00a7\u00a7 20, 22, are confined to estates other than and different from those for which provision is made in \u00a7 18. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>121 Mass. 453. The existence of a sublease of a part of the term made by the tenant, <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>126 Mass. 384, or of a mortgage of her interest is not enough to throw the petitioners upon \u00a7 22. See also <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>126 Mass. 1; <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>149 Mass. 176. Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 108, refers, primarily at least, to a case where the landowner, not a tenant, has made a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">\n<em>Decree of Frob.ate Court reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
