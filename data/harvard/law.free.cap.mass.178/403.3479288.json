The petitioner moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The motion was denied by the judge, who made certain findings and allowed exceptions, whereon it was held by this court, in a decision given January 12, 1900, and reported in 175 Mass. 208, that it did not appear that the judge exceeded his powers in refusing a new trial. Thereafter, on February 3, 1900, the petitioner filed in the Superior Court another motion for a new trial, on the ground of newly discovered evidence, the nature of whibh was stated in his petition. On June 21, 1900, <em>Fessenden, </em>J., overruled this motion and amended his former findings, previously before this court, so that his second finding made upon the previous motion for a new trial should read as follows: I find \u201c If material and competent, that Jesse L. Nason, who testified as a witness at the trial of the above cause, did not, in August, 1895, see the petitioner\u2019s building, the value of which was a subject of inquiry at the trial; that he was mistaken in his testimony as to when he saw the buildings ; that he did see them before they were removed, and made memoranda concerning their dimensions and valuations; that the written memorandum or report made by said Nason to the City Solicitor was made in 1896 from the said memoranda; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>and that the date of the said report was afterwards changed so as to read 1895, and then delivered to said City Solicitor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-3\">From the order of June 21,1900, overruling the petitioner\u2019s motion for a new trial, and from the judgment of the Superior Court in the case, the petitioner appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-4\">At the argument of the case before this court, the respondent moved that the court impose upon the petitioner a sum to be taxed in the costs of the suit under Pub.
