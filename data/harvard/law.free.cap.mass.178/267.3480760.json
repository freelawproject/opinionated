J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">This is a petition to recover for the destruction of an established business, alleged to have been caused under the Metropolitan Water Supply Act, St. 1895, c. 488. The petition was filed in the Superior Court, and asked for a jury under \u00a7 13. It was dismissed on motion, for want of jurisdiction, and the case comes here on report. It is provided by \u00a7 14 that, if persons injured in this way cannot agree with the Metropolitan Water Board as to the amount of damages to be paid, \u201c such damages shall be determined and paid in the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ner hereinbefore provided.\u201d The question is whether the words quoted refer to the manner provided in \u00a7 14, which is a petition to the Supreme Judicial Court for a commission, or that specified in \u00a7 13, which is a petition to the Superior Court for a iury-</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">By \u00a7 12 the water board may agree with the party injured upon \u201c the damages sustained by any person ... in property by any taking of property or by any change of grade, . . . or by the construction, etc. ... or by the interference with the use of any water, or by any other act or thing done by said board under this act.\u201d It will be noticed that the words \u201c by any other act or thing\u201d refer back to and qualify \u201csustained by any person in property,\u201d in the same way as do the words \u201c by any taking of property\u201d and the succeeding clauses. The damage referred to throughout is damage sustained in property, and, it would seem, in property which can be taken by eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The act goes on to provide by \u00a7 13 that the parties, \u201c if they cannot agree upon any damages, sustained as aforesaid, may, except in the cases in which payment is otherwise provided for in this act, within two year\u2019s after the day of the taking of any. land, ... or of the use of any property, or of the making of any change of grade, ... or of the doing of any other act or tiling causing the damage,\u201d file a petition for a jury \u201c to determine such damages \u201d in the Superior Court. Here again it will be seen that all the broad and general words of the section are confined to \u201c damages, sustained as aforesaid.\u201d \u201c As aforesaid \u201d refers to \u00a7 13, and therefore the provisions of \u00a7 14 are confined to damages sustained in property. If then the statute stopped here the petitioners could not recover under the act. <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>3 Allen, 133, 141, 142. <em>Edmands </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>108 Mass. 535. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>168 Mass. 364. Lewis, Em. Dom. \u00a7 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The statute goes on in \u00a7 14 to provide for owners of land taken upon the Nashua River, or entered upon and used, or injured by the taking of the waters of the Nashua River, whether the land is within or without the Commonwealth, or of certain real estate in West Boylston, Boylston or Clinton, not taken but directly or indirectly decreased in value by the statute and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>doings under it. To these it gives a petition to the Supreme Judicial Court for a commission. Among other things \u201c said commissions shall determine the damage to and value of real estate, machinery and business, and from time to time report,\u201d etc. Then follows the clause giving the petitioners their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><em>\u201c </em>In case any individual or firm owning ... an established business on land in the town of West Boylston, whether the same shall be taken or not under this act, . . . shall deem that such business is decreased in value by the carrying out of this act, . . . and unable to agree with said board as to the amount of damages to be paid for such injury, such damages shall be determined and paid in the manner hereinbefore provided.\u201d It seems to us that this last clause is carrying on the thought of those that precede it. The immediately preceding clause had spoken of damage to business as a matter to be estimated by the commissioners, and this one goes on to provide for another case of damage to business. The earlier part of the section dealt with West Boylston, this continues to deal with it. It seems to ns pretty plain that as the section had provided for a commission before it is providing for a commission still.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">It is provided in \u00a7 15 that \u201c any persons whose property is taken under the right of eminent domain, or entered upon or injured by the taking of said water, if dissatisfied with any determination of damages made by any commission, may . . . claim a trial by jury.\u201d It is unnecessary to consider whether this provision extends to the petitioners\u2019 case. It cannot do so except upon the ground that destruction of business is made by the act a taking of property within its meaning, whatever might be the case in the absence of \u00a7 14. If that argument should prevail, which we do not intimate to be likely, of course it would impair if not destroy the argument based on the word <em>\u201c </em>property \u201d in \u00a7 12. But in \u00a7 13 there is an exception \u201c in the cases in which payment is otherwise provided for in this act,\u201d and if this does not refer to \u00a7 14 it has no satisfactory meaning at all. Taking the exception in \u00a7 13 and the juxtaposition of words in \u00a7 14, we are satisfied that \u201c hereinbefore\u201d means in \u00a7 14, that the petition should have been filed in the Supreme Judicial Court, and that it properly was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>jDecree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
