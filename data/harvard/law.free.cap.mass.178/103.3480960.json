Gentlemen : Please to execute for me a Steel Plate Engraving from photograph furnished of myself, for which I agree to pay to you or your order the sum of Three Hundred Dollars, upon the delivery to me of Fifteen India-Proof impressions from the plate; and I authorize you to copyright, print and insert the number of impressions required in the Portrait Gallery and Biographical Volume of the above-named work, after which the plate is to be delivered to me.

O. D. or otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-30\">At the trial it was agreed that, in pursuance of this contract, the plaintiff executed for the defendant a steel plate engraving from a photograph of the defendant furnished by the defendant, and delivered to the defendant fifteen India-proof impressions from the plate. The plate was never delivered to the defendant, and the plaintiff contended that he held the plate because he was not through using it for the purpose of new editions of the work in.which the plaintiff\u2019s portrait was published.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-36\">The portrait and biography of the defendant were not published in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry, which was a work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>complete in four volumes. The plaintiff testified that they were published in a volume which the plaintiff contended was the Portrait Gallery and Biographical Volume of that work, but in the title of this book there was no reference to Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-4\">It appeared that the following advertisement was published as a leaflet by the plaintiff: \u201c List of Brethren whose Portraits have already been engraved or are being engraved to appear in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry and Biographical Cyclopedia and Portrait Gallery of prominent Freemasons of the United States.\u201d Then followed a list of one hundred and two names, including that of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">The defendant testified: \u201cI did receive Vol. IV. of Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry, and there was no publication in their volume of my biography, nor was there any portrait, of any nature, of myself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-6\">An agent of the plaintiff testified: \u201c Mr. Brown often said to me that his portrait did not appear in the work for which it was intended; that his distinct understanding was that it was to appear in one of the volumes of Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-7\">In reference to this, I desire to- say that the original intention of Mr. Tors ton was to publish a volume to be entitled Portrait Gallery and Biographical Volume of Gould\u2019s. History of Freemasonry, to be uniform in size and binding with the aforesaid history, and to be complete in one volume: at my instance, however, the title of the work was changed, eliminating therefrom all reference to Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry, so that the title would appear Portrait Gallery with Biographical Sketches of Prominent Freemasons thoughout the United States, John C. Yorston &amp; Company, Publishers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-8\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant requested six rulings, of which the sixth was as follows: \u201c That if the contract stipulated that a biography of the defendant should be published in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry, it was not performed by a publication of the defendant\u2019s biography in some other book or volume, even though the same was similar in purpose and circulation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-9\">The judge, among other instructions to the jury, said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-10\">\u201c I think his [the defendant\u2019s] sixth request, that if the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tract stipulated that a biography of the defendant should be published in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry, it was not performed by a publication of the defendant\u2019s biography in some other book or volume, even though with the same or similar in purpose and circulation ; I think that is correct and that would be so, but the question is, whether the contract stipulates that. I have already stated that it seems to me the contract precedes that direction, and that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, upon the execution of the steel plate engraving photograph of himself, and the delivery to him of fifteen India-proof impressions from the plate. He says, you notice, 61 agree to pay you or your order the sum of three hundred dollars upon the delivery to me of fifteen India-proof impressions from the plate.\u2019 He does not say upon the delivery to me of those impressions <em>and </em>the delivery of the plate to me or the publication of those impressions in a <em>book; </em>he goes on and makes those directions afterwards. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">\u201c In addition to that, I want you to answer this question, as it may have some bearing upon the whole case: \u2018 Did the defendant with knowledge of all the facts, and especially the fact that the biography had not been published in that particular book, promise to pay the bill of $300 or to send a check for it?\u2019 ... I should like to have you, in addition to your verdict, answer that question yes-or no.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff and to the question asked them answered \u201c yes; \u201d and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-7\"><em>J. A. </em>Brackett, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-8\"><em>W. P. </em>Foster, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b124-9\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeC\">The order for the steel plate engraving, for which the defendant was to pay $300, was not given to an engraver but to a publisher; it was addressed to <em>\u201c </em>J. C. Yorston &amp; Co. Publishers \u201d ; it is competent for the defendant to refer to the plaintiff\u2019s own printed heading on the blank furnished by him to the defendant for use in making out the order, to show that the order was given to him as publisher of Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">This case is not like <em>Schenck </em>v. Saunders, 13 Gray, 37, which was followed by the Supreme Court of the United States in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Sturm </em>v. <em>Boker, </em>150 U. S. 812, relied on by the plaintiff; in those cases one of the parties sought to add to the terms of a contract which was clearly set forth in writing, by a statement in his own bill head, under which he had made out an invoice of the goods covered by the contract; in this case the defendant seeks to take advantage of the heading on the plaintiff\u2019s printed blank order, to show that the order was given to the plaintiff as publisher of Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The advertisement of the plaintiff, in which the defendant is named as one of the \u201c brethren whose portraits have already been engraved or are being engraved to appear in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry,\u201d was an act of the plaintiff which can be considered in construing this ambiguously written document. <em>Menage </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>175 Mass. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Taking these matters into consideration, we are of opinion that by the true construction of the written order, the steel plate engraving, for which the defendant was to pay \u00a7800, was to be made for the publication of the likeness of the defendant in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Were it not for the contention of the plaintiff to the contrary, it would be unnecessary to add that the plaintiff, on abandoning the publication of the defendant\u2019s likeness in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry, ended his right to recover the contract price. Cases like <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Ingersoll, </em>2 Pick. 292, and the first rule in the notes to <em>Pordage </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>1 Wms. Saund. 548, 550, have no application to a case where the plaintiff has abandoned all intention of performing his part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The plaintiff is not entitled to have a verdict entered for him by reason of the affirmative answer given by the jury to the question put to them. It would have been competent for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant accepted a publication of his likeness in the book, published by the plaintiff, from which all reference to Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry was eliminated, in place of a publication of it in that boob. But if he wished to recover on that ground, he had to convince the jury that the defendant, knowing that under the contract he had a right to have his likeness published in Gould\u2019s History accepted in place of it, a publication in the Portrait Gallery, from which all reference to Gould\u2019s History was eliminated. No such question was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>left to the jury in this case; on the contrary, they were told that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the contract price on executing the steel engraving and delivering to the defendant fifteen India-proof impressions from it, without a publication or an intended publication of the defendant\u2019s likeness in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry. After giving them that instruction the presiding justice asked the jury to answer the following question : \u201c Did the defendant, with knowledge of all the facts, and especially the fact that the biography had not been published in that particular book, promise to pay the bill of $300 or to send a check for it ? \u201d Though the j ury under these instructions answered that question in the affirmative, they have not found that the defendant with knowledge of his rights under the written order accepted a publication in the Portrait Gallery in place of a publication in Gould\u2019s History of Freemasonry, and that answer gives the plaintiff no right to recover the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
