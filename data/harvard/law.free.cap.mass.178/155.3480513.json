It was found as a fact by a judge sitting without a jury, that what the granddaughter did in and about the house was only to assist her grandmother, and that she had never agreed to pay rent and was not a party to any plan to defraud the lessor. <em>Meld, </em>that all requests for rulings as to the liability of the granddaughter for use and occupation of the premises jointly with her grandmother had been made immaterial by the findings of fact.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-8\">Contract against Fanny S. Whittle and Charler\u00eda D. Hoyt jointly and severally, for the use and occupation of a dwelling-house at 5 Walnut Street in Boston, for one year from September 1,1897, to August 31, 1898.

The grandmother had kept a boardinghouse for many years, and in 1892 first occupied the plaintiff\u2019s house, No. 5 Walnut Street. She executed a lease with the plaintiffs for five years and one month, which lease expired August 31, 1897. She used the house as a boarding-house for another year, having obtained an extension of the lease by an instrument under seal for that period of time, which was the period for which the plaintiffs sought to recover rent. The defendant Hoyt lived with her grandmother in the house during that year on terms of the closest intimacy, and helped her in the business to a certain extent. She was a teacher in a kindergarten school in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-10\">On July 2\u20199, 1896, the defendant Whittle gave to the defendant Hoyt a bill of sale which was recorded in the city clerk\u2019s office, conveying \u201c all the household goods, furniture and chattels in the house situate on Walnut Street, in said Boston, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>numbered 5 on said Walnut Street, owned by me, or in which I have any right, title or interest.

This lease was extended for one year by an instrument under seal signed by the lessors and lessee, which was virtually a new lease for that term. This action is to recover for the use and occupation of the premises during this year. The judge who tried the case without a jury found against the defendant Whittle. The defendant Hoyt, who was her granddaughter, was a teacher in a kindergarten, and lived in the house without paying rent or board. In July, 1896, the grandmother gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>her a bill of sale of the household goods, furniture and chattels in the house. The plaintiffs contended that the occupation of the house by the defendants and their use of it as a boardinghouse was a joint enterprise to defraud the lessors, and that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for the use and occupation of the premises. The judge found in favor of the defendant Hoyt, and found further that \u201c what she did in or about the house was only to assist her grandmother, that she did not ever agree to pay rent, and was not a party in or to any plan or enterprise to defraud the plaintiffs.\u201d These findings make the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for rulings immaterial to the question whether the defendant Hoyt was liable for use and occupation, and it is unnecessary to consider them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
