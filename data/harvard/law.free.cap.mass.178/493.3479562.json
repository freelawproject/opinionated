Per Holmes, C. J.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b511-6\">A manufacturer of shoes in Massachusetts adopted a label with the word \u201c Knickerbocker\u201d as a general mark for his goods or a large variety of them, although he also used other marks for goods made to order for particular firms. Two years later his factory was burned, and he went out of business and for four years was in the employ of others as a salesman in other States. At the end of that time he resumed business for himself in Philadelphia selling the goods of a New Jersey company as a jobber, adopted the title \u201c Knickerbocker Shoe Company \u201d and used the word \u201c Knickerbocker \u201d on his packages with a label similar to the one he formerly used. He testified that he never had intended to abandon the use of the word \u201c Knickerbocker \u201d as a trade-mark regarding it as a valuable possession and that he resumed it at the first opportunity. During the four years that this former manufacturer was working for others, the word \u201c Knickerbocker <em>\u201d </em>had been adopted as a trade-mark by another manufacturer of shoes. In a suit brought by the last named manufacturer against the first named for alleged infringement of his trade-mark, it was <em>held, </em>that the judge who tried the case was warranted in finding, that the defendant had made the word \u201cKnickerbocker\u201d a trade-mark, that he had not abandoned it, and that his present use of it was within the scope of his original acquisition.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">Bill in equity by copartners engaged in the manufacture and sale of boots and shoes, to restrain the defendant from using their trade-mark consisting of the word \u201c Knickerbocker \u201d as applied to boots and shoes, filed November 27, 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">The case was heard in the Superior Court, by Mason, C. J., who made the following note on the papers in the case: \u201c The answer admitting so much of the plaintiffs\u2019 case as to rely wholly on the matter alleged in avoidance, the defendant was directed by the court t.o go forward on the question of the prior ownership and abandonment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">Thereafter on December 12, 1900, the judge indorsed and signed on the back of the bill the following: \u201cThe pleadings admit many of the allegations of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill.

F. Tucker &amp; Co., in the city of Lynn, Massachusetts, and in the town of Middleton, Massachusetts, and for the purpose of advertising goods of his manufacture and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>creasing the sale thereof, he, about the year 1894, caused to be made certain designs to be placed on his cartons or pasteboard boxes containing shoes of his manufacture, which said designs distinguished the shoes made by him as \u2018 Knickerbocker\u2019 shoes, and included a sketch or design representing what was said to be the Knickerbocker arms or emblem together with the word \u2018 Knickerbocker \u2019; that after procuring said designs he caused to be printed therefrom labels for such cartons or pasteboard boxes in large numbers, and during said years sold to the trade in various parts of the country, shoes put up in such boxes and so designated by labels, and that such label, including such design and the word <em>\u2018 </em>Knickerbocker,\u2019 as aforesaid, was generally used by him during all of said years in connection with his said business of the manufacture and sale at wholesale of boots and shoes; that in the year 1896 he ceased to manufacture boots and shoes, and since said year has not, until about July or August of the present year, been engaged in the business of the manufacture and sale of boots and shoes on his own account, but has been employed by sundry manufacturers as a salesman; that in July or August of the present year he decided to engage in the jobbing of boots and shoes in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and purchased from certain manufacturers boots and shoes to constitute his stock in trade for such jobbing business, and upon receiving shoes so purchased by him he caused the same to be labelled on the cartons or paper boxes, on the ends thereof, with labels bearing the same design as that used by him in 1896, and previously as aforesaid, said labels so used by him in the present year being identical in design with those previously used, the only difference being that the labels previously used were printed in colors, while the style for such labels having changed, those used in the present year have been printed in plain black, and are smaller in size than those formerly used; that when he caused said design to be made and said labels to be printed, and used them as aforesaid in 1896, and prior thereto, he intended to, and did, adopt said design and labels as a trade-mark for his exclusive use in designating and distinguishing boots and shoes of his manufacture ; that said design and label so adopted were used by him generally and regularly in his business until he discontinued business in 1896, and this adoption and regular use took place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>long before the word \u2018 Knickerbocker \u2019 was used by the plaintiffs in their business; that when he discontinued business in 1896 he did not intend to abandon said design and labels, or his right to the same, and did not use them from 1896 to July or ' August, 1900, because he was out of business, as aforesaid, and that immediately upon resuming business he resumed the use of said design and labels.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-3\">In addition to the facts stated in the answer the record set forth oral testimony of the defendant and other witnesses.

At that time Batchelder &amp; Lincoln were running heavily on our Excelsior line of goods and they wished us to confine the use of that label to them, so I was obliged to seek another general label for my trade, and I thought that the Knickerbocker \u2014 it occurred to me it was a pretty good name. I went to the Boston Bank Note Company and asked them what shape they could put that into. I wanted it especially adapted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>to any New York trade. I thought it was a good name for the New York. They brought me a design, saying to me this was the old Knickerbocker arms, and they brought in the design practically as adopted.

I gave these two lines of goods my old trade-marks, \u00a3 Excelsior \u2019 and \u00a3 Knickerbocker,\u2019 knowing that they would be valuable to me, because I was very well and favorably known in the trade by goods which I had manufactured under those names I adopted. My first arrangement I thought I would call myself the Excelsior Shoe Co., as the Excelsior was the highest price shoe I was going to put out, but I found before I got far in it, that there was a concern, an Excelsior Shoe Company, doing business in Portsmouth, Ohio, which, of course, precluded the use of the term. Then I made a thorough search, \u00e1s far as I was able, to find whether anybody was doing business under the style of' the Knickerbocker Shoe Co. I was told there was a concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>in Baltimore who had been doing business under the name of the Knickerbocker Shoe Co. I made considerable effort to find them, but they were not in existence, and I found they were not in existence then at the present time, and so I adopted that name as the name under which to do business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\"><em>\u201c Q. </em>Didn\u2019t you know that in Lynn there was a factory manufacturing Knickerbocker shoes? <em>A. </em>No, sir; not until after I had my printing out.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-6\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxP\">This is a bill to restrain the infringement of an alleged trade-mark consisting of the word \u201c Knickerbocker,\u201d as applied to boots and shoes. In the answer a prior use and acquisition of the trade-mark by the defendant is set up. The case is here on the evidence, by appeal from a decree of the Superior Court dismissing the bill, after a finding that the facts were as alleged in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">In considering whether the defence is made out, of course we shall assume in favor of the finding that the defendant was an honest witness, as he had every appearance of being, so far as the printed answers go. It was admitted in the argument before us that the defendant was the first to use the word. It would have to be admitted also that when he resumed the use he did so in ignorance of what the plaintiffs had done in the meantime, so that in its dramatic aspect the case for the defendant is pretty strong. The plaintiffs, however, deny that the defendant ever did more than to use the word as an advertising device, and insist that if he did get a trade-mark it was abandoned as matter of fact and of law, and further that the defendant now is making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>a use of the word not within the scope of any right which he may have acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"AEz\">We assume in favor of the plaintiffs that they might be entitled to prevail notwithstanding the fact that the defendant first used the word in its present connection, and that the right to a trade-mark does not depend upon originality, even as against the originator of the characteristic use. <em>Menendez </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>128 U. S. 514, 521. <em>Royal Baking Powder Co. </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>70 Fed. Rep. 376. We therefore assume that the points toward which the plaintiffs have directed their argument are the points necessary to be considered, and that what we have called the dramatic aspect of the facts is not conclusive of the equities upon which the decision of the case must turn.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">In the first place then it is to be considered whether the defendant ever had a trade-mark. Upon this question the finding of the Superior Court seems to us fully warranted by the evidence. From 1894 to 1896 the defendant used the mark, very largely, as he says, in the jobbing trade in New York and in the general retail trade, especially through the middle states and the west. He used it not to designate a particular style of shoe, but to cover a wide range of shoes which he manufactured and sold. It is true that he also used other names, but most of them were used for the special goods of particular houses only, and one which was started for general use, \u201c Excelsior,\u201d became appropriated to a single firm. Without intimating that a man could not have more than one trade-mark for his boots and shoes, we are of opinion that the judge was warranted in finding that by the course of the defendant\u2019s business \u201c Knickerbocker \u201d became his general mark for his goods, or for a large variety of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">There is more difficulty on the question of abandonment, but in view of the testimony of the defendant we are not prepared to say that the finding of the Superior Court- was wrong. If we should adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the defendant\u2019s intent is immaterial, then the question would be whether, from lapse of time, or the public abandonment of his business, or from other causes, the good will associated with the name had melted away, either gradually or at once. In July, 1896, the defendant\u2019s factory in Massachusetts was burned and he went out of busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ness. From that time until July or August, 1900, he worked for others as a salesman in other States. During those four years of course he made no use of his trade-mark. Then he began business again on his own account in Philadelphia, selling goods \u25a0 of a New Jersey company as a jobber, and then he resumed the use of the name on his packages, adopting it as a title for his concern, \u201c Knickerbocker Shoe Company.\u201d Certainly it is hard to believe that a name which had not been more or longer associated with the defendant\u2019s goods than this had been still should have value from any good will once attached to it. But the defendant testified, at least by implication, that it did, and the extent to which his testimony should carry credence is a matter on which we cannot undertake to revise the opinion of the judge who saw him. <em>Royal Baking Powder Co. </em>v. Raymond, 70 Fed. Rep. 376, 380. <em>Mouson </em>v. <em>Boehm, </em>26 Ch. D. 398. <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Hoosier Drill Co. </em>78 Ind. 408,412. Browne, Trade-marks, \u00a7 680. It may be argued that there is another aspect of the facts just stated, also irrespective of intent. It may be contended that discontinuing the use of the trade-mark, at least when coupled with abandonment of the business, amounts to a notification of the public that any one is free to use the mark, and that the defendant cannot go behind the import of his acts after the plaintiffs have taken up the use, although the old good will still attaches to the name, whatever the private intent of the defendant may have been. But it is plain that there is no such meaning\u00b0absolutely attached to a discontinuance of use, and it seems to us that even when the business also is discontinued, it is not a necessary con- . elusion that the use of the mark at once is free to all. Or, at least, to put it more cautiously, whatever rights may have been gained by the plaintiffs if they used the mark in good faith in the interval of discontinuance, the defendant still may be entitled as against them to resume his use. <em>Mouson </em>v. <em>Boehm, </em>26 Ch. D. 398, 407, 408. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Waitt, </em>61 Fed. Rep. 1008. <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Hoosier Drill Co. </em>78 Ind. 408, 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In the cases and text-books intent is assumed to be important. Browne, Trade-marks, \u00a7 681. Perhaps it might be so as giving a character to the ambiguous fact of discontinuing the use of the mark. Perhaps if the use were given up with the intent never to resume it, that would amount to an offer of it to the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>which any one might accept at once, although giving up the use with intent to resume would not have that effect. If this should be so, and if a trade-mark may be lost under such circumstances before the vanishing of the good will associated with it, here again it is something of a stretch to believe that the defendant, during the four years that he was a salesman, continuously intended to resume business on his own account and again to use the name. But it is perfectly possible, he says that he did, and the Superior Court has found accordingly, and in this matter also we have no sufficient ground for going behind its view of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the defendant is attempting to make his old trade-mark cover a new meaning, as well as to change its form. It was used on shoes manufactured by him in Massachusetts, and seems in fact to have been confined mainly to shoes for young people, in connection with the word \u201c School \u201d (\u201c Knickerbocker School Shoes It now is used upon shoes made by another firm in New Jersey and sold by him in Philadelphia. It is pointed out also that he has taken his word into his business and dropped \u201c School \u201d altogether. Again we have to fall back on the findings. We cannot say that the judge was not warranted in finding that the word originally indicated the source from which the shoe was recommended, rather than that of its manufacture, \u2014 a judgment of excellence which more &lt;?r less commends itself to buyers. If so, it might be found that the present case is like the former in its characteristic features, and if that were found and it were established that the defendant could use the trade-mark on the shoes which he intended -to sell, we see no ground on which the plaintiffs could prevent his incorporating the same word into his business name.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">It will be seen that we nowhere undertake to say what our decision would have been on the printed evidence had it come before us in the first instance. We confine ourselves according to the settled practice to considering whether we can say that the judge who saw the witnesses necessarily was wrong upon matters which depended very largely on the degree to which they were believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
