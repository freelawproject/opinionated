A standard policy on mortgaged real estate was made payable to the mortgagee in case of loss. Without the assent or knowledge of the company, one of the two mortgagors who took out the policy conveyed his interest in the mortgaged property and his interest was also sold on execution.

Whiting against Herman F. \u2022Burkhardt, Albert L. Jewell and the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, to recover as mortgagee for a loss by fire to property covered by the mortgage and situated in Hull, Massachusetts, the property at the time of the loss being covered by a policy of insurance issued by the defendant insurance company, and the proceeds of the policy being claimed by each of the other two defendants, if the plaintiff was not entitled thereto, filed September 14, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-12\">The case was heard in the Superior Court by <em>Bell, </em>J., who at the request of the parties reported it upon the facts as found by him for the consideration of this court, such order to be made therein as might seem meet and proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The facts found by the judge were as follows: The policy was issued on June 20, 1898, to Herman F. Burkhardt and George W. Guptill, and was issued \u201c payable in case of loss to Albert L. Jewell, mortgagee, as his interest may appear.\u201d The plaintiff as trustee became the owner of the mortgage on October 13,1898, Jewell having on that day assigned the mortgage to Whiting, trustee, and having delivered the policy to Whiting, trustee, after indorsing thereon the following: \u201c October 13, 1898. For value received I hereby assign and set over all my right and interest in this policy, and all the advantages to be derived therefrom, unto William S. Whiting, trustee for John S. Whiting, Son &amp; Co., assignee of my mortgage. Albert L. Jewell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-5\">Jewell at the time of the transfer of the mortgage indorsed in blank the mortgage note, waiving demand and notice. The mortgage contained a covenant to keep the property insured for the benefit of the mortgagees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">On June 11, 1899, the property was entirely destroyed by fire, and it was proved that the damage at least equalled the insurance upon the buildings, and that the amount due upon the mortgage was in excess of the total amount of insurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-7\">On April 15,1897, Jewell had conveyed by deed the insured building, together with the land on which it stood, to George W. Guptill and the defendant Burkhardt. The latter being a trustee of the Burkhardt Brewing Company, a trust association, the other trustees being Gottlieb F. Burkhardt and P. W. Burkhardt. By this deed Guptill and the defendant Burkhardt became record joint holders of the property, but the defendant Burkhardt held the title for the Burkhardt Brewing Company with the verbal understanding that Guptill could purchase that half at any time by paying what the company had paid for it, with any interest, taxes, or other expenses on its account, and also paying any sum that Guptill might owe the company for merchandise. Upon receipt of the deed Guptill and Burkhardt executed a note and mortgage for $10,875 to Jewell, which was the mortgage later assigned by Jewell to the plaintiff as above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-8\">The policy insured Herman F. Burkhardt and George W. Guptill and their legal representatives against loss or damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>by fire to the amount of f 1,500 on frame buildings and additions situated on the easterly side of Main Avenue, Nan task et, in the -town of Hull, Massachusetts, known as Hotel Hollis, for the term of one year from the twenty-fourth day of June, 1898, and was in the Massachusetts standard form prescribed by St. 1894, c. 522, \u00a7 60. It contained the usual provision that it should be void if without the assent of the company in writing or print \u201c the said property shall be sold or this policy assigned.\u201d It- contained also the provision that \u201c If this policy shall be made payable to a mortgagee of the insured real estate, no act or default of any person other than such mortgagee or his agents, or those claiming under him, shall affect such mortgagee\u2019s right to recover in case of loss on such real estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-3\">On or about November 1, 1898, the defendant Burkhardt, Gottlieb F. Burkhardt and P. W. Burkhardt, as the Burkhardt Brewing Company, brought suit against Guptill, and made an attachment of his interest in the property insured. On December 30,1898, Guptill conveyed his interest in the premises to one Harvey H. Pratt. On or about February 11, 1899, the interest of Guptill was sold on execution, issued in the above mentioned suit, to Gottlieb F. Burkhardt, one of the attaching creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\">The assent of the defendant company was not obtained to the transfer of the insurance made by the defendant Jewell to Whiting, trustee, and it had no knowledge thereof nor of the assignment of the mortgage until after the date of the fire. The defendant company had no knowledge of the attachment by the B.urkliardt Brewing Company and the sale of the property on execution in that suit to Gottlieb F. Burkhardt, nor of the transfer by Guptill to Harvey H. Pratt, nor did the defendant Burkhardt know of the conveyance by Guptill to Pratt. No conveyance had been made before the fire by the defendant Burkhardt of his interest in the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\">The judge found that the insurance company waived a reference to arbitrators under the terms of the policy, and also waived any other or further proofs of loss than those actually filed, and that if the insurance company was liable at all it was liable for the full amount of its policy, together with interest since July 8, 1899, on or before which date the amount due under the policy became payable.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>W.

The transfer prohibited by this provision is a transfer of the contract of insurance; that is to say, a transfer by Guptill and Burkhardt, the persons insured; not a transfer by Jewell, who was the person designated as the person entitled to receive the proceeds of the insurance, if any, due under the contract between the company on the one hand and Guptill and Burkhardt on the other. The distinction is plainly and fully pointed out in <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co. </em>10 Cush. 337, <em>346; Phillips </em>v. <em>Merrimack Ins. Co. </em>10 Cush. 350, 353; <em>New York Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>138 Mass. 24, 28, 29; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Colonial Mutual Ins. Co. </em>169 Mass. 10, 13, 14. What Jewell did by assigning his <em>\u201c </em>right and interest in this policy \u201d was not to transfer the policy, but to assign to another his right to receive the proceeds, if any, under it; the policy remained after the assignment,. as it was before, the policy of Guptill and Burkhardt.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">We see no reason why Jewell should not make the assignment made by him; the policy was mad\u00f3 payable to him as <em>\u201c </em>mortgagee, as his interest may appear \u201d; he assigned his right to receive the proceeds, if any, to the assignee of the mortgage in question, and the plaintiff\u2019s right to receive the proceeds of the insurance was subject to this clause in the hands of the plaintiff and could not be held by him for any debt other than the debt secured by that mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The conveyance by Guptill of his interest in the building insured did not affect the right of the plaintiff to recover in case of loss; it is provided in the policy, that \u201c If this policy shall be made payable to a mortgagee of the insured real estate, no act or default of any person other than such mortgagee or his agents, or those claiming under him, shall affect such mortgagee\u2019s right to recover in case of loss on such real estate.\u201d This mortgage was originally made payable to \u201c Jewell, mortgagee,\u201d and after the assignment by Jewell of his interest to the plaintiff, who had in fact become the assignee of the mortgage in question, it continued to be \u201c payable to a mortgagee,\u201d and, as we have said, it could not have been held by the plaintiff for any debt other than the mortgage debt in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The objection that there is a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law was not set up in the answers or any of them, and being raised for the first time in this court, is not taken in time. <em>Jones </em>v. Keen, 115 Mass. 170. <em>Crocker </em>v. Dillon, 133 Mass. 91. <em>Parker </em>v. Nickerson, 137 Mass. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">A decree must be entered directing the defendant insurance company to pay to the plaintiff the amount of the policy with interest from September 4, 1899.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\n<em>iSo ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
