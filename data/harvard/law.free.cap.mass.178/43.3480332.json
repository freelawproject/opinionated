Respectfully submitted, Whitworth Heating Co., Wm. Whitworth, Treas. A. S. Lowell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aus\">The bill further alleged, that in the first clause of said proposition or agreement either by accident, mistake, or by fraud on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the part of the defendant or his agents, the work and materials to be performed and furnished by the plaintiff were not limited and confined to the building below the three top floors as was intended by the plaintiff as the defendant or his agents then well knew, and as appears also in the third clause of said proposition or agreement; that the plaintiff performed the work and furnished the material for piping for power and heating purposes in said building except in the three top floors in accordance with the specifications and his agreement, and the defendant paid him on account thereof the sum of $1,000, leaving the sum of $1,260 still due the plaintiff thereon, but that the defendant now contends that the $965 for future work should be deducted from the $2,260 instead of from the $3,719, the price for the whole building, and that he only owes the plaintiff thereon the sum of .$295.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-3\">The plaintiff prayed that the first clause of said agreement might be reformed by inserting after the word \u201cpurposes\" in the third line thereof the following words \u201c below the three top floors,\u201d or in some other way to make it conform to the intention of the parties thereto at the time it was executed, and prayed for an enforcement of the contract as reformed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\">In the Superior Court the case was referred to a master who reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">\u201c First. In the month of January, 1898, the plaintiff and the defendant had a conversation in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s installing a heating plant in a building then being erected by the defendant in the City of Worcester. After some discussion of the subject, the defendant referred the plaintiff to his engineers, Lewis &amp; Claflin, of Providence, Rhode Island, under whose supervision the building was being erected. Subsequently, W. B. Lewis, of the firm of Lewis &amp; Claflin, sent or gave to the plaintiff a paper containing the specifications in regard to heating the defendant\u2019s building, of which a copy was annexed to plaintiff\u2019s bill, marked \u2018A.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">. \u201c Second. On or about January 28, 1898, the plaintiff gave or sent to said Lewis, an unsigned proposal or agreement, concerning the said heating, a copy of which was annexed to the plaintiff\u2019s bill and marked 6 B.\u2019 Between the time of the first conference between the plaintiff and defendant, and February 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>1898, the plaintiff and Lewis had several conversations relating to installing the heating plant, but no definite agreement or understanding in relation thereto, was reached before February 8, 1898. A few days before February 8, 1898, the plaintiff was informed by one Parker, acting for Lewis, that he, Lewis, had decided to give him the job on the bid, and to go to work on it, and that he would be up in a few days and fix up the contract. The plaintiff thereupon began and worked three or four days on the job, before February 8, 1898.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">\u201c Third. On February 8,1898, Lewis drew up in writing, an agreement for the plaintiff and defendant to sign, a copy of which agreement is annexed to plaintiff\u2019s bill, marked \u2018 0,\u2019 excepting the following words, \u2014 \u2018 providing circumstances beyond our control do not interfere.\u2019 Lewis gave this agreement to the plaintiff to read and consider. The plaintiff, after reading the agreement, expressed a desire to have incorporated into it the provision,\u2014 \u2018 Providing circumstances beyond our control do not interfere.\u2019 Lewis assented to this, and the plaintiff thereupon took the agreement to a typewriter, and after the insertion of the above provision, had the same set in type.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">\u201c The plaintiff then signed the agreement marked <em>\u2018 </em>C \u2019 and took it to the defendant, who also, after reading it, signed it. I find that the defendant never saw the specifications \u2018 A \u2019 nor the unsigned agreement 6 B \u2019 until this hearing, and that the only paper or agreement he had any knowledge of, was the contract \u2018 C \u2019 signed by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">\u201c Fourth. I find that the plaintiff had opportunity to fully consider and understand the terms of said agreement \u2018 C.\u2019 I do not find that said Lewis practised any deception or fraud in obtaining the plaintiff\u2019s signature to said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">\u201c Fifth. I find that after the plaintiff had put in some portion of the heating plant, and long before the work was completed, the plaintiff was suspicious that the agreement was not what he thought it was, at the time of signing it, and a doubt arose in his mind as to whether the sum of $965 was to be deducted from $2,260, or added to that sum in case the three top floors were furnished with heating appliances. The plaintiff did not inform the defendant, or Lewis, of his doubt or suspicion, but continued on in the work of installing the plant, assuming that the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>meant that the $965 was not to be deducted from the $2,260, but to be added thereto in case the three top floors were furnished with heating appliances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">\u201c Sixth. The plaintiff after the signing of said agreement, proceeded with th\u00e9 work contemplated, and furnished material and work for heating purposes in said building, except in the three top floors, substantially in accordance with the specifications and agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">\u201c Seventh. After the completion of the heating plant, the plaintiff called upon the defendant for a settlement of the account, stating that he understood that he was to receive $2,260 for installing the plant on the two lower floors. The defendant denied this construction of the contract, and contended that the contract was for.$2,260, less $965, for the three top floors, which had not been furnished with heating apparatus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">\u201c Eighth. I find that the plaintiff supposed, at the time he signed contract \u2018 C,\u2019 that he was to receive $2,260 for installing the heating plant on the two lower floors, and that he was mistaken in the meaning and purport of the agreement\u00a3 C.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">\u201c Ninth. The evidence fails to satisfy me that either the defendant, or the defendant\u2019s engineer Lewis, understood that the agreement was for $2,260 for the two lower floors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">\u201c Tenth. I therefore find that the failure to limit or confine the contract price of $2,260 to the two lower floors, was not an accident, was not procured by fraud, and was not a mutual mistake of the parties to the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-10\">\u201c Eleventh. Upon the foregoing findings of fact, I rule as a matter of law, that the plaintiff is not entitled to have said contract \u2018C \u2019 reformed; and that the defendant is entitled to have the $965 deducted from the $2,260, leaving the sum of $1,295 as the amount the plaintiff is entitled to receive under agreement \u00a3 0.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-11\">The other findings are not material to the case as now presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-12\">The master also reported as follows: \u201c Before making a rough draft of the report the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s counsel filed with me requests for findings and rulings, which requests accompany this report. Having made a rough draft of the report,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-13\">I notified the respective counsel thereof, and subsequently heard their suggestions and requests as to my final draft. I thereupon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>made the foregoing final draft of the report, and gave notice thereof to the respective counsel on December 29,1899. On the first day of January, 1900, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed with me his objections to my report, which objections accompany this report.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s objections to the master\u2019s report and his requests for findings and rulings were appended to the master\u2019s report as stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">The master\u2019s report was filed January 5, 1900, and on January 10, 1900, the plaintiff filed the following statement: \u201cNow comes the plaintiff and excepts to so much of the master\u2019s report as is inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s objections and his requests for findings and rulings, which objections and copies of the requests are appended to the master\u2019s report.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">The case was heard in the Superior Court- by Pierce, J., who entered a decree as follows: \u201c 1. That the objections to the master\u2019s report be and hereby are overruled. 2. That the, master\u2019s report be and hereby is accepted and confirmed. 3. That the exceptions to the master\u2019s report be and hereby are overruled. 4. That it appearing as a matter of record that this court upon the defendant\u2019s motion awarded the plaintiff his costs, and the same were taxed by the clerk pursuant to the order, to January 11, 1900, and it appearing that on that date the defendant tendered and brought into court for the plaintiff the amount found due the plaintiff by the master\u2019s report, together with interest thereon to January 11, 1900, and also that the defendant on that date tendered and brought into court for the plaintiff, the plaintiff\u2019s taxable costs as decreed by the court to January 11,1900, and that the plaintiff received and accepted said sums so tendered and brought into court, now therefore it is ordered that the defendant be awarded the taxable costs from January 11,1900.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-9\">From this decree the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-10\"><em>B. W. </em>Potter, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-11\"><em>E. H. </em>Vaughan, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-12\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF0\">This case comes up on an appeal from a decree of the Superior Court, overruling the plaintiff\u2019s objections to the master\u2019s report, accepting and confirming the report, overruling the exceptions to the report, and allowing to the defendant taxable costs after the date when he paid to the plaintiff the sums found by the report to be due from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The decree should not have undertaken to deal with objections to the report. The only purpose served by them is to lay the foundation for exceptions to the report; unless perfected by exceptions founded on them, they give to the party making them no standing in court to contest the master\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The only exception or exceptions filed by the plaintiff were as follows: \u201c Now comes the plaintiff and excepts to so much of the master's report as is inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s objections and his requests for findings and rulings, which objections and copies of the requests are appended to the master\u2019s report.\u201d Accompanying the report are, first, a paper containing four requests for findings of fact and four requests for rulings on the law and the evidence; second, a paper in the form o.f a letter to the master, asking him to draw certain inferences from the evidence ; and, third, a paper containing seven objections, and in the seventh objection there are contained three requests for findings and two objections to the master\u2019s having failed to make two findings there specified. This is not a compliance with Chancery Rule 32 of the Superior Court, and there were no exceptions properly before that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">But there is no error shown in the points urged by the plaintiff at the argument and on his brief, and he has lost no rights by failing to put them in the proper form.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">1. The first point made by the plaintiff is that the master was wrong in making the finding of fact that the defendant never saw the specifications nor the unsigned bid of the plaintiff, Exhibit B, until the hearing before the master, and that the only paper or agreement he had any knowledge of was the contract, Exhibit C. There is nothing in the deposition of the defendant\u2019s engineer Lewis, which is the only evidence before the court which shows that this finding was not warranted. There is no inconsistency between this finding and the fact which appears from the contract between the defendant and Lewis, the engineer, that the defendant had approved specifications for heating the building. The finding is that the specifications submitted to the plaintiff that he might make a bid on the work had not been seen by the defendant. Whether they were an exact copy of the specifications, approved by the defendant, or not, does not appear, and is immaterial. What is material is that so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>as the defendant\u2019s knowledge went, the paper \u201cC\u201d contained the agreement. The argument that Lewis was acquainted with Exhibits A and B, and the defendant is bound by his knowledge, is disposed of by the master\u2019s ninth finding: \u201c The evidence fails to satisfy me that either the defendant, or defendant\u2019s engineer Lewis, understood that the agreement was for $2,260 for the two lower floors,\u201d and the finding that the plaintiff had opportunity \u201c to fully consider and understand the terms of said agreement \u2018C.\u2019 I do not find that said Lewis practised any deception or fraud in obtaining the plaintiff\u2019s signature to said agreement.\u201d We cannot say that these findings were not warranted by the evidence. This disposes of the plaintiff\u2019s second point also.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">2. The third point is that the master was wrong in finding that the plaintiff did not prove that either the defendant or the defendant\u2019s engineer, Lewis, understood the agreement was for $2,260 for the two lower floors, and in the finding that the failure to limit the price of $2,260 to the two lower floors was not an accident, was not procured by fraud, and was not a mutual mistake of the parties to the contract. The plaintiff\u2019s bid was ambiguous; he had been requested to \u201c Make price on piping without tanks and elevator pump and with\u201d also to \u201cMake price on complete plant \u201d and \u201c Make price on plant without heating system above the second floor.\u201d There is nothing on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s bid to show whether $2,260, which was the plaintiff\u2019s price \u201c without the tanks and No. 8 Worthington pump,\u201d was his price for the whole building or for the building \u201c without the three top floors.\u201d It was stated distinctly in the agreement \u201c C \u201d which the plaintiff had ample opportunity to study, that this was the price from which $965 was to be deducted if the system was not put in on the three top floors. We are of opinion that there is nothing in Lewis\u2019s deposition which prevented the master from making this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">3. The plaintiff\u2019s next point is that the master should have ruled, as a matter of law, that the agreement which was signed, Exhibit C, was ambiguous. On the contrary, we think that the agreement was not ambiguous, and that the plaintiff\u2019s bid, Exhibit B, which he wishes to have considered in determining the true construction of the unambiguous contract, Exhibit C, was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>4. The plaintiff\u2019s next point is that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to have the contract, Exhibit C, reformed. This is covered by what already has been said in dealing with the plaintiff\u2019s other points.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The decree, confirming the master\u2019s report, and allowing the defendant taxable costs from January 11,1900, when the defend-, ant brought into court all sums due the plaintiff under the master\u2019s report, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
