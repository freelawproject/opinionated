We reverse and remand.</p> <p id=\"b1058-14\" pgmap=\"1058(94) 1059(97)\">Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint is based upon common law negligence and is brought against Gower, Inc., a corporation d/b/a the Barbary Coast Tavern, and Joann Gower, Terry Watson, and Eloise May McAnelly as agents and employees of the defendant tavern. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that on December 16, 1981, decedent was a customer at the Barbary Coast Tavern. Decedent consumed liquor and became intoxicated and unconscious. While intoxicated and unconscious, decedent was removed from the tavern by Gower, Watson, and McAnelly and placed into a car in the tavern\u2019s parking lot. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint further alleged that defendants knew or should have known that their conduct was likely to cause injury or death and that as a result of defendants\u2019 negligent conduct, decedent froze to death. Defendants Gower, Inc., and Joann Gower filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the Dramshop Act is the exclusive remedy against owners and operators of taverns for injuries to person, property, or means of support by an intoxicated person or in consequence of intoxication. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 43, par. 135.) The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion.</p> <p id=\"b1059-5\" pgmap=\"1059\"> On appeal, plaintiff contends that the Dramshop Act is not the only remedy available to her because her complaint is based upon defendants\u2019 negligent conduct toward decedent after he became intoxicated and unconscious rather than upon defendants\u2019 negligence in supplying decedent with liquor. It is well established that the Dram-shop Act is the exclusive remedy against tavern owners and operators for injuries caused by an intoxicated person or in consequence of intoxication. Consequently, there is no common law liability for the negligent sale or supply of liquor. Wimmer v. Koenigseder (1985), 108 Ill. 2d 435, 484 N.E.2d 1088.</p> <p id=\"b1059-6\" pgmap=\"1059(275) 1060(43)\">Plaintiff relies upon Lessner v. Hurtt (1977), 55 Ill. App. 3d 195, 371 N.E.2d 125, for its argument. In Lessner, plaintiff was injured in a fight with defendant Hurtt in defendant Ramada Inn\u2019s cocktail lounge. (55 Ill. App. 3d 195, 196, 371 N.E.2d 125.) Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint alleged that \u201cRamada was negligent in that it, through its employees, knew that Hurtt was intoxicated, knew that he threatened plaintiff with physical harm, did not remove Hurtt when plaintiff was endangered, and refused to aid plaintiff *** when the threat of physical harm became imminent.\u201d (55 Ill. App. 3d 195, 196, 317 N.E.2d 125. ) The trial court granted Ramada\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that the Dramshop Act was the exclusive remedy available to plaintiff. (55 Ill. App. 3d 195, 196, 371 N.E.2d 125, 126.) In reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, this court stated that plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccomplaint does not charge negligence by reason of the sale or supply of liquor, but rather is grounded on Ramada\u2019s failure to prevent injury to plaintiff by a boisterous and dangerous customer on the defendant\u2019s premises.\u201d (55 Ill. App. 3d 195, 197, 371 N.E.2d 125, 126. ) The court reasoned that \u201cregardless of whether a person obtains *** liquor at a dram shop, the owner or operator of such a business may be negligent and consequently be liable by failing to protect its patrons from physical harm by a person on the premises.\u201d (55 Ill. App. 3d 195, 197, 371 N.E.2d 125, 126.) The court held that the duty of a tavern owner or operator is to see that his guests are free from annoyance or injury much as any possessor of land must act reasonably in avoiding harm to invitees from the negligence of third persons. (55 Ill. App. 3d 195, 197, 371 N.E.2d 125, 126.) Thus, the Dramshop Act is not the exclusive remedy.</p> <p id=\"b1060-5\" pgmap=\"1060\"> Although plaintiffs complaint in this case alleged that decedent purchased intoxicating liquor from plaintiff, unlike plaintiff\u2019s complaint in Lessner, it does not diminish plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. The allegation in this complaint regarding the sale of intoxicating liquor to decedent is significant only in reference to how decedent became unconscious. It also established that decedent did not place himself in peril, but rather it was defendants who placed decedent in peril.</p> <p id=\"b1060-6\" pgmap=\"1060\"> Furthermore, when a party brings a cause of action, allegations of fact are necessary for a proper complaint. (Mlade v. Finley (1983), 112 Ill. App. 3d 914, 918, 445 N.E.2d 1240, 1243-44.) The trial court must liberally construe these pleadings in order to achieve justice between the litigants (112 Ill. App. 3d 914, 918, 445 N.E.2d 1240, 1244) and look to the resolution of litigation on the merits and the avoidance of elevating questions of form over questions of substance (Zeh v. Wheeler (1986), 111 Ill. 2d 266, 278, 489 N.E.2d 1342, 1348).</p> <p id=\"b1060-7\" pgmap=\"1060\">In this case, the trial court elevated form over substance. Plaintiff properly alleged all pertinent facts which resulted in decedent\u2019s death.</p> <p id=\"b1060-8\" pgmap=\"1060\"> Although plaintiff alleged in the complaint that defendants sold and supplied intoxicating liquor to the decedent causing decedent to become unconscious, it is not the act that allegedly resulted in decedent\u2019s death. Whether or not decedent had been drunk, his drunkenness did not lessen the tavern owner\u2019s duty to protect his patrons from other customers, his employees, or the owner himself. Plaintiff properly predicated her complaint on the fact that defendants\u2019 placing of the unconscious decedent in his truck on a very cold winter night is the act which allegedly led to plaintiff\u2019s husband\u2019s death.</p> <p id=\"b1060-9\" pgmap=\"1060\">It is unlike the case where a minor suffered injuries when he became unconscious in a bank of snow after purchasing alcoholic liquors. (Gora v. 7-11 Food Stores (1982), 109 Ill. App. 3d 109, 440 N.E.2d 279.) Plaintiff, in this case, did not allege decedent was harmed because he became unconscious inside the tavern after consuming alcoholic liquors. Rather, plaintiff alleged that tavern owners harmed decedent by placing decedent in peril. Thus, this court finds that the complaint did state a proper cause of action for common law negligence based upon the negligent acts against decedent and not their negligence in the sale of intoxicating liquor.</p> <p id=\"b1060-10\" pgmap=\"1060(11) 1061(13)\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Williamson County is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b1061-5\" pgmap=\"1061\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b1061-6\" pgmap=\"1061\">KASSERMAN, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b1061-7\" pgmap=\"1061\">PRESIDING JUSTICE KARNS,</author> <p id=\"Aa-i\" pgmap=\"1061\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b1061-8\" pgmap=\"1061\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s complaint states a cause of action for common law negligence. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s decedent was a customer and patron of defendants\u2019 establishment,\u201d that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s decedent consumed drinks and became intoxicated and unconscious,\u201d and that \u201cwhile intoxicated and unconscious\u201d decedent was removed from the tavern by defendants\u2019 agents and employees. In so pleading, plaintiff went beyond alleging a breach of duty stemming from defendants\u2019 status as a possessor of land. In Lessner v. Hurtt (1977), 55 Ill. App. 3d 195, 197, 371 N.E.2d 125, 126, the court examined the pleadings and emphasized that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s amended complaint made no reference or allegation regarding whether defendant Hurtt purchased liquor at Ramada or became intoxicated by reason thereof.\u201d In concluding that Lessner is distinguishable on this basis, I do not believe that form has been elevated over substance. See Zeh v. Wheeler (1986), 111 Ill. 2d 266, 278, 489 N.E.2d 1342, 1348.</p> <p id=\"b1061-9\" pgmap=\"1061\">Examination of the pleadings leads to the inescapable conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s action is predicated on the sale or supply of liquor. It is well established that the Dramshop Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 43, par. 135) is the exclusive remedy against tavern owners and operators for injuries caused by an intoxicated person or in consequence of the intoxication of any person (Wimmer v. Koenigseder (1985), 108 Ill. 2d 435, 484 N.E.2d 1088), and it was undisputed at oral argument that plaintiff had indeed recovered a settlement pursuant to the Dramshop Act. The supreme court has taken an expansive view of the Dramshop Act and has failed to recognize common law liability for the negligent sale or supply of liquor, concluding that the Act is plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy where the sale or supply of liquor leads to injury. (See Wimmer v. Koenigseder (1985), 108 Ill. 2d 435, 442, 484 N.E.2d 1088, 1092; Cunningham v. Brown (1961), 22 Ill. 2d 73, 77, 174 N.E.2d 157, 160.) The trial court correctly granted defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. Cardinal Glass Co. v. Board of Education (1983), 113 Ill. App. 3d 442, 444, 447 N.E.2d 546, 547.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
