The account is a long one, and the principal difficulty of settling it, devolves of course on you. If the books are copies made from the slate of Harris, after an interval of a week or more from the time the work was done, and entered on the slate, as stated by some of the witnesses, they are not such books of original entry as the law contemplates, and you should reject them; on the contrary, if the entries were made on the slate first, and transferred to the books the same day, or within a day or two, as testified by John Milliken, they are sufficiently authenticated to go to you for what they are worth. You must determine this, not we. If you find they are not books of original entry, then we answer the defendant\u2019s first point, viz. (\u201c If the jury believe the evidence given in the cause, the books of the plaintiff are not books of original entry, and ought not to be regarded by the jury as furnishing evidence whereon to found a verdict for the plaintiffs.\u201d) in the affirmative. But, whether they are or not is now for you to determine, under a view of all the facts in the case. Defendant\u2019s third, fourth and fifth points, read and answered in the affirmative. Third point\u2014{\u201cthe jury should give credit to the defendant for the sum of $30, paid by him to the plaintiff in 1834, and this sum of $30 should be deducted from the charges of the plaintiff since April 7th 1832.\u201d) Fourth point\u2014(\u201caccounts between a blacksmith in the county and his agricultural employers in the course of his trade, are not such accounts between merchant and merchant, their factors or servants, as are excepted from the operation of the 2d section of the Act of Limitations, of the 27th of March 1713.\u201d) Defendant\u2019s fifth point\u2014(\u201c All payments made by the defendant within six years before the commencement of this suit, should be deducted from the charges of the plaintiff within the said period of six years.\u201d) Defendant\u2019s second point\u2014(\u201c if the jury believe the evidence given, the statute of limitations is a bar to the recovery of the plaintiffs, as to all items charged before the 7th of April 1832.\u201d) Answer. If you find from an examination of the books of the parties, that their accounts were mutual, and the demands reciprocal between them, the statute would not be a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery of the balance due him; but if the accounts and demands are not so, the statute would preclude his recovery beyond a period of six years from the commencement of this suit, and whether the testimony warrants the one conclusion or the other, you must determine, not we. The accounts are long, and you will have to examine them. Credits of payment on account only evidenced by the plaintiff\u2019s books would not .be such mutual accounts as would prevent the operation of the statute. This, we think, is settled by the Supreme Court, in 17 <em>Serg. &lt;\u00a7\u2022 Rawle </em>347. I cannot, therefore, answer plaintiffs\u2019 third and fourth points in the affirmative. Third point\u2014(\u201cif six years did not elapse between any of the charges and credits, and the last item within six years previous to the bringing of this suit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>it is not within the statute, and the plaintiffs ought to recover the balance of the account.\u201d) Fourth point\u2014(\u201c if not mutual accounts, and the defendant made payments on account within every six years, they would take the case out of the statute.\u201d) Plaintiffs\u2019 first point\u2014(\u201c the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel request the court to instruct the jury, that if they believe the accounts between the parties are open, running and mutual accounts, they are not barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d) Answered in the affirmative. Plaintiffs\u2019 second point\u2014(\u201cif the jury believe that the defendant admitted before the arbitrators, or at any time, that the plaintiff\u2019s account was correct, except six or seven removes which he objected to, it cannot be affected by being first entered on the slate, and not transferred for a number of days.\u201d) I know of no evidence in the cause, showing the defendant\u2019s admission as here stated; the remaining part of the point is answered in the opening part of the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">If the books are rejected, the account since 7th of April 1832 is not disputed, and the plaintiff would be entitled to your verdict for such sum as you think due him, deducting his payments made since that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">The whole of the facts you must determine, and not we, and find such verdict, under the law as we have stated it, as you think right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">Charge excepted to, by plaintiffs and defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-9\"><em>Mathers </em>and <em>J.

This was first decided in <em>Catling </em>v. <em>Skoulding, </em>(6 <em>T. R. </em>189) and has been repeatedly recognised since, as the cases cited abundantly show. It takes the case out of the statute, and it is immaterial whether the parties are merchants or not, as it goes on the ground of implied promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">The administrators, who were examined without objection, proved the books of original entries of the intestate, by evidencing that they were in his hand-writing, and that they were the only books that came to their hands, as administrators. This was enough to lay the books before the jury. The subsequent evidence showed that it was the general practice of the intestate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>make his entries on a slate, and afterwards draw them off in his boob; and that this sometimes was not done until two or three days. If it had been proved that the same practice was pursued as regards this account, it would be doubtful whether the evidence could have been received. But under the circumstances disclosed, the court was right in receiving the evidence, and submitting the facts to the- jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
