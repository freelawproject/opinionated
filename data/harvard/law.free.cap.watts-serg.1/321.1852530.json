This was an action of ejectment for a lot of ground, and was brought to compel the payment of the two last instalments mentioned in the following agreement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">Articles of agreement made and concluded upon this 17th day of September 1835, by and between Alexander Patterson, of Lancaster county, of the one part, and John Smull, of Harrisburg, of the other part, witnesseth that the said Alexander Patterson shall and will, on or before the first day of April next ensuing, well and sufficiently convey, clear of all encumbrances, to the said John Smull, his heirs or assigns, that certain lot situate in Swatara township, Dauphin county, adjoining lot of John Geiger, the river Susquehanna, George Mish, and the Pennsylvania canal, containing about nine acres.

That the said note was not paid when due, nor since. That at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, Patterson gave notice of the amount of money which was due for the land; and that the two last payments are due and unpaid; and that Smull retained the article of agreement, with the receipt, until after the sheriff\u2019s sale; nor was the receipt shown to any one by Smull till after the sale, or made known; and to be followed with proof that the lot at the time of sale was worth from $1000 to $1500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">The defendant objected to this evidence and to the competency of the witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The court overruled the objections, and admitted the evidence; defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-8\">John Smull sworn.

This receipt remained in my hands at that time, and until after the sheriff\u2019s sale\u2014the article with the receipt on it. The article went out of my hands a short time previous to the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed. I gave it to Mr M\u2019Clure, as my attorney; and when I gave him the article, I told him how the receipt was given. On the day of the sheriff\u2019s sale, I saw Mr Patterson at the sale. The land was sold subject to his notice, which he put up of the two gales due. The receipt was not known by the purchasers. Patterson gave notice at the sheriff's sale that the two last payments were due. The property was worth then $1500; it had been appraised before at $2000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-9\">The jury, under the instruction of the court, found a verdict for the plaintiff to be released, upon the payment of $683.94, within five days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-10\">Errors assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-11\">1.

The plaintiff alleges that the two last instalments due under the articles were never paid, and claims their amount. He asserts that although Smull gave him his promissory note for the amount of the second instalment, $267.33, yet the note remains unpaid. The question on the trial seems to have been, whether the plaintiff was entitled to the second and third instalments or only the third. The defendant gave in evidence Patterson\u2019s receipt to Smull on the back of the articles for the second instalment. The plaintiff then offered Smull as a witness to show, that when this receipt was given no money was paid, but Smull gave his promissory note to Patterson, which it was agreed should be credited only when paid, and that the note never had been paid; and also, that at the sheriff\u2019s sale, Patterson gave notice of his claim to both instalments, and the defendant had no knowledge of the receipt endorsed. Smull was objected to by the defendant, as an incompetent witness, on the ground of interest, and the question is, whether Smull was admissible as a witness to prove these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The effect of Smull\u2019s evidence is to subject the land to the payment of the disputed instalment, and to discharge himself from the payment of his note. Should the plaintiff fail in establishing his claim to the second instalment, and obtain from the defendant by means of a conditional verdict, only the third instalment, he could maintain his action against Smull on his note, and Smull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>could not resort to the defendant, the purchaser. But should the plaintiff succeed here as to both instalments, the defendant would either be obliged to pay them on a conditional verdict, or the plaintiff would recover back again the lot, in which cases the instalments would be extinguished. Smull, therefore, is directly interested in the event of this suit, to the amount of his note and interest thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">But it is said Smull is at all events discharged from his note, because the plaintiff, by giving notice at the sale, and averring that the purchaser took the land subject to both instalments, has elected to look to the land, and waived his resort to Smull. I do not see how this effect could flow from the conduct of the plaintiff. On the contrary, his omission to give notice might with more plausibility be contended to have this effect. The plaintiff in giving notice did no more than it was right for him <em>to do, for </em>the safety of the purchaser. A person having concurrent securities, one personal, the other binding land, does not waive the former by asserting his legal claim against the latter, unless satisfaction or something equivalent be obtained. We are therefore of opinion that the court below erred in admitting Smull as a witness for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">There is nothing in the second error. The receipt was but a part of the transaction, and receipts are open to explanation by parol evidence of what occurred at the time between the parties, and of the circumstances and conditions under which they were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
