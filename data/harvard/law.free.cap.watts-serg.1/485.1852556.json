Richards. Feigned issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-13\">The object of this issue was to ascertain whether the plaintiff or defendant was entitled to the money made by the sale of the property of William Dobson, under a judgment of <em>B. Barnly </em>v. <em>William Dobson, </em>No. 79, February Term 1839; which was the oldest judgment. The defendant claimed the money under a judgment, No. 66, September Term 1840, entered 15th of June 1840, against Dobson, in favour of J. S. <em>&amp;. </em>R. D. Peironnet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-14\">Upon the face of the records the plaintiff was entitled to the money, and the question was, whether the effect of the evidence given, was either to satisfy*the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, or postpone its lien to that of the judgment assigned to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-15\">John Clifford became the assignee of the oldest judgment, entered 5th of February 1839; and it seems from his testimony, that Dobson, by an arrangement made between them, was to convey the land, from the sale of which this money is made, to Ayres, the plaintiff, and that Ayres agreed to pay Clifford the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>amount of this judgment. At the time this arrangement was made, Dobson affirmed that there was no other lien upon the land. The deed to Ayres was executed on the 23d of June, and on the same day it was discovered that Peironnet\u2019s judgment had been entered on the 15th; when this was ascertained, Clifford, who had intended entering satisfaction on his judgment, assigned it to Ayres, Ayres having paid him, or given his note for the amount. Clifford testified that by the agreement, he was to assign the judgment to Ayres, if it became necessary for his security. He did so assign it, when he found that the deed of Dobson would not convey an unencumbered estate, as it had been agreed that it should. When Dobson affirmed there were no liens upon the land, it was agreed that the conveyance should be in full satisfaction of Clifford\u2019s judgment. Under the facts as stated by Dobson and Peironnet, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge the jury that the defendant was entitled to the money; and they relied upon the case of <em>Koons </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>(7 <em>Watts </em>20.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-4\">The court below was of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and thus instructed the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">Lewis, President.\u2014We cannot instruct as requested : the case cited, as well as the others referred to, are not applicable to <em>this </em>case. The plaintiff had a clear right to hold his judgment as a lien upon this land for his own security. He could not do this it is true, in such a manner as to prejudice another; but if there had been ho assignment, and no agreement to assign the judgment by Clifford, the court would have permitted Ayres, after paying Clifford for the judgment, to come in and be substituted as the equitable owner of the judgment, in order to protect him against the fraud which Dobson would otherwise have practised upon him. The lien of Peironnet\u2019s judgment could not be prejudiced by this arrangement. When that was entered, it was subject to the older lien of Clifford\u2019s judgment, and is not now in any way affected by the transfer of the land to Ayres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">The argument raised from the case of <em>Koons </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>destroys itself. It assumes that Ayres being the owner of the land and of the judgment, the lien of the latter was thereby extinguished, and so the judgment of Peironnet is entitled to the money. If the land belongs to Ayres, then the money cannot belong to the defendant, as it is only upon the ground that (so far as this question is concerned) the land belonged to Dobson, that it can be claimed by the defendant; for if \u00edfobson did not own the land, then the defendant is not entitled to the money for which the land was sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">If Ayres being the owner of the judgment, either by assignment, or by such payment to Clifford as would give him the control of it, had taken a deed of the land from Dobson, and- then sold and conveyed that land to another person, he would have been estopped from setting up the lien of the judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the land in the hand of his alienee. Had he attempted it, the principles laid down in the case above cited, would have been applicable. It might then with propriety have been said, that the judgment was merged in the deed: but this is not the case before us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">The court therefore instruct the jury that under the evidence, if the jury believe John Clifford, the plaintiff is clearly entitled to the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">To this charge the defendant excepted, and assigned it for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-8\"><em>Case, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApWt\">cited 7 <em>Watts </em>20; 4 <em>Kent.

Such being the rule, it disposes of the case before us without more to do. The very object of the purchaser in taking an assignment of the judgment, was to protect his estate in the land; and if the consequence of the union be not unyielding, there never was a stronger case for equitable interference; consequently, the direction of the judge was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
