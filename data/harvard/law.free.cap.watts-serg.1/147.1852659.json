John Ley had appointed assignees, and in a month or two after I appointed assignees too. Ley\u2019s assignees and my assignees came several times together to settle. Then they made a contract, George Hess and Peter Houk. If Peter would pay him they would drop $20 of the amount. That hung from time to time, and so it does yet. I had a debt of #170, and more, against William Stroh. Peter Houk left this place. George Hess came to my house and was plaguing me that I owed. I owed him a small note for meat, and if he would gain that action he would take out that note and give it to me, the balance; it was six or seven dollars, and that was the suit which Hess had on the #170 claim assigned over to him against Stroh. Hess recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>a judgment against Stroh for $140. Stroh dropped some. That hung four or five months, then my wife wanted some money, and I told her to go to Hess; she sent the boy, and he gave her $2 or $3. Four months after that then Hess would not give any, and I went down to him myself, and told him I wanted the money, and to see that note. He said I owed him something. Hess wanted to be paid for the small note for meat. I told him I wanted the balance of the note. He sued me, and I paid the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">Hess said I owed John Ley something. He said he was satisfied, and had no claim against me. He settled with Peter Houk. Hess was one of John Ley\u2019s assignees. They could not agree, and they settled. I was in the side room, and they would not let me in the room.

(Sworn in chief.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-8\">I never received a cent from Stroh. Houk never paid me. No money has been paid on this bond. It was given for a debt Houk owed me, about $307, and Stroh went bail for him. I demanded the money from him a number of times, and he did not like to pay it, and then he agreed to give me this for $235. Stroh never paid me the debt as assignee of Ley\u2019s estate. Houk never paid to me the debt for Ley\u2019s estate, he assigned the debt due to me from Stroh, before Ley assigned to me. The debt due from Houk was never paid to me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-9\">The court thus charged the jury :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">This is an action on an instrument under seal, given by defendant to the plaintiff, George Hess, which has been by him assigned to Levi Hess. The agreement purports to be given on a compromise of a claim which was due from Jacob Houk to George Hess, and also a debt due by said Houk to John Ley, which claim had been assigned by Ley to Hess as his assignee, under a voluntary assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">This is an instrument under seal, given on a compromise of both parties. It imports validity on its face and a consideration, being under seal, and binds all parties, and at law the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">The defendant alleges that there was no consideration, and that in equity he ought not to pay the debt. The court instruct you that the defendant is bound to pay this money unless he has shown to your satisfaction, that there was fraud in the procuring the bond or agreement, or a mistake in the settlement, or that the consideration has failed. Fraud must not be presumed, it must be clearly established by evidence; and we submit it to you to decide whether there was any fraud practised upon Stroh by Hess in procuring the agreement. Was he deceived ? Has he in any way been imposed upon ? Did he not know all the facts ? Is there any evidence that he did not owe a debt to Jacob Houk, does not owe this money, or did he not owe it originally to Jacob Houk? The court have seen none, nor is there any contained in the agreement. But it is alleged that Jacob Houk did not owe George Hess any thing. But it must be borne in mind, that the agreement under seal which is the plaintiff\u2019s claim, was not only for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>George Hess, but for one due to John Ley from Houk, and which was assigned to Hess. Jacob Houk has been examined as a witness,he swears that John Ley had appointed assignees and so had he, that Hess was Ley\u2019s assignee, his brother Peter was the assignee of himself. He says these assignees met several times together to settle, that they made a contract, that if Peter Houk, the assignee of Jacob, would pay him, he would drop $20; he says so it hung from that time to this, and does yet. Now, what portion of this settlement and agreement was made up of the debt due from Ley\u2019s estate does not appear. Now, supposing that there was nothing due to Hess in his own right, as has been contended, still there is nothing to show but Houk was honestly indebted to John Ley, and how much does not appear from the defendant\u2019s showing, for aught we know the amount of the agreement, <em>the </em>$235. Would it under such circumstances be right or proper for a court or jury to set aside a solemn agreement of the parties made on a compromise of all these conflicting claims, on such evidence as is before you ? When a party alleges a mistake in a settlement, he ought to point out the mistake by very clear and explicit proof, and that one party has been imposed upon, who is called upon to pay the money. Contracts of this kind ought to be treated as of some validity; their agreement is the law of the case. Would the parties make a settlement of this kind without a full knowledge of the facts ? It is not pretended that any fraud has been practised on Stroh, the defendant, but if any injustice has been done it is to Jacob Houk; and if Hess, as the assignee of Houk of this debt due him from Stroh, should collect or receive more money than was due him from Houk, he would be responsible over to the assignor, and Hess would hold it as his trustee. Houk swears that Stroh was indebted to him, and the claim was assigned to Hess.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">What injustice is there, then, in his paying his debt, for which he admits himself to be liable ? But what evidence is there that George Hess, when this agreement was made, or since, ever had been paid his debt?\u2014all there is, comes from Jacob Houk. (I will read you from my notes his testimony.) He says Hess told him he owed him nothing, except a note of six or seven dollars for a meat bill, and for that he sued him, and got a judgment. Hess said he was satisfied. When this conversation took place, does not appear; if it was after he had taken this agreement (and it would be fair to presume it was) then all would be correct, because in this agreement it is admitted Hess had received some money, and this $235 was to be paid him, besides what he had already received. He also says that Hess told him, at the time of this conversation, that he owed Ley\u2019s estate. He also says that Peter Houk, his assignee, and Hess had a settlement. They appointed Henry Grow to settle; that he was in a side-room at the tavern, and heard it. Does he swear that the debt was paid ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Does he tell how it was paid ? he certainly does not. Now, a settlement only fixes the amount due, and that is one thing, but a payment is another, and the material one to show here. If Hess was paid, how was the payment made ? you must have evidence, before you can decide that this defendant is not liable. If a party alleges a payment, he must show it, the time when, and the amount paid. No amount has been mentioned except the $141, on a judgment against Stroh, which was before this agreement, and it would be fair to infer that the parties referred to that in the agreement on which suit is brought; it was made on the 6th of February 1836, and agreement bears date the 4th day of October 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\">Mere vague declarations, and unexplained conversations should never destroy the form and effect of a written agreement under seal. A jury have a right to require some proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">I have a great aversion to disturbing settlements made between parties, and reduced to writing by them, without clear proof of a mistake. Jurors should be cautious in setting them aside, five years after they were made, and no objection heard till the party is called upon to pay the money. It would be a disgrace to the administration of justice to suffer it to be done, unless in clear case of fraud or mistake. The burden of proof is cast upon the defendant to show it. Has he done it here <em>1 </em>Are the accounts or the papers shown here <em>1 </em>Hess swears his debt against Stroh was more than $300\u2014all he received was $141. The expenses of that suit had to be paid out of it. If you believe him, there is no doubt but that the debt is due. Why did not the defendant require the production of his books, and the accounts of Ley, so that the jury could look over the figures, and see the errors ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">The counsel for the defendant have' told you, that this agreement was drawn by a respectable member of the bar. You can draw your own inferences from that. Would he have written this agreement if the parties were not all satisfied, and told him so, and how to draw their settlement ? All these are facts worthy of your consideration. If you are satified that there was no fraud or mistake in this settlement, then, under the law of the land, the plaintiff would be entitled to your verdict for the amount of the debt and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">Assignment of errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-10\">1.

The defence set up was a want of consideration in giving the writing obligatory; that George Hess, the obligee named <em>therein, </em>had actually received the debt for which it was given, previously from the principal debtor, but concealing this fact from the defendant below, and indeed going further, by representing that the debt still remained unpaid; and the defendant below having made himself liable for the payment of it as surety for the principal debtor; the plaintiff below thus induced the defendant below to give him the obligation in question. The counsel for the plaintiff, after that the defendant below had given some evidence, tending in a slight degree to prove the fact upon which the defendant rested his defence, offered George Hess as a witness, to repel and disprove the evidence so given by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s counsel, however, objected to the competency of Hess, to pi'ove what he was offered for, on the ground of interest. It was then shown that George Hess had assigned all his right and interest to and in the writing obligatory, in suit, to Levi Hess, in satisfaction of a debt which he owed him; that this action was therefore brought for the use of the said Levi Hess, as stated on the record; that all the costs which had accrued were paid into court, and a further sum of money deposited there, sufficient to cover all that should accrue. The plaintiff having shown this, alleged that George Hess could have no interest in the result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the suit, and ought for that reason to be admitted to give evidence. But the defendant still objected to his competency. The court, however, considered him a competent- witness, and accordingly overruled the objection; whereupon, the defendant excepted to the opinion of the court in this behalf. Now, in order to decide whether the opinion of the court was correct or not, it is necessary to examine first, and see what would have been the effect produced upon the liability of George Hess to Levi Hess, by a verdict and judgment having been passed in this action in favour of the defendant below, on the ground that George Hess had, before obtaining the obligation in suit, received payment in full of the debt for which it was given, from the real debtor, and that he prevailed upon the defendant, who was bound as a surety for the payment of it, but ignorant of the payment by his principal, to give him the obligation in suit, by claiming the debt as unpaid and still due to him. If this were made to appear to the satisfaction of a jury, it would clearly be such a fraud practised by George Hess upon the defendant as would avoid the obligation, and render it no better than a counterfeit. But every obligee, or holder of an obligation, who assigns it to another, especially if he does so for a valuable consideration, impliedly at least, thereby engages that it is genuine and binding upon the obligor, unless he discloses fully and truly to the assignee, in treating for the assignment, all the facts and circumstances connected with the execution and delivery of the obligation, and, after being thus advised, the assignee agrees to take it at his own risk. Hence, George Hess would have been liable, upon such implied engagement, to have paid to Levi Hess, the amount of the obligation in suit here, if the defendant had succeeded in making the defence which he set up, good before the jury. But George Hess was admitted as a witness, to give evidence for the very purpose of preventing this result; and, consequently, to prevent his becoming liable to Levi Hess for the payment of the obligation, upon his implied warranty or engagement, arising from the assignment, that it was a valid and binding obligation. Thus it appears that he was interested in the event of the suit, and that his interest was in favour of a recovery being had by the plaintiff, and therefore was an incompetent witness for him; so that the court below erred in admitting him to testify as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The second error, which is the only remaining one, is an exception to the first part of the charge of the court to the jury; in which the court state, that \u201c the agreement (meaning that upon which the plaintiiPs claim is founded) purports to be given on a compromise of a claim, which was due from Jacob Houk to George Hess, and also a debt due by said Houk to John Ley, which claim had been assigned by Ley to Hess, as his assignee, under a voluntary assignment.\u201d It is very obvious, that the court fell here into an error, in construing the agreement. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>considered it a compromise of <em>two </em>distinct claims: the first, as they say, due from Jacob Houk to George Hess, and the second due from said Houk to John Ley, which had been assigned by Ley to George Hess. Now, the agreement speaks of but one claim, which was an account that John Ley originally had against Jacob Houk, and assigned to George Hess, for the payment whereof William Stroh had, in some way, made himself liable to George Hess. This, the agreement expressly declares, was the subject of dispute between the parties to it, and that the agreement was made for the purpose of compromising and settling the dispute concerning this claim, without making the least mention of any other. The idea of there having been <em>tivo separate </em>claims compromised and settled by the agreement, is carried by the court throughout their charge to the jury. And under this erroneous impression of the import of the agreement, the court, among other things, instruct the jury, that although Houk has paid George Hess all that he owed directly to him, yet the second claim which George Hess had, as assignee of John Ley, against Houk, may have remained unpaid, and have amounted to the #235, the amount for which the obligation in suit was given. This instruction was certainly calculated to mislead the jury, because, according to the tenor of the agreement, the only claim which George Hess had against Houk, was that which had been assigned to him by Ley; so that if Houk paid off any claim, coming from him to George Hess, it ought to have been taken that it was that claim, unless other evidence had been given, showing clearly that Hess had a second or different claim against Houk, to which the evidence of payment was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Judgment reversed, and a venire <em>de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
