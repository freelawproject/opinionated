The submission is to the referees, and the award is only by two of them: therefore, the award is not made according to the submission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">The court below was of opinion that the exceptions were not filed in time, and therefore dismissed them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-11\"><em>Blanchard, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7h\">cited 6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>145; 4 <em>Watts </em>75; 9 <em>Watts </em>472; 1 <em>Bac.

But it cannot be brought within the purview of the Act of 1806, because that act requires that the parties shall agree that their submission be made a rule of court ; which is not done here, but, on the contrary, the parties bind themselves under a penalty to abide by the award, which rather leads to a contrary inference. The authority to make the reference a rule of court should appear either expressly or by plain implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">Then, although the submission might be good according to the usual practice, under the old Act of 1705, (which the Act of 1836 has re-enacted) yet the award is bad, being made by only two of the arbitrators, when the reference was to three. It, therefore, falls within the principle decided in <em>Welty </em>v. <em>Zentmyer, </em>(4 <em>Watts </em>75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">Judgment on the award reversed, and case remitted for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
