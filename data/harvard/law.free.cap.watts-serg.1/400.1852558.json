The claim is $62.36 yearly, from the 1st of April 1822, till the 1st of April 1839, with interest on each annual sum from the time it is alleged to have become due, making in all the sum of $1632.34. The distress was made upon a tract of land made up of several parcels, containing 121 acres 83 poles, more or less, in Allen township, in the possession of John Coover by his tenant, by virtue of a claim for the several sums of money above stated and alleged to be due to the defendants, as the interest upon one-third of the valuation of said land under the intestate laws as the property of said John Starr, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-10\">The said John Starr was seised at the time of his death, about the year 1800, of certain real estate consisting of three several tracts situated in Cumberland county, to wit: Two tracts partly in East Pennsborough and partly in Allen townships, containing 628 acres, and one other tract of woodland containing 68 acres more or less, situate in East Pennsborough. He left a widow, the said Magdalena, who intermarried with Valentine Shouffler, and five children, to wit: John who died soon after his father\u2019s death, William, Elizabeth, who intermarried with Henry Coover, also deceased, Jacob, and Magdalena. On the 16th of April 1803, William Starr, the eldest son of the said John Starr, presented his petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court for the partition or valuation of said real estate, agreeably to the intestate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>laws of the commonwealth. It was held under advisement by the court, and on the 31st of May 1803, an inquest was'awarded. In pursuance of the said writ of partition or valuation, Robert Grayson, high sheriff, duly made inquisition on the 16th June 1803, finding that the lands could not be parted and divided, and appraising the same, the large tract (embracing two tracts) at the sum of $14,798, the other at the sum of $149.33, and the inquisition was returned 26th July 1803, to the Orphans\u2019 Court on that day, as appears by an endorsement on the inquisition, \u201con motion to the court postponed until the first day of the next term.\u201d The following further endorsement is on the inquisition; \u201c29th of August 1803, on motion the court confirmed the valuation to William Starr the petitioner \u201d <em>\u201cper </em>curiam.\u201d No entry of this return or the endorsement are to be found on the docket, and no further proceedings appear by the docket to have been had thereon until the following 1st of December 1805; at an Orphans\u2019 Court then held it is thus contained: Jacob Starr, brother and heir at law of William Starr, late of East Pennsborough township, deceased, preferred a petition stating that the petitioner\u2019s brother, William Starr, lately died intestate without issue, leaving the petitioner and Henry Coover, son and only heir at law of Elizabeth Coover, deceased, late Elizabeth Starr, sister and heir at law of the said intestate\u2014seised in his demise as of fee of and in a certain messuage and tract of land with the appurtenances, containing 230 acres, situate in East Pennsborough township.

Inquest was awarded April 1st 1806, an inquisition was held finding that the land could not be divided, and it was appraised at $24.38 per acre. It being stated to the court that the said tract contained more land than was stated in the petition, William Ramsey was appointed an artist to re-survey the land and report the quantity, and the proceedings were held under advisement by the court. April 1st 1806, at an Orphans\u2019 Court, Jacob Starr brother of William Starr, came into court and prayed the court to confirm to him the real estate of his brother William held under advisement at the last court.

Starr and Zug, who had been owners of two of the parts, were compelled to pay not only their own shares, but also that portion which should have been paid by the plaintiff, who owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>another part; and the only question is, whether they may not be substituted to the w'idow\u2019s right of distress, to compel the plaintiff to pay his share. Substitution is an equitable remedy to prevent circuity of action, and will be resorted to in every case, where one in the character of a surety is compelled to pay money for another; and the remedy is one resorted to, not only for the purpose of enabling the person paying to collect the debt from him who should have paid it, but also to put him in possession of all the facilities for collection, which the original creditor had\u2014hence, in the case of <em>Croft </em>v. <em>Moore, (9 Watts </em>451) it is held, that one surety may be substituted to a plaintiff\u2019s rights, in a judgment against two sureties, although an action would lie for contribution. There seems to be no reason why there should not, in this case, be a right of substitution to the remedy which the widow had, by which she compelled the defendants to pay the whole amount of her annuity; 4 <em>Johns.

The estate consisted of between six and seven hundred acres of land, which was divided by the eldest son, after it was decreed to him, into three parcels, two of which he sold, one to his brother Jacob Starr, and the second to his brother-in-law Henry Coover. The third he retained till his death; when his brother Jacob, as one of his heirs, became the owner of it under a decree of the same Orphans\u2019 Court. Jacob Starr subdivided all that he acquired, and sold the most, if not the whole of it, to various persons. In making some of his sales, he left in the hands of the purchasers as much of the purchase money as would enable them to pay their respective proportions of the interest coming to the widow, taking from them, however, a security that they would do so, and at her death pay the principal to himself. Henry Coover disposed of his nearly in a similar manner. At the time the distress was made, there was no interest in arrear or due to the widow or her husband. All that had become payable, had been paid either to her or her husband, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Jacob Starr, John Zug, or some other of the holders of the land. The only question then, which arises in the case is, whether the widow and her husband, who are the plaintiffs in error, had a right to make or cause a distress to be made on the goods of the plaintiff below, who is the defendant in error, for the use of those who it was alleged, had paid beyond their due proportion, to the amount of what it was claimed, he, as a holder of part of the land, ought to have paid, but had failed to do so. It is very clear that the widow had no claim, when the distress was made, as she had been fully paid all that was previously due to her. Distress may be regarded as <em>festinum remedium, </em>when not founded upon the previous judgment of a tribunal established for the purpose of administering justice, and being given to the party claiming to be <em>redressed </em>by means of it, to be administered in some degree according to his or her will and judgment in the matter, it would, therefore, seem to be right not to extend it beyond the occasion or the necessity which induced the granting of it, or permit it to be exercised for the benefit of those who do not stand precisely in the situation, in every respect, of the party who was designed to be protected by it. Generally, it is given only in cases where assessments are made to supply the public wants, or rents becoming due annually, under leases made of lands, or under a partition of lands between co-parceners for owelty of the same, or where rent is granted to a widow out of lands, of which she is dowable, in lieu of dower; the law considers the rent or owelty in such cases a <em>charge of common right, </em>because a valuable consideration, that is, a right that the party had in the lands charged has been given for it, and therefore, the law gives a remedy by distress for the recovery of it; <em>Lit. Sec. 58, 213, 214, </em>216; 1 <em>Inst. 47 a, 142 a, </em>169 <em>b; Gilb. on Rents </em>20; or in case of another\u2019s cattle <em>damage feasant, </em>the right of distress is given from the necessity of the thing itself, as otherwise it might be impossible at a future time to ascertain whose cattle they were that committed the trespass or damage. 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>6. Although the law gives the lessor a right to distrain, it will not permit the like right to be exercised by the lessee, if he assigns his term reserving a rent, or taking a stipulation from the assignee that he shall pay the rent to the lessor as it shall become payable; <em>2 Wils. 375; </em>and it is said by Mr. Archbold, that the lessee will not be permitted to distrain in such case, even if the deed of assignment contains a clause of distress. 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>6, <em>note </em>(1). Now if it be, that the lessee, who may have paid the rent due to his lessor, cannot distrain upon his assignee for the rent reserved to himself, in order to reimburse what he paid to the lessor, it would seem to indicate that his position is not entitled to the same favour as that of his lessor. And if he cannot distrain under an express reservation of an authority to do so, it is difficult to comprehend upon what ground he shall be permitted to use the name of his lessor for recovering the rent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>by way of distress, reserved to himself, or the lessor shall be permitted, after being paid the rent coming to himself, to distrain for the benefit of his lessee. So, if there be lord and tenant by fealty and certain rent, and the lord by deed grant the rent in fee, saving the fealty, and grant further, by the same deed, that the grantee may distrain for the same rent in the tenancy, albeit a distress were incident to the rent in the hands of the grantor, and although the tenant attorn to the grant, yet the grantee can not distrain; because the distress cannot be separated from the seigniory. 1 <em>Inst. </em>150 <em>b. </em>These authorities go to show that the right of distress can only be exercised where a particular relationship exists between the parties, and that the party invested with such right cannot transfer it without transferring also along with it the interest to which it is incident; or that the party who was liable to pay the rent and to be distrained for it, on account of his situation, cannot devest himself of that situation by making an assignment of his interest in the land charged with the rent, and at the same time thereby secure to himself a right to distrain on his assignee. And when the lord or the lessor has actually been paid the whole of the rent due by those who were bound to do so, his right to distrain must be considered as gone in regard to that which has been so paid; and upon no principle known, either to the law or equity, can he be permitted to exercise it for the benefit of those whose relative situation, in regard to the duty was such that the policy of the law would not even allow them to stipulate on their own behalf for the exercise of it in their own names. The right on the part of the widow to distrain, in <em>the </em>case before us, was given by law not only from a consideration of the great meritoriousness of her claim upon her husband's estate for a support during her natural life, but likewise from the consideration, that unless the remedy were put into her own hands, to be administered by h\u00e9rself, as her necessities might require it, she might be without the means of support, and the first and great object of the annuity given to her, in some degree defeated by delay in making payment of it to her. But as long as it is promptly paid to her, she cannot distrain, nor can there be any occasion for it. Her wants being supplied, to the full extent of her right under the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, by those who either had been or were bound to do so, she has no occasion to concern further with the matter, nor right to make a distress for the purpose, as it is claimed here, of administering justice to those who paid her, on the ground that they, as they allege, paid more than their proportion of the annuity coming to her, or that which the plaintiff\" below ought to have paid. This, certainly her necessity did not require, nor does it seem to have been within the contemplation of the law giving her the right of distress. Besides this, it involves questions of fact and of law, which seem to be opposed to the exercise of the right for such purpose. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>cannot be exercised so as to do justice to the several holders of the land charged with the widow\u2019s annuity, without having it equally or justly apportioned among them, according to the relative value which each one\u2019s share bears to the primitive value of the whole quantity of land. But this neither the widow nor the court has the means of ascertaining; it is a question of fact which can only be determined by a reference of it to a jury. <em>Hodgkins </em>v. <em>Robson, </em>(1 Ventr. 276); <em>Gilb. on Rents </em>189. Then unless the amount for which the distress is to be made can be reduced to certainty it is not clear that a distress can be made on account of it. For it is a maxim in law, that no distress in general can be taken for any duty or services that are not stated with certainty, or so at least as to be capable of being rendered certain; for <em>oportet quod certa res deducatur in judicium. </em>1 <em>Inst. </em>96 <em>a. </em>A question of law also may arise, whether it be competent for the original or other tenant of the land, in such case, by his own act, after dividing it into several parcels, to sell and convey the same so divided to different persons, and by doing so to apportion the annuity among them, so that a separate distress may be made on each for his proportion thereof. I take it that he cannot bind the annuitant to observe any apportionment which he may attempt to make in this way; nor yet can she avail herself of it even if she were willing to do so. This would be more than the lessee, yielding a rent service for the land he occupies, could do; though his lessor, it would seem, may by a grant of part of the reversion to a stranger, apportion the rent between himself and the stranger, because the rent is incident, in such .case, to the reversion, so that by parting the reversion the rent is apportioned. 1 <em>Inst. </em>148 <em>a. </em>This, however, cannot be done by the grantee of a- rent charge, which rent, in this particular, somewhat resembles the annuity here; consequently, I take it that neither the tenant of the land in this case, nor yet the widow or annuitant, can divide and apportion the annuity. The annuity here, then, being an entire sum, and incapable of apportionment, and.the right of distress being given by the Act of Assembly for that entire sum, one distress only, if sufficient goods are to be found, can be taken for it. <em>Anon. Moo. </em>7; <em>Anon. Cro. Eliz. </em>13; <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Savill, (Lutw. </em>1536). But it is said that in the present case a sufficient portion of the purchase money, to be paid by each tenant of the land for his portion thereof, was left in his hands to enable him, by using it, to pay all that is required. Admitting, however, this to be so, still, as it appears that the widow has been satisfied the amount secured to her by the Act of Assembly and the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, she can have no right to distrain for any greater amount, or any thing above that sum. If Jacob Starr, in disposing of the land, intended to make a further provision in her favour, the right of distress given by the Act of Assembly cannot be extended to that. But, in truth, it would seem that the distress here was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>made for the benefit of Jacob Starr, and not the widow. Stili, however, whether it was for his or her benefit, the remedy by distress is not the one which must be resorted to for the purpose of recovering it. But above all, it is a powerful objection to the distress being made for the claim of the plaintiffs in this case, that no authority or case has been adduced by their counsel going to support it, nor \u00e1m I aware of an instance in which there has been a subrogation by either a court of law or equity to the remedy by distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
