Appeal by defendants from the judgment of a justice of the peace entered to August Term 1840, when Mr Reed appeared for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-8\">1840, September 9th, at an adjourned court. Rule at the instance of the plaintiff to show cause why this appeal should not be stricken off. Returnable at November Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-9\">The ground of the motion to strike off the appeal was, that Thomas M\u2019Creary, Esq., who was the justice before whom the cause was tried, was the surety in the recognizance of defendants to prosecute the appeal, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-10\">When the case came up for hearing before the court, on the rule to show cause, the defendants made the following proposition in writing, which at their request was ordered to be filed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-11\">\u201c 26th November 1840, the defendants now in open court, offer to give any recognizance <em>instanter </em>which the court may require: sureties now present: and they resist the dismissal of the appeal. They also object that by the delay to make the motion, they have incurred costs. Also, that the recognizance is valid as it stands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-12\">It was admitted that Thomas M\u2019Creary, the surety in the recognizance, was the justice, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-13\">The court made the rule absolute, and so struck off the appeal:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-14\">Errors assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-15\">1. The court erred in refusing to take a new recognizance if they deemed the one before taken to be defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-16\">2. They erred in adjudging the original recognizance to be defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-17\">3. They erred in sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s application after the term to which the appeal was entered, when the defendants had been compelled to employ counsel, as was evidenced by the appearance previously entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-18\">4. They erred in granting a rule in the first place to show cause why the appeal should not be stricken off. It should have been in the <em>alternative, </em>if the recognizance was not perfected.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-19\"><em>Reed, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgV\">relied upon the cases in 16 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>349; 2 <em>Penn.

It does not appear that the appellee was too late with his motion to quash, an adjourned court being part of the term; but it is clear that it ought not to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Order to quash reversed, and appeal reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
