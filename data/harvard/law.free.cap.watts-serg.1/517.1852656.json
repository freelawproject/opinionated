This was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>in which the question arose whether there was any cause of action laid in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\">\n<em>Columbia County, ss,</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-9\">Jesse Funstone, late of the county of Columbia, yeoman, was summoned to answer Mary Strawbridge of a plea that he render unto her $475, that he owes and unjustly detains, &amp;c. \"And whereupon the said Mary Strawbridge, by Joshua W. Comly, her attorney, comes and complains for that whereas heretofore, to wit, on the twentieth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, at the county of Columbia aforesaid, certain differences having arisen, and being depending between one William Strawbridge, (then and there being intermarried with the said Mary Strawbridge, plaintiff in this suit,) and one Hugh Allen, and the said Jesse Funstone, of and concerning the valuation and owelty of partition of certain lands, situate in Derry township, in the county of Columbia; of which said lands, the said Mary Strawbridge, (before her intermarriage with the said William Strawbridge,) and the said Hugh Allen and Jesse Funstone, had made partition and division among themselves. That afterwards, to wit, on the twentieth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, at the county of Columbia aforesaid, the said William Strawbridge,'Hugh Allen, and Jesse Funstone, referred all matters in variance between them, of and concerning the valuation and owelty of partition of the said lands above-mentioned, to Thomas Woodside, John F. Ross, Mathew Calvin, John Blee, and Andrew M\u2019Reynolds, arbitrators, indifferently chosen by them, the said William Strawbridge, Hugh Allen, and Jesse Funstone. That afterwards, to wit, on the day and year last aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, the said Thomas Woodside, John F. Ross, Mathew Calvin, John Blee, and Andrew M\u2019Reynolds, arbitrators, chosen as aforesaid, made their certain award in writing; whereby they, the said arbitrators, awarded and directed that the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Hugh Allen and Jesse Funstone should jointly pay to the said Mary Strawbridge, the just sum of $475. That afterwards, to wit, the same day and year last aforesaid, at the county of Columbia aforesaid, the said William Strawbridge, Hugh Allen, and Jesse Funstone, by their deed underwritten the said award, so made as aforesaid by the said Thomas Woodside, John F. Ross, Mathew Calvin, John Blee, and Andrew M\u2019Reynolds, bound themselves, under their hands and seals, to be bound by the same award; which said award, together with the said deed underwritten the same, the said Mary Strawbridge here brings into court, &amp;c. And the said Mary Strawbridge further avers, that before the commencement of this suit, to wit, on the twentieth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty, at the county aforesaid, the said William Strawbridge and the said Hugh Allen both died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">Nevertheless, the said Jesse Funstone and the said Hugh Allen, in the lifetime of the said Hugh Allen, (although often required,) the aforesaid sum of #475 to the said William Strawbridge and Mary Strawbridge, or either of them, in the lifetime of the said William Strawbridge, or to the said Mary Strawbridge, after the death of the said William Strawbridge, yet hath not rendered, bat the same to the said William Strawbridge and Mary Straw-bridge, to render hitherto have altogether refused, and the same to the said Mary Strawbridge to render, the said Jesse Funstone still doth refuse.

The amount was awarded exclusively to herself; and as her husband might recover it, or leave it to her chance of survivorship, his death placed her as she would have stood had she herself entered into the submission when sole, and remained so. It appears, therefore, that a good cause of action was set out on the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
