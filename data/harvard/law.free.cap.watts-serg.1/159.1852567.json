After the lapse of six months, an execution issued to the constable upon the judgment against Ford &amp; Whitterman; upon which he made return, \u201c No goods; Whitterman sick, and not able to be removed, and Ford not to be found.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">The defendant in this suit contended that this was not a sufficient return to fix him for the money: and the court below was of that opinion, and instructed the jury to find for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-10\"><em>J.

The <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>is necessary to ground the <em>scire facias, </em>but only to give notice to the bail, that their principals are demanded; and, the object being to fix the bail, it is never served. It has the four days in the sheriff\u2019s office, and is returned <em>7wn est inventus, </em>as a matter of course. But a plaintiff has, by the terms of such a recognizance, a right to demand all the defendants ; and if they are not all forthcoming, the bail are answerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>for it. They are special gaolers of their principals, at their own request; and are liable for the non-production of any of them, as the sheriff would be. Now, it has been ruled, that if there be two in execution, and one of them escape, though the other remain in prison, yet shall the sheriff be liable for the debt, because each body is a separate and distinct pledge for it; and it is therefore fixed upon him if either escape. <em>Roll.
