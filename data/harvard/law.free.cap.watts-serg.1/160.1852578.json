Whether, when the husband of a widow dies intestate, seised of real estate, and that property is divided among the heirs on a valuation by order of Orphans\u2019 Court, and the widow recovers her.dower out of such real estate, she can recover.\u00a1her dower at common law, out of lands of which her husband was. seised during coverture, but. aliened by him before his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-11\">2. Whether, when lands are sold at Orphans\u2019 Court sale, thus aliened, the purchaser takes them discharged of the widow\u2019s dower at common law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-12\">3. Whether, after a widow has recovered a verdict in an action of dower, and issues a <em>sci. fa. </em>to revive the judgment of dower and have a writ of seisin, the defendant is not concluded by that verdict from denying her right to the writ of seisin and having her dower set off to her. If the last question should be decided in favour of the plaintiff in this case, the two former propositions need not now be considered in the decision of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-13\">It appears from the facts in the case\u2019stated, that Tobias Stoever, the husband of the plaintiff, died in September 1824; that, at November Term, 1824, an inquest was awarded upon his real estate; and in March 1825, the heirs gave a recognizance in the Orphans\u2019 Court an,d took the property at the valuation. To April Term, 1825, No. 12r this action of dower was brought, and a Verdict and judgment given, 11th June 1828, which was afterwards affirmed by the Supreme Court. Under this- state of facts, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to have her writ of seisin: for, admitting for argument\u2019s sake, that the first position of defendant\u2019s counsel is correct, and by her accepting, the dower under the statute, she is barred at common law, still a\u2019 court of competent jurisdiction have decided that she is not, and. that decision now stands unreversed. She must have made her election before that suit was brought, at all events before the. trial, because the case stated admits she received the interest annually ..from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>1825 to this time, and if she made her election before trial and after suit brought, the defendant should have pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>when it would have been received by the court, if there was any thing in the defence, and it had been a legal ground to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">For the purposes of this cause, the court are bound to presume that defence was shown and the court adjudicated on the same; we cannot go back of the judgment. It has been determined that all these matters do not bar her of dower, at least the court are bound to infer so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">For these reasons we think the first and third propositions are disposed of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">As to the second, the terre-tenants purchased the land at Orphans\u2019 Court sale, after the verdict and judgment in dower and when they had full notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. It was a judicial sale of all the interest of the deceased; that was sold and no more, and subject to all existing incumbrances; and the right of dower was a legal incumbrance, and could not be barred by 21 years\u2019 possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">The court,, therefore, render judgment of revival on the <em>sci. fa., </em>and order that a writ of seisin in dower issue; they also order a substitution of the heirs of Peter Leinaweaver on the record.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-10\"><em>Weidman, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkP\">cited <em>Act of </em>1764, <em>sections </em>2, 8, 9, 10; 3 <em>Smith\u2019s Laws </em>156; <em>Act of </em>1794; 3 <em>Smith\u2019s Laws </em>148, <em>sec.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af1\">The argument to prove this a case of election, is that when the widow accepted her share of the intestate\u2019s estate under the statute of distribution in the Orphans\u2019 court, she received, as an equivalent for her dower in the land aliened by her husband, her third part of the purchase money which had gone into the mass of his estate either as personal property or other land bought with it; and, consequently, that she ought not to have both her dower and the price of it. But was any part of the purchase money the price of her dower <em>1 </em>In the supposition that it was lies the fallacy. Take the strongest case possible'\u2014'the case of a sale by the husband without his wife\u2019s co-operation, followed by his death and intestacy before payment of the bonds taken for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the purchase money\u2014and it will still result that she would be entitled, not only to a third of them as part of his personal estate, but to dower in the land also; nor can it be thought that she would thus have a double satisfaction. Why was her dower left in the land <em>1 </em>Evidently because the husband had no power over it, and it was therefore neither sold nor paid for. Then, his interest alone having been sold, the purchase money paid for it is an equivalent for nothing else; and this consideration practically enters into the contemplation of the husband and his vendee in the concoction of the bargain. No man gives as much for an estate encumbered with an incipient right of dower as he would give if it were free from it; and the chances of the wife\u2019s survivorship, where she is not a party to the deed, are calculated and deducted from the purchaser\u2019s estimate of the unencumbered value. What he buys and pays for, then, is not the title unaffected by the wife\u2019s contingent interest in it, but the husband\u2019s part of it exclusively, being what the husband can part with independently of her concurrence and will. When, therefore, his exclusive portion of the estate is converted into money, why should she not stand in relation to the produce of it as she does to any other part of his personal property <em>1 </em>Should he die intestate while it remains personal, she would get a third of it absolutely; or if he should have invested it in land again, she would have acquired an additional estate of dower by it, and she would also retain her dower in the tract sold. It may perhaps be thought that she might in this way, if the principle were sound, gain the whole purchase money in the shape of land by repeated conversions of it; but to suppose so is fallacious, because each re-purchase would be successively less in value than the preceding one by the ratio of the dower taken out of the preceding sale till the reinvestments would, in the end, be frittered away to almost nothing; and the value of her dower in all the tracts thus successively purchased, would eventually be no more than her interest in the price of the tract first sold. There might be such a case, but it would never happen in practice. A widow, therefore, retains her dower reserved in her husband\u2019s conveyance\u2014for it is reserved when it is not parted with\u2014as her proper estate, and not as a part of the husband\u2019s ; and when she claims what also is hers by the intestate laws, the heirs cannot compel her to bring such dower into hotchpot. Neither can her husband\u2019s alienee object that she has received an equivalent for it from the husband\u2019s estate. For whose benefit would she relinquish her dower <em>1 </em>For the benefit, not of the husband\u2019s representatives, but of a stranger to them./ She calls on him for what she purchased by her marriage, and what he has not paid for; and it is no matter to him that she has received her share of another part of the husband\u2019s estate elsewhere. There is no election in such a case, and she may take both. The other part of the defence is still more palpably unfounded. It never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>was before imagined that dower consummate by the death of the husband, could be devested by any judicial sale except for his debts; and in no other country or state than Pennsylvania, is the sale of even an initiate right of dower for his debts an exception. The award of a writ of seisin against the vendee\u2019s heirs, was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
