Beside, the record notice contemplated by the act, ought to appear among the docket entries of the preceding five years; for to keep the minutes of each consecutive <em>scire facias, or </em>act of revival, as a part of the original suit, is not sufficient, because a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>chaser would not be so apt to find them there as in their proper place. That the agreement, for an amicable- <em>scire facias </em>and judgment is not itself notice, is a consequence <em>of Black </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>94) in which a <em>cesset </em>which had- not been placed upon the docket, was not allowed to hinder the, limitation of the lien from, beginning to run. ...
