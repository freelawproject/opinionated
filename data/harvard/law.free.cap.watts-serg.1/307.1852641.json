(Signed) John Snevily.\u201d That on the day said note fell due, a demand was made for payment on Mr Perdue, the drawer, who refused to pay, and notice thereof was, on the same day, given to said John Snevily, and the note was then duly protested; of which notice was also given to said Snevily. In consideration thereof, he, the said Snevily, then and there became liable to pay the amount of said note, when he should be thereunto afterwards required. Wherefore the said John Snevily became liable to pay the said sum of $93.05, with interest from 22d of February 1839, and costs of protest, $1.37^.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-9\">Plaintiff gave in evidence the note and endorsement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-10\">\u201c $93 Tfjy <em>Mount Holly Furnace, Dec. 21st, </em>1838.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-11\">Sixty days after date I promise to pay to the order of John Johnston, ninety-three dollars and <em>Th&gt; </em>without defalcation, for value received.

Woodburn sworn. I knew Mentor Perdue, at Mount Holly Iron Works, Cumberland county, in 1837 and 1838. In the latter part of the year 1838, his property was sold out by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the sheriff of Cumberland county. I understood him to be insolvent. He went from there to Lancaster county. He carried on Mount Holly Iron Works. He was insolvent in January 1839. I do not know where he was after he left Cumberland county. I understood him to have a great many debts. He left Cumberland in the winter of 1838 or \u20199; I do not know that he had left before February.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">The court was requested to charge the jury on the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-7\">1. That said defendant not being a <em>party </em>to the note, it was therefore necessary and material to plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery to <em>aver </em>and <em>prove </em>a consideration for his said guaranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-8\"><em>2. </em>That the said defendant not being a party to the said note, and being merely a <em>guarantor, </em>it was incumbent on the plaintiff <em>to </em>resort for recovery of the amount <em>thereof, </em>in <em>the first place, </em>and before proceeding against said defendant, to the drawer of it, or else to aver and prove, and at all events to <em>prove </em>the <em>insolvency </em>of said drawer, at the time said note fell due, as an excuse and reason for not proceeding against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-9\">3. That the contract of guaranty made by defendant, on which this suit is founded, was specially limited to John Johnston, with whom it was made, and cannot be enforced in favour of Johnston\u2019s assignee, the present plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-10\">4. The statement does not contain the sufficient and necessary averments of a consideration to the defendant for his undertaking, and of the insolvency of the drawer of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-11\">Parsons, President. \u2014 1. The court answer the first point in the negative, and say that the law is not therein correctly stated; that by the guaranty being made in writing, on the part of the defendant, to pay to the plaintiff the amount of the note, it is a new undertaking ; a consideration is presumed sufficient to authorize the plaintiff to recover; the act of thus writing a guaranty, imports a consideration, and casts the burden of proof on the defendant, to show a want of consideration; this objection cannot so far prevail as to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, under the facts now disclosed in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-12\"><em>2. </em>In answer to the second point thus submitted, the court instruct the jury, if they <em>believe </em>that Perdue was insolvent in February of 1839, and also when this suit was brought, this objection cannot prevail; and the plaintiff can recover if the maker was insolvent and unable to pay the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-13\">3. To the third point the court say that this action is now brought in the name of Johnston, for the use of Rehum; and the court refuse to give the direction prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-14\">4. In answer to the fourth point thus submitted, the court say that the statement or narr. is sufficient to authorize the plaintiff to recover, as the case is now presented, and under the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ings, if the jury should find the facts in his favour, and therefore refuse to answer this point in favour of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">The counsel for the defendant excepted to the charge of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-7\">Assignment of errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-8\">1.

It does not of itself import a consideration, so as to cast upon the defendant the burthen of proving a negative. The defendant was not a party to the note, but a stranger to it and its consideration; which is a different case entirely from that where the guaranty is by a party to the instrument. 2 <em>Watts </em>128; 4 <em>Watts </em>448; 2 <em>Halst. </em>116; 3 <em>Penn.

Where the guaranty or promise, though collateral to the principal contract, is made at the same time with the principal contract, and becomes ah essential ground of the credit given to the principal debtor, the whole is one original and entire transaction, and the consideration extends and sustains the promise of the principal debtor, and also of the guarantor. No other consideration need be shown, than that for the original agreement upon which the whole debt rested. This principle was first decided in <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Vredenburgh, (8 Johns. </em>29); since recognized in 11 <em>Johns. </em>221, 13 <em>Johns. </em>175; and by Justice Story, in <em>D\u2019Wolf </em>v. <em>Rabaud, </em>(1 <em>Peters\u2019s Rep. </em>501.) The only difficulty is to show that the guaranty was made at the same time with the principal contract. The note is given by Perdue, and made payable to the order of Johnston. On the back of the note is written, \u201c I guarantee the within note to John Johnston\u201d; this is signed by John Snevily. The note is also endorsed by John Johnston. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the want of all direct proof of the consideration paid to Snevily, it is difficult to understand the transaction, except on the supposition that it was an entire contract: and that Snevily, for some reason which has not been explained, as between him and Perdue and Johnston, undertook to guarantee the payment of the note. There is no date to the guaranty; the writing, therefore, imported on the face of it, (as in <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Vredenburgh) </em>an original and entire transaction; for a guaranty of a contract implies, <em>ex vi termini, </em>that it was a concurrent act, and part of the original agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
