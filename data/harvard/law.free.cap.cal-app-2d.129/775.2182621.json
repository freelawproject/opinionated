The evidence supports these findings, contrary to plaintiff-appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Two parcels of land in San Joaquin County, known to the parties as the Tracy ranch, stood in the name of Sebastian Lombardi as sole owner. In 1933 he borrowed $5,700, secured by deeds of trust on these two parcels. His wife Candida signed the notes with him and joined in the execution of the deeds of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">By September, 1937, the unpaid balance of this debt amounted to $2,800. Plaintiff went with his father to the office of the obligee, paid the amount due, and received and retained in his own possession the cancelled notes and the deeds of reconveyance. Candida was not present upon that occasion and there is no evidence that she was at the time-aware of this transaction. This supports the finding that she made no express promise to repay plaintiff. At most it would support (defendant concedes it does support) an implied promise, an obligation imposed by law, to repay. Subsequent events bear out this view of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">From the time plaintiff made this $2,800 advance until about April, 1941, checks for gas royalties accruing from time to time in respect to the Tracy ranch, were delivered or mailed to plaintiff. Until March 21, 1939, plaintiff cashed these cheeks and kept the proceeds, amounting to $982.69, which he treats as a credit in part payment of his $2,800 claim. Sebastian died early in 1941. In April, 1941, Candida, executrix of Sebastian\u2019s will, caused the mailing of the gas checks to plaintiff to be discontinued. Upon that occasion, Candida told her attorney that plaintiff had been paid long ago; hearsay evidence, but it went'in without objection. The fact that plaintiff did not cash the gas checks which he received after March, 1939, lends support to Candida\u2019s statement. In 1947, as the result of a title search incident to a proposed sale of the Tracy ranch, Candida\u2019s attorney discovered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>lack of a reconveyance of record. Accordingly, he obtained deeds of reconveyance and had them recorded. He had no knowledge that similar deeds had been previously issued nor is there evidence that Candida knew of the deeds first issued or that plaintiff had them. Later, Candida sold the ranch. Defendant testified, without objection, that her mother Candida told her there was nothing due Steve. Neither in Sebastian\u2019s will nor in Candida\u2019s was there any reference to this claim. Also, plaintiff did not present this claim during the probate of his father\u2019s estate. Indeed, during that probate proceeding he bought 15 shares of bank stock at $100 per share, paying the executrix, Candida, cash in full, without any offset or credit against the claim here involved. Neither Candida\u2019s attorney nor her executrix was aware of plaintiff\u2019s claim until asserted by him after Candida\u2019s death. She died in November, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Thus far there is no evidence of an express promise by Candida to repay; some evidence that plaintiff has been fully repaid, and no evidence of any fact that would toll the statute of limitations.  Plaintiff attaches some significance to testimony of his son, Stephen, and his brother, August. The son said that in 1948 or 1949 he heard Candida tell plaintiff \u201cnot to worry about the money that was due my father, as soon as she had a few debts straightened out, she would straighten it out with him.\u201d The brother testified, concerning a conversation between plaintiff and Candida a year or so before the latter\u2019s death: \u201cWell, Steve claimed that he had the money coming. \u2022 I don\u2019t know the exact amount, but my mother said that she would pay him when she was able to.\u201d That was not sufficient to toll the statute or to start it running anew, because the \u20181 acknowledgment or promise\u201d was not \u201ccontained in some writing, signed by the party to be charged thereby.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 360.)  Plaintiff would construe these conversations as evidence of a promise made in the beginning (1937) \u201cto pay when able.\u201d But the trier of the facts did not so view this testimony. Nor was he required to do so, especially in the absence of evidence that Candida at the time of plaintiff\u2019s payment made any promise of any kind in respect to its repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The obligation to repay which the law imposed upon Candida under the circumstances described was one which became immediately due and payable. (See cases collected in 16 Cal.Jur. 523, Limitation of Actions, \u00a7 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>That started the two-year statute running in September, 1937, this being an obligation \u201cnot founded upon an instrument of writing.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 339, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">It is unnecessary to consider additional grounds urged by defendant in support of the judgment, which for the reasons indicated, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
