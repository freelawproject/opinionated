We of course must disregard conflicting testimony of defendant that the complaining witness had struck him first. Such testimony merely raised a conflict in the evidence which was for the determination of the trier of fact who disbelieved defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>DeVaughn, </em>136 Cal.App. 746, 752 [29 P.2d 914]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 669, 672 [4] [229 P.2d 836]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Huston, </em>21 Cal.2d 690, 693 [1] [134 P.2d 758].)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Moore, P. J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-14\">Pursuant to settled rules the record is viewed in the light most favorable to sustain the findings of the trier of fact. Where there is a conflict in the evidence the evidence most favorable to sustaining the judgment is accepted as true and contrary evidence disregarded. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Renek, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 277, 281 [233 P.2d 43].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
