The action is for property damage resulting from a fire alleged to have been caused by the negligence of Anthony Lupella, an employee of defendant. The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">On April 12, 1946, plaintiffs owned a one-story double building in Los Angeles. One half of the building was leased to and occupied by defendant which was engaged in the manufacture of floor and wall furnaces and heaters. The other half was occupied by plaintiffs who were engaged in the manufacture of lamps. Defendant had about 25 employees. At 2 \u00a130 p. m. on that date the fire was started, resulting in total damages to plaintiffs in the stipulated sum of $122,081.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">At the time of the fire and for several months prior thereto, Lupella had been an employee of defendant. Defendant had given orders prohibiting smoking on the floor of the shop, but had permitted its employees to smoke in the washroom. It was Lupella\u2019s practice to go to the washroom four or five times a day to smoke. The day before the fire while working in defendant\u2019s paint booth he had taken the fluid out of his cigarette lighter and had painted \u25a0 the lighter. Defendant, to Lupella\u2019s knowledge, maintained spatter thinner, a highly volatile, inflammable, and dangerous substance, in a 50-gallon drum next to the paint booth and adjacent to an aisle used for access to the washroom\u2014in a portion of the shop where smoking was prohibited. The drum was at an angle of about 40 or 45 degrees. There was a spigot in the drum for releasing the thinner. It was not the spring-closing type of outlet to which you have to apply pressure on the handle to allow the outlet to remain open and when the pressure is released <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the outlet is automatically closed. There was a \u201cdrip can\u201d about 12 inches in diameter under the spigot of the thinner drum. There were no signs adjacent to the drum. There was a fire extinguisher near it. There were at least two more fire extinguishers on the floor; the record does not clearly disclose their location. The thinner was used by the painters more or less continuously. Some paint was kept behind the paint booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">About 2:30 p. m. on the day of the fire, Lupella left his work station and proceeded to the washroom to use its facilities and to smoke. Having no matches and wishing to smoke while he was in the washroom, he stopped at the thinner drum to fill his lighter with fluid. There were about 20 or 25 gallons of thinner in the drum. Lupella testified: 1 \u2018 [W] e were</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">not allowed to smoke on the floor, so every time I wanted to smoke I went up to the washroom. The day before the fire I had my cigarette lighter painted, and I took the juice out of it. Well, I wanted to go for a smoke, and I wanted to put some juice in the lighter so I can smoke a cigarette, because I didn\u2019t have any matches, so what I did was I went to the thinner drum, and I opened up the spigot a little, just dripping; so I turned the lighter upside down and took the cap off; and then I accidentally pressed the button, and it sparked, and it ignited the thinner, so I got hysterical and I dropped the lighter in the pan underneath the spigot and it started to blaze, and I yelled, \u2018Fire.\u2019 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">\u201cSo Mr. Pardee, the shop foreman, he came over with a fire extinguisher, and he asked me to shut the spigot off. Well, when I tried to put out the fire, my clothes caught on fire and I got burned, slightly burned on my hand and my legs, and I burned my clothes; and he asked me to hit the spigot, and I couldn\u2019t move it with my hand because it was on fire, so I tried to hit it with my foot. When I hit it with my foot, I knocked the spigot off, and then it started flowing more, and it blazed the fire up to the crates, and the crates caught fire, and I ran for a fire extinguisher, and there was no controlling the fire, so they called the fire engines, and Mr. Pardee told me to leave the shop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">After Lupella left the building, an explosion occurred. He had used spatter thinner from the drum before as fluid for his cigarette lighter. He \u201cknew thinner would be best for the lighter.\u201d He knew the thinner was a good fuel for his cigarette lighter because he had used it when he was in the Air Force. He remained in the employ of defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>about two months after the fire, when he voluntarily quit his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Defendant\u2019s vice-president testified the thinner was maintained in a drum which was not a safety container and that it had been so maintained for about three years prior to the fire; that it was the duty of all employees to safeguard and preserve the premises; that Lupella\u2019s express duties were working on the punch press, a notching machine, in the paint booth, and to do such things as he was instructed to do from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">After plaintiffs rested their case, defendant, without introducing any evidence, moved for a directed verdict on two grounds: 1. Although evidence submitted by plaintiffs was undisputed and without conflict, the facts did not entitle plaintiffs to recover damages from defendant. 2. Upon an appeal from a former judgment in the same \u201centitled cause, and upon the same or substantially the same facts adduced at the present trial of said cause,\u201d the reviewing court \u201cheld that said facts were insufficient to support any judgment in favor of the plaintiffs\u201d; that the decision has become final and constitutes the law of the ease, \u201cand the plaintiffs are estopped from questioning its correctness and from further prosecuting this action against the defendant.\u201d The motion was granted on both grounds. The court directed the jury to return a verdict for defendant. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on either ground. The two grounds will be considered in reverse order from that in which they were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The second ground is based on the theory that the decision in <em>DeMirjian </em>v. <em>Ideal Heating Corp., </em>112 Cal.App.2d 251 [246 P.2d 51], constitutes the law of the case and estops plaintiffs from further prosecuting the action. The contention raised on appeal from the former judgment, which was for plaintiffs, was (p. 253) \u201cthat the findings of the trial court set forth above do not support a judgment against it [defendant Ideal].\u201d The court held (pp. 253-254) : \u201cThis proposition is sound and must be sustained. . . . [T]here is a total absence of any finding that defendant Lupella was acting within the scope of his employment or authority at the time he committed the negligent act which was the proximate cause of the damage suffered by plaintiffs. . . . [U] nder the findings of fact of the court in the instant case defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>corporation ivas not liable for the negligent act of its co-defendant, and the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of plaintiff. . . . Judgment reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The only question presented and necessary for determination on the former appeal and the only question determined was that the findings of fact of the trial court were deficient in one particular and that therefore they did not support the judgment. It was not held that the evidence did not support the findings. All that was decided was that the findings did not support the judgment.  A failure to find on a given issue of fact in a prior trial which resulted in a reversal does not establish the law of the case where at the second trial there is a satisfactory finding on that point. <em>(Hibernia Sav. &amp; Loan Soc. </em>v. <em>Farnham, </em>153 Cal. 578, 583 [96 P. 9, 126 Am.St.Rep. 129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The doctrine of the law of the case does not extend to remarks or opinions on questions that are not necessarily before the court or involved in the determination of the cause. <em>(Millsap </em>v. <em>Balfour, </em>158 Cal. 711, 714 [112 P. 450].)  The statements relied on by defendant in the opinion on the prior appeal concerning the responsibility of defendant to third persons for the negligence of its agent, are mere passing remarks, not necessary to the decision, at best <em>obiter dicta. </em>They are not binding as the law of the case and do not bar us from now deciding the question on its merits. <em>(Hammond </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>49 Cal.App.2d 671, 677 [122 P.2d 332].)  The effect of the unqualified reversal of the case on appeal was to remand it for a new trial on all the issues presented by the- pleadings. <em>(Odlum </em>v. <em>Duffy, </em>35 Cal.2d 562, 564 [219 P.2d 785]; <em>Riedy </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>93 Cal.App. 202, 205 [269 P. <em>682]; Heinfelt </em>v. <em>Arth, </em>4 Cal.App.2d 381, 383 [41 P.2d 191]; 4 Cal.Jur.2d 551, \u00a7 666.)  Inasmuch as the court on the former appeal did not consider or attempt to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain proper findings, the doctrine of the law of the case does not apply. It was error for the court to direct a verdict for defendant on the second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The next question is whether it can be said, as a matter of law, that Lupella was not acting within the course of his employment at the time he committed the negligent act which was the proximate cause of the damage suffered by plaintiff. Stated in different fashion: Would a verdict for plaintiff have been supported by the evidence!</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ployer is liable for injury to the property of another proximately resulting from the negligent act of his employee done within the course of his employment. An employer is responsible not only for the negligent act of his employee done within the course of his employment, but also for the wrongful act of his employee committed in and as a part of the transaction of the-business of the employer. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2338; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Monson, </em>183 Cal. 149, 152 [190 P. 635]; <em>Otis Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>First Nat. Bank, </em>163 Cal. 31, 39 [124 P. 704, 41 L.R.A.N.S. 529].)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The definitive limits of the phrase \u201cin the course of employment\u201d are uncertain. The determination of what conduct of an employee is within the course of his employment is largely dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.  As a general rule whatever is done' by the employee in virtue of his employment and in furtherance of its ends is deemed by the law to be an act done within the course of his employment; and in determining whether the employee\u2019s conduct was within the course of his employment, it is proper to inquire whether he was at the time engaged in serving his employer.  It is not necessary that the employee should have authority to do the particular act which resulted in the injury complained of. (57 C.J.S. 303, \u00a7 570d(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Acts necessary to the comfort, convenience, health, and welfare of the employee while at work, though strictly personal to himself and not acts of service, do not take bim outside the course of his employment.  Cessation of work for eating, drinking, warming himself, and similar necessities are necessary incidents of employment. In these and other conceivable instances the employee ministers unto himself, but in a sense these acts contribute to the furtherance of his work. \u2018 \u2018 That such acts will be done in the course of employment is necessarily contemplated, and they are inevitable incidents. Such dangers as attend them, therefore, are incident dangers. At the same time injuries occasioned by them are accidents resulting from the employment.\u201d <em>(Archibald </em>v. <em>Ott, </em>77 W.Va. 448 [87 S.E. 791, 793, L.R.A. 1916D 1013]; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>American President Lines, </em>23 Cal.2d 681, 685 [146 P.2d 1]; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>21 Cal.2d 281 [131 P.2d 521, 144 A.L.R. 358]; <em>Brunk </em>v. <em>Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co., </em>334 Mo. 517 [66 S.W.2d 903]; 57 C.J.S. 308, \u00a7 570d(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">A mere deviation by an employee from the strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>course of his duty does not release his employer from liability. An employee does not cease to be acting within the course of his employment because of an incidental personal act, or by slight deflections for a personal or private purpose, if his main purpose is still to carry on the business of his employer. Such deviations which do not amount to a turning aside completely from the employer\u2019s business, so as to be inconsistent with its pursuit, are often reasonably expected and the employer\u2019s assent may be fairly assumed. In many instances they are the mingling of a personal purpose with the pursuit of the employer\u2019s business.  In order to release an employer from liability, the deviation must be so material or substantial as to amount to an entire departure. <em>(Westberg </em>v. <em>Willde, </em>14 Cal.2d 360, 372-373 [94 P.2d 590].)  \u201c [W]here the employee is combining his own business with that of his employer, or attending to both at substantially the same time, no nice inquiry will be made as to which business he was actually engaged in at the time of injury, unless it clearly appears that neither directly or indirectly could he have been serving his employer.\u201d <em>(Lockheed Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>28 Cal.2d 756, 758-759 [172 P.2d 1].)  An employee may be acting in the course of his employment even though the act done be a violation of some rule or instruction of the employer. (See <em>Associated Indem. Corp. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>18 Cal.2d 40, 47 [112 P.2d 615]; and cases collected 23 A.L.R. 1161, 26 A.L.R. 166, 58 A.L.R. 197, 83 A.L.R. 1211, 119 A.L.R. 1409.) An employee takes with him his human frailties as well as his virtues when he goes to work. (See <em>Pacific Emp. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>26 Cal.2d 286 [158 P.2d 9, 159 A.L.R. 313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\"><em>Dolinar </em>v. <em>Pedone, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 169 [146 P.2d 237], says (p. 175) that \u201cmere deviation by an employee from a strict course of duty does not release the master from liability. In order to have such an effect the deviation must be shown substantially to amount to an entire departure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\"><em>Hiroshima </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>18 Cal.App.2d 24 [63 P.2d 340], held that the defendant\u2019s employee was acting in the course of his employment where, while in the act of writing a receipt for a check given by the plaintiff in payment of a bill for electricity, he began a quarrel with the plaintiff and immediately followed it up by an assault on the plaintiff. In that case the court said that acting within the general scope of his employment means while on duty. Hiroshima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>has been quoted or referred to with approval in the eases set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Wm. C. Crowell Co., </em>28 Cal.2d 652 [171 P.2d 5], an employee of a general contractor threw a hammer at an employee of a subcontractor, striking him on the head and seriously injuring him. He sued the general contractor and his employee. The trial court granted a motion for a directed verdict as to the general contractor. The plaintiff appealed. On appeal the general contractor contended that his employee was not acting in the course of his employment when he injured the plaintiff, on the ground that the throwing of the hammer did not further the employer\u2019s interests as an employer and that his employee could not have intended by his conduct to further such interests. Reversing, the court declared (p. 654) : \u201cIt is sufficient, however, if the injury resulted from a dispute arising out of the employment. Under the provisions of section 2338 of the Civil Code a principal is liable for \u2018wrongful acts\u2019 of his agent committed \u2018in and as a part of\u2019 the principal\u2019s business. \u2018It is not necessary that the assault should have been made \u201cas a means, or for the purpose of performing the work he (the employee) was employed to do.\u201d \u2019 . . . The employer\u2019s responsibility for the tortious conduct of his employee \u2018extends far beyond his actual or possible control over the conduct of the servant. It rests on the broader ground that every man who prefers to manage his affairs through others, remains bound to so manage them that third persons are not injured by any breach of legal duty on the part of such others' while acting in the scope of their employment. [Citations.] Such injuries are one of the risks of the enterprise. [Citations.] In the present ease, defendant\u2019s enterprise required an association of employees with third parties, attended by the risk that someone might be injured. \u2018 The risk of such associations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>conditions were risks of the employment.\u2019 [Citation.] Such associations \u2018include the faults and derelictions of human beings as well as their virtues and obediences. Men do not discard their personal qualities when they go to work. Into the job they carry their intelligence, skill, habits of care and rectitude. Just as inevitably they take along also their tendencies to carelessness and camaraderie, as well as emotional makeup. In bringing men together, work brings these qualities together, causes friction between them, creates occasions for lapses into carelessness, and for fun-making and emotional flareup. Work could not go on if men became automatons repressed in every natural -expression. . . . These expressions of human nature are incidents inseparable from working together. They involve risks of injury and these risks are inherent in the working environment.\u2019 \u201d In support of the last statement the court cited among other cases, <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Cardillo, </em>112 F.2d 11, 15 [72 App.D.C. 52], a case involving an issue under the Longshoremen's &amp; Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and <em>Pacific Emp. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>26 Cal.2d 286, 291 [158 P.2d 9, 159 A.L.R. 313], a case which arose under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><em>Fields </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>29 Cal.2d 834 [180 P.2d 684, 172 A.L.R. 525], was an action against an employee and his employer for damages for an assault committed on the plaintiff by the employee, following an altercation as to whether the employer\u2019s truck, driven by the employee, had struck the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. The employee hit the plaintiff with a wrench. The court held, as a matter of law, that the employee was acting in the course of his employment, saying in part (p. 842): \u201cNor is it of any consequence that \u2018the employer here could not expect that the wrench would be used [by Sanders] as a club\u2019 to beat plaintiff.\u201d (See also the following cases in which it was held that the employee was acting in the course of his employment: <em>Haworth </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 77 [153 P.2d 804], party injured when he was ejected by defendant\u2019s bartender; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Seidner, </em>49 Cal.App.2d 427 [121 P.2d 863], party assaulted because he refused to pay for some drinks; <em>Stansell </em>v. <em>Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>44 Cal.App.2d 822 [113 P.2d 264], customer assaulted by store manager; <em>Kruse </em>v. <em>White Brothers, </em>81 Cal.App. 86 [253 P. 178], deviated from the direct route to take girl friend home; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wibye, </em>9 Cir., 191 F.2d 181, digressed from normal route so he could see his mother.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Defendant cites <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>58 Cal.App. 587 [209 P. 85], and <em>Yore </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.

The dicta in the Feeney case, and the Yore case which relied principally on the dicta in the Feeney case, were overruled in <em>George </em>v. <em>Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co., </em>33 Cal.2d 834 [205 P.2d 1037], (See 57 C.J.S. 334, \u00a7 575b and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">As indicated in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Wm.

He continued to work. Twice during the day the bandage was soaked with turpentine by an agent of the company in an endeavor to alleviate the pain. Soon after the second application the employee temporarily ceased his labor and struck a match for the purpose of lighting a cigarette. The saturated bandage was ignited by the match and the hand was seriously burned. The court held the injury arose in the course of the employment.

Whether an employee\u2019s deviation from his course of duty was so material or substantial as to constitute a complete departure is usually a question of fact. <em>(Dolinar </em>v. <em>Pedone, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 169, 175 [146 P.2d 237].)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Lupella left his assigned work to go to the washroom to use its facilities and to smoke, acts necessary to his health and comfort and incidental to and within the course of Ms employment. He stopped to fill Ms cigarette lighter with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>spatter thinner, a highly volatile and inflammable substance maintained and used by defendant and left by it in a drum adjacent to an aisle used for going to the washroom. Lupella intended to use the thinner as fluid for his lighter so he could smoke in the washroom. Although his deviation or deflection from going directly to the washroom was for a personal reason it was committed so he could later enjoy the comfort of smoking in the washroom, where it was permitted. His main purpose was to pursue an act which was necessarily contemplated by defendant and which therefore was within his course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Defendant\u2019s business required the usage of spatter thinner, a highly explosive and inflammable substance, and it was attended by the risk that smoking on the part of an employee would set fire to the thinner and the paints. Whether it was a reasonable act and in the course of Lupella\u2019s employment for him to attempt to fill his cigarette lighter from the filler drum was a question of fact. It was for the jury to say whether the deviation was so material or substantial as to constitute a complete departure from defendant\u2019s business. It could have found that there was a mingling of a personal purpose with the' pursuit of defendant\u2019s business. Lupella had not necessarily assumed a status distinct from that of an employee and for the time being had put off his general status as an employee. He was not, as a matter of law, doing something outside the sphere of his employment. We are of the opinion that an inference can reasonably be drawn from the evidence-that Lupella\u2019s act was done in the course of his employment. Whether such inference should be drawn was a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Plaintiffs urge that the jury could have reasonably found that defendant was negligent in maintaining the highly volatile, inflammable, and dangerous thinner in a container which was not a safety container, with a spigot which did not close automatically, and in an unguarded position adjacent to an aisle, readily accessible to all persons in the premises including Lupella. We are constrained to agree.  \u201c \u2018The rule, as we understand it, applicable to such cases, is that where the original negligence of a defendant is followed by an independent act of a third person which results in a direct injury to a plaintiff, the negligence of such defendant may, nevertheless, constitute the proximate cause thereof if, in the ordinary and natural course of events, the defendant should have known the intervening act was likely to happen; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>but if the intervening act constituting the immediate cause of the injury was one which it was not incumbent upon the defendant to have anticipated as reasonably likely to happen, then, since the chain of causation is broken, he owes no duty to the plaintiff to anticipate such further acts, and the original negligence cannot be said to be the proximate cause of the final injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sawyer </em>v. <em>Southern Calif. Gas Co., </em>206 Cal. 366, 374 [274 P. 544].) <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Arden Farms Co., </em>26 Cal.2d 213 [157 P.2d 372, 158 A.L.R 872], is in point. In Mosley an employee of the defendant piled milk crates on a parking near the sidewalk and left them unguarded and unattended for at least a month. The plaintiff, in driving a mowing machine, collided with crates which were hidden by weeds between the sidewalk and the property line. Affirming a judgment for the plaintiff, the court said that whether a person of ordinary prudence should have foreseen or anticipated that someone might be injured by the action of the employee was one of fact for the trier of fact, and (p. 219) \u201c \u2018If the realizable likelihood that a third person may act in a particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, negligent, intentionally tortious or criminal does not prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby.\u2019 (Rest., Torts, \u00a7 449.) It has been held that the rules on the subject in the Restatement of Torts, sections 442-453, are applicable in this state.\u201d (See also <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>American Pool Corp., </em>32 Cal.2d 295, 298-299 [195 P.2d 783]; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Gas &amp; Elec.

In <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Southern Calif. Gas Co., supra, </em>206 Cal. 366, the court stated (p. 376) : \u201cThe probability of an accident happening through the acts of a third person in the manner in which it did happen, in the circumstances of the case, presented an issue of fact that may well have been submitted to the jury.\u201d (See also <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>City of Whittier, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 609, 616 [230 P.2d 132].)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Whether defendant exercised ordinary care in maintaining the highly volatile, inflammable, and dangerous thinner in the manner which it did was a question for the jury. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that defendant- should not have anticipated that Impel\u00eda or some other person might negligently deal with the thinner and cause a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We conclude that the record contains evidence of sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>substantiality to support a verdict in favor of plaintiffs, and that the trial court erred in granting the motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Wood (Parker), J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\"><em>Fields </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>29 Cal.2d 834, 838 [180 P.2d 684, 172 A.L.R. 525]; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Wm.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ-\">I concur in the judgment: I agree that on the former appeal the court did not <em>hold </em>upon the facts found that Lupella was not acting within the scope of his employment. The trial court had found that Lupella\u2019s act of filling the lighter \u201cwas not connected with the duties which said Lupella was then delegated to perform for defendant Ideal.\u201d It was this finding, I suppose, that the court said would be inconsistent with a finding that Lupella was acting within the scope of his employment. In view of the court\u2019s finding the judgment was clearly erroneous. I do not see that on the appeal the court decided anything else. There was an implication in the general reversal that the trial court could find that Lupella was acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">I agree that the questions whether Lupella was acting within the scope of his employment and whether he was negligent should have been submitted to the jury. I do not agree that there was evidence that defendant was negligent with respect to the drum of paint thinner. Filling a lighter from a spigot with an automatic shut-off would have been as likely to cause a fire as filling it from the kind that was used. It was capable of being shut off and I cannot believe defendant had any reason to anticipate that someone would kick it and break it off or that any accident would happen of the general nature of the one that did happen because of the type of spigot that was on the drum or the way the thinner was being stored and used. There was no danger except in the use of the thinner by the workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 20, 1955, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 16, 1955.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
