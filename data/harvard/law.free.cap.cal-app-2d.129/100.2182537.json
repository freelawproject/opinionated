Code, \u00a711500) a narcotic, defendant seeks a reversal on the grounds of (1) the insufficiency of the evidence to prove he had knowledge of his possession of the contraband; (2) errors in rejecting appellant\u2019s offered instructions on (a) knowledge, (b) giving other instructions, (e) accusatory statements; (3) error in receiving evidence of value of contraband; (4) error in the prosecutor\u2019s telling the jury defendant admitted his <em>guilt; </em>(5) error in proceeding on an indictment (No. 160110) charging same offense as that alleged in the information (No. 157170) which had been based upon the commitment by the municipal court and which information was still pending; (6) error in denying motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">Before relaying the story of appellant\u2019s experiences and his clash with the law, it will serve to illuminate other refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>enees to report an antecedent proceeding wherein appellant was accused by complaint of the same offense charged in the instant indictment, was committed in June, 1953, and was accordingly charged by information and his bail fixed at $2,500. Trial on the information (No. 157170) began September 17, 1953. Thereupon, the Supreme Court issued its writ prohibiting the superior court from taking any further proceeding on the information until further orders; directed the superior court to complete its transcription of the preliminary examination or file a supplemental transcript containing all steps taken not contained in the transcript already on file. The trial was continued to January 18, 1954. The People filed in the Supreme Court a request and consent \u201cthat they immediately issue herein a peremptory writ as prayed for without prejudice to proceeding by means of a new preliminary hearing or by indictment.\u201d The superior court thereafter advanced, without notice to appellant, the trial date from January .18, 1954, to December 16, 1953, and on the latter date, without notice to appellant, dismissed the information in No. 157170 in the interest of justice. That left pending the indictment No. 160110 which had been presented November 10, 1953, after the superior court had consented to the issuance of the peremptory writ. The accused was allowed liberty on $1,500 bail and his arraignment set for November 25,1953. His motion to quash the indictment under section 995 of the Penal Code was overruled. His trial resulted in his conviction, denial of motion for new trial; denial of bail and his filing notice of appeal which is here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Pacts Prove Knowledge</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Officer Cowan accompanied by officer Samuelson arrested appellant in a drunken condition at 11:45 p.m. June 7, 1953 at a cafe in Long Beach. They transported him to the city jail and escorted him to the booking lobby. Appellant seated himself on a bench where Cowan observed him fumbling with his right sock. He told the jailers to look in the prisoner\u2019s hosiery. As he removed his right sock, pursuant to the jailer\u2019s instructions, Officer Turley asked to see what the accused had. Not only did the latter refuse to display the object he held, but thrust his hands into his pockets and refused to withdraw them. When Officer Leslie attempted to take appellant\u2019s hands from his pockets, in the midst of the violent struggle of the jailers with the prisoner, Officer Cowan reached through the slit in the coveralls and removed the red package of \u201cPall Mall\u201d from the crotch of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>coveralls, marked the cigarettes therein for identification and deposited them in a safe. When Samuelson returned to the lobby and asked appellant whether the cigarettes were his, the only reply was; <em>\u201cI don\u2019t smoke that brand.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The foregoing recital was substantially the evidence of officers Cowan, Leslie and Turley. Officer Simonds, expert chemist, testified that the leafy material of the cigarettes was marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Appellant resisted search; attempted to conceal the cigarettes and exerted himself to the limit to prevent their recovery by the officers and never denied that the red package was his own.  The lawful right to search a prisoner at the time of arrest <em>(Bruce </em>v. <em>Sibeck, </em>25 Cal.App.2d 691, 696 [78 P.2d 741]) implies the correlative duty on the part of the prisoner to submit to the search.  When one owes a duty to the state and defies its agencies to enforce performance of such duty, no reasonable inference can be drawn other than that the prisoner was conscious of a knowledge of his guilt.  Appellant\u2019s refusal to deliver the red package to his captors, and his resistance to search in the city jail, justified the jury in finding (1) that he knew his package contained the narcotic, which fact the chemist discovered (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Gory, </em>28 Cal.2d 450, 454 [170 P.2d 433]), and (2) that his wilful interference with the performance of official duty was proof of his wilful possession of the contraband. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Tomalty, </em>14 Cal.App. 224, 235 [111 P. 513].)  A prisoner\u2019s secret knowledge of the illegal character of narcotics in his possession is \u201csufficiently shown by the conduct and behavior\u201d of the accused in attempting to secrete them. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tennyson, </em>127 Cal.2d 243, 246 [273 P.2d 593]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Batwin, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 825, 827 [262 P.2d 88]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>121 Cal.App.2d 173, 175 [262 P.2d 640].)  That the conduct of a person accused of crime immediately after his commission of the act charged is proper evidence, is too well established to be challenged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannelly, </em>128 Cal. 83, 87 [60 P. 670].)  Attempts to escape, to hide, to evade a peace officer or to conceal from an arresting officer a contraband object in his possession are pertinent proofs of a guilty mind. <em>(Ibid.) </em> Consciousness of guilt may be inferred from an attempt to avoid apprehension. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dabb, </em>32 Cal.2d 491, 500 [197 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Appellant takes comfort from his assumption that the jury <em>knew </em>that he had no knowledge of the presence of the marijuana cigarettes in his red package. He contends that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>of his intoxication at the - time, of - his .arrest,- he could have had no knowledge of either (1)' the contraband character of his cigarettes or (2) of their physical presence on his person. Now, his knowledge of their actual presence was determined by the jury on the testimony of four officers who saw the contraband removed from his clothing after he had tried to prevent the officers seeing it.  On mere suspicion it could not reasonably have been found that another had .inserted the red package in his right sock or placed it in his coveralls. The pants of a man or the \u201ccoveralls\u201d over them are so intimate a vestment that what is. found there, in the absence of a contradictory explanation, the contents of the pockets or of the inside of the garment are presumed or reasonably inferred to have been placed there by the owner.  Also, when an object is found in such a garment worn by a person it is necessarily under his dominion or physical control, and is, by reason thereof, a prima facie violation of \u2022the statute.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The jury were, on the evidence of' the four officers, justified in finding that appellant had- knowledge, not only of the presence of the marijuana, but also of his control over it..  Moreover, a finding of his knowledge of its presence 'in his package of cigarettes necessarily encompasses a finding that he knew the nature of the object and the uses to which it is applied. A man does not carry contraband merchandise in his sock or his pocket through .accident. The violator of the statute is guilty unless he presents a-defense prescribed by the statute, to wit: \u201cthe written prescription of a physician,\u201d etc.  But despite the fact that he had no prescription for the marijuana, appellant contends that because he was drunk when arrested, he was unconscious of either his possession of the narcotic or of its contraband character. Whether he knew either was a fact 'which the jury found against him. The finding effectually determined that he had such knowledge prior to the act .of inserting the contraband into his clothing and walking into the cafe where he was found drunk. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gory, supra.) </em>If the law allowed crimes to be committed with impunity <em>by </em>those who are drunk, the criminal elements of a city would at every night-fall swim in rivers of alcohol- to erase guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>of the murders, rapes, banditry, and all the offenses proscribed by the statutes of this state. When a person imbibes alcohol, he knows he deadens his senses and that anything might occur by reason of his intoxication. How, then, can a violator of the law be excused for his crimes ahd yet, in spite of such behavior, expect the people to maintain a state for the preservation of life and liberty?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Instructions Not Prejudicial</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Appellant assigns as prejudicial the alteration of his instruction 33 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u201cIt is an essential fact which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant had knowledge that the article found on him was marijuana. You must acquit the Defendant if the People fail to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew this article was marijuana <em>while it was in his possession-, </em>if you find it <em>was in </em>his possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Before the modification, the italicized phrase \u201cwhile it was in his possession\u201d was \u201cat the time it came into his possession.\u201d The change was proper. There is no evidence of when, where or how the marijuana reached appellant\u2019s possession. Because there was proof that it was in his possession, the change was free from error.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The giving of C-35 is assigned as prejudicial. It is as follows: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">\u201cYou are instructed that a violation of Section 11500 of the Health and Safety Code, does not require that the defendant acted with any particular purpose, motive, or intent. All that is required, is for you <em>to find, </em>beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant <em>knowingly possessed a narcotic. </em>That is, that he knew he had the substance and that he knew it was a narcotic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">No suggestion is made as to how the instruction prejudiced appellant. Standing alone it is harmless; when read as a part of the entire charge, its benefit is readily apparent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tolmachoff, </em>58 Cal.App.2d 815, 825 [138 P.2d 61].) <em> </em>Guilt is founded upon defendant\u2019s conscious possession of a substance he knew to be a narcotic. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gory, supra; People </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>76 Cal.App.2d 317, 319 [172 P.2d 910].) \u201cThe statute provides that mere possession of marijuana shall subject the possessor to the penalties prescribed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rumley, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 6, 9 [222 P.2d 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\"> Complaint is made of the court\u2019s rejection of nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>certain instructions offered by appellant.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Those instructions would have added only confusion. Some of them are argumentative; some are repetitious; some are substantially included in those given and some are contrary to the law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>By instructions given, the jury were in effect, advised that they must not find defendant guilty unless he knew the contraband was on his person and knew that it was contraband.  A court is not obliged to repeat an instruction in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>same words or in different words. Juries are presumed to understand what is said to them once in plain, simple language.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The instructions found on pages 32 and 39 of the clerk\u2019s transcript, given at appellant\u2019s request, fairly cover the points embraced in the above nine rejected instructions. Those two directed the jury that to justify a conviction they must find from the evidence (1)' that defendant knew he had marijuana in his possession, (2) that he knew it while he had possession; (3) that he was physically and mentally conscious and capable at the time of perceiving and understanding the presence and nature of the narcotic he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The instructions given adequately cared for the fact of defendant\u2019s conscious knowledge. Their significance and value were not erased by virtue of the court\u2019s instructing on the law with reference to voluntary intoxication\u2019s not rendering an offense anytheless criminal when committed during intoxication. No instruction given violated the doctrine announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gory, </em>28 Cal.2d 450, 455 [170 P.2d 433].</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Appellant contends that it was prejudicial error to reject his proposed instruction \u201cthat if you have a reasonable doubt that defendant . . . was given or received marijuana cigarettes in a package of one of the standard brands of cigarettes made of tobacco and retained it in his possession in the honest and innocent belief that it was a package of that brand of cigarettes, then you must find defendant . . . not guilty. \u2019 \u2019 He asserts that the error lies in the- fact that the \u201cevidence shows that marijuana cigarettes were contained in a package of one of the standard brands of cigarettes and <em>there is a reasonable doubt </em>that defendant must have retained that package in his. possession in the honest and innocent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>belief that it was a package of that brand of cigarettes.\u201d Appellant thereby merely says that as a juror he would have entertained such reasonable doubt of his own guilt because the evidence showed his possession of the contraband in the red package. But the jury probably inferred from appellant\u2019s having the package, his concealing it in his sock, his resistance to search, his transferring it to his coveralls, his inebriation from the use of other narcotics (alcohol), his loitering where alcohol is served, his silence at the trial\u2014 from these facts\u2014that while appellant was sober, he procured the <em>canabis sativa, </em>concealed it in the red package, and hied himself to the caf\u00e9. Nothing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>113 Cal.App.2d 253, 258 [248 P.2d 141], required the court to read the last quoted instruction. \u201cWhile a specific intent to violate the law is not an ingredient of the crime of possession of a narcotic, \u2018a knowledge that <em>the facts exist </em>which bring the act within the provisions of this code\u2019 is necessary.\u201d Of course, knowledge that he had marijuana in his red package was a <em>sine qua non. </em>But how is that pertinent here? The court fairly instructed the jury and they found that appellant knew he had marijuana in his red package from the time he put it in his sock. The instructions maintained the distinction between knowledge of the nature of the narcotic appellant carried and his knowledge that its possession was unlawful <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gory, </em>28 Cal.2d 450, 456 [170 P.2d 433]) and by their implied findings the jury determined that he knew both facts. We have no such situation as that in the Cole case. The law there announced is not applicable to the facts here in' issue. In addition to the instructions carefully safeguarding the rights of appellant with reference to the knowledge of the substance he possessed, the jury were alerted on his right to the presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt and burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">No Error in Admitting Evidence of Value of Marijuana</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Assignment is made of the court\u2019s having received over objection testimony that the four marijuana cigarettes found in appellant\u2019s possession on the day of his arrest were worth one dollar each. There was no error in the ruling. The purpose of the evidence was to rebut the suspicion that some one might have made a gift of the cigarettes without telling appellant. If there was error in the admission of the evidence or in the court\u2019s instruction thereon, still the jury could have acquitted. The testimony might have suggested to the jury that the court believed some stranger slipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the red package into appellant\u2019s sock. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>70 Cal.App. 476, 482 [233 P. 406].)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Instructions on Accusatory Statements Not Erroneous</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The only spoken words of appellant after arrest were his reply to officer Samuelson when the officer asked the accused whether the red package was the latter\u2019s cigarettes. The reply, \u201cI don\u2019t smoke that brand\u201d was an evasive answer. The officer\u2019s question to appellant was whether the cigarettes in the red package were his. There was no reference to <em>brand. </em>But the prisoner, sober enough to engage in subterfuge, avoided giving a direct answer. The jury were there to determine whether the \u201cconditions in which appellant was confronted with it\u201d (the question) fairly afforded \u201chim an opportunity to reply by reason of the fact of his drunken condition. \u2019 \u2019 They were fairly instructed with reference thereto : \u201cif you should find that he heard the accusations and understood its nature, the circumstances of his silence (and conduct) may be considered against him as indicating an admission that the accusation thus made was true.\u201d Declarations of a prisoner under the influence of intoxicants are not rendered inadmissible by reason of his drunkenness. That condition \u201cwould go only to the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sameniego, </em>118 Cal.App. 165, 176 [4 P.2d 809, 5 P.2d 653]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorman, </em>28 Cal.2d 846, 854 [172 P.2d 686].)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Trial on Indictment, Information Pending</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Appellant deems himself aggrieved because the court received and filed on November 10, 1953, the indictment charging the same facts and offense alleged in the pending information, filed early in the same year. His grievance is augmented by the fact that for five weeks both accusations were pending and appellant was under bail in both; that in October 1953 respondent filed a request that the Supreme Court issue a peremptory writ, without prejudice to proceeding by means of a new preliminary hearing or indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">On December 16, 1953, the information (No. 157170) was dismissed in the interest of justice. Since the trial court was authorized so to dismiss the information (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1385, 1387) no prejudice was suffered by its dismissal. That the offense alleged in the indictment was the identical crime charged in the information was not material to the proceedings on the indictment. Hence the trial on the indictment was in order. The mere fact that the same offense was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>charged in the indictment that had previously been charged in the information does not establish any legal connection between the two pleadings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>88 Cal.App. 222, 228 [263 P. 306].) The dismissal of the information put an end to it as effectively as though it had never been filed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Pbosecutob\u2019s Opinion to the Juey, Not Pee judicial</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In the course of his argument, the prosecutor commented, \u201cAnd I think by failing to take the stand he is admitting guilt.\u201d Appellant assigns the statement as prejudicial misconduct. After the objection by appellant\u2019s counsel, the prosecutor said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say it was the law; I say it is my opinion.\u201d After more words of the same import, the court emphatically instructed the jury \u201cto disregard the statement of counsel for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The jury are presumed to have followed the court\u2019s instruction. Later the court read CAL JIG\u2019S Nos. 51, 51A and 51B<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> on failure of defendant to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Statements of the prosecutor declaring or implying the guilt of the accused, while not commended, are not prejudicial where they are called to the court\u2019s attention and the jury are instructed to disregard them. (Const., art. I, \u00a7 13; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1323; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zirbes, </em>6 Cal.2d 425, 428 [57 P.2d 1319].) Section 1323, <em>supra, </em>specifically authorizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>comment upon the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to explain or deny.\u201d The same rule applies with reference to appellant\u2019s failure to testify.  It is a presumption that the jury obeyed the court\u2019s instruction to disregard any statement ascribing to appellant a consciousness of guilt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Amer, </em>8 Cal.App. 137, 142 [96 P. 401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Motion fob New Trial Properly Denied</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Appellant based his motion upon the affidavits of witnesses O\u2019Donnell, Shibley and Attorney Marshall, counsel for defendant. O\u2019Donnell deposed that during early June 1953 he was a prisoner in the Long Beach jail; saw an officer strike appellant; watched appellant and the officers; saw no one take anything out of appellant\u2019s shoes or clothing; never saw an officer show appellant a package of cigarettes; never heard a mention of any narcotic. But when he was called to the stand, O\u2019Donnell testified he \u201cwas not paying too much attention\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t be too definite about it.\u201d From the affidavit and testimony of O\u2019Donnell and Shibley, it was made clear that O\u2019Donnell was in the \u201ctank\u201d during the trial, February 10 and 11, 1954, and that the court had on the application of Attorney Marshall, signed an order for the production of O\u2019Donnell as a witness. Therefore, he was available as a witness at the trial. The jailer of Long Beach testified that O\u2019Donnell was not in that jail when appellant was booked. Withal, the court found from the jail\u2019s records and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s testimony that he was not there and could not have seen anything that occurred to appellant in the jail at Long Beach June 7 or 8, 1953.  Therefore, since the affidavit of O\u2019Donnell was overcome by his own testimony and by other proof <em>(People </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 219, 223 [230 P.2d 877]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rushing, </em>130 Cal. 449, 454 [62 P. 742, 80 Am.St.Rep. 141]), and since the \u201cnew evidence\u201d was not true, the motion for a new trial was properly denied. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 882, 889 [262 P.2d 343]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frankfort, </em>114 Cal.App.2d 680, 706 [251 P.2d 401]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>92 Cal. 359, 365 [28 P. 261].)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The judgment and the order denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">McComb, J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 2, 1954, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 22, 1954.

It is a constitutional right of a defendant in a criminal trial that he may not be compelled to testify. Thus, whether or not he does testify rests entirely in his own decision. As to any evidence or facts against him which the defendant can reasonably be expected to deny or explain because of facts within his knowledge, if he does not testify or if, though he does testify, he fails to deny or explain such evidence, the jury may take that failure into consideration as tending to indicate the truth of such evidence and as indicating that among the inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom those unfavorable to the defendant are the more probable. The failure of a defendant to deny or explain evidence against him does not, however, create a presumption of guilt or by itself warrant an inference of guilt, nor does it relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving every essential element of the crime and the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">\u201c51-A. In this connection, however, it should be noted that if a defendant does not have the knowledge that he would need to deny or to explain any certain evidence against him, it would be unreasonable to draw an inference unfavorable to him because of his failure to deny or explain such evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">\u201c51-B. In deciding whether or not to testify, the defendant may choose to rely on the state of the evidence and upon the failure, if any, of the people to prove every essential element of the charge against him, and no lack of testimony on defendant\u2019s part will supply a failure of proof by the people so as to support by itself a finding against him on any such essential element.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
