J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apk\">The question for decision is whether a teacher in the public schools has a constitutional right to her position after invoking her eoncededly constitutional privilege of refusing to answer the question: \u201cAre you a member of the Communist Party of Los Angeles County?\u201d\u2014no other misconduct having; been charged against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">Appellant, Frances Robman Eisenberg, entered the public school system in 1933 as a substitute teacher. By 1944 she had advanced to the status of California lifetime teacher. On October 28, 1952, appellant appeared before the California Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. While under oath, she refused to answer the quoted question. On November 20, 1952, basing his action on such refusal, the superintendent of the Los Angeles City School Districts formally charged her with unprofessional conduct and violation of the board of education rule requiring her to tell a senatorial committee whether she belonged to the Communist Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">The Legislature has enacted statutes designed to prohibit the infiltration of communists into the ranks of employees in public service and to prevent the spread of the practices and doctrines of communism. By statute in 1951, the lawmakers forbade the teaching of communism \u201cwith intent to indoctrinate any pupil.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 8275.) In 1952, the Los Angeles Board of Education made a study of the subject and published its findings that \u201cthere are active disciplined eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>munist organizations presently functioning\u201d in the Los Angeles School, High School and Junior College Districts; that there is a clear and present danger that the members of such organizations will engage in concerted effort to hamper, restrict, impede or nullify the efforts of the Los Angeles Board of Education to enforce section 8275, <em>supra </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Thereupon, the board adopted the rule, section 2 of which provides that no person who is knowingly a member of the Communist Party shall hereafter be employed by, or retained in the employment of, any school district, except as provided in section 3. Section 5 made it the duty of any employee of any school governed by the Los Angeles Board, of Education who is subpoenaed by an un-American Activities Committee of either the American Congress or of the California Legislature to appear before such committee to answer specifically under oath questions propounded by the committee relative to \u201cmembership in the Communist Party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The same section makes guilty of insubordination and subject to dismissal, any employee who refuses to answer under oath <em>any question </em>propounded by any such committee or subcommittee. Also, section 7 makes the violator of the rule guilty of unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">By virtue of the board\u2019s service upon appellant of its findings and the rule, she knew their contents on October 22, 1952, knew that her refusal to answer, before a legislative committee, questions on any topic specified in section 5 required dismissal from the Los Angeles High School District, and knew that employees of the district were required to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>pear before such committee to answer whether they were members of the Communist Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">When she refused to answer whether she was a member of the Communist Party of Los Angeles County, the superintendent of schools forthwith charged her with unprofessional conduct and violation of the board\u2019s rule. Pursuant to appellant\u2019s demand for a hearing thereon, the board filed a complaint in the superior court alleging that cause existed for the dismissal of appellant from the Los Angeles school system. The trial court found the charge to be true within the meaning of section 13521 of the Education Code which authorizes the dismissal of a permanent employee for violating section 8275.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">On appeal she contends that the judgment is unjust and assigns certain rulings and conclusions as unjustified, certain laws as violative of her constitutional guaranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Appellant assigns as prejudicial the court\u2019s exclusion of her testimony: that she believed it was her duty to invoke and protect the provisions of the Education Code and of the state and federal Constitutions and that she did only that while before the legislative committee; that she believed the committee had no power to inquire into her beliefs, her communications or associations, and that the procedures of the committee were unconstitutional; that she believed her answering the question would be to participate in wrongdoing and that it was her duty not to cooperate in such acts of the school board; that if she had acted otherwise, she would have rendered herself a corrupt, indecent person, unfit to teach school.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Such testimony was irrelevant to the issues of the truth or falsity of the charge against her. The court\u2019s duty was plain: to ascertain whether the charge of appellant\u2019s refusal to answer was true. Her beliefs had nothing to do with it. Having found that the committee convened, that appellant appeared, that the question was asked, and that she refused to answer, the court had not far to seek to conclude that her intransigence constituted sufficient grounds for her dismissal The rule of the board made it imperative that her guilt be adjudged. The truth of the charge did not depend in the slightest degree upon her beliefs. <em>(Christal </em>v. <em>Police Com., </em>33 Cal.App.2d 564, 568 [92 P.2d 416]; <em>Workers Intl. Union </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 512, 534 [230 P.2d 71]; <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Davison, </em>30 Cal.2d 193, 200 [180 P.2d 873, 171 A.L.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>667].) The duty of the court to order her dismissal was according to the truth of the charge. Her only way to avoid a dismissal was to answer the question. The artificial argument that her conduct was not involved is of no avail. She was on trial for her conduct, to wit, not answering a question relating to the public good. No exceptions were provided for in the rule violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The Rule Is Valid</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"> Appellant proposes that the rule of the board is unconstitutional as an unauthorized assumption of legislative power and violates her right of due process. She contends that the Levering Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3100-3109) had prescribed an oath which she had signed two years previously; that such act occupies the field of legislation on the subject of loyalty oaths and prescribes the only one which may be required of a county employee. Such argument has already been answered by this court in <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>125 Cal.App.2d 100 [270 P.2d 82]. It involved the same board of education and the same rule, Mr. Justice Drapeau points out that the Levering Act does not prohibit school boards from requiring their employees to be loyal to the state and to the nation; that it does not relieve such boards from inquiring into the fitness of teachers or from prescribing reasonable rules for our protection against traitors; that the citizens of America are entitled to know whether any public employee is a communist. (See <em>Fraser </em>v. <em>University of California, </em>39 Cal.2d 717, 718 [249 P.2d 283]; <em>Christal </em>v. <em>Police Com., supra.) </em>In the Christal case, the officers accused insisted that they were not obliged to answer questions that would tend to incriminate them. But because they refused to answer did not make them white as snow. Their refusal disqualified them as police officers and was cause for their dismissal. Paraphrasing Justice Holmes,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> they had a constitutional right to talk politics, but no constitutional right to be policemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Not. only did the Levering Act have nothing to do with the conduct of teachers who appear before investigating committees, but it merely requires a loyalty oath as a condition precedent to public employment and occupies the field of legislation on the subject of loyalty oaths for public employees. <em>(Bowen </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>39 Cal.2d 714, 715 [249 P.2d 285].) Moreover, only two years after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>adoption of the Levering Act, the Dilworth Act<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> was created solely because the Levering Act had nothing to do with teachers and communism.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Now, the giving of a loyalty oath to teachers is not, in the slightest degree, relevant to the issues in the ease at bar. A public school teacher\u2019s refusal to answer before a legislative committee whether she is a member of the Communist Party is the only question involved in this action. Neither the board nor the Legislature itself deemed a compliance with the Levering Act sufficient protection for the public. A teacher must answer directly that she is or is not a member. Past pledges or oaths of loyalty are not sufficient for the school board which has jurisdiction over a vast empire of wealth, pupils and teachers. Its responsibility impels it to require every teacher to stand and be counted. Unless it knows the extent of reliance to be placed in a teacher, its attempt to preserve American ideals will go for naught and treason might run rampant.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">One year after the school board had adopted its rule, the Legislature enacted the Dilworth Act, which in turn approved of the right of the board to make rules on the subject of keeping communists out of the public schools and validated any rule, regulation or order previously enacted by school boards. It is consonant with law and with pertinent statutes and is therefore invaluable to the government of the Los Angeles City School Districts. <em>(Tucker </em>v. <em>San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., </em>111 Cal.App.2d 875, 882 [245 P.2d 597].) In view of the findings that there is a present, imminent danger that communist organizations in the district will engage in concerted undertaking to hamper the efforts of the board to comply with section 8275 of the Education Code and in view of appellant\u2019s obligation to inform the board whether she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>is a member of a communist organization whose tenets she was forbidden to impart to her students, it cannot with reason be said that the adoption of its rule on September 22, 1952, was unreasonable or that it conflicts with appellant\u2019s constitutional guaranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Appellant contends that the Constitution requires a showing that she knew of the activities or purposes of the Communist Party before she may be discharged for a refusal to answer the question, citing <em>Wieman </em>v. <em>Updegraff, </em>344 U.S. 183 [73 S.Ct. 215, 97 L.Ed. 216]. The cited ease is not authority for such contention. It does not require a public employee to have knowledge of the activities or purposes of an organization to which he belongs if it has been proscribed by name. It holds merely that a statute may not require a public employee to know at his peril whether all the organizations of which he is a member and are not named in the statute, advocate the forceful overthrow of the government by unlawful means. The ease requires not knowledge on the part of the teacher that her organization advocates the violent overthrow of the government, but knowledge that it is proscribed to public employees as a condition of continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Prom the court\u2019s review of the authorities cited in <em>Wieman </em>v. <em>Updegraff, </em>it is there made clear that the decision was confined to the holding that a statute is fatally defective when it requires an employee to state whether he belongs to unnamed proscribed organizations, when the employee is not allowed, for lack, of knowledge, to say that his organization was in the proscribed class. In the case at bar, the question was whether appellant was a member of an organization which is proscribed in the board\u2019s rule. She knew the rule\u2019s contents. The incidents of due. process had been meticulously observed, notwithstanding former holdings that due process of law does not require that a teacher must have had knowledge of the activities or purposes of the Communist Party. <em>(Wieman </em>v. <em>Updegraff, supra; Galvan </em>v. <em>Press, </em>347 U.S. 522 [74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911].)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The board\u2019s rule presents none of the difficulties encountered by the courts in the Wieman case. It was skillfully prepared with a view to an observance of the constitutional guaranties of the employees of the Los Angeles School Districts. It prevents a member of the Communist Party from obtaining or retaining employment in the Los Angeles City School Districts; requires an employee to indicate under oath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>whether he is or has been a member of the Communist Party; requires the employee subpoenaed by a legislative committee or the board of education to answer five questions relating to his loyalty and duties. Section 3 allowed an employee 30 days from the date of the adoption (September 22, 1952) to resign in good faith from the Communist Party, and retain his position with the board. Sections 5 and 6<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> * of the rule give the five questions which must be answered when asked by a legislative committee, or board of education member or the superintendent of schools. Failure or refusal to answer any such question requires dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">No Prior Determination of Relevancy Required</p>\n<p id=\"AnP\">Appellant is obsessed with the notion that before the school board could act upon the complaint and discharge her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>she was entitled to have the superior court determine that the question propounded to her was relevant. Relevant to what <em>\u00ed </em>That question, itself, was the sum total of all that was before the legislative committee. The rule was a simple statement that \u201cit shall be the duty of any employee . . . who may be subpoenaed by ... a California Legislative UnAmerican Activities Committee ... to appear . . . and specifically to answer . . . e. Questions as to membership in the Communist Party.\u201d Of course, it placed appellant in an unfortunate situation in that she must answer or be \u201cguilty of violating this rule,\u201d of the board, an act of insubordination. The procedure of the board in discharging appellant was not the final scene. She was entitled to a trial before the court and there they tried anew the very issue determined by the board. If the question had been irrelevant, the court below had the opportunity so to determine before approving of her dismissal. In the Wilkinson case, <em>supra, </em>the court said: \u201cThis is not a contempt proceeding . . . the duty of the court began and ended with a determination that defendant\u2019s conduct did or did not constitute grounds for dismissal.\u201d If a teacher may be dismissed for refusal to accept teaching assignments <em>(Board of Education </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>41 Cal.2d 546, 551 [261 P.2d 261]), there is equally as good reason for her dismissal when she has refused to answer whether she is a member of the Communist Party. The existence of that party which the board had found to be \u201ca clear and present danger,\u201d engaged in concerted effort \u201cto nullify the efforts of the Los Angeles City Board of Education to comply with and enforce Section 8275 of the Education Code\u201d is a real danger to the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Not only do the facts herein recited argue that appellant was not entitled to judicial guidance on the question of relevancy, but highly respectable authority holds that a witness acts at his peril when he refuses to answer. <em>(Sinclair </em>v. <em>United States, </em>279 U.S. 263, 274 [49 S.Ct. 268, 73 L.Ed. 692]; see also <em>Morford </em>v. <em>United States, </em>339 U.S. 258 [70 S.Ct. 586, 94 L.Ed. 815].)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Senate Enabling Act Not Unconstitutional \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Appellant vainly seeks to undermine Senate Resolution 127 by contending that it is too vague. She says the resolution makes no suggestion as to the identity of the persons who are to be denied protection under the Bill of Rights; that the resolution has no limitations and that it covers every area of work in California; that \u201ca legislative body may not im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>pose restrictions that are unnecessary or unreasonable.\u201d  The rights of appellant under the federal Constitution are not invaded by Senate Resolution 127. Appellant has not made a speech or published a sentence. Her mistake, so far as free speech is concerned, is her refusal to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d The resolution has no vague and ambiguous terms. But if it had, it is only a resolution, not a statute. All of appellant\u2019s argument on this score and all the authorities she cites pertain to the enactment of statutes. It is true that laws made by a Legislature must be clear and unambiguous. The Legislature having determined, as did the Los Angeles Board of Education, that the infiltration of communism is detrimental to the general welfare, it did the next logical thing by sending ont, as its emissaries, committees to ascertain the extent of the detriment caused and likely to be caused by advocates or prowlers for communism. There is nothing unAmerican in such action. It is done to protect the United States and every political subdivision thereof. No attempt is made to bridle free speech. The resolution means no more than \u201cstand up and be counted.\u201d It makes no interdiction against any person\u2019s saying whatever he desires to say. It is designed to give the Legislature a knowledge of social conditions prevailing in California whereby to make laws intelligently. If a teacher will not cooperate by informing the committee whether he is a party member of the communists, he violates a definite rule of his school board and is entitled to nothing but dismissal from the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The adoption of Senate Resolution 127<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is authorized by section 37 of article IV of the Constitution whereby a committee so appointed may make recommendations \u201cas to any subject within the scope of legislative regulation or control.\u201d The power of the Legislature to appoint such committees and their power to investigate un-American activities has been exercised repeatedly. <em>(Barsky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>167 F.2d 241, 245 [83 App.D.C. 127]; 334 U.S. 843 [68 S.Ct. 1511, 92 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>1767]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Josephson, 165 </em>F.2d 82, 90, 333 U.S. 838 [68 S.Ct. 609, 92 L.Ed. 1122].) On the question of definiteness of terms employed in the resolution, the language of the resolution involved in the Barsky case was held to be definite enough: \u201csubversive and un-American propaganda that attacks the principle of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution\u201d; it conveys a clear meaning and that is all that is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The claim that the Resolution 127 authorizes prior censorship of ideas is defeated by the very existence of the First Amendment to the Constitution.  \u201c The power of Congress to gather facts of the most intense public concern, such as these, is not diminished by the unchallenged right of individuals to speak their minds within lawful limits. When speech or propaganda, or whatever it may at the moment be called, clearly presents an immediate danger to national security, the protection of the First Amendment ceases.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Josephson, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Because of plaintiff\u2019s violation of a lawful rule of her employer, the Los Angeles Board of Education, it was authorized to dismiss her from public service.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">McComb, J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 16, 1955.
