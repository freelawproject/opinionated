The orders appealed from (a) directed defendant to pay plaintiff for her support $250 a month, commencing September 20, 1953, and to pay her attorney $50 court costs and $500 attorney\u2019s fees at the rate of $50 a month, the first payment to commence October 1, 1953, and (b) awarded plaintiff the exclusive use and occupancy of the family home, with the exception of a studio attached thereto. The studio was awarded to defendant who is a musical composer and uses it in the pursuit of his profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">This is the sole question necessary for us to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">\n<em>Was there substantial evidence to sustain the orders of the trial court and the findings of fact in support thereof f</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-10\"><em>Yes. </em>The present appeal is upon the clerk\u2019s transcript solely, without any record of the evidence presented at the hearing. Therefore it cannot be held on such a record that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the orders of the trial court and the findings in support thereof. The rule is established that in the absence of a record of the evidence received at the hearing it will be presumed that the trial court acted duly and regularly and received substantial evidence to support its findings. <em>(Colbert </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>28 Cal.2d 276, 281 [7] [169 P.2d 633]; <em>Locke Paddon </em>v. <em>Locke Paddon, </em>194 Cal. 73, 81 [7] [227 P. 715]; <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Kellogg, </em>170 Cal. 84, 85 [148 P. 518]; <em>California Home etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Hilborn, </em>115 Cal.App.2d 634, 638 [6] [252 P.2d 368].)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">In view of the foregoing rule we must presume that evidence was introduced at the hearing which would justify the implied finding of the trial court to meet the requirements of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>49 Cal.App.2d 716 [122 P.2d 346], and <em>Luitwieler </em>v. <em>Luitwieler, </em>57 Cal.App. 751 [207 P. 931].</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">Moore, P. J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
