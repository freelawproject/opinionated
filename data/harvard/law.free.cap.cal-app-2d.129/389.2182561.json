The decree gave to the wife an undivided one-half interest in a nine-unit furnished court in Sierra Madre. It was stipulated at the trial that this property belonged one-half to the wife as her separate property and that the other one-half belonged to the husband and wife as community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The decree gave the community one-half to the wife, and provided that she pay her husband $10,000, at the rate of $100 per month with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The husband has appealed from the judgment and has filed his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The wife now moves to dismiss the appeal for the reason that the husband has accepted eight monthly payments of $100 each under the terms of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Voluntary acceptance of the benefit of a judgment or order does not always bar the prosecution of an appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">When there has been payment of a judgment by an appellant he does not lose his right of appeal if it is compulsory, such as under execution or other coercion <em>(Reitano </em>v. <em>Yankwich, </em>38 Cal.2d 1 [237 P.2d 6]).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">A wife who accepted certain items of property shortly after the conclusion of the divorce trial but before the judgment was signed was not estopped from prosecuting her appeal (S<em>tice </em>v. <em>Stice, </em>81 Cal.App.2d 792 [185 P.2d 402]).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">In <em>Daroux </em>v. <em>Daroux, </em>53 Cal.App. 223 [199 P. 1112], in deciding a motion to dismiss the appeal, it was said that the settlement of property rights of the parties to an action for divorce, being a mere incident of the main purpose of the action, it should be the policy of the appellate courts to hear and determine such actions upon their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
