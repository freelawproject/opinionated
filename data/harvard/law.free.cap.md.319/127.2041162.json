B &amp; K Rentals and Sales Co., Inc., brought this action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County seeking to recover damages for losses resulting from a fire. The fire was allegedly caused by the negligence of the defendants Universal Leaf Tobacco Co. and others.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and at the close of all of the evidence, the trial court denied Universal\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and allowed the case to go to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff B &amp; K Rentals in the amount of $123,252.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">On January 19, 1987, the trial court granted Universal\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and entered judgment for the defendants for costs. Within ten days, on January 28, 1987, B &amp; K Rentals filed a \u201cMotion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>for Reconsideration and Motion for New Trial,\u201d seeking reconsideration of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict and seeking a new trial under Maryland Rule 2-533. The circuit court, on February 17, 1987, entered an order that \u201cboth motions be and the same are hereby denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Thereafter B &amp; K Rentals filed a timely notice of appeal which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cIt is respectfully requested that you enter an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on behalf of B &amp; K Rentals &amp; Sales Co., Inc., Plaintiff, from this Court\u2019s Order denying Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for New Trial, entered in this action on February 17, 1987.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayd\">In its brief in the Court of Special Appeals, B &amp; K Rentals argued that the circuit court\u2019s ruling on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was erroneous. B &amp; K Rentals specifically contended, based upon the evidence, that the jury properly determined that the fire resulted from the defendants\u2019 negligence and that the defendants were liable. B &amp; K Rentals also claimed that the circuit judge had committed various errors during the trial. B &amp; K Rentals sought a new trial limited to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, however, refused to consider any of the matters raised by B &amp; K Rentals in its brief. <em>B &amp; K Rentals v. Universal Leaf, </em>73 Md.App. 530, 535 A.2d 492 (1988). The intermediate appellate court agreed with Universal\u2019s argument that the notice of appeal, by appealing from the order entered February 17, 1987, and not specifically \u201cappeal[ing] the judgment of 19 January 1987,\u201d had limited the scope of the appeal. 73 Md.App. at 535, 535 A.2d at 495. The Court of Special Appeals relied upon the following dictum from its earlier opinion in <em>Shipp v. Autoville Ltd., </em>23 Md.App. 555, 560 n. 4, 328 A.2d 349 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>274 Md. 725 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">\u201c \u2018We think that if there are two or more appealable judgments in a cause, an appellant designating one would be bound by the designation.\u2019 \u201d 73 Md.App. at 535, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>536-537, 535 A.2d at 495, 496.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVp\">In the present case the Court of Special Appeals took the position that, if the appellant desired to appeal from the \u201cjudgment,\u201d the appellant designated an incorrect order in the notice of appeal. The appellate court thus stated: \u201cThis appeal from the denial of the \u2018motion to reconsider\u2019 the judgment does not serve as an appeal from the judgment,\u201d 73 Md.App. at 537, 535 A.2d at 496. The court held that \u201cthe only question before this Court is whether the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the \u2018motion for reconsideration\u2019 and the motion for new trial.\u201d 73 Md.App. at 534, 535 A.2d at 494. Concluding that the trial court had not abused its discretion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Thereafter this Court granted B &amp; K Rentals\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari which presented the following single issue: \u201cIs the Court of Special Appeals precluded from considering the propriety of the underlying decision on the merits solely because [the notice of appeal] designates, as the judgment appealed from, the decision of the trial court upon timely post-trial motions, where such judgment is the final decision rendered by the trial court in the case ... ?\u201d We shall answer the question in the negative and reverse. In our view, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision is erroneous for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">B &amp; K Rentals did not designate an incorrect order as the final appealable \u201cjudgment\u201d in the case. Contrary to the position of the Court of Special Appeals, this is not a case where \u201c \u2018there are two or more appealable judgments in a cause\u2019 \u201d and the appellant designated only one of them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Under the applicable rules and case law, the order designated in B &amp; K Rentals\u2019 notice of appeal became the only final appealable order in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">If nothing had been done in the circuit court after January 19, 1987, the January 19th entry of judgment for the defendants for costs, pursuant to the court\u2019s direction, would have been the final appealable judgment in this case. <em>See, e.g., </em>Maryland Rule 2-601; <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41-42, 45-46, 566 A.2d 767 (1989); <em>Doehring v. Wagner, </em>311 Md. 272, 275-276, 533 A.2d 1300 (1987); <em>Walbert v. Walbert, </em>310 Md. 657, 661, 531 A.2d 291 (1987); <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 221-222, 513 A.2d 291 (1986), and cases there cited. The subsequent motions filed by B &amp; K Rentals, however, deprived the January 19th judgment of its finality for appeal purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Rule 2-533 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a party whose verdict has been set aside on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may file a motion for a new trial within ten days after entry of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 2-534 states that a motion to alter or amend a judgment, based on a court decision, may be filed within ten days of the judgment, and may be joined with a motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The two motions filed by B &amp; K <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Rentals on January 28, 1987, were timely motions pursuant to Rules 2-533 and 2-534. Rule 8-202(c) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that when a timely motion is filed pursuant to Rules 2-533 or 2-534, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the denial or disposition of the motions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Consequently, \u201cwhen a motion to alter or amend an otherwise final judgment [or a motion for a new trial] is filed within ten days after the judgment\u2019s entry, the judgment loses its finality for purposes of appeal.\u201d <em>Unnamed Atty. v. Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 486, 494 A.2d 940 (1985). <em>See Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 241 n. 19, 503 A.2d 239 (1986); <em>Sieck v. Sieck, </em>66 Md.App. 37, 42-44, 502 A.2d 528 (1986); Committee Note to Rule 8-202(c). Under Rule 8-202(c), the order which was final in this case, and from which the time for appeal ran, was the order of February 17, 1987, denying both of B &amp; K Rentals\u2019 motions. Being final, the February 17th order was a \u201cjudgment.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was the only final appealable judgment in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Moreover, the appeal from the February 17th final judgment subjected the January 19th \u201cjudgment\u201d to review on appeal. It is a long established principle of appellate procedure, now embodied in Rule 8-131(d), that an appeal from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>final judgment ordinarily brings up for appellate review all earlier orders in the ease. <em>See, e.g., Vogel v. Grant, </em>300 Md. 690, 701, 481 A.2d 186 (1984); <em>Carbaugh v. State, </em>294 Md. 323, 328, 449 A.2d 1153 (1982); <em>Lewis v. Lewis, </em>290 Md. 175, 184-185, 428 A.2d 454 (1981); <em>Montgomery Co. v. Ian Corp., </em>282 Md. 459, 467-468, 385 A.2d 80 (1978); <em>Wylie v. Johnston, et al., </em>29 Md. 298, 303 (1868) (explaining the reasons for the principle). Thus, the Court of Special Appeals plainly erred in holding that an appeal from the February 17, 1987, order did \u201cnot serve as an appeal from the\u201d January 19, 1987, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Unlike Rule 3(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and many rules in other states, Maryland Rule 8-202 does not require that a notice of appeal specify the judgment or order appealed from. Nevertheless, neither reason nor authority supports the view that a recital in the notice of appeal of the order constituting the only final appealable judgment in the case somehow limits the scope of the appeal. As discussed in part (2) below, the cases have regularly held that the specification in the notice of appeal of an <em>incorrect </em>order as the final appealable judgment does not limit the issues on appeal. In light of this, the mere recitation of the <em>correct </em>final appealable order obviously should not limit the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">As mentioned above, the current Maryland Rules do not require that a notice of appeal designate the order or judgment from which the appeal is taken. In fact, the present and prior rules of procedure in this State have not regulated the content of a notice of appeal or an \u201corder for appeal\u201d as it was formerly called. Therefore, Maryland cases usually have construed notices of appeal liberally and have ignored limiting language in notices of appeal, deeming it surplusage. The cases have taken the position that the purpose of a notice or order of appeal is not to designate or limit the issues on appeal. Instead, the designation of issues on appeal is a function of the information report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>required by Rule 8-205, the prehearing conference under Rule 8-206(b), and the briefs. <em>See generally, e.g., Newman v. Reilly, </em>314 Md. 364, 382-388, 550 A.2d 959 (1988); <em>MPTH Assoc. v. St. Dep\u2019t of Assess., </em>302 Md. 319, 328 n. 6, 487 A.2d 1184 (1985); <em>Institutional Mgt v. Cutler Computer, </em>294 Md. 626, 628-633, 451 A.2d 1224 (1982); <em>Williams v. Dawidowicz, </em>209 Md. 77, 82, 120 A.2d 399 (1956); <em>Christy v. Hammond, </em>161 Md. 139, 144, 155 A. 322 (1931); <em>Sweeney v. Trust Co., </em>144 Md. 612, 622, 125 A. 522 (1924); <em>Anderson v. Stewart, </em>108 Md. 340, 346-348, 70 A. 228 (1908); <em>Lowenthal v. Rome, </em>57 Md.App. 728, 738, 471 A.2d 1102, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 153, 476 A.2d 722 (1948); <em>Joppa Sand &amp; Gravel Corp. v. L. Epstein &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>39 Md.App. 34, 43, 382 A.2d 1086 (1978); <em>Johnson-Bey v. Reiger, </em>32 Md.App. 299, 306, 360 A.2d 457, 461, <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 725 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">For example, in <em>Institutional Mgt. v. Cutler Computer, supra, </em>the trial judge made certain rulings in an oral opinion delivered on December 3, 1980, and final judgments in the case were entered on December 9, 1980. Within thirty days after the entry of final judgments, the appellant filed an order for appeal which specified that the appeal was being taken from the rulings on December 3, 1980. The Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal on the. ground that it was not taken from the final judgments. This Court, however, reversed, saying (294 Md. at 630, 451 A.2d at 1226):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">\u201cThis Court and the Court of Special Appeals have both recognized that when an order for appeal is timely filed subsequent to the entry of a final judgment, an appellate court has jurisdiction. It must entertain the appeal even though the text of the order for appeal indicates that the appeal is taken from something other than a final judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">A similar situation was presented in <em>Sweeney v. Trust Co., supra. </em>There, a timely order for appeal was filed after the final decree in the case. Nevertheless, the order for appeal recited that the appeal was taken from an earlier opinion of the trial court. In overruling the appellee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>motion to dismiss, this Court stated that \u201cwe think the appeal should be regarded as having been taken from the decree,\u201d 144 Md. at 622, 125 A. at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">This general issue was considered very recently by the Court in <em>Newman v. Reilly, supra. </em>There the circuit court had entered, as sanctions, separate money judgments against the plaintiff and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The order for appeal, however, recited that the appeal was being taken by the plaintiff from the \u201cjudgment,\u201d with the latter word being in the singular and with no mention of the attorney. In rejecting the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position that the issues on appeal did not encompass the judgment against the attorney, Judge Rodowsky for the Court reviewed the Maryland law in this area (314 Md. at 383, 550 A.2d at 968-969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\u201cThe Maryland Rules do not regulate the content of an order for appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. When the subject order was filed, the governing rule was former Rule 1011.a which provided that an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals \u2018shall be taken by filing an order for appeal with the clerk of the lower court[.]\u2019 Current Rule 8-201(a) is similarly silent concerning content of the order for appeal. In civil cases the judgments and rulings complained of by an appellant are not required to be identified until the filing of the information report required by Rule 8-205 or the filing of the appellant\u2019s brief. By contrast, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 3(e), requires that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u2018[t]he notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from; and shall name the court to which the appeal is taken____ An appeal shall not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">\u201cInasmuch as the Maryland rule does not by its terms require that the body of the order for appeal identify the party appealing or the judgment appealed from, the limitation on the scope of this appeal applied by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Special Appeals rests on language gratuitously included in the body of the order. If Zerivitz had signed, as attorney for the plaintiff, a paper reading, \u2018Please note an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 and the paper were filed within thirty days of the entry of the sanctions judgments, the legal effect would have been to bring up for appellate review all appealable judgments in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The <em>Newman </em>opinion then held (314 Md. at 386, 550 A.2d at 970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cViewed in this light, the order for appeal in the instant case does not operate to exclude Zerivitz. Our cases, and those of the Court of Special Appeals, have generally been quite liberal in construing timely orders for appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZF\">Judge Rodowsky in <em>Newman </em>went on to discuss several earlier cases in this Court and in the Court of Special Appeals where limiting language in orders for appeal was treated as inadvertent or surplusage. He then continued (314 Md. at 387-388, 550 A.2d at 971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cThe philosophy of these cases is also reflected in the Notes of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, 1979 Amendment, Note to Rule 3, subdivision c:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u2018Because of the fact that the timely filing of the notice of appeal has been characterized as jurisdictional ... it is important that the right to appeal not be lost by mistakes of mere form. In a number of decided cases it has been held that so long as the function of notice is met by the filing of a paper indicating an intention to appeal, the substance of the rule has been complied with.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">In other jurisdictions as well, including those where the content of notices of appeal is regulated by rule, courts do not construe notices of appeal so as to limit the issues on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Dawdy v. Sample, </em>178 Ill.App.3d 118, 127 Ill.Dec. 299, 306, 532 N.E.2d 1128, 1135, <em>pet. denied, </em>125 Ill.2d 564, 130 Ill.Dec. 479, 537 N.E.2d 808 (1989) (\u201cNotices of appeal are liberally construed. The notice of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>informs the prevailing party that the unsuccessful party is seeking review of the judgment. Briefs specify the precise points relied upon for reversal\u201d); <em>James v. Brumlop, </em>94 N.M. 291, 609 P.2d 1247, 1249 (N.M.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>94 N.M. 674, 615 P.2d 991 (1980) (\u201cnotices of appeal, even where technically defective, should be liberally construed to allow consideration of the merits of the appeal where they disclose the intention to appeal\u201d); <em>Kelly v. Kelly, </em>371 N.W.2d 193, 195 (Minn.1985); <em>Maritime Mfrs., Inc. v. Hi-Skipper Marina, </em>70 Ohio St.2d 257, 436 N.E.2d 1034, 1035 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">A decision of this Court which appears to be out of step with the above-discussed principles and cases is <em>Carter v. State, </em>286 Md. 649, 408 A.2d 1335 (1979). The Court of Special Appeals relied on <em>Carter </em>in reaching its decision in the present case. <em>Carter </em>was a criminal case in which various issues were raised at trial, including whether the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial had been infringed. After conviction and sentence, the defendant filed a timely order for appeal which recited that the appeal was \u201c \u2018on the constitutional question relating to Speedy Trials,\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter v. State, supra, </em>286 Md. at 651, 408 A.2d at 1336. In his briefs, however, the defendant did not raise a speedy trial issue; instead he argued various other matters. Concluding that the order for appeal had limited the issues on appeal to those pertaining to a speedy trial, and that the failure to brief any speedy trial issues resulted in their waiver or abandonment, this Court ordered that the defendant\u2019s appeal be dismissed. 286 Md. at 651-652, 408 A.2d at 1336-1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The <em>Carter </em>case is distinguishable from the present case and from the other cases in this Court which we have previously discussed. The limiting language in the <em>Carter </em>order for appeal was very specific and clearly related to only one substantive legal issue. The decision in <em>Carter, </em>even if correct, clearly does not support the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Nevertheless, the <em>Carter </em>decision does appear to be inconsistent with the principles that limiting language in a timely notice of appeal will be treated as surplusage, and that the delineation of the issues on appeal is a function of the briefs, information report and prehearing conference, rather than of the notice of appeal. In order to avoid future confusion, we overrule <em>Carter v. State </em>and any other decisions to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
