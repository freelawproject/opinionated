The mother brought an action in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County against the father, alleging that the child died as a result of the father\u2019s negligence. In the first count of the Complaint, the mother instituted a survival action. She claimed damages as the personal representative of the estate of the child for \u201cthe great conscious physical and emotional pain and suffering sustained by [the child] prior to his death and for funeral ex-penses____\u201d In the second count, the mother instituted a wrongful death action. As the surviving mother of the child, she claimed damages involving the elements of solatium suffered by her by reason of \u201cthe tragic loss of her [only] son.\u201d In what was labeled as a third count, the mother, both as personal representative of the estate of the child and as the surviving mother of the child, claimed punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The actions went before the court on the father\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss the Complaint,\u201d founded on the \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Md.Rule <em>2-</em>322(b)(2). The court granted the motion. The mother noted an appeal. We certified the case to us <em>ex mero moiu </em>before decision by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We pointed out in <em>Sharrow v. State Farm Mutual, </em>306 Md. 754, 511 A.2d 492 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">Under Md.Rule 2-322, a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim serves the same function as the demurrer under former Rules 345 and 371 b____ Consequently, in considering the legal sufficiency of [a] complaint to allege a cause of action for tortious interference, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>assume the truth of all relevant and material facts that are well pleaded and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from those pleadings____ On the other hand, any ambiguity or uncertainty in the allegations bearing on whether the complaint states a cause of action must be construed against the pleader.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 768, 511 A.2d 492 (citations omitted). The relevant and material facts set out in the Complaint here were sufficient to establish, if proved, that Virginia Lee Smith was the natural mother of the child, that she was the personal representative of his estate, that the child was killed in an automobile accident caused by the negligence of the father and that the mother and the child sustained damages therefrom. The Motion to Dismiss related that Gross, Sr., was the natural father of the child. The Answer to the Motion to Dismiss alleged that the mother and the father were never married, that the child \u201cwas born out of wedlock, and lived with his mother from the time of his birth until his death and never lived with his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 6-401(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides, except as to a cause of action for slander, that \u201ca cause of action at law, whether real, personal, or mixed, survives the death of either party.\u201d Maryland Code (1974), \u00a7 7-401(x) of the Estates and Trusts Article authorizes a personal representative to prosecute, for the benefit of the estate, <em>\u201ca personal action which the decedent might have commenced or </em>prosecuted____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Such an action survives the decedent except for the slander of him during his lifetime, in which case the action dies with him.

A parent, among others, may institute the action as a primary beneficiary. Section 3-904(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The survival statute and the wrongful death statute have in common the authorization to commence and prosecute a personal action after the death of the decedent if the decedent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> might have maintained the action when he was alive. The father urges that the child was barred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>suing him by the doctrine of parent-child immunity, as adopted and applied by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The general rule is that defenses which would have been good against the decedent, had the decedent survived, are good against the decedent\u2019s personal representatives and, in their capacity as Lord Campbell\u2019s Act claimants, the decedent\u2019s survivors. As to survival actions, <em>see </em>4 Harper, James &amp; Gray, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 23.8 at 449 (2d ed. 1986) (\u201cWhere the statute provides for the survival of [the decedent\u2019s] action, the surviving action is derivative in the fullest sense of the term, and the result of the cases <em>[i.e., </em>contributory negligence of decedent bars estate\u2019s action] comes as near to being demanded by inexorable logic as anything does\u201d). Actions under Maryland\u2019s Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, however, are not as purely derivative as survival actions. That statute\u2019s requirement of an act \u201cwhich would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued,\u201d clearly excludes a wrongful death action if there would be no cause of action on the decedent\u2019s part, had the decedent survived. <em>See State, Use of Bond v. Consol. Gas, etc. Co., </em>146 Md. 390, 126 A. 105 (1924) (holding, prior to the \u201cfall of the citadel,\u201d that a wrongful death action based on an allegedly defective product did not lie on behalf of survivors of a deceased child who was not in privity with the defendant seller). Of particular significance here is that the decedent, if surviving, not only must have been able to \u201cmaintain an action\u201d but also to \u201crecover damages.\u201d We have, in effect, interpreted this language to include defenses. <em>See Frazee v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>255 Md. 627, 258 A.2d 425 (1969) (contributory negligence of decedent is defense to survivor\u2019s Lord Campbell\u2019s Act claim); <em>State, Use of Brandau v. Brandau, </em>176 Md. 584, 6 A.2d 233 (1939) (same); <em>State, Use of Potter v. Longeley, </em>161 Md. 563, 570, 158 A. 6, 8 (1932) (same); <em>North Cent. Ry. Co. v. State, Use of Burns, </em>54 Md. 113 (1880) (same); <em>State, Use of Foy v. Philadelphia, Wilm &amp; Balto. R.R., </em>47 Md. 76 (1877) (same); <em>see also Baltimore &amp; Potomac R.R. v.

Thus, the issue here is whether the defense of parental immunity is an exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"A1P\">Some 50 years ago, we adopted a general rule refusing to allow actions between parent and minor child for personal torts. <em>Schneider v. Schneider, </em>160 Md. 18, 152 A. 498 (1930). <em>See Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. 542, 505 A.2d 826 (1986). Over the years we have recognized two exceptions. We have held that immunity does not apply with respect to a minor child and a parent whose conduct was cruel and inhuman or wanton and malicious, and with respect to a parent and a child who is emancipated at the time the conduct occurred. <em>Frye </em>at 546-548, 505 A.2d 826, citing <em>Mahnke v. Moore, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923 (1951), and <em>Waltzinger v. Birsner, </em>212 Md. 107, 128 A.2d 617 (1957). We have, from time to time, refused to abrogate the rule or to modify it further. Against the modern trend, we specifically declined to do so generally as to motor torts. In the light of compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance, part of an elaborate scheme constructed by the legislature for the general welfare and protection of the people of this State, we believed that a blanket exception of motor vehicle torts from the parent-child immunity rule was best left to the General Assembly. <em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 562-567, 505 A.2d 826. The General Assembly has not acted in this regard. The mother, however, urges that the parent-child immunity rule is simply not applicable because the rationale supporting the rule is not appropriate under the facts and circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The rationale of the rule is that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqb\">is founded upon the relation in which the parent and the unemancipated minor child stand to each other. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>reciprocal dependence and entitlement of that relationship promotes a public policy which the rule reflects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 548, 505 A.2d 826.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The public policy which the rule reflects has been long recognized by this Court. We observed in <em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 551-552, 505 A.2d 826:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">It is clear that for over half a century this Court has recorded its belief in the importance of keeping the family relationship free and unfettered. Our primary concern with regard to matters involving the parent-child relationship was the protection of family integrity and harmony and the protection of parental discretion in the discipline and care of the child. We have steadfastly recognized the authority of parents and their need to fulfill the functions devolved upon them by that position. The parental status should be held inviolate so that there be no undue interference with the dependence of the minor unemancipated child on the parents for such judgment and care needed during the child\u2019s minority or with the dependence of the law on the parent for fulfillment of the necessary legal and social functions associated with the office of parent. This Court has declared it to be the public policy that discipline in the family not be impaired and that tranquility of the home be preserved. Matters which tend to disrupt or destroy the peace and harmony of family or home are not to be condoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In short, as we declaimed in <em>Schneider v. Schneider, supra, </em>the seminal case on the rule in this jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1k\">\u201cBoth natural and politic law, morality, and the precepts of revealed religion alike demand the preservation of [the parent-child] relation in its full strength and purity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Id. </em>160 Md. at 23-24, 152 A. 498 (quoting Scheinler, <em>Domestic Relations </em>\u00a7 23). We discussed at length in <em>Frye </em>the obligations and rights of the parent-child relationship arising both in the common law and various legislative enactments. 305 Md. at 558-561, 505 A.2d 826. We found that legislative enactments tended to strengthen the rationale of parent-child immunity rather than weaken it. <em>Id. </em>at 559, 505 A.2d 826. We were aware in <em>Frye </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9R\">the fifty-four years which have elapsed since <em>Schneider </em>have been marked by shifting values in a changing world.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX8\"><em>Id. </em>at 561, 505 A.2d 826. \u201cBut,\u201d we found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgM\">both this Court and the legislature have been faithful to the promotion of the stability, harmony and peace of the family and to the preservation of parental authority and the family unity as a matter of public policy in the best interests of society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The mind-set of the mother is that \u201c[t]he parent-child immunity doctrine is inapplicable to the case at bar because there is no parent-child relationship to protect\u201d She points to the fact that the child never lived with his father. She asserts that \u201cparental discipline is not capable of impairment\u201d because \u201cthere isn\u2019t any family relationship\u201d between the father and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It does not follow that merely because the parents\u2019 relationship had not culminated in marriage and because the mother, the father, and the child did not reside together in a common home, there was no family relationship within the ambit of the rule between the father and the child. Rights and obligations, privileges and duties \u2014 the elements of parenthood \u2014 existed between the father and child despite that the child \u201clived with his mother from the time of his birth until his death and never lived with his father.\u201d The maintenance of a common home is not the <em>sine qua non </em>of the elements of parenthood. The primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>requisite of a father-child relationship is not that a person reside with the child but that the person is, in fact, the father of the child. It is by reason of being the father that certain rights, privileges, obligations, and duties arise. In <em>Frye </em>at 558-561, 505 A.2d 826, we detailed those elements of parenthood as they existed at the common law and as they were created by various statutes. It is the parental status reflected by them that the rule serves to hold inviolate</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">so that there be no undue interference with the dependence of the minor unemancipated child on the parents for such judgment and care needed during the child\u2019s minority or with the dependence of law on the parent for fulfillment of the necessary legal and social functions associated with the office of parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>Id, </em>at 552, 505 A.2d 826. Here, the rights, privileges, obligations, and duties arising from the father-child relationship were not wiped out merely because the child lived with the mother. <em>See </em>the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code (1984) referred to in <em>Frye </em>at 559-561, 505 A.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The record does not disclose the full amount of the father\u2019s participation in the life of the child. Clearly, he had not completely abandoned the parental relationship; the child was with him at the time of the accident. There is no indication that he had forfeited his parental obligations, responsibilities, and duties by acts and conduct, as was the case in <em>Mahnke v. Moore, supra, </em>or that he had forsworn his parental authority, rights, and privileges. There is no suggestion that the father was not fulfilling his responsibility for the child\u2019s support, care, nurture, welfare, and education. Md.Code (1984), \u00a7 5-203(b)(1) of the Family Law Article. <em>See Frye </em>at 560, 505 A.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Under the circumstances revealed in the record before us, we hold that the parent-child immunity rule was applicable during the life of the child.. While the child was alive, the father was entitled to the immunity which the rule affords.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Our holding is dispositive of this appeal. The survival statute and the wrongful death statute are clear and certain. The only prerequisite for the prosecution of the actions authorized is the entitlement of the injured decedent to maintain the respective action and recover damages if death had not ensued. \u201cBecause there is a lack of relevant legislative history, we must rely substantially on the language of the statutes in the context of the goals and objectives they seek to achieve.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Teneyck, et al., </em>317 Md. 626, 632, 566 A.2d 94, 97 (1989), citing <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-516, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). The legislature has not addressed the rule although it surely has been aware of parent-child immunity followed in the courts of this State for over 50 years. The appellate courts of this State have from time to time specifically called the legislature\u2019s atten tion to the rule. <em>See Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. at 566-567, 505 A.2d 826; <em>Latz v. Latz a/k/a Schafer, </em>10 Md.App. 720, 733-734, 272 A.2d 435, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 726 (1971). The legislature has not responded. Thus, the survival statute and the wrongful death statute stand legislatively unsullied by the rule. The rule impacts on the statutes only in the determination whether the decedent might have maintained an action against the tortfeasor while the decedent was alive. If the rule applies, the survival and wrongful death actions are precluded; if the rule does not apply, the actions are permitted. If the legislature intended that the judicially created parent-child immunity rule be excepted from the legislatively created survival and wrongful death actions, it has had ample opportunity to say so. But it has allowed the rule to stand inviolate as we have adopted and applied it, without change or modification. In this case it serves to bar an action by the child while living against the father. Therefore, the mother is precluded from proceeding against the father in her own right as a parent or as the personal representative of the child\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The mother looks primarily to the subsequent death of the child as making the rule inapplicable. But a personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tort action by the child while alive was killed by the rule. The death of the child did not serve to remove the immunity dictated by the rule and resurrect the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The Circuit Court for Dorchester County did not err in granting the father\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-7\">ELDRIDGE, J., dissents with opinion in which ADKINS, J., concurs.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-16\">.

By Ch. 299, \u00a7 1, of the Acts of 1852, the General Assembly, borrowing from Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201cwhensoever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>default is such as would (if death had not ensued), have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Under current law, Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-902(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u201c[a]n action may be maintained against a person whose wrongful act causes the death of another.\u201d Section 3-901(e) defines a \u201cwrongful act\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201can act, neglect, or default including a felonious act which would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued.\u201d Thus, the two phrases emphasized by the majority, \u201ca</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">personal action which the decedent might have commenced or prosecuted\u201d from the survival statute, and \u201cwhich would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages if death had not ensued\u201d from the wrongful death statute, are substantially unchanged from the language in the Acts of 1798 and 1852, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">As the majority notes, this Court has held that defenses such as lack of privity, contributory negligence and assumption of risk, on the part of the decedent, are defenses to a wrongful death claim. I agree with the majority that these types of defenses would also be recognized in survival actions. I believe that the purpose of the two phrases quoted above was to identify the types of events that would trigger liability under the statutes: the events had to give rise to cognizable causes of action. Circumstances such as contributory negligence and assumption of risk bar <em>every </em>tort action, regardless of the identity or relationship of the parties. An immunity such as parent-child immunity, on the other hand, does not mean that no cause of action exists. It means that a recovery will not be permitted because of overriding public policy. I doubt that the surviv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>al and wrongful death statutes were intended to incorporate every immunity and public policy defense that this Court had recognized, or would recognize in the future, under circumstances where no public policy would be served by incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"AlZN\">The Court of Appeals first recognized parent-child immunity in 1930, over 75 years after the enactment of the wrongful death statute, and over 130 years after the survival statute went into effect. <em>See Schneider v. Schneider, </em>160 Md. 18, 152 A. 498 (1930). In <em>Yost v. Yost, </em>172 Md. 128, 134, 190 A. 753, 756 (1937), the Court stated that as a \u201cgeneral principle,\u201d \u201cfor acts of passive negligence incident to the parental relation, there is no liability.\u201d In that case, the Court emphasized the need to preserve the peace and harmony of the home and recognize the authority of parents. <em>Ibid. See Frye v. Frye, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">This Court has not applied the general principle of parent-child immunity in cases where the public policy underlying the principle would not be served. For example, in <em>Mahnke v. Moore, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923 (1951), the plaintiff infant\u2019s father murdered her mother and later committed suicide, both in the child\u2019s presence. When the child sued her father\u2019s executrix to recover for personal injuries, parental immunity was imposed as a defense. Under the circumstances of the case, the Court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGM\">\u201cthere can be no basis for the contention that the daughter\u2019s suit against her father\u2019s estate would be contrary to public policy, for the simple reason that there is no home at all in which discipline and tranquility are to preserved.\u201d 197 Md. at 68, 77 A.2d at 926.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">The Court also concluded that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7e\">\u201cwhen, as in this case, the parent is guilty of acts which show complete abandonment of the parental relation, the rule giving him immunity from suit by the child, on the ground that discipline should be maintained in the home, cannot logically be applied, for when he is guilty of such acts he forfeits his parental authority and privileges, including his immunity from suit.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Furthermore, in <em>Waltzinger v. Birsner, </em>212 Md. 107, 125-126, 128 A.2d 617, 626-627 (1957), this Court held that there was no parental immunity to bar a suit between a parent and a child who was emancipated. Moreover, we recently held, in <em>Hatzinicolas v. Protopapas, </em>314 Md. 340, 550 A.2d 947 (1988), that the policies served by parent-child immunity did not require an extension of the principle to bar a child\u2019s recovery in negligence from a parent\u2019s business partner, where the partnership was responsible for an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In both <em>Mahnke v. Moore, supra, </em>and <em>Waltzinger v. Birsner, supra, </em>where no parent-child relationship still existed, the Court did not recognize an immunity. In this case, the death of Gross, Jr. severed the parent-child relationship and terminated the basis for immunity. This suit cannot \u201cbe contrary to public policy, for the simple reason that there is no home at all in which discipline and tranquility are to be preserved.\u201d <em>Mahnke v. Moore, supra, </em>197 Md. at 68, 77 A.2d at 926. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he death of the child did not serve to remove the immunity dictated by the rule.\u201d I would follow the reasoning of courts that have refused to recognize parent-child immunity where, because of a death, no public policy would be served by the immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In <em>Harlan National Bank v. Gross, </em>346 S.W.2d 482 (Ky.1961), Kentucky\u2019s highest court held that the principle of parent-child immunity would not bar the administrator of a deceased infant\u2019s estate from bringing a cause of action against the infant\u2019s parent for wrongful death caused by negligence in an automobile accident. The court explained (346 S.W.2d at 483):</p>\n<p id=\"ALe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Many other state courts are in accord with this view. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Myers, </em>2 Ill.App.3d 844, 277 N.E.2d 778, 779 (1972) (\u201cwhen the family relationship has been dissolved by death the stated policy behind the rule of family immunity ceases\u201d); <em>Plumley v. Klein, </em>31 Mich.App. 26, 187 N.W.2d 250, 252-253 (1971), <em>aff'd, </em>388 Mich. 1, 199 N.W.2d 169 (1972) (\u201cthe reasons for the doctrine of intra-family immunity have been terminated by death\u201d); <em>Palcsey v.

The rule of non-liability is based upon a public policy to protect from disruption a family relationship. This potential evil is removed by the death of the child. Consequently there is no longer such a public policy objection to a claim asserted by an administrator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The majority suggests that \u201c[i]f the legislature intended that the judicially created parent-child immunity rule be excepted from the legislatively created survival and wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ful death actions, it has had ample opportunity to say so.\u201d Of course, when the General Assembly created the survival and wrongful death actions, there existed in Maryland no parent-child immunity rule to be \u201cexcepted.\u201d The rule was created by this Court at a much later date, and this Court has not hesitated to hold the rule inapplicable when the policy underlying the rule is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Parent-child immunity is a general principle that sometimes serves a public policy of promoting family discipline and domestic tranquility. As our prior cases show, it is not an absolute rule. Therefore, I would hold that the circuit court erred in recognizing parent-child immunity in a case where, because of the death of the child, there was no policy to be served.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-6\">Judge ADKINS has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-11\">.
