She sought the sale of a certain piece of real property in lieu of partition and requested that the residue of the proceeds after the payment of expenses be divided among the owners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of the property according to their respective shares. The battle ended at the nisi prius level on 14 June 1988 when the court rendered a final judgment. The court ordered that the property be sold as one parcel. It decreed, \u201c[t]he rights, shares and interests\u201d in the property to be as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">(a) Clarice Williams owns one-third;</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">(b) Elmer McDonald owns one-twelfth;</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">(c) Florine Harvey owns seven-twenty-fourths;</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">(d) Martha McDonald Johnson owns seven-twenty-fourths.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The court further ordered that \u201c[t]he proceeds of such sale shall be distributed unto the above-listed parties in accordance with this proportional interest as found herein less the cost of sale and court costs,\u201d but that \u201cany parties who paid taxes [were] entitled to reimbursement from any proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Harvey and Johnson appealed from the judgment. McDonald was apparently content with his one-twelfth. He did not appeal, thereby withdrawing from the fray, and has not been heard from since. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment. <em>Harvey v. Williams, </em>79 Md.App. 566, 558 A.2d 756 (1989). At that point, it seems that Johnson had enough. She left the field of battle, neither filing nor joining in a petition for a writ of certiorari. The only party who sought our review was Harvey. We granted her petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari and ordered that the records and proceedings be certified to us. Thus, the only parties before us are Harvey and Williams. Williams, of course, had sought the judgment in the trial court, fought against its reversal in the Court of Special Appeals, and now beseeches us to sustain it. Johnson and McDonald have surrendered. What they admitted or denied and what they did or did not do, while they were still active in the fray, are of no moment in this final skirmish. It is true that Harvey will carry them with her in victory or defeat, but she alone shoulders the burden at this point. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>short, Johnson and McDonald have no voice, past or present, in the proceedings before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Harvey\u2019s petition presented only one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Did the Court of Special Appeals ignore the clear language of Section 1-201 of the Estates and Trusts article of the Annotated Code of Maryland and, therefore, err in holding that [Harvey\u2019s] admission that [Williams] was the child of [Williams\u2019] Father thereby rendered the provisions of Section l-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts article moot and of no legal effect?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We granted the petition as submitted. However, Harvey\u2019s brief ignores the question as presented in her petition, and, in lieu thereof, substitutes four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">1. Did the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals err in giving de jure effect (conferring inheritance rights on the Appellee, Clarice Williams) to a de facto admission of the Appellee\u2019s paternity contrary to the provisions of Section 1-208 of the Estates and Trust Title of the Maryland Code?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">2. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in refusing to permit the defendants to withdraw an admission of fact which was deemed admitted only because the defendants had failed to deny the requested admission in a timely manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">3. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in refusing to permit the defendants to introduce evidence concerning the ancestry and legitimacy of the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">4. Did the trial court err in holding or concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s requested admissions of fact were suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>cient to prove that she had an interest in the real property and in accepting as an admission of fact that which should be considered an issue of law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">These questions are not properly before us, and we decline to address them. Md.Rule 8\u2014303(b)(6); <em>Huger v. State, </em>285 Md. 347, 354, 402 A.2d 880 (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">On 14 February 1985, in a pretrial foray, Williams filed a request for admission of facts pursuant to Md.Rule 2-424(a). Paragraph (2) of the request called for the defendants to admit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">That John Timothy Thomas died on or about January 20, 1916, intestate, leaving as his sole heirs at law, his widow, Edna Thomas and a son, James Edward Thomas. The widow, Edna Thomas, intermarried with Mr. Melton, who died on or about July 17,1962, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. <em>The son James Edward Thomas died intestate, on or about May 14, 1935, leaving one child, Clarice Williams, Plaintiff, </em>who is the great-granddaughter of John Timothy Thomas, granddaughter of Edna Thomas. Edna Thomas (Melton) died intestate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 17, 1983, leaving. Clarice Williams as her only heir at law who has now inherited Vs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>of the subject property previously owned by her great-grandfather, John Timothy Thomas (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARz\">Harvey did not answer the request until 7 June 1985. Rule 2-424(b) prescribes, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request or within 15 days after the date on which that party\u2019s initial pleading or motion is required, whichever is later, the party to whom the request is directed files a response signed by the party or the party\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX2\">Harvey\u2019s untimely<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> answer to the second paragraph of the request for admission of facts read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">That she does not admit the allegations of fact in paragraph 2 of the Request because the Defendant is reasonably certain that John Timothy Thomas was never married to Edna Thomas. The Defendant knew the person referred to in the Pleadings as Edna Thomas and said person was always known to the defendant as Edna Coates and later as Edna Coates Melton. In addition, James Edward Thomas was never married to the Plaintiff\u2019s mother. The last clause of this request contains a conclusion of law which the Defendant will not admit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">On 10 June 1985 the court conducted a hearing. The court deemed that two matters were before it: (1) whether Williams had an interest in the property, and (2) whether the property was subject to partition. As we have seen, the request for admission of facts called for the admission that Williams was the only child of James Edward Thomas, and that as such, was entitled to a one-third interest in the subject property. Harvey\u2019s attorney, who had entered the case two weeks before the hearing, asked the court for \u201can extension of time to respond to the Request for Admission of Facts nunc pro tunc.\u201d The court treated this request as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>a motion to withdraw pursuant to Md.Rule 2-424(d), which declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">Any matter admitted under this Rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The judge denied the motion, citing <em>Murnan v. Joseph J. Hock, Inc., </em>274 Md. 528, 534, 335 A.2d 104 (1975), to the effect that \u201cif there is no withdrawal permitted by the court, then the facts set forth therein are conclusive and should be accepted by the court.\u201d The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aje\">Now, of course, Rule 2-424 is put in for a very valid purpose. Sometimes it\u2019s not terribly easy to prove things and one of the methods of doing that is to request an admission because party on the other side has some burden of denying this and frequently doesn\u2019t deny things which are obvious but which require difficulty to prove. It also can be used as a discovery tool in the sense that if you don\u2019t answer it, then I don\u2019t have to worry about it. I can go ahead with my case and not worry about getting into any possible defenses that you may have with regard to all of that. It does require that the Answers be made within thirty days____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">[S]o the facts stand as admitted unless we permit withdrawal. The Rule is that \u201cany matter admitted under this Rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment. The court may permit withdrawal or amendment if the court finds it would assist the presentation of the merits of the action and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">Now the two requests here that were made, one was the request that [Williams] was in fact I think the granddaughter of the original owners here as best I can read the Request for Admissions or get the facts out of them____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>With regard to that request, there was no answer to it. I think that\u2019s a clear request for a fact and I think that that certainly could and should have been raised long before. Obviously [there was] nothing that [McDonald\u2019s present attorney] could do, he didn\u2019t get in the case until the 23rd of May, but the party was in the case, that could have been raised. There\u2019s nothing in here that even comes close to raising it. I think the Rule has validity, and I think we\u2019re going to have the Rules to have some validity, well, we have to admit exceptions to them at certain times, we at least ought to recognize the Rule and give effect to it, and I\u2019m going to ... deny the request to ... object to that admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">As we have seen, the propriety of this denial is not before us. So, by the failure to file a timely answer to the request, the fact that Williams was the child of James Edward Thomas and was, therefore, entitled to a one-third interest in the property stood admitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The matter of the interest of Williams was settled, at the trial level, once and for all. This was confirmed in an opinion of the judge issued 25 January 1988 in which he declared, \u201cWe have already determined that [Williams] is the owner of a one-third share [in the property].\u201d And, as we have seen, the final order of 14 January 1988 was in accord. The adherence of the judge to our rule was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Harvey argues that, even though she is deemed to have admitted that Williams was the child of James Edward Thomas, this was not conclusive. Harvey urges that further proof was required as called for by Md.Code (1974), \u00a7 1-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article, in the light of \u00a7 1-201 of that Article. Section 1-208(b) prescribes the circumstances in which \u201c[a] child born to parents who have not participated in a marriage ceremony with each other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>shall be considered to be the child of the father____\u201d Section 1-201 declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">In the absence of express language to the contrary, the rules of construction contained in this subtitle [2, designated \u201cDetermining Relationship\u201d] shall be applied in construing all provisions of the estates of decedents law and the terms of a will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">We agree that the language of these sections is clear, as asserted by Harvey, but it is equally clear that their provisions are inapplicable here. It is plainly and simply not necessary to resort to the circumstances set out in \u00a7 l-208(b) under which an illegitimate child shall be considered to be the child of a putative father when the party contesting the paternity admits that the alleged father is in fact the father. Whether Williams was born in or out of wedlock is of no matter. A man may beget a child outside the bonds of marriage. Paternity is not dependent upon a marriage ceremony. To say that a man is not the father of a child merely because he was not married to the mother is oxymoronic. By failing to comply with Rule 2-424(b), Harvey was conclusively deemed to have admitted that James Edward Thomas was the father of Williams. As the trial judge found, the failure took Harvey out of court on the issue, and, in the circumstances here, she carried Johnson, who did not seek review by way of certiorari, and McDonald, who did not appeal, with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The answer to the question presented in Harvey\u2019s petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari is \u201cno,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals did not err in holding that Harvey admitted the parentage of Williams. Sections 1-201 and l-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-12\">. The brief submitted to us, purporting to be that of \u201cappellants,\u201d bears not only the name of Harvey\u2019s attorney but also the name of Johnson's attorney. As we have noted, Johnson was a party to the appeal before the Court of Special Appeals, but she did not petition us for the issuance of a writ of certiorari and is not a party to the proceedings before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\">.
