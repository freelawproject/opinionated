He was then confined to Lorton Penitentiary in Virginia for another offense. On November 23, 1987, an arrest warrant was issued for Jefferson on the theft charge. It was lodged as a detainer for Jefferson\u2019s continued detention and served upon him at Lorton on April 19, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), which consists of nine Articles and supplemental provisions, codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl. Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 616A-616R, Jefferson was transferred from Lorton to Montgomery County for trial before the District Court. On May 19, 1988, Jefferson was convicted of theft and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On the same day, he appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County under Code (1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-401 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. This section authorizes \u201cthe defendant in a criminal case [to] appeal from a final judgment entered in the District Court.\u201d Section 12-401(d) specifies, with one exception, that the \u201cappeal shall be tried de novo.\u201d Pending the de novo proceeding, which was scheduled for July 13, 1988, Jefferson was returned to Lorton.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Prior to his appeal de novo before the circuit court, Jefferson moved to dismiss the theft charges; he relied upon provisions contained in Article IV of the IAD. Codified within \u00a7 616E, this part of the Interstate Agreement, in subsection (a), authorizes officials of a jurisdiction, in which an \u201cuntried indictment, information or complaint\u201d is pending, to have a prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged, and who is serving a term of imprisonment in another state, transferred temporarily to their custody for trial. Subsection (c) provides that trial in such cases shall be commenced within 120 days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state. Section 616E(e) \u2014 the so-called \u201canti-shuffling\u201d provision of the Act \u2014 provides that \u201c[i]f trial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby\u201d prior to the prisoner\u2019s being returned to the original place of imprisonment, the court shall dismiss the charging document \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In support of his motion to dismiss, Jefferson argued that a de novo appeal is not in actuality a second proceeding, but a continuation of the District Court trial. He maintained that the two proceedings should be considered as one for purposes of applying the \u201canti-shuffling\u201d provisions of \u00a7 616E(e), so that if the de novo appeal is not \u201chad,\u201d prior to his return to prison, the charges must be dismissed. Jefferson noted that the purposes of the IAD include the expeditious resolution of outstanding detainers and the prevention of \u201cshuffling\u201d of prisoners between jurisdictions. He said that both of these problems continue to exist with de novo appeals since the appeal requires a retrial of the same charges, a recalling of witnesses, and the presence of the defendant. He thus urged that \u00a7 616E be interpreted to include de novo appeals as part of the \u201ctrial\u201d that must be \u201chad\u201d before he may be returned to imprisonment in the sending state.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">After reviewing the provisions and purposes of the IAD, the circuit court (Mitchell, J) agreed with Jefferson. It said that the IAD \u201cmandates that a prisoner, transported for the purpose of resolving an outstanding criminal charge in another jurisdiction, be transported only once for a given jurisdiction and returned only after final disposition of the charges in the transferred state.\u201d The court held that the IAD was designed \u201cto ensure that a jurisdiction requesting to obtain temporary custody of another jurisdiction\u2019s prisoner completes its business with the prisoner before returning him to the custodial jurisdiction.\u201d It said that a de novo appeal under the Maryland statute functions as if the case had not been heard before and as if no decision had been previously rendered in the District Court. Acting on the belief that the District Court judgment was nullified by the filing of the de novo appeal, the court concluded that the appeal in effect \u201creturned the case to a pending status\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>therefore Jefferson\u2019s return to Lorton, prior to the completion of the de novo appeal, required dismissal of the charges under \u00a7 616E(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Upon the State\u2019s petition, we granted certiorari, pursuant to \u00a7 12-305 of the Courts Article, to consider whether, in the circumstances, \u00a7 616E(e) of the IAD was violated when Jefferson was returned to Lorton after the District Court trial but before his circuit court de novo appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The IAD is a compact among the states, the United States, and the District of Columbia. Enacted in Maryland in 1965, it recites in Article I (\u00a7 616B) that the \u201cparty states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation.\u201d The section further states that \u201cit is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">As we recognized in <em>Clipper v. State, </em>295 Md. 303, 305-06, 455 A.2d 973 (1983), the IAD \u201cprescribes the methods and procedures by which one jurisdiction may obtain temporary custody of an inmate imprisoned in another jurisdiction for purposes of trial on detainers based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><em>untried indictments, informations or complaints </em>pending in the requesting jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) \u201cThe two basic goals sought to be achieved by the IAD are: (1) to encourage the expeditious disposition of charges; and (2) to provide cooperative procedures among member jurisdictions to facilitate such disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 455 A.2d 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The IAD was enacted in part to avoid a \u201cpractice of filing detainers based on untried criminal charges that had little basis.\u201d <em>Carchman v. Nash, </em>478 U.S. 716, 729, 105 S.Ct. 3401, 3408, 87 L.Ed.2d 516 (1985). Before the IAD, the majority of these detainers were withdrawn shortly before the prisoner was released. <em>Id. </em>at 729-30, 105 S.Ct. at 3408-09; H.R.Rep. No. 91-1018, at 3 (1970); S.Rep. No. 91-1356, at 8 (1970). \u201cUndoubtedly, detainers [were] sometimes used by prosecutors to exact punishment without having to try a charge which they [believed] would not result in a conviction.\u201d <em>Carchman, </em>473 U.S. at 729-30 n. 6, 105 S.Ct. at 3408 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">As <em>Carchman </em>recognized, unsubstantiated detainers based on untried charges have a detrimental effect on the prisoner\u2019s treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 730, 105 S.Ct. at 3409. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">\u201c \u2018[T]he inmate is (1) deprived of an opportunity to obtain a sentence to run concurrently with the sentence being served at the time the detainer is filed; (2) classified as a maximum <em>or </em>close custody risk; (8) ineligible for initial assignments to less than maximum security prisons (i.e., honor farms or forestry camp work); (4) ineligible for trustee status; (5) not allowed to live in preferred living quarters such as dormitories; (6) ineligible for study-release programs or work-release programs; (7) ineligible to be transferred to preferred medium or minimum custody institutions within the correctional system, which includes the removal of any possibility of transfer to an institution more appropriate for youthful offenders; (8) not entitled to preferred prison jobs which carry higher wages and entitle [him] to additional good time credits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>against [his] sentence; (9) inhibited by the denial of possibility of parole or any commutation of his sentence; (10) caused anxiety and thus hindered in the overall rehabilitation process since he cannot take maximum advantage of his institutional opportunities.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><em>Id. </em>at n. 8 (quoting <em>Cooper v. Lockhart, </em>489 F.2d 308, 314, n. 10 (8th Cir.1973)). Because there was no uniform method to resolve detainers before the IAD, the detainers were potentially quite damaging for extended periods of time to the prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation at his place of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 358-59, 98 S.Ct. 1834, 1846-47, 56 L.Ed.2d 329 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">This is the background which gave rise to inclusion of the \u201canti-shuffling\u201d provision in Article IV of the IAD (\u00a7 616E(e)). The provision has been interpreted as intending to \u201climit the interjurisdictional transfer of prisoners by requiring [the accusing jurisdiction] ... [to] wrap up its business with [the prisoner], so to speak, before returning him to the custodial [jurisdiction].\u201d <em>Boyd v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 197, 203, 441 A.2d 1133, <em>aff'd, </em>294 Md. 103, 447 A.2d 871 (1982) (adopting the reasons given in the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals). <em>Boyd </em>explained that the anti-shuffling provision assists in implementing the IAD's purpose of \u201cminimizfing] any disruption to the prison regimen and the prisoner\u2019s participation in it.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The State urges that the nature of the de novo appeal, combined with the purposes of the IAD, allows the return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>of a prisoner after his District Court trial but before his de novo appeal. It claims that the circuit court appeal de novo acts as a second proceeding and not as a continuation of the District Court trial. Thus, it asserts that the District Court judgment against Jefferson satisfied the requirement of \u00a7 616E(e) that a \u201ctrial\u201d be \u201chad\u201d on the \u201ccomplaint contemplated hereby,\u201d and this is so regardless of whether the de novo appeal was \u201chad\u201d as well. Regarding the purpose of the IAD, the State maintains that dismissal of charges with prejudice is a drastic measure. It contends that the drafters of the IAD intended that the anti-shuffling provision be limited to circumstances where there has been no trial at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We said in <em>Hardy v. State, </em>279 Md. 489, 493, 369 A.2d 1043 (1977), that the de novo appeal is treated as a wholly original proceeding as if the charges had not been heard before and no decision had been rendered. The issue in that case was whether a defendant had a right to a jury upon his de novo appeal in the circuit court. It was in that context that we commented upon the nature of the de novo proceeding (\u201cde novo,\u201d we said, means \u201cafresh\u201d or \u201canew\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Nothing in <em>Hardy </em>suggested that the District Court judgment was not a final adjudication in that court. We have always recognized that the de novo nature of the appeal does not change its basic character as an appeal from a final judgment, with the circuit court exercising appellate, rather than original jurisdiction. <em>See Harper v. State, </em>312 Md. 396, 403-04, 540 A.2d 124 (1988); <em>Hardy, </em>279 Md. at 492, 369 A.2d 1043. Indeed, the de novo appeal could not have been perfected in the circuit court until there had been a final District Court judgment. \u00a7 12-101(a) of the Courts Article. As we later said in <em>Stanton v. State, </em>290 Md. 245, 248, 428 A.2d 1224 (1981), <em>Hardy </em>did not hold \u201cthat the mere entry or perfecting of a de novo appeal under \u00a7 12-401 of the Courts Article nullifies the District Court sentence prior to adjudication by the circuit court of the defendant\u2019s appeal.\u201d We noted that a defendant \u201cmay be incarcerated under the District Court sentence pending de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>termination of the de novo appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 428 A.2d 1224; Md. Rule 4-349. Moreover, a trial judge may legally impose a sentence to run consecutively to an earlier imposed District Court sentence in an unrelated case even though the earlier sentence is pending de novo review in circuit court. <em>See Briggs v. State, </em>289 Md. 23, 421 A.2d 1369 (1980) and <em>Stanton, supra, </em>290 Md. at 249, 428 A.2d 1224. It is thus clear that the District Court trial is complete unto itself. It does not act as a preliminary proceeding to a possible de novo appeal. Nor does the de novo appeal \u201cwipe the slate clean.\u201d <em>Stanton </em>at 249, 428 A.2d 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We have considered Jefferson\u2019s argument that support for his position that the de novo appeal acts as an extension of the District Court trial may be found in <em>Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294, 309, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 1813, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984). There, the Court stated, quoting <em>Lydon v. Justices of Boston Municipal Court, </em>698 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir.1982) (Campbell, J. dissenting):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201c 'While technically [the defendant] is \u201ctried again,\u201d the second stage proceeding can be regarded as but an enlarged, fact-sensitive part of a single, continuous course of judicial proceedings during which, sooner or later, a defendant receives more \u2014 rather than less \u2014 of the process normally extended to criminal defendants in this nation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The issue in <em>Lydon </em>concerned the extent to which the doctrine of double jeopardy applies to appeals de novo. The Supreme Court held that, for double jeopardy purposes, a de novo appeal should be regarded as a retrial after a reversal and remand of a conviction. It explained that, in both a retrial and a de novo appeal, jeopardy is \u201ccontinuing\u201d because there has been no acquittal. 466 U.S. at 308, 104 S.Ct. at 1813. It was in that context that the Court termed a de novo appeal as a \u201csingle, continuous course of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 104 S.Ct. at 1814. Manifestly, this language was not intended to require a District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>trial and the ensuing de novo appeal to be treated as one. Indeed, the Court fully recognized in <em>Lydon </em>that the de novo appeal was in effect a second trial distinct from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The \u201canti-shuffling\u201d provision of \u00a7 616E(e) does not, by its terms, require the receiving state to keep a prisoner until the final disposition of the charges against him. It only requires that a \u201ctrial\u201d be \u201chad\u201d on the charges. Had the IAD intended to require that the receiving state hold a prisoner until all appeals were exhausted, rather than just until completion of the trial, it would have said so in no uncertain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 616E(e) is inapplicable when, as here, the prisoner has been convicted by the District Court of the criminal charges underlying the detainer, files an appeal, and is returned to the sending state to await the scheduling of the de novo appeal. As explained in <em>Mauro, </em>\u201c[t]he real concern of [\u00a7 616E(e)] was that, if the prisoner were returned to the sending State prior to the disposition of the charges in the receiving State, the detainer previously lodged against him would remain in effect with all its attendant problems.\u201d <em>Mauro, </em>436 U.S. at 361 n. 26, 98 S.Ct. at 1847 n. 26. As we see it, however, the problems and uncertainties associated with detainers are based on <em>unsubstantiated </em>charges, or charges that remain lodged after the prisoner is returned. The detainer in this case was resolved with a District Court conviction against Jefferson; thus, the charge was no longer questionable or unsubstantiated. While the conviction may be overturned upon the conclusion of Jefferson\u2019s de novo appeal, obviously this is not a case where the prosecutors are using the detainer system \u201cto exact punishment without having to try a charge which they feel would not result in a conviction.\u201d <em>Carchman, supra, </em>473 U.S. at 729-30, n. 6, 105 S.Ct. at 3408, n. 6. In this regard, we note that the original detain-er lodged against Jefferson informing Lorton that he was facing charges in Maryland was removed once his District Court trial ended in a conviction; thereafter, a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>detainer had to be issued to inform Lorton that Jefferson was wanted for Ms de novo appeal. Thus, Jefferson\u2019s rehabilitation was not obstructed by any uncertainties flowing from the issuance of the original detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Certainly, the State is not required by \u00a7 616E(e) to retain custody of a prisoner appealing a circuit court conviction on the record to the Court of Special Appeals. We agree with <em>Shanks v. </em>Commonwealth, 574 S.W.2d 688, 690 (Ky.Ct. App.1978), which said, \u201cTo hold that a new detainer could not be filed to return [a prisoner] for [a] second trial [after his conviction has been reversed and remanded for a new trial] would be obvious error.\u201d For purposes of \u00a7 616E(e), we see no distinction between the two types of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">At least three jurisdictions have held that the \u201canti-shuffling\u201d provisions of \u00a7 616E(e) do not prohibit an accusing jurisdiction from returning a prisoner to his original place of imprisonment after a mistrial, but before his retrial. <em>United States v. </em>Evans, 423 F.Supp. 528 (S.D.N.Y.1976), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>556 F.2d 561 (2d Cir.1977); <em>Wilkett v. State, </em>753 P.2d 383 (Okla.Crim.App.1988); <em>Shanks, supra. </em>These courts have strictly interpreted the word \u201ctrial\u201d to mean that actual event.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The final judgment rendered against Jefferson in the District Court satisfied \u00a7 616E(e)\u2019s requirement that a \u201ctrial\u201d be \u201chad\u201d on the \u201ccomplaint contemplated hereby,\u201d regardless of whether the de novo trial was \u201chad\u201d as well. Our holding today does not render the provisions of \u00a7 616E of the IAD discordant with its other purposes. It is true that a secondary purpose of the \u201canti-shuffling\u201d provision is to ensure the physical presence of the prisoner and that the \u201c \u2018continuous physical presence of a prisoner is not possible when multiple trips to a foreign jurisdiction are made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd, supra, </em>51 Md.App. at 203 n. 5, 441 A.2d 1133, quoting <em>United States ex rel. Esola v. Groomes, </em>520 F.2d 830, 837 (3d Cir.1975). However, <em>Boyd </em>also notes that \u00a7 616E(e) is intended to limit jurisdictional transfers, not eliminate them altogether. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 441 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>It is also true that a purpose of the IAD is to expedite the resolution of the charges against a prisoner in order to protect against \u201cstaleness and difficulty of proof.\u201d <em>Clipper, supra, </em>295 Md. at 309, 455 A.2d 973. There are \u201cspeedy trial\u201d provisions to ensure that the State complies with this purpose. <em>See </em>Articles III(a), IV(c) of the IAD. However, Jefferson was granted his speedy trial in the District Court. He has remedies under Article III of the IAD by which he can ensure a speedy trial of the second detainer filed against him. He also has constitutional speedy trial remedies. Nothing in our holding today interferes with these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION.
