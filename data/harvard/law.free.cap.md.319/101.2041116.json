ORTH, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">\n<em>Statement of the Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">Juvenile delinquency petitions were filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging that Clifton P. and Antoine H. had committed the crimes of harboring a fugitive, proscribed by Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 268F (first count), and hindering or obstructing police officers in the performance of their duties, proscribed by the common law (second count). At a joint adjudicatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>hearing, the master, in response to \u201ca motion of dismissal,\u201d recommended that the harboring charge be dismissed and that the obstruction charge be sustained. There were separate disposition hearings. The master who presided at the adjudicatory hearing conducted, the disposition hearing as to H. She recommended that H. be found delinquent and that he be placed on conditional probation. The disposition of P. was referred to another master who had conducted an adjudicatory hearing concerning a charge that P. had committed a crime unrelated to those charged here. She recommended that P. be found delinquent and that he be committed to the Juvenile Services Agency. Both H. and P. filed exceptions to the respective recommendations, each alleging that \u201cthe adjudication of the allegations in [his] petition were erroneous.\u201d The exceptions were heard by one judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City but at separate hearings. In each ease, the judge overruled the exceptions and approved the recommendations. Each juvenile noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We ordered, <em>ex mero motu, </em>before decision by the intermediate appellate court, that the cases be certified to us. The cases were consolidated for our review. Two questions were presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">1. Whether the common law offense of hindering a police officer has been preempted by Maryland Code, Article 27, \u00a7 268F when applied to the facts of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">2. Whether the evidence was insufficient to prove that [H. and P.] hindered or obstructed a police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">(1)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\n<em>Preemption</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">(a)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">\n<em>The Crime of Hindering or Obstructing a Police Officer</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">[Resisting, hindering, or obstructing an officer of the law in the performance of his duties is an offense at common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>law.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><em>Cover v.

We give a precis of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">A warrant was outstanding for the arrest of one Joseph Howard. Members of the Baltimore City Police Department went to Howard's residence to execute the warrant. They did not find him on the premises, but \u201ctwo girls and a young boy ran out the back door,\u201d and fled the scene. P. and one Clarence Barnes remained in the house. The next day the police officers returned to the house.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">Officer Krebs and Officer Brown positioned themselves in front of the house and Officer Carter went to the rear. They kept rapping on the door but were unable to gain entrance to the house until about 15 minutes passed by. They were finally admitted to the house____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Officer Carter, stationed at the rear of the house, also was refused entrance for 10 or 15 minutes. During that time she heard</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-14\">sounds of movement inside and the curtains moved at - times, but she was unable to identify anyone specifically on that basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">When the police were finally admitted, they saw H., P., and an adult, Calvin Foster. The officers asked whether Joseph Howard was there and all three said, \u201cno,\u201d he \u201cwas not there at the time.\u201d Nevertheless, the officers searched the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>house. They found Howard in the cellar \u201cbehind some knotted pine planks.\u201d They arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">H. elected not to testify. P. took the stand. He denied that either he or H. told the police that Howard was not there. He claimed that he was upstairs when the police arrived, that \u201che heard some knocking at the door, and that someone said, \u2018don\u2019t open the door.\u2019 \u201d He admitted that he had been in the house the day before when the police arrived, but that Howard was not there at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\n<em>The Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Maryland Code (1978,1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-819(b)(1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">Before a child is adjudicated delinquent, the allegations in the petition that the child has committed a delinquent act must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Section 3-801(k) declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">\u201cDelinquent act\u201d means an act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The standard for appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict in a criminal trial, whether rendered by the court or by a jury, is whether the evidence either shows directly or supports a rational inference of the facts to be proved, from which the trier of fact could fairly<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State, </em>261 Md. 551, 563-564, 276 A.2d 214 (1971); <em>Royal v. State, </em>236 Md. 448, 448-449, 204 A.2d 500 (1964); <em>Williams v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 450, 459, 247 A.2d 731 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>252 Md. 734 (1969). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>[w]hen an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Md. Rule 8-131(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">It is clear that the evidence was sufficient to prove the first element of the offense \u2014 that the police officers were engaged in the performance of a duty. It is equally clear that the evidence was insufficient to prove each and every one of the other elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Looking at the facts as set out in the agreed statement in the light most favorable to the State, <em>see, Cover, </em>297 Md. at 400, 466 A.2d 1276, the extent of the acts of P. and H. was (1) the failure to open the door promptly when the police sought entrance, thereby conceivably affording Howard an opportunity to hide; (2) the lie to the police about Howard\u2019s presence on the premises; and (3) in general, the lack of cooperation with the police. These acts, viewed singly or together, do not bring P. and H. within the ambit of the crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, the agreed statement is deficient in that the evidence presented therein does not contain facts sufficient to support a determination by the trier of fact that P. and H. were guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the crime of hindering or obstructing the police. To give but one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>example of the deficiency, the facts recounted in the statement are not adequate to support a finding that the police were actually hindered or obstructed by P. and H. in the attempt to arrest Howard. It is clear that the denials that Howard was on the premises did not hinder or obstruct the officers in the performance of their duty. The officers did not believe the denials. They searched the house despite the denials and found Howard. Any delay in opening the door did not, in any event, result in a failure to find and arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Under our system of the administration of criminal justice, an accused is presumed to be innocent. It is the obligation of the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty. <em>Christensen v. State, </em>274 Md. 133, 140, 333 A.2d 45 (1975); <em>Stanley v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 651, 655-656, 406 A.2d 693, <em>cert. denied, </em>286 Md. 753 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 926, 100 S.Ct. 3021, 65 L.Ed.2d 1119 (1980). On the evidence presented to us, the State did not meet its obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">ORDERS'OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY OVERRULING THE EXCEPTIONS OF P. AND H.
