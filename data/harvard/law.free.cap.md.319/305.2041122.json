Ficker (Ficker) with violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (for acts that occurred on or before 31 December 1986) and of the Rules of Professional Conduct (for acts that occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>thereafter).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9 b, we referred the matter to Judge Peter Messitte of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The charges against Ficker related to three sets of circumstances, the first involving Angela A. Daley, the second Lewis Keith Wilcom, and the third an advertisement Ficker had placed soliciting \u201cpalimony\u201d cases. Judge Messitte held an evidentiary hearing. In the <em>Daley </em>matter he found that Ficker had in two respects neglected a legal matter in violation of DR 6-101(A)(3), Code of Professional Responsibility, and that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of DR 1-102(A)(5). In the <em>Wilcom </em>case, Judge Messitte again found Ficker guilty of neglect and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice under the Code. In addition, the judge concluded that Ficker had \u201chabitually\u201d violated a rule of court, thereby also violating DR 7-106(C)(7). Additionally, Judge Messitte found violations of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3 (diligence). With respect to the \u201cpalimony\u201d matter, Judge Messitte held that the AGC had failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the advertisement was misleading in violation of Rule 7.1, Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Ficker excepts to Judge Messitte\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations in the <em>Daley </em>matter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The AGC excepts to the factual findings and legal conclusions that lead to Judge Messitte\u2019s holding that Ficker did not violate Rule 7.1. No one excepts to the findings or conclusions in the <em>Wilcom </em>case. We shall summarize them, nevertheless, since they must be considered when we determine the appropriate sanctions for Ficker\u2019s conduct. And because of some factual similarities, we discuss the <em>Daley </em>and <em>Wilcom </em>cases together. We shall reject Ficker\u2019s exceptions as well as those advanced by the AGC.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">I. Daley and Wilcom</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Ficker encountered Angela Daley and Lewis Wilcom in 1986, in separate cases. Ficker had been practicing law since 1973 and in 1986 was a sole practitioner with an office in Bethesda, Montgomery County. He employed one full-time clerk with no legal training. He maintained no formal \u201cdiary\u201d or \u201ctickler\u201d system. His only schedule of clients\u2019 court dates was a large desk calendar upon which he endeavored to make appropriate entries. His practice \u201cconsisted primarily of the representation of clients charged with drinking and driving offenses\u201d and Daley and Wilcom each retained him in connection with drinking and driving charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">A. Angela Daley</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Daley, a resident of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, was charged with violation of \u00a7 21-902 of the Transportation Article, Maryland Code (1988 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.) (driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol), and with a related offense. She was to appear for trial in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Frederick County at 9:00 a.m. on 4 December 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">On 30 October 1986 Daley met with Ficker in his office. She retained him to represent her and paid $200 on account of his $599 fee. Ficker agreed to appear on the 4 December trial date. But he failed to enter the trial date on his desk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>calendar. He also failed to enter his appearance in the District Court as required by Md. Rule 4-214(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">On 4 December Daley travelled from her Pennsylvania residence to Frederick and awaited the docket call in District Court. Ficker never appeared. He later explained that he had simply forgotten about his commitment to be there on Daley\u2019s behalf. No one attempted to contact Ficker. Daley\u2019s case was continued until the afternoon, at which time she pleaded guilty, was fined $250, and placed on probation before judgment. That disposition, the AGC and Ficker agree, was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The next day Daley phoned Ficker and told him what had occurred. He apologized and immediately refunded the $200 retainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">B. Lewis Wilcom</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Like Daley, Wilcom was charged with a violation of \u00a7 21-902 of the Transportation Article. Wilcom\u2019s trial was also to be held in the District Court in Frederick County. The trial date was 23 December 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">On 9 December 1986 Wilcom and his mother met with Ficker and retained the lawyer to appear on Wilcom\u2019s behalf for a fee of $599. This time Ficker entered the trial date on the desk calendar. But he again violated Rule 4-214(a) by failing to enter his appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">On 23 December both Wilcom and Ficker were in Frederick. The former was in the courtroom and was unaware that the latter was nearby. Ficker was in the hallway searching for the arresting officer. When Wilcom\u2019s case was called, it was continued, at the State\u2019s request, because the arresting officer was not on hand. The new trial date was 3 March 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Ficker and Wilcom never made contact on 23 December. But Ficker testified that on that date, he did enter his appearance on behalf of Wilcom. Judge Messitte found that the docket entries in Wilcom\u2019s case did not show the entry of Ficker\u2019s appearance on 23 December or at any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">On 3 March 1987 Wilcom appeared in court, but Ficker did not. Because the court records did not show his appearance, he had not been notified of the 3 March trial date. Wilcom explained that Ficker was representing him, and the court granted a continuance to 24 June 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Ficker had actual notice of the 24 June date; Wilcom\u2019s mother told him about it. But despite that, Ficker undertook to appear for another client in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on the same date. In an attempt to resolve the conflict, he sought yet another continuance of Wilcom\u2019s case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The \u201ccomedy\u201d of errors proceeded. Because Ficker put the wrong zip code on the envelope containing the motion for continuance that he tried to send to the District Court in Frederick, it never arrived there. Ficker, however, assumed both that the motion had arrived and that it would be granted. Without checking further, he advised Mrs. Wilcom that the case would be continued and that her son need not appear for trial on 24 June.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Despite that advice, Wilcom did appear in court on 24 June. Ficker, relying on the nonexistent continuance, did not. The prosecutor <em>had </em>received a copy of Ficker\u2019s motion and showed it to the trial judge, who offered Wilcom yet another postponement. Wilcom elected to proceed pro se. He pled guilty to driving under the influence and received probation and a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">When Ficker learned of this, he represented Wilcom without charge at a de novo appeal. Wilcom was convicted of driving under the influence. The court imposed probation and a fine almost double that imposed in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">C. Ficker\u2019s Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Ficker insists that he did not violate DR 6-101(A)(S) in the <em>Daley </em>matter because a single inadvertent failure to appear is not neglect of a legal matter. Nor is his failure to enter his written appearance neglect, he says, because that was not shown to be part of a pattern of neglect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The text for his argument is American Bar Association Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility Informal Opinion 1273 (1973). The Committee opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">Neglect involves indifference and a consistent failure to carry out the obligations which the lawyer has assumed to his client or a conscious disregard for the responsibility owed to the client. The concept of ordinary negligence is different. Neglect usually involves more than a single act or omission. Neglect cannot be found if the acts or omissions complained of were inadvertent or the result of an error of judgment made in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\"><em>Accord, </em>ABA Comm, on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Informal Op. 1428 (1979); ABA Comm, on Ethics and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Professional Responsibility, Informal Op. 1467 (1981); Informal Opinion 1273 also is cited in R. Rotunda, <em>Professional Responsibility </em>86 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We have considered the ABA Committee\u2019s construction of DR 6-101(A)(3), but decline to follow it. First, it is an advisory opinion given in a vacuum with the conclusion already assumed in the question submitted to the Committee. The opinion responds to this question: <em>\u201cAssume a lawyer has not neglected the matter entrusted to him, </em>is his ordinary negligence involving an affirmative act or omission grounds for disciplinary action?\u201d Informal Op. 1273, <em>supra </em>[emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Second, we already have read DR 6-101(A)(3) more broadly than has the ABA Committee. In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>296 Md. 113, 460 A.2d 597 (1983), we considered, among other things, a complaint of Gerald McCants. An action brought by Montgomery on behalf of McCants was dismissed at a hearing attended by McCants but not by his lawyer, Montgomery. 296 Md. at 119, 460 A.2d at 600. We concluded that Montgomery \u201cwas not present in court when the dismissal took place and this alone would constitute neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We did not speak of patterns or consistent failure or conscious disregard of responsibility, nor did we suggest that inadvertence might be a defense. We found, a single failure to appear to be neglect. We believe Ficker\u2019s single failure to appear also was neglect, as was his failure to enter his written appearance. <em>See also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>302 Md. 571, 579, 490 A.2d 231, 235 (1985) (single instance of failure to include attestation clause and witness signature lines on will is neglect).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Given the duty of zealous representation that a lawyer owes the client, we are not persuaded that a failure to appear caused by poor office practices or simple forgetfulness can never be neglect. Nor are we convinced that inadvertent failure to comply with a mandatory rule like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Rule 4-214(a) can never be a violation of DR 6-101(A)(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Ethical Consideration 6-1 (under Canon 6 of the Code of Professional Responsibility) directs a lawyer to \u201cact with ... proper care in representing clients.\u201d Ethical Consideration 6-4 also admonishes a lawyer who has undertaken representation to \u201cuse proper care to safeguard the interests of his client.\u201d Derelictions of the sort involved here can result in serious harm to the client, even when the cause is no more than carelessness. Both Daley and Ficker are fortunate that no major prejudice occurred in this case, but we reject Ficker\u2019s argument that a single act of negligence that causes no serious harm is not, as a matter of law, a violation of DR 6-101(A)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We agree with Judge Messitte that inadvertence, lack of a persistent pattern of conduct, lack of prejudice to the client, and other such matters \u201cmore properly pertain to mitigation of any sanction, rather than the fact of violation.\u201d <em>See Maryland Stale Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975) (\u201c[wjhere an attorney has been shown to have been negligent, or inattentive to his client\u2019s interests ... in violation of the canons ..., the imposition of some disciplinary sanction against him may be warranted; the extent of the discipline to be applied, however, is generally dependent upon the severity of the conduct and the particular facts and circumstances surrounding it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Ficker also insists that his inadvertent failure to be present at Daley\u2019s trial cannot be conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of DR 1-102(A)(5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>He argues that to pass constitutional muster the term \u201cconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d must be narrowly defined or limited to \u201cparticularly egregious conduct\u201d or \u201cconduct flagrantly violative of accepted professional norms.\u201d <em>In re Hinds, </em>90 N.J. 604, 632, 449 A.2d 483, 498 (1982) (citing <em>Committee on Professional Ethics v. Durham, </em>279 N.W.2d 280 (Iowa 1979)). <em>Hinds </em>does not hold, however, that DR 1-102(A)(5) would be unconstitutional if not construed as Ficker wishes; it says only that if so construed, the rule is sufficiently definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">More to the point, we have very recently concluded that Rule 1-102(A)(5) \u201cis neither facially overbroad nor void for vagueness____\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 538, 565 A.2d 660, 667 (1989). There, we pointed out that \u201c \u2018[t]he regulation ... applies only to lawyers, who are professionals and have the benefit of guidance provided by case law, court rules and the \u201clore of the profession.\u201d <em>In re Snyder, </em>... 472 U.S. [634] at 645, 105 S.Ct. [2874] at 2881 [86 L.Ed.2d 504 (1985) ].\u2019 \u201d 317 Md. at 538, 565 A.2d at 667 (quoting <em>Howell v. State Bar of Texas, </em>843 F.2d 205, 208 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 109 S.Ct. 531, 102 L.Ed.2d 563 (1988)). <em>See also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Korotki, </em>318 Md, 646, 667-668, 569 A.2d 1224, 1234-1235 (1990). In that case we upheld DR 2-106, prohibiting excessive fees, against a vagueness challenge. Judge Rodowsky, for the Court, observed that \u201c[t]he regulations governing conduct of members of the bar are civil and not criminal\u201d and subject to more tolerant scrutiny than an enactment imposing criminal penalties. \u201c \u2018All that is necessary is that the [disciplinary] rule prescribe general principles so that those subject to the rule are reasonably able to determine what conduct is appropriate.\u2019 \u201d 318 Md. at 667, 569 A.2d at 1235 (quoting <em>In re Charges of Unprofessional Conduct Against N.P., </em>361 N.W.2d 386, 394 (Minn.), <em>appeal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>dismissed, </em>474 U.S. 976, 106 S.Ct. 375, 88 L.Ed.2d 330 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Ficker fares no better with his contention that inadvertent failure to appear in court cannot constitute conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Unlike the respondent in <em>Matter of Alexander, </em>496 A.2d 244, 250 (D.C.App.1985), a case Ficker relies on, Ficker knew precisely when Daley\u2019s trial was to be held and had agreed to be there. His negligent failure to be present at that trial interfered with the orderly disposition of the court\u2019s docket; a trial set for 9:00 a.m. had to be postponed until afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We have held that failure to be punctual in a scheduled court appearance is \u201cnot only detrimental to the administration of justice but also constitute^] discourteous conduct degrading to the tribunal.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Howard, </em>282 Md. 515, 523, 385 A.2d 1191, 1196 (1978). We have held that an attorney who fails to appear punctually at a trial is guilty of a contempt of court. <em>Kandel v. State, </em>252 Md. 668, 250 A.2d 853 (1969). Misconduct of that sort is a contempt of court because it interferes with the conduct of court business.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">[A]n attorney plays such an integral role in the judicial process that without his presence the wheels of justice must, necessarily, grind to a halt. The attorney\u2019s absence from the courtroom is immediately cognizable by the judge and intrudes upon the operation and dignity of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\"><em>Murphy v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 138, 146, 416 A.2d 748, 753 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">If being late for a scheduled court appearance interferes with the administration of justice, it is obvious that being altogether absent from a scheduled trial does so as well. As in the case of neglect, the circumstances surrounding the failure to appear and the actual consequences of that failure are matters that go to the question of sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">We overrule Ficker\u2019s exceptions to Judge Messitte\u2019s conclusions of law in the <em>Daley </em>matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>II. \u201cPalimony\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">A. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We now turn to the \u201cpalimony\u201d problem. The facts on which the charges against Ficker are based are simple; the resolution of the question of whether these facts establish a violation of Rule 7.1, Rules of Professional Conduct, is more complex.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In 1987, Ficker placed advertisements in the <em>Washington Post </em>and the <em>Washington Times. </em>They read:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">PALIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Suits Against Wealthy Men</p>\n<p id=\"AiKn\">Robin Ficker, Atty.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">652-1500</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The ads ran once in each of two successive weeks in each paper. No one responded to the ads, and Ficker withdrew them.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Judge Messitte found that Ficker, who had a very limited divorce practice, had never had an occasion to file a law suit seeking \u201cpalimony.\u201d The lawyer chose to use the term \u201cpalimony\u201d because it was \u201cpunchy\u201d and would give him more \u201cbang for my buck.\u201d He conceded that when he placed the ads, he knew that \u201cpalimony\u201d was not a precise term and that \u201cit means different things to different people, depending upon their fact circumstances.\u201d Ficker \u201cknew that any recovery had to be based on a contractual right, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>a promise other than simply based on the meretricious, or sexual aspect of the relationship.\u201d He sought to limit his clients to those with \u201csuits against wealthy men\u201d as a \u201cscreening device meant to target situations where people had substantial involvements, and could actually afford to have an attorney represent their interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Before Judge Messitte, Bar Counsel argued that \u201cpalimony\u201d meant \u201calimony for a pal\u201d and that Maryland law had never recognized such a cause of action. Since the ads invited clients to retain Ficker to sue on a nonexistent cause of action, the ads were misleading. Ficker, on the other hand, asserted that \u201cpalimony\u201d had a very broad meaning and had been recognized in fact, if not by name, in <em>Baxter v. </em>Wilburn, 172 Md. 160, 190 A. 773 (1937), and <em>Donovan v. Scuderi, </em>51 Md.App. 217, 443 A.2d 121, <em>cert. denied, </em>293 Md. 616 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Judge Messitte approached the problem as a factual issue. He received testimony from Professor William I. Weston of the University of Baltimore School of Law, who was accepted as an expert in both domestic relations law and ethics. He consulted dictionaries and treatises about language and how it develops. He examined newspaper and magazine articles. He concluded that \u201c \u2018palimony\u2019 is already a legitimate word fairly used in a broad sense ... as referring to the collective rights of unmarried cohabitants.\u201d He expressed the view that, in that broad sense, Maryland does recognize a cause of action for \u201cpalimony\u201d because this Court, in <em>Baxter, supra, </em>said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">But the mere fact that a man and a woman are living together in an unlawful relation does not disable them from making an enforceable contract with each other, if it has no reference to continuation of the relation, or is only incidentally connected with it, and may be supported independently of it. A loan to the woman to buy herself clothes would be lawful, and upon the same reasoning a loan to buy real property not for the furtherance of the immoral relation would be enforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>172 Md. at 162-163, 190 A. at 774. <em>See also Donovan, </em>51 Md.App. at 228, 443 A.2d at 127, where the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">[w]hether an agreement is reached as the result of ego, braggadocio, love, kindness or affection does not affect the validity of a contract. Nor is it unenforceable because the contract may never have been struck, \u201cbut for\u201d the relationship, even if proven adulterous. That relationship does not disable parties from making an enforceable contract with each other so long as it does not stand or fall upon the sexual relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The judge concluded that because \u201cpalimony\u201d has a broader meaning than merely \u201calimony for [or from] a pal,\u201d it refers to a cause of action recognized in Maryland and, therefore, Ficker had \u201cneither advertised falsely nor ... misled anyone.\u201d He found no violation of Rule 7.1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Attorney Grievance Commission excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We agree with Judge Messitte that Ficker\u2019s ads were tasteless. \u201cBad taste,\u201d however, is not a synonym for \u201cmisleading,\u201d nor does \u201ccrassness\u201d necessarily equate with \u201cfalse advertising.\u201d We are unable to hold that Judge Messitte\u2019s factual findings as to the meaning of \u201cpalimony\u201d were clearly erroneous. And his conclusion that the ads did not violate Rule 7.1 was firmly based on those factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The word \u201cpalimony\u201d seems to have entered the language in connection with the case of <em>Marvin v. Marvin, </em>18 Cal.3d 660, 557 P.2d 106, 134 Cal.Rptr. 815 (1976), although it was not used in that case. In <em>Marvin, </em>the Supreme Court of California held that the provisions of that state\u2019s Family Law Article did not govern the distribution of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>between unmarried cohabitants. But the <em>Marvin </em>court also said that courts would enforce express or implied contracts between unmarried cohabitants, including contracts for property division and for support, to the extent that the contracts were not explicitly founded on meretricious sexual services. 18 Cal.Sd at 665, 557 P.2d at 110, 134 Cal.Rptr. at 819. Counsel in the case, however, coined the term \u201cpalimony\u201d to describe the <em>Marvin </em>case. <em>See </em>Los Angeles Daily Journal, 16 May 1989, at 6, col. 3. The word was picked up by the press. <em>See, e.g., </em>Footlock and Kasindorf, <em>An Unmarried Woman, </em>Newsweek, Apr. 30, 1979, at 70. It has now become a part of our language.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">As noted, we have no quarrel with Judge Messitte\u2019s finding to that effect or with his findings that \"language evolves and the meanings of words change. All this is obvious. Nor was the judge clearly erroneous when he found (adopting Professor Weston\u2019s testimony) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201cPalimony is a generic term that describes a series of remedies. It is much like the term civil rights, or torts, although obviously not as well developed. The concept being a series of rights and remedies as between nonmarried cohabitants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cObviously the majority of those rights and remedies involve contracts, but there are other rights and remedies that have been enforced around the country as well, all under the rubric of palimony cases.\u201d<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">This \u201cbroad\u201d definition of \u201cpalimony\u201d is consistent with <em>Marvin, </em>which spoke of remedies such as express contract, implied contract, and constructive trust, so long as meretricious sexual services were not the basis for the claim. Thus, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1000 (5th ed. 1979) explains that \u201cpalimony\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>has a meaning similar to \u2018alimony' except that award, settlement or agreement arises out of nonmarital relationship of parties <em>(i.e. </em>nonmarital partners). It has been held that courts should enforce express contracts between nonmarital partners except to the extent the contract is explicitly founded on the consideration of meretricious sexual services, despite contention that such contracts violate public policy; that in the absence of express contract, the court should inquire into the conduct of the parties to determine whether that conduct demonstrates implied contract, agreement of partnership or joint venture, or some other tacit understanding between the parties, and may also employ the doctrine of quantum meruit or equitable remedies such as constructive or resulting trust, when warranted by the facts of the case. <em>Marvin v. Marvin, </em>557 P.2d 106, 18 Cal.3d 660, 134 Cal.Rptr. 815.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><em>See generally </em>S. Green and J. Long, <em>Marriage and Family Law Agreements </em>\u00a7 3.15 at 188 (1984). <em>And see, e.g., Kozlowski v. Kozlowski, </em>80 N.J. 378, 403 A.2d 902 (1979); <em>Morone v. Morone, </em>50 N.Y.2d 481, 413 N.E.2d 1154, 429 N.Y.S.2d 592 (1980); <em>Kinnison v. Kinnison, </em>627 P.2d 594 (Wyo.1981); <em>Glasgo v. Glasgo, </em>410 N.E.2d 1325 (Ind.App. 1980). None of these cases uses the word \u201cpalimony\u201d <em>(but see Crowe v. DeGioia, </em>203 N.J.Super. 22, 30, 495 A.2d 889, 900 (1985), which does); but all of them apply broad principles consistent with the <em>Black </em>definition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">It is, of course, true that the meaning of \u201cpalimony\u201d is not limited to the type of actions recognized in <em>Marvin </em>and other cases; <em>see </em>n. 11, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. The word can be understood as meaning (as the AGC insists) alimony from or for a pal, as opposed to a Marvin-type action. For example, the <em>Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>1397 (2d ed. 1987) tells us that</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cpalimony\u201d is \u201ca form of alimony awarded to one of the partners in a romantic relationship after the breakup of that relationship following a long period of living together \u2014 \u201d <em>See also, e.g., </em>XI <em>Oxford Eng sh Dictionary </em>95 (2d ed. 1989), W. Statsky, <em>West\u2019s Legal Thesaurus/Dictionary </em>555 (1985); M. Bernard, E. Levine, S. Presser <em>&amp; </em>M. Stecich, <em>The Rights of Single People </em>55 (1985). Both Professor Weston and Judge Messitte recognized this ambiguity. But ambiguity does not necessarily translate into a violation of Rule 7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Professor Weston, asked whether \u201cthe fact that one person may understand palimony to mean something different than another person\u201d made the word \u201cmisleading, inherently,\u201d replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">No. It does not. Because the very nature of the term is to make people aware of a class of action that involves nonmarried cohabitants. The fact of the matter is when the advertisement is read, the very worst that happens is the person calls the lawyer, goes to the lawyer\u2019s office and learns more about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">So that the term itself is not misleading, inherently misleading and the consequences pose absolutely no damage whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Put otherwise, the problem seen by the AGC is that Ficker\u2019s ads were not complete because they failed to limit themselves to the contractual component of \u201cpalimony,\u201d or to disclaim the \u201calimony for a pal\u201d aspect. It is certainly true that in connection with professional advertising more disclosure is better than less. <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U.S. 350, 373-374, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2703-2704, 53 L.Ed.2d 810, 829 (1977). But the <em>Bates </em>Court also observed that while \u201c[advertising does not provide a complete foundation on which to select an attorney, ... it seems peculiar to deny the consumer, on the ground that the information is incomplete, at least some of the relevant information needed to reach an informed decision.\u201d 433 U.S. at 374, 97 S.Ct. at 2704, 53 L.Ed.2d at 829-830.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The AGC directs our attention to <em>Barnett v. Md. State Bd. of Dental Ex., </em>293 Md. 361, 444 A.2d 1013 (1982). In that case we held that a dentist\u2019s use of the word \u201cpolydontics\u201d in an advertisement was deceptive and misleading. This word, we explained, could easily be confused with various other words defining particular dental specialties, and thus could lead the public to believe that Dr. Barnett possessed expertise in such a speciality. In point of fact, however, the word was misleading because it did not refer to <em>any </em>recognized speciality; it was simply manufactured by Dr. Barnett. 293 Md. at 370-372, 444 A.2d at 1017-1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Obviously, \u201cpalimony\u201d also is a manufactured word. It was not manufactured by Ficker, however. As Judge Messitte correctly explained \u201c 'palimony\u2019 is already a legitimate word fairly used in a broad sense.\u201d It was not a violation of Rule 7.1 for Ficker to use the word in that broad sense; Judge Messitte also was correct in pointing out that Maryland appellate courts have recognized that a contract between cohabiting but unmarried persons may be enforceable if not based on a meretricious sexual relationship. <em>See Baxter v. Wilburn </em>and <em>Donovan v. Scuderi, </em>both <em>supra, </em>as well as <em>Lynch v. Rogers, </em>177 Md. 478, 10 A.2d 619 (1940). Indeed, our very recent decision in <em>Unitas v. Temple, </em>314 Md. 689, 552 A.2d 1285 (1989), implicitly recognizes the enforceability of such a contract. <em>Unitas </em>involved a purported contract between two unmarried people. It did not meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. But Judge Rodowsky, for the Court, took care to point out that the unenforceability of the contract was not caused by the problem of a meretricious relationship or by an effort to seek \u201cpalimony\u201d in the \u201calimony for a pal\u201d sense. 314 Md. at 701 n. 6, 552 A.2d at 1291 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Judge Messitte believed that the AGC\u2019s case for violation of Rule 7.1 \u201cfalls woefully short by [the clear and convincing evidence standard] or indeed quite likely by any lesser standard.\u201d Proof by clear and convincing evidence is indeed what is required to support factual findings in an attorney discipline matter. Md. Rule BY10 d. We, at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>rate, do not find the judge\u2019s fact-findings with respect to \u201cpalimony\u201d clearly erroneous. As a consequence, the AGC\u2019s exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">III. Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We have overruled Ficker\u2019s exceptions and those of the AGC. Consequently, Ficker has been found to be in violation of the ethics provisions prohibiting neglect, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, and habitual violation of a rule of procedure in the <em>Daley </em>and <em>Wilcom </em>matters, and of lack of diligence in the latter. The remaining question is that of an appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The purpose of attorney \u201cdisciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish\u201d the errant lawyer. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kolodner, </em>316 Md. 203, 208, 557 A.2d 1332, 1334 (1989). And the \u201cseverity of sanctions depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kandel, </em>317 Md. 274, 281, 563 A.2d 387, 390 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Both <em>Daley </em>and <em>Wilcom </em>occurred within approximately the same time frame. Since then, Judge Messitte found, Ficker \u201chas improved his office practice, ... hir[ed] an associate, [required] the associate to maintain a separate calendar of court dates, and maintain[s] in all three separate court calendars in the office.\u201d Additionally, the judge believed that Ficker appreciates his responsibility to his clients, understands the requirements of Md. Rule 4-214(a), \u201cseems committed to appear timely at his Court proceedings; and he has given to understand that he cannot again take the filing or approval of his motions for granted.\u201d The judge concluded that \u201c[a]ll things considered, [Ficker] appears to have learned his lesson\u201d with respect to the ethical lapses illustrated by <em>Daley </em>and <em>Wilcom. </em>Under all the circumstances, we believe a reprimand to be the appropriate sanction for those derelictions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>IT IS SO ORDERED.

We shall refer no further to either of these rules; if an attorney has violated a substantive rule of ethics, it is enough that he or she be sanctioned for that transgression.
