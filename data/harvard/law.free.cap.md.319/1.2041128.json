The legislative policy of limiting the employer\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation liability to that payable for the subsequent injury was designed to encourage the hiring of handicapped persons. <em>See generally </em>Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 66; <em>McKenzie v. C. C. Kottcamp &amp; Sons, </em>311 Md. 54, 57, 532 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>A.2d 703 (1987); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Kraus, </em>301 Md. 111, 117, 482 A.2d 468 (1984); <em>Anchor Motor v. Sub. Injury Fund, </em>278 Md. 320, 324-325, 363 A.2d 505 (1976); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Thomas, </em>275 Md. 628, 633-634, 342 A.2d 671 (1975). In order to raise monies for the SIF, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission assesses 6V2% of all awards rendered against an employer, or the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, for permanent disability or death, and of all settlements approved by the Commission. Art. 101, \u00a7 66(2)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The UEF was created in 1967 to provide for the payment of workers\u2019 compensation awards against uninsured employers. Ch. 152 of the Acts of 1967, codified as Art. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 90-102. The UEF is funded by, <em>inter alia, </em>a 1% assessment upon all awards rendered against an employer, or the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, for permanent disability or death, and upon all settlement agreements approved by the Commission. Art. 101, \u00a7 91(d)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The assessments to fund the SIF and UEF are paid in addition to any payment of compensation to employees or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>their dependents. Art. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 66(2)(c), 91(d)(3)(iii). All funds received by the SIF and the UEF are held, managed and disbursed by the State Treasurer. Art. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 66(2)(d), 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation (PCIGC) was created by the General Assembly as a non-profit corporation intended \u201cto provide a mechanism for the prompt payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies and to avoid financial loss to residents of Maryland who are claimants or policyholders of an insurer, including surety, which has become insolvent____\u201d Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 504.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> PCIGC is funded by member insurers who are required to \u201cbe and remain members of the Corporation as a condition of their authority to transact insurance in this State.\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 506(b). PCIGC is obligated to pay, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cfull amount of any covered claim arising out of a workmen\u2019s compensation policy.\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 508(a)(1)(i). PCIGC is exempt, however, \u201cfrom payment of all fees and all taxes levied by this State ... except taxes levied on real or personal property.\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">After repeated attempts by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission to collect from PCIGC for SIF and UEF assessments on awards PCIGC had paid to injured workers, PCIGC filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for declaratory relief. PCIGC contended that the assessments for the SIF and UEF are taxes or fees and that, therefore, it is exempt from paying the assessments pursuant to Art. 48A, \u00a7 515. The Commission took the position that the SIF and UEF assessments are not taxes but are part of the \u201ccovered claims\u201d which PCIGC is obligated to pay pursuant to Art. 48A, \u00a7 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The circuit court (Jacobson, J.) rendered a declaratory judgment holding that the assessments are taxes or fees within the meaning of Art. 48A, \u00a7 515, and that PCIGC is, consequently, exempt from paying the assessments. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Comm\u2019n v. Property Ins., </em>74 Md.App. 99, 536 A.2d 714 (1988). Thereafter we granted the Commission\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to decide this important issue of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">This Court long ago defined the statutory term \u201ctaxes\u201d to mean \u201cburdens, charges or impositions, put or set upon persons or property for public uses----\u201d <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Greenmount Cemetery, </em>7 Md. 517, 535 (1855). Later this Court defined \u201ctax\u201d as \u201ca charge imposed upon the taxpayer as an act of sovereignty, without his consent, and for the public use----\u201d <em>Baltimore v. Fine, </em>148 Md. 324, 328, 129 A. 356, 358 (1925), citing <em>Bonaparte v. State, </em>63 Md. 465, 470-471 (1885). <em>See also, e.g., Comptroller v. Russell, </em>284 Md. 174, 178, 395 A.2d 488 (1978) (quoting with approval the definition of a \u201ctax\u201d set forth in the <em>Greenmount Cemetery </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cassessment\u201d in no way indicates that a governmental charge imposed for a public purpose is not a \u201ctax.\u201d As Chief Judge Le Grand observed for the Court in the <em>Greenmount Cemetery </em>case, <em>supra, </em>7 Md. at 535:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">\u201cThe distinction, if any, between a <em>tax </em>and an <em>assessment </em>is not very palpable. The meaning of the words is the same in our laws. When a man is assessed to pay a certain sum, it is equivalent to, and nothing more than, the imposition of a tax on him to that amount. This is the popular understanding of the signification of the terms, as well as that of philologists. Thus, <em>Webster: </em>Tax \u2014 \u2018a rate or sum of money <em>assessed </em>on the person or property of a citizen by government for the use of the nation or State.\u2019 So, also, <em>\u2018an assessment </em>is a valuation made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>authorized persons, according to their discretion, as opposed to a sum certain or determined by law. <em>It may be a direct charge of the tax to be paid.\u2019 </em>In principle, we are unable to discover any difference between the meaning of the words____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Under the above definition, the assessments to fund the SIF and UEF are \u201ctaxes.\u201d They are involuntary charges imposed by the State upon insurers and employers. They are intended to raise revenue for public purposes. As previously discussed, the purpose of the SIF is to limit an employer\u2019s compensation liability to that payable for the subsequent injury occurring while in the employer\u2019s service, thereby encouraging the hiring of handicapped persons. The SIF helps to insure job availability for the handicapped, full compensation for injuries received on the job, and a fair apportionment of liability to the employer. The primary objective of the UEF is to insure that injured employees receive the compensation to which they are entitled. The benefit of the general public is served by both of these funds because the burden of the circumstances they are intended to relieve would otherwise be shouldered in part by the general public. Accordingly, the assessment proceeds which fund the SIF and the UEF constitute government revenue raised by legally required payments to be expended for public purposes. As such, they are \u201ctaxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Moreover, the assessments to fund the SIF and UEF are similar to other assessments which have been viewed as taxes. In <em>Allied American Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>219 Md. 607, 616, 150 A.2d 421, 427 (1959), this Court held that assessments to the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund, which were virtually identical to the assessments in the case at bar, were an exercise of the State\u2019s taxing power. Later, in <em>State Insurance v. Nationwide, </em>241 Md. 108, 116-117, 215 A.2d 749, 754 (1966), the Court held that assessments to the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund were in fact similar in character to both taxes and licenses for purposes of a credit on a retaliatory tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Assessments and contributions to the SIF and UEF are like employer contributions to fund unemployment compensation, and this Court has specifically held the latter to be taxes. In <em>STD. Properties v. Emp. Security Bd., </em>201 Md. 1, 7, 92 A.2d 459, 462 (1952), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">\u201cThe Unemployment Compensation Law, which imposes upon employers the obligation to pay a certain percentage of their pay rolls into the unemployment compensation fund, is an exercise of the taxing power of the State. The contribution demanded of the employer by this statute is an excise tax imposed by the Legislature----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><em>See Compensation Board v. Albrecht, </em>183 Md. 87, 89, 36 A.2d 666, 667 (1944) (the contribution \u201cdemanded from the employer is an excise tax imposed by the Legislature in the exercise of the police power of the State\u201d). <em>See also, e.g., Carmichael v. Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>301 U.S. 495, 57 S.Ct. 868, 81 L.Ed. 1245 (1937); <em>State v. Thayer, </em>118 N.H. 819, 822, 395 A.2d 500, 502 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit recognized that contributions to unemployment compensation are taxes, and the Court specifically likened them to workers\u2019 compensation assessments, which were held to be taxes as well. <em>In re Pan American Paper Mills, Inc., </em>618 F.2d 159, 162 (1st Cir.1980) (concludes that premiums to a governmental fund pursuant to the Puerto Rico Workmen\u2019s Accident Compensation Act should be treated as taxes because, like contributions made pursuant to a state unemployment compensation law, \u201cthey are pecuniary obligations imposed by the government for the purpose of defraying the expenses of an undertaking which it authorized\u201d). <em>See State Industrial Accident Commission v. AEBI, 177 Or. </em>361, 368, 162 P.2d 513, 516 (1945). <em>See also Territory of Alaska v. Alaska Juneau Gold Mining Co., </em>105 F.2d 841, 844 (9th Cir.1939); <em>Audubon Ins. Co. v. Bernard, </em>434 So.2d 1072, 1075 (La.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Turning specifically to the charges here involved, assessments to the SIF have been recognized as being \u201cin the nature of a general tax assessed against members of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>certain group to cover expenses of administering a government program involving that group.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Wicomico County, </em>284 Md. 576, 585, 398 A.2d 1237, 1242 (1979) (dissenting opinion).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In addition, jurisdictions throughout the country have held that assessments like those involved in this case are in fact taxes. <em>American Alliance Insurance Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, </em>134 Cal.App.3d 601, 606, 184 Cal.Rptr. 674, 676, 30 A.L.R.4th 865 (1982) (tax on workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers not special assessment but in the nature of a tax, and therefore may be used in computing retaliatory tax return); <em>Price v. All American Engineering Company, </em>320 A.2d 336, 338 (Del.1974) (points out that insurance carriers and self-insured employers are taxed to support the Industrial Accident Board Second Injury and Contingency Fund); <em>Beth-Elkhorn Corporation v. John McDowell Ross, </em>552 S.W.2d 656, 657 (Ky.1977) (refers to assessments for special claim fund as a tax); <em>Stottlemeyer v. General Motors Corp., </em>399 Mich. 605, 614, 250 N.W.2d 486, 490 (1977) (Silicosis and Dust Disease Fund is supported by a tax on employers); <em>Employer\u2019s Fire Ins. Co. v. Taxation Div. Director, </em>5 N.J.Tax 326 (1983), <em>aff'd, </em>6 N.J.Tax 613 (N.J.Super.1984) (assessments to Second Injury Fund may be taken into account in computing retaliatory tax liability); <em>State Industrial Accident Commission v. AEBI, supra, </em>177 Or. 361, 162 P.2d 513 (contributions under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act are not deprived of their character as taxes); <em>Providence Wash. Ins. v. Comm. Dept. of Revenue, </em>75 Pa.Commw. 463, 471, 463 A.2d 68, 72 (1983), <em>aff'd </em>504 Pa. 506, 475 A.2d 741 (1984) of premiums, paid into special fund, count as tax on retaliatory tax return); <em>State ex rel. Christensen v. Nugget Coal, </em>60 Wyo. 51, 62, 144 P.2d 944, 947 (1944) (employer\u2019s obligation for overdraft in State Industrial Accident Fund, because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>payment awarded injured employee, is not a debt but is a tax).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The Commission\u2019s argument against treating the assessments as taxes within the meaning of Art. 48A, \u00a7 515 is a convoluted one based upon a strained interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 508(a) and 505(c) of Art. 48A.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">First, the Commission begins with the premise, unsupported by any provision of the Code or by any decision of this Court, that the \u201cSIF and UEF assessments are part of the overall workers\u2019 compensation required to be paid by an employer, or if insured, by the employer\u2019s insurer when an employee of the employer is permanently disabled or dies as a result of a job-related injury____ The assessments are part of the benefits provided by the employer\u201d (Commission\u2019s brief, pp. 4-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Second, the Commission points to the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d in the PCIGC subtitle of Art. 48A. That definition, in \u00a7 505(c), includes \u201c \u2018obligations ... of an insolvent insurer which: [a]rise out of the insurance policy contracts of the insolvent insurer issued to residents of this State ... on behalf of insureds of the insolvent insurer.\u2019 \u201d (Commission\u2019s brief, p. 8, quoting Art. 48A, \u00a7 505(c)). According to the Commission, because \u201cpayment of SIF and UEF assessments is part of the coverage afforded an employer when the insurer issues a policy for workers\u2019 compensation insurance,\u201d the \u201cSIF and UEF assessments are part of the covered claims\u201d within the meaning of Art. 48A, \u00a7 505(c). (Commission\u2019s brief, pp. 8-9).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Third, the Commission points to Art. 48A, \u00a7 508(a), which requires the PCIGC to pay \u201cthe covered claims\u201d against the insolvent insurer. Because of its argument that the assessments are \u201ccovered claims\u201d within the definition of \u00a7 505(c), the Commission concludes that \u00a7 508(a) requires the PCIGC to pay the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Fourth, the Commission contends that, because \u00a7 508(a) requires the PCIGC to pay the assessments, a construction of Art. 48A, \u00a7 515, which views the assessments as fees or taxes within the meaning of the exemption, would create a conflict between \u00a7 515 and \u00a7 508(a). This, in turn, would violate the principle of statutory construction that statutes should be construed \u201c \u2018so as to harmonize with each other\u2019 \u201d (Commission\u2019s brief, p. 9, quoting from <em>Baltimore Transit v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 19, 174 A.2d 768 (1961)). Thus, the Commission concludes that \u00a7 515 should be construed as not including the assessments as fees or taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">There are several flaws in the Commission\u2019s reasoning. Initially, the rule of statutory construction invoked by the Commission does not justify an unreasonable interpretation of one statute in order to create a conflict with a second statute, and then \u201charmonizing\u201d the two enactments by ignoring the clear meaning of the second statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Moreover, the premise underlying the Commission\u2019s construction of Art. 48A, \u00a7 505(c), is erroneous. It is clear that the assessments are not part of the workers\u2019 compensation awards. Rather, the statutory provisions specifically distinguish the assessments from the awards. Art. 101, \u00a7 66(2)(c), states that the SIF assessments \u201cshall be in addition to any payment of compensation to employees who are injured or sustain an occupational disease____\u201d Art. 101, \u00a7 91(d)(3)(iii), similarly provides that the UEF assessments \u201cshall be in addition to any payment of compensation to employees or to their dependents pursuant to the provisions of this article.\u201d The assessments are separate payments to the State, maintained by the State Treasurer. They are simply not part of the \u201coverall workers\u2019 compensation,\u201d as asserted by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Furthermore, the assessments do not \u201carise out of the insurance policy contracts of the insolvent insurer,\u201d and thus are not within the definition of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d in Art. 48A, \u00a7 505(c). Instead, the assessments, like other taxes, are obligations arising wholly from statutes. As stated by Judge Pollitt for the Court of Special Appeals in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>this case, the assessments \u201care not obligations arising out of the contract with the insurer. They are obligations assessed by the Legislature as a condition of doing business in this State.\u201d 74 Md.App. at 106, 536 A.2d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Consequently, the assessments are not \u201ccovered claims\u201d for purposes of PCIGC\u2019s obligation under Art. 48A, \u00a7 508(a). There is simply no conflict between \u00a7 508(a) and \u00a7 515. The assessments are taxes, and plainly fall within the exemption in Art. 48A, \u00a7 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">.
