ORTH, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AOh\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">Judge Clifton T. Gordy, presiding in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, received a call from the Criminal Assignment Clerk that a court trial was being transferred to his court. The criminal cause transferred was <em>State v. James C. Stewart </em>in which Stewart was charged with a sexual offense in the third degree and related crimes. When the case was called for trial, the prosecutor said that it was his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>understanding that the trial would be by the court. Defense counsel observed, \u201cMr. Stewart prayed a jury trial before Judge [Elsbeth] Bothe sent the case here.\u201d Judge Gordy asked whether Stewart needed \u201cto be formally arraigned at this time?\u201d Defense counsel noted that Stewart had already been arraigned. Defense counsel said that the plea would be not guilty, and, with no expression of disapproval by Stewart, that Stewart had elected a court trial. The only pretrial motion was by the State for the sequestration of witnesses which was granted (the defense withdrew all of its motions). Both the prosecutor and defense counsel waived opening statements. The trial proceeded routinely to verdict (guilty of a sexual offense in the third degree) and the imposition of punishment (imprisonment for a term of one year).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">At the close of all the evidence, the court indicated that the trial would be continued to resume on the following day. Defense counsel raised the question of bail. She informed the judge that Judge Bothe had revoked bail and requested that Stewart \u201cgo back on the bail status that he was on.\u201d Judge Gordy said he did not know why Judge Bothe revoked bail and suggested that defense counsel discuss it with her. Defense counsel said, \u201cMy understanding was it was revoked during his trial.\u201d Judge Gordy ruled that \u201c[Stewart\u2019s] bail status will remain unchanged until I can dispose of this matter tomorrow one way or the other on the merits.\u201d The judge declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">I am not getting into how he got his bail revoked, but one way or the other, it won\u2019t matter tomorrow. He\u2019ll either be free or we\u2019ll proceed to disposition. So he will remain in custody of the sheriffs at the present time in the Baltimore City Jail until tomorrow morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Stewart then personally requested that he be released on bail. The judge denied the request. Nothing more was said.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">When trial resumed the next morning, defense counsel\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied. Arguments were heard and considered. The judge rendered the verdict. Stewart was allowed allocution through his counsel and his mother. Stewart said that he did not wish to be heard. The State recommended a period of incarceration for \u201cfive years suspend all but one year and five years supervised probation upon release from the Department of Correction.\u201d The court imposed sentence and explained to Stewart his post-trial rights. Defense counsel asked the judge to \u201cset an appeal bond.\u201d The judge inquired, \u201cWhat would be the ground for the appeal?\u201d It was then, for the first time, that Judge Gordy learned why the case had been transferred from Judge Bothe\u2019s court and of the conditions imposed by her on the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The case was originally set for trial before Judge Bothe. Stewart did not appear. The judge held the case over until the next afternoon. Although informed of the new trial time by his counsel, Stewart again failed to appear. The judge revoked bail and issued a bench warrant. On the following Monday, three days later, Stewart telephoned and was informed by his counsel and by the judge\u2019s law clerk that he was obliged to appear for trial that day. Once again, he failed to appear. His appearance was finally obtained two days later through his bailbondsman. Whereupon the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">THE COURT: In any event, the warrant was finally served this morning on Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Stewart is here in custody after the Court has waited through three court days ready to proceed with this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">Now, Hicks runs on Friday.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It\u2019s my understanding, Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">THE COURT: What are we going to do? I mean, I\u2019m ready to try the case, if need be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We\u2019re ready to try the case. It\u2019s an open\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to send the current case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m asking the Court to recuse itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not recusing myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Because the Court has made comments while we\u2019ve been waiting to get Mr. Stewart in here, indicating that the Court has made up her mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">THE COURT: I haven\u2019t made up my mind about anything other than getting Mr. Stewart here\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, you just selected another jury in another trial\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">THE COURT: I have been waiting here in this court for three days to resolve this case, and it\u2019s going to be resolved in my court. He\u2019s not going to come into the court today, as he has, and say I don\u2019t want Judge Bothe because she\u2019s unfair to make me come to her court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Not that you\u2019re saying he\u2019s unfair for coming to court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-15\">THE COURT: If you wish to ask me to recuse myself\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-17\">THE COURT: I\u2019ve heard your Motion. I deny it. Shortly thereafter, the matter of the revocation of bail was discussed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-18\">THE COURT: The warrant\u2019s been served on him, and I see no reason not to guarantee his presence for the trial, which I\u2019ve had so much difficulty accomplishing, by keeping him detained until the matter is resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, I have no problems making it to my trial dates. I know my prior ones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC0\">THE COURT: Friday, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, even though you had contacted him and told him to be here. But now it\u2019s Wednesday. It so happened that a great deal of court time has been wasted because my court was totally clear on earlier dates this week, as you\u2019re aware, and both of you have been in constant touch with me trying to find out where Mr. Stewart was. The waste of resources that\u2019s resulted from his failure to appear is one that I\u2019m not going to see duplicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But I don\u2019t want that problem bleeding over into my trial, Judge. That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid is going to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">THE COURT: You mean if he doesn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If it\u2019s tried here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad8\">THE COURT: It\u2019s nothing to do with me, personally. Whatever court he goes to, he\u2019s going to have to be available. And he didn\u2019t know which court it was going to be assigned to, neither did I. He wants a jury trial, I assume. If he wants a court trial, I\u2019ll recuse myself. I do feel that I would be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If I can have a moment, Judge. Have a seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">THE COURT: You want to discuss that with him now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">THE COURT: You want a few minutes to do it? But he\u2019s continued in custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">After a brief recess, defense counsel addressed the judge: Your Honor, after discussing the options with my client, it\u2019s my understanding Mr. Stewart\u2019s going to be waiving a jury trial, requesting a court trial and requesting this Court to recuse itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">Defense counsel then told Stewart in open court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-15\">Mr. Stewart, you have to make the waiver on the record. You have a right to be tried by a jury of your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>peers, which would be twelve people you would help to select. All twelve people would have to agree that you are guilty. If one person said they weren\u2019t sure you were guilty, it would be hung jury and we would start over again. Or you could have a court trial, a trial before the court. In a trial before the court, a judge would sit alone, would listen to all the testimony and evidence, and the judge would decide whether or not you were guilty or innocent of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">She asked Stewart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">Do you wish to waive a jury trial and request a court trial, sir?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Stewart replied that he did. Defense counsel repeated her request that the judge recuse herself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">THE COURT: I have said in a court trial, under the circumstances, I would recuse myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">I understand that Judge Gordy is available for a court trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">I want it understood, very clearly, two things: One is that there must be a court trial. He\u2019s waived his right to a jury trial. If it\u2019s a jury trial, my recusal does not stand. Is that understood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">THE COURT: Secondly, the bail has been revoked and remains revoked. Of course you can appeal to any other judge. I assume if you want to bring the matter to Judge Gordy, you may. But at this time, the Defendant is in custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">Thirdly, it was my understanding, when this case was sent to me from the move list before I knew anything about it at all, that the Defendant had rejected an offer of probation, five and five I believe I was told. Is that correct?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That was back in September, I believe, Judge. In August.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-15\">THE COURT: Whenever it was, it was before another judge and another court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">THE COURT: That offer was rejected and the Defendant then indicated his desire to be tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">THE COURT: The offer is not on the table as far as this court was concerned. When I was advised about the nature of the offense in this case, I indicated that I was not amenable to probation. And there has never been any intention, on the part of this Judge, to impose a probationary sentence to this Defendant. I want it made clear to Judge Gordy that it was not this Court\u2019s \u2014 this Court has not accepted any plea negotiation. And I very definitely have and would have rejected any probationary offer in this case, and I want that clear, [Prosecutor].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll make it clear to Judge Gordy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Your Honor. Thereupon, the case was sent to Judge Gordy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">When Judge Gordy asked defense counsel what ground there was for appeal, she recounted at length, and not without acrimony, what had occurred before Judge Bothe. She made perfectly clear that her objection to Judge Bothe\u2019s conduct was not a foofaraw, but was founded on a denial of Stewart\u2019s constitutional rights to a trial by jury, due process of law, and the effective assistance of counsel. Throughout her discourse, Judge Gordy declared that he did not \u201cknow anything about that.\u201d He asked, \u201cWhy was that issue not raised before me when you arrived here?\u201d Defense counsel replied, \u201cBecause Judge Bothe said if any jury trial was granted, it had to come back to her courtroom.\u201d She assured the judge that this was on the record of the proceedings before Judge Bothe. Judge Gordy called for a bench conference on the record. At the conference, Judge Gordy asked defense counsel what she was talking about. She told him in detail. Judge Gordy said, \u201c[L]et the record reflect that at no time did you ever request this court to be allowed to elect a jury trial [in] this case.\u201d Defense counsel acknowledged that this was correct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Judge Gordy emphasized, \u201cYou never requested to change your election of this court.\u201d Defense counsel replied, \u201cNot in here.\u201d At this point the prosecutor interjected to give the court the history of the case. His summary of the proceedings before Judge Bothe was true to the record and in full accord with the version of defense counsel. Judge Gordy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">Let me say this. When the case arrived here, I\u2019m the presiding judge____ [I]t is within my discretion as to whether to allow the defendant to change his election of court trial or jury trial. I was never advised that this was anything other than a court trial, and I was not familiar with the history of the case as to how it arrived here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Defense counsel attempted to justify her failure to inform the judge, \u201c[W]hen we came to chambers, you said you didn\u2019t want to discuss anything.\u201d The judge pointed out that he was referring only to plea negotiations, and the prosecutor agreed that was correct. Defense counsel said that she misunderstood. She confessed, \u201cAll I can say is grant an appeal bail for post-conviction because I made a huge boo-boo then.\u201d The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">I am only letting the record reflect as to how the case came to me, and that I don\u2019t know what I would have done if you asked to change your election, as it was my case at that point, but I never had to reach that issue, because I was never asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">He noted later that the case came to him in a strange posture. The prosecutor agreed. He acknowledged that he did not dispute the circumstances, as related, of the transfer of the case. Defense counsel stated her desire \u201cto put one thing on the record\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">Mr. Stewart always insisted he wanted a jury trial, because at one point the case was worked out for probation, and he backed out of the plea on the last question, because he said he couldn\u2019t plead guilty to something he didn\u2019t do, and he wanted a jury to decide it. The only reason we waived the jury trial was because Judge Bothe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>was, I don\u2019t know how else to word it, out of control. I have never had a judge yelling about a case as much as she was. She did have a right to be angry at him for being late, but it was going to bleed all over my case if I had tried it in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">I never had a judge that had a jury sitting in the jury room with the attorneys ready to go, but shipped that case out just so he could hang onto another case. The only way I could get my case out of there and try to attempt to get Stewart a fair trial was to give up the jury trial right. I was told if the right was then granted again, I had to go back to the very place I thought I couldn\u2019t get a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The judgment entered against Stewart was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals on direct appeal. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>No. 1700, September Term, 1988, filed 22 June 1988, unreported. We granted Stewart\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and ordered that the case be certified to us. The questions presented in the petition revolve around the effectiveness of Stewart\u2019s waiver of his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The right of a person to a trial by jury is constitutionally guaranteed. Constitution of the United States, Amendment VI, applicable to state prosecutions under <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 149, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1447, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968); Maryland Declaration of Rights, Articles 21 and 24. The right may be voluntarily waived, that is, intentionally relinquished, <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), by a knowing, intelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences, <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1469, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). <em>See </em>Md.Rule 4-246; <em>Martinez v. State, </em>309 Md. 124, 133-134, 522 A.2d 950 (1987). \u201cWhether there is an intelligent waiver must depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Martinez </em>at 134, 522 A.2d 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>This appeal turns on the voluntariness of the waiver of Stewart\u2019s right to a jury trial. The peculiar facts and circumstances of this particular case, as set out in the record before us, are not sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the waiver was involuntary. Stewart\u2019s lawyer did not divulge to Judge Gordy before the commencement of the trial the comments of Judge Bothe and the dictates and conditions imposed by her on the transfer of the case. Judge Gordy correctly recognized that it was entirely within his discretion as the presiding judge to allow Stewart to elect a jury trial rather than a court trial and that he was not bound by the dictates and conditions imposed by Judge Bothe on the transfer of the case. We made clear in <em>Hunt v. State, </em>312 Md. 494, 500, 540 A.2d 1125 (1988), that \u201c[t]he conduct of criminal trials falls within the sound discretion of the trial judge which will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d We said in <em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 449, 470 A.2d 1269 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">As a general principle, one judge of a trial court ruling on a matter is not bound by the prior ruling in the same case by another judge of the court; the second judge, in his discretion, may ordinarily consider the matter de novo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGo\">In <em>Washburne v. Hoffman, Etc., </em>242 Md. 519, 525, 219 A.2d 826 (1966), we declared, in effect, that no trial judge is required to abdicate his own individual judgment merely because a colleague of coordinate jurisdiction has made a ruling. We are unable to conclude, on the record here, considering all the unusual facts and circumstances, that Stewart\u2019s constitutional rights to a jury trial were violated. By the same token we are unable to conclude that his constitutional guarantees of due process of law were offended. <em>See </em>Constitution of the United States, Amendment XIV; Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 24. Our holdings are without prejudice to the right of Stewart to raise these jury trial and due process issues under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 645A-645J.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>It would have been far better for all concerned had defense counsel laid all her cards on the table before Judge Gordy when the case was called for trial. Another question is whether her failure to do so denied Stewart the effective assistance of counsel to which he was entitled under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. We have consistently held that the desirable procedure for determining claims of inadequate assistance of counsel, when the issue was not presented to the trial court, is by way of the Post Conviction Procedure Act. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>295 Md. 329, 337-338, 455 A.2d 979 (1983); <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>261 Md. 11, 23-25, 273 A.2d 156 (1971). We adhere to that view. The way is also open for Stewart to pursue the matter of his counsel\u2019s effective assistance by way of post conviction procedures if he desires to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\">.
