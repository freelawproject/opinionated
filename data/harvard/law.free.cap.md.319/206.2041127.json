He appealed from the judgment entered on the conviction. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Dykes v. State, </em>No. 1716, September Term, 1988, filed 7 July 1989, unreported. We granted a petition for certiorari submitted by his attorney, an assistant public defender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\n<em>Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Homicide is the killing of a human being by a human being. It is culpable when it is felonious, and it is felonious when it is not justifiable or excusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\"><em>State v. Ward, </em>284 Md. 189, 194, 396 A.2d 1041 (1978). In order for the trier of fact to convict an accused of a crime, the evidence must be legally sufficient to prove the corpus delicti of the crime charged and the criminal agency of the accused. In other words, the evidence must establish, under the reasonable doubt test, that the crime was committed and that the accused committed it. Dykes went to trial on a criminal information which charged that he \u201cdid feloniously, wilfully, deliberately and maliciously kill and murder Dwight Lee Landon.\u201d Under this charge, the jury could have acquitted Dykes or could have convicted him of</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">1) murder in the first degree; or</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">2) murder in the second degree; or</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">3) manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 200-201, 396 A.2d 1041. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>In the petition we granted, Dykes does not dispute that the manner of Landon\u2019s death was homicide and that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor does he claim that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant a conviction of murder in the second degree. And he does not deny that he was the person who inflicted the wounds resulting in Landon\u2019s death. But he contends that the judgment must be reversed because the jury was not made aware, even if it found that he committed the homicide, that he would not be culpable at all if it found he killed Landon in perfect self-defense, and that he would be culpable only for the crime of manslaughter if the jury found that the killing was committed in imperfect self-defense. In the former event, he suggests the verdict would properly be not guilty; in the latter event, the verdict would properly be guilty of manslaughter, not murder. The contention arises from the refusal of the trial judge to grant Dykes\u2019s request that the jury be instructed as to perfect self-defense and imperfect self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\n<em>Self-Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Dykes\u2019s view of the doctrines of perfect self-defense and imperfect self-defense is not adverse to the letter of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>Perfect Self-Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Homicide committed in <em>perfect self-defense </em>is either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>justifiable or excusable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the defense is established, the killer is not culpable.

In <em>Faulkner, </em>Judge Cole, writing for the Court, set out the requirements for a person to be found not culpable when acting in perfect self-defense in committing a homicide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">(1) The accused must have had reasonable grounds to believe himself in apparent imminent or immediate danger of death or serious bodily harm from his assailant or potential assailant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">(2) The accused must have in fact believed himself in this danger;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">(3) The accused claiming the right of self-defense must not have been the aggressor or provoked the conflict; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">(4) The force used must have not been unreasonable and excessive, that is, the force must not have been more force than the exigency demanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 485-486, 483 A.2d 759. <em>See </em>cases cited therein at 486, 483 A.2d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">\n<em>Imperfect Self-Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">The Court of Special Appeals discussed <em>imperfect self-defense </em>in <em>Faulkner v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 113, 114-115, 458 A.2d 81 (1983), <em>aff'd, State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 483 A.2d 759 (1984). The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">From the turbulent waters of the criminal law of Maryland, roiled by the dictates of <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881 [44 L.Ed.2d 508] (1975), emerged an esoteric qualification to the doctrine of self-defense, known as the \u201cimperfect right of self-defense.\u201d We noticed it in <em>Evans v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 640, 658, n. 4, 349 A.2d 300 (1975), <em>aff'd, State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 362 A.2d 629 (1976), recognized it in <em>Shuck v.

State, </em>29 Md.App. 110, 120-121, 349 A.2d 421 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 735 (1976), and applied it in <em>Law v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 457, 463-465, 349 A.2d 295 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 726 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In its <em>Faulkner, </em>the intermediate appellate court confirmed its adoption of the doctrine and again applied it, but noted that \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals has not yet addressed the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 458 A.2d 81. We \u201caddressed the matter\u201d on our review of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 <em>Faulkner </em>by way of certiorari. We first noted that \u201c[i]mperfect self-defense, by contrast [with perfect self-defense], is not a complete defense.\u201d 301 Md. at 486, 483 A.2d 759. We explained that \u201c[i]ts chief characteristic is that it operates to negate malice, an element the State must prove to establish murder.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">As a result, the successful invocation of this doctrine does not completely exonerate the defendant, but mitigates murder to voluntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>Id. </em>We recognized that \u201c[i]mperfect self-defense ... is different from either [perfect] self-defense or the commonly recognized mitigation defenses [such as heat of passion which provokes a homicide].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We traced the history and development of the imperfect self-defense doctrine and explored the various views with respect to the standard for applying it. <em>Id. </em>at 486-499, 483 A.2d 759. We settled on \u201cthe honest but unreasonable belief standard of imperfect self-defense\u201d as \u201cthe proper one to be followed in Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499-500, 483 A.2d 759. We quoted with approval, <em>id. </em>at 500, 483 A.2d 759, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 <em>Faulkner, </em>54 Md.App. at 115, 458 A.2d 81, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>articulating the ingredients of the defense under that standard as distinguished from perfect self-defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cPerfect self-defense requires not only that the killer subjectively believed that his actions were necessary for his safety but, objectively, that a reasonable man would so consider them. Imperfect self-defense, however, requires no more than a subjective honest belief on the part of the killer that his actions were necessary for his safety, even though, on an objective appraisal by a reasonable man, they would not be found to be so. If established, the killer remains culpable and his actions are excused only to the extent that mitigation is invoked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHn\">We agreed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">this statement represents an analytically sound view, and reflects the position taken by a majority of those jurisdictions that have addressed and embraced this defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYd\"><em>Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 500, 483 A.2d 759. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzR\">Logically, a defendant who commits a homicide while honestly, though unreasonably, believing that he is threatened with death or serious bodily harm, does not act with malice. Absent malice he cannot be convicted of murder. Nevertheless, because the killing was committed without justification or excuse, the defendant is not entitled to full exoneration. Therefore, as we see it, when evidence is presented showing the defendant\u2019s subjective belief that the use of force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm, the defendant is entitled to a proper instruction on imperfect self-defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). It follows, we pointed out, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9a\">if the jury concluded that the defendant honestly believed that the use of force was necessary but that this subjective belief was unreasonable under the circumstances, then its verdict would be guilty of voluntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 501, 483 A.2d 759. This is so, we declared, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahx\">the conduct of the defendant in these circumstances negates the presence of malice, a prerequisite to a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of murder, but the defendant is nevertheless to blame for the homicide and should not be rewarded for his unreasonable conduct.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>Id. </em>We also agreed with the observation of the Court of Special Appeals, 54 Md.App. at 118 n. 5, 458 A.2d 81:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAc\">It is difficult to envision circumstances which are sufficient to generate the issue of justification or excuse by way of perfect self-defense which do not also generate the issue of mitigation by way of imperfect self-defense. Generally, if a defendant is entitled to an instruction with respect to the former, he will be entitled to an instruction with respect to the latter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">301 Md. at 502, 483 A.2d 759. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A82\">It is hard to imagine a situation where a defendant would be able to produce sufficient evidence to generate a jury issue as to perfect self-defense but not as to imperfect self-defense. It seems clear to us that if the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s belief is at issue, as it is in self-defense, <em>a fortiori, </em>the existence of that belief is also at issue. Therefore, the jury must reject the reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s belief as well as the existence of that belief to find the defendant guilty of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 502-503, 483 A.2d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">It is clear from our <em>Faulkner </em>that \u201cwhen evidence is presented showing the defendant\u2019s subjective belief that the use of force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm, the defendant is entitled to a proper instruction on imperfect self-defense.\u201d 301 Md. at 500, 483 A.2d 759 (footnote omitted), quoted in <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 39, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988). For entitlement to the instruction with respect to both perfect self-defense and imperfect self-defense,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">the defendant has the \u201cburden of initially producing \u2018some evidence\u2019 on the issue of mitigation or self-defense ... sufficient to give rise to a jury issue____ Once the issue has been generated by the evidence, however, the State must carry the ultimate burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt on that issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-10\"><em>Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 39-40, 542 A.2d 1258, quoting <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. at 207-208. <em>See Cunningham v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 249, 257, 473 A.2d 40, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 316, 477 A.2d 1195 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\"><em>The \u201cSome </em>Evidence\u201d <em>Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbeI\">Prior to <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, we believed, and so held, that \u201cthe burden is upon [the defendant] to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted in self-defense.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 559, 276 A.2d 214 (1971). We learned from <em>Mullaney </em>that we were wrong. The holding in <em>Mullaney, </em>decided in the light of <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), reached a jury instruction given in a homicide case. It taught us that an instruction which cast upon the defendant in a homicide case the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence, when the issue of self-defense was raised by the evidence, was consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tutionally defective since it shifted the burden to the defendant to prove justification or excuse for the homicide. <em>State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. at 207, 362 A.2d 629. We discovered through <em>Mullaney </em>and <em>Winship </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5C\">due process of law is offended by placing the burden on the defendant to prove, <em>by any standard, </em>the existence of mitigating circumstances necessary to lower a felonious homicide to the level of manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 206, 362 A.2d 629 (emphasis added). Therefore, we declared, \u201cAll Maryland homicide cases involving the defense of mitigation which contain contrary holdings are no longer valid precedents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We were careful to point out, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">the burden of initially producing \u201csome evidence\u201d on the issue of mitigation or self-defense (or of relying upon evidence produced by the State) sufficient to give rise to a jury issue with respect to those defenses, is properly cast upon the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 208, 362 A.2d 629. It is only when \u201csome evidence\u201d has been adduced which is looked to by the defendant on the issue of self-defense or other mitigation, that the State \u201cmust carry the ultimate burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt on that issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">In <em>Evans </em>we were talking in terms of <em>perfect </em>self-defense, although not by that nomenclature. We did not characterize self-defense as \u201cperfect\u201d or \u201cimperfect\u201d because we had not then adopted the concept of <em>imperfect </em>self-defense. It was after our <em>Evans </em>that <em>imperfect </em>self-defense surfaced in this Court and was accepted by us as a mitigating defense in the criminal law of Maryland. But our holdings in <em>Evans </em>also spoke to mitigating defenses other than perfect self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 208-209, 362 A.2d 629. Imperfect self-defense is another mitigating defense and, thus, is clearly within the ambit of the <em>Evans </em>teachings. <em>Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 486, 483 A.2d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\"><em>Some evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It calls for no more than what it says\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u201csome,\u201d as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The source of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant. It is of no matter that the self-defense claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim that he acted in self-defense, the defendant has met his burden. Then the baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the defendant did not kill in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>The Evidence Adduced</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">There were no eyewitnesses to the homicide. It took place in a bedroom of a mobile home trailer in which Landon resided. The trailer was in a trailer park in Princess Anne, Somerset County, Maryland. A Maryland State Trooper described the outside of the trailer and the floor plan. At the suggestion of the prosecutor, he drew, for the edification of the jury, a diagram of the exterior and interior of the trailer, showing the two doors providing ingress and egress to the trailer and the location of five rooms off a hallway which ran the length of the trailer. Landon\u2019s body was found in the master bedroom at the rear of the trailer, on the floor beside the bed. The jury was shown a color photograph depicting the body in the position and the condition in which it was found. The photograph also showed a part of the bedroom floor, cluttered ankle deep with discarded clothing, bags, shoes, coat hangers, and other articles between the door to the bedroom and the body. The Post Mortem Examination Report, to which were appended nine photographs of Landon\u2019s nude body showing the wounds in close-up, was received in evidence. The Trooper testified as to the events leading to the finding of the body, how the investigation became focused on Dykes, and the circumstances of Dykes\u2019s arrest and interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The details of the commission of the homicide came from Dykes. The interrogation of him by the police was over a period of almost two hours, with a break for dinner. Without prodding, Dykes readily gave a statement which, when transcribed, covered nine and one-half pages. The statement was read verbatim to the jury. Dykes also testified at the trial. The result was that the jury had before it three versions of the events leading to the homicide and of the circumstances of the killing itself, all from the mouth of Dykes. We set out a compendium of each version.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In the first version Dykes averred that Landon, who was not known to him previously, abducted him at gunpoint outside a bar and drove him to Landon\u2019s house trailer. By the time they arrived, Dykes believed, from Landon\u2019s remarks en route, that Landon was a homosexual. Landon forced him into the trailer, pressing the gun to his neck and telling him they would get \u201csome action.\u201d Dykes stalled by asking to use the bathroom. Dykes found a \u201cbutter knife\u201d in the bathroom, which he picked up. He did not leave the trailer because he feared Landon would shoot him. Landon was in the master bedroom. He was sitting on the bed, naked from the waist down and masturbating. Landon saw the knife in Dykes\u2019s hand and grabbed a steak knife, which was on a table by the bed. Dykes punched Landon in the face; Landon punched him back. Dykes hit him again, and. Landon fell. Dykes then stabbed Landon a \u201ccouple times\u201d with the butter knife, which broke off inside Landon. Landon was still \u201cmoving and trying to get\u201d Dykes; he \u201ckept coming at [him].\u201d Landon stabbed Dykes in the hand. Dykes hit Landon in the face again whereupon Landon\u2019s grip on the steak knife relaxed. Dykes took the steak knife and stabbed Landon \u201ca couple times.\u201d Dykes left the room. Dykes told the police that he hated \u201cqueers\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s sick, immoral. I don\u2019t think God put us on this earth to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In the second version, offered after the dinner break, Dykes recanted the abduction scenario. Dykes denied that Landon threatened him with a gun. Dykes said that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>went with Landon because Landon offered to give him some cocaine. Dykes did not think that Landon was a homosexual en route to Landon\u2019s trailer. When they arrived, Landon went down the hallway of the trailer to get the cocaine. Dykes asked to use the bathroom where he found a knife and put it in his pocket, \u201cjust in case I might need it____\u201d He entered the back bedroom where he found Landon masturbating. Landon reached for a knife on a bedside table, and Dykes \u201crushed him.\u201d Dykes was not sure \u201cwho got who first.\u201d They struggled, each hitting the other. Landon was \u201cclawing\u201d Dykes. He was \u201ccoming at [Dykes] and [Dykes] poked him a couple times with the butter knife.\u201d Even after the butter knife broke, Landon \u201cstill kept coming at [Dykes].\u201d Dykes hit him in the face, and Landon\u2019s \u201chand opened up,\u201d so Dykes \u201cgrabbed [Landon\u2019s] knife\u201d and \u201cgot him with [it]....\u201d Landon fell back. Dykes left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The third version, as presented by Dykes in his testimony at trial, was substantially similar to the second version to the point when Dykes left the bathroom and stopped by the master bedroom where he found Landon sitting on the side of the bed masturbating. From there on, Dykes\u2019s telling of the events diverged somewhat from the second version and expanded on it in significant part. Dykes claimed that when he stood in the doorway of the bedroom, Landon made a lewd proposition. Dykes rushed the five or six feet across the cluttered floor to the bed to hit Landon with his fist because he was afraid Landon would try to hurt him or have sex with him. He said that he \u201cpossibly\u201d could have escaped at that time but that \u201c[i]t was so quick. I did not think about it. I didn\u2019t have time.\u201d After Dykes hit him, Landon reached behind him, grabbed a steak knife, and cut Dykes on the hand. As Dykes was looking at his bleeding hand, Landon threw him on the bed and got on top of Dykes\u2019s chest, pinning one arm to his side. Landon hollered that he was going to kill Dykes and \u201ccame down\u201d with both his hands on the knife, \u201cyelling and slamming at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>[him].\u201d Dykes wrapped his legs around Landon\u2019s neck and pulled him down on the bed. Landon dropped the steak knife. Dykes took the butter knife he found in the bathroom out of his pocket and \u201cstabbed [Landon] a few times on the bed.\u201d The butter knife broke. Dykes claimed that all the while Landon was \u201cchoking\u201d him, that Landon \u201cthrew [him] against the wall and was choking [him] there.\u201d Dykes maintained that \u201c[t]he whole time this incident was happening [Landon] was choking and hitting me.\u201d When Dykes picked up the steak knife, he \u201cstuck [Landon] a few more times and [Landon] fell down.\u201d Dykes maintained that he could not \u201cget away\u201d from Landon after Landon dropped the steak knife because Landon was \u201changing on [to Dykes\u2019s] throat [with] his hands.\u201d Dykes avowed that he was unaware of the rear door in the trailer which led off the hallway near the master bedroom. He further asserted that he lied in his first version about the circumstances under which he went to the trailer because he did not want the police or his mother to know that he used cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\n<em>Authority of the Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding____ The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\"><em>See Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 179, 486 A.2d 196 (1985), quoting with approval <em>Bruce v. State, </em>218 Md. 87, 97, 145 A.2d 428 (1958) (\u201cit is incumbent upon the court, ... when requested in a criminal case, to give an ... instruction on every essential question or point of law supported by evidence\u201d); <em>Blackwell v. State, </em>278 Md. 466, 477, 365 A.2d 545 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 918, 97 S.Ct. 2183, 53 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977) (where there is no evidence supporting an instruction, it need not be given).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>It is clear from the record that requests were made to instruct the jury on the doctrine of self-defense, both perfect and imperfect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And defense counsel made timely objection to the refusal of the judge to grant his requests. Md.Rule 4-325(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The threshold determination whether the evidence was sufficient to generate the doctrine of self-defense was a question of law for the judge. We believe that the judge erred as a matter of law in refusing to grant Dykes\u2019s requests for the instructions. He recognized that the burden was on Dykes to generate the issue of perfect and imperfect self-defense. But we think that he mistook the nature of that burden. He did not find that the law of self-defense was inapplicable because the evidence, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Dykes, did not mount up to \u201csome\u201d evidence, which would tend to show that the homicide was within the ambit of self-defense. Rather, he justified his refusal on findings of fact. He recounted the evidence in detail and found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">1) The evidence was not sufficient to show that Landon was the aggressor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">2) Dykes had the opportunity to retreat and did not do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">3) Dykes raised a fist fight to a deadly level; he took the fight beyond a mere skirmish between two individuals to the deadly weapon stage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>4) Dykes was in no danger at all of serious bodily harm after Landon had dropped his knife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">I don\u2019t think the question of self-defense or an imperfect self-defense has been generated by the evidence. About all the evidence has got to say about that is [Dykes] was lured to [Landon\u2019s] home and he was lied to. He went willingly to engage in an illegal activity, and he found out after he got there he had been lied to and he wasn\u2019t going to be able to engage in that illegal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">Certainly that is not sufficient provocation to kill a man, to stab a man. He had a chance to leave, and he didn\u2019t. Instead of leaving he did the opposite. He advanced towards the man. He had armed himself before he did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">So I don\u2019t believe that the question of self-defense or partial self-defense has been generated by the evidence, and I am not going to give an instruction on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">In short, the judge resolved conflicts in the evidence, choosing which parts of Dykes\u2019s statement and testimony to believe, weighed the evidence and made findings of fact. On this culling of the evidence, he found that the elements necessary to establish perfect self-defense had not been established and that the incidents of imperfect self-defense had not been met. This went far beyond his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">It is now firmly established, as we have seen, that there is a legal basis in the administration of criminal justice in this State for an instruction on imperfect self-defense as well as on perfect self-defense. And we think that Dykes met the burden we have imposed on a defendant to establish a factual basis for the instructions. When the evidence before the jury here is winnowed so as to leave that which is most favorable to Dykes, it takes no more than a casual scanning to disclose that it is not bereft of \u201csome\u201d evidence which, if believed by the jury, would be sufficient for it to find that the elements of perfect self-defense or the incidents of imperfect self-defense were fulfilled. For example, there was \u201csome\u201d evidence, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>though it may be difficult to accept, which was sufficient to create a jury issue whether, in fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVz\">1) Landon was the initial aggressor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">2) Dykes was in imminent fear of being sexually assaulted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">3) if Landon was not the initial aggressor, he became the aggressor by escalating a non-deadly affray to a deadly level;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">4) a safe retreat was not reasonably possible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">5) the force used by Dykes was not excessive in the circumstances, especially in light of evidence tending to show that Landon was persistently choking Dykes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">6) Dykes had a subjectively honest and objectively reasonable belief that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">If the jury so found, it could have concluded, guided by proper instruction and looking to the totality of the circumstances, that the doctrine of perfect self-defense applied. If the jury found the first five of those factors but determined that Dykes had a subjectively honest but objectively unreasonable belief that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, it could have concluded that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense applied. <em>See Perry v. State, </em>234 Md. 48, 52, 197 A.2d 833 (1964); <em>Crawford v. State, </em>231 Md. 354, 361, 190 A.2d 538 (1963); <em>Bennett v. State, </em>230 Md. 562, 567, 188 A.2d 142 (1963); <em>Gunther v. State, </em>228 Md. 404, 409, 179 A.2d 880 (1962) (all to the effect that a person not seeking a fight but fearing an attack may arm himself in anticipation of the attack); <em>Watkins v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 136, 139, 555 A.2d 1087 (1989) (defendant may claim self-defense, even as initial aggressor, if victim escalated altercation to deadly level); <em>Lambert v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 83, 93, 519 A.2d 1340, <em>cert. denied, </em>309 Md. 605, 525 A.2d 1075 (1987) (while general self-defense rule precludes use of deadly weapon against unarmed assailant, account must be taken, among other things, of respective size of defendant and assailant and violent na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ture of unarmed attack);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Tipton v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 556, 562, 232 A.2d 289 (1967) (where defender uses deadly force against nondeadly attacker, original attacker becomes defender).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Of course, what evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury, not the judge, to determine. <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 210, 214, 522 A.2d 1338 (1987); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 566, 276 A.2d 214 (1971); <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>238 Md. 648, 650, 210 A.2d 722 (1965).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the trial judge resolves conflicts in the evidence, in the face of the \u201csome\u201d evidence requirement, and refuses to instruct because he believes that the evidence supporting the request is incredible or too weak or overwhelmed by other evidence, he improperly assumes the jury\u2019s role as fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\n<em>The Function of the Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The instructions which the judge gave informed the jury that it was bound by the law as explained by him. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Even if you don\u2019t agree with it, you must accept that law and apply it to the facts as you find them to be. You are not a legislative body. You have no authority to change the Maryland criminal law. So you will take the law as I explain it to you and then you will apply it to the facts as you find them to be from the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>And he told the jury that it was \u201cthe sole judge of facts in a criminal case____\u201d But he did not give the jury the law of self-defense. Contrary to his duty, the judge denied to the jury the opportunity to apply the law of perfect self-defense and imperfect self-defense to its findings of fact, according to tenets of that law as explained by the judge as an authoritative figure. We have concluded that the evidence here was sufficient, if believed by the jury, to engender the doctrine of self-defense. Then the burden should shift to the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Dykes did not kill in self-defense. The judge precluded the shifting of the burden. The failure to give the instructions in the circumstances was reversible error; it stymied the function of the jury to determine the issue of self-defense and deprived Dykes of his entitlement to have the jury so determine. <em>Wilson, </em>261 Md. at 566, 276 A.2d 214. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and award Dykes a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR SOMERSET COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL;</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY SOMERSET COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-16\">.

It declared that the wounds caused extensive bleeding externally and also injured the spinal cord, lungs, and spleen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-15\">. In modern times, the distinction between \u201cjustifiable\u201d and \"excusable\" as to a homicide committed in perfect self-defense has no practical effect in application because, under either characterization, the killer is not culpable. <em>See Faulkner v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 113, 115 n. 1, 458 A.2d 81 (1983), <em>aff'd, State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 483 A.2d 759 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\">4. We rejected the State\u2019s contention that \"the subjective nature of imperfect self-defense warrants its rejection because the defense rewards unreasonableness.\u201d <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. at 503, 483 A.2d 759. We found this contention to be unpersuasive for two reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxR\">First, criminal law is predicated on the concept that an offender\u2019s level of culpability is dependent on his mental state. Strict liability offenses are the exception, not the rule. Second, a mitigation defense such as imperfect self-defense provides little reward for unreasonableness: a conviction of manslaughter rather than murder. Although the difference is substantial, a successful defense based on imperfect self-defense never results in the exculpation of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\"><em>Id. </em>We also rejected the State\u2019s contention that imperfect self-defense should only be available if the facts indicate \u201cextreme extenuating circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 483 A.2d 759.

We glean from the argument on the matter, out of the presence of the jury, that defense counsel had submitted an instruction on perfect self-defense and imperfect self-defense and that the prosecutor had presented an instruction on imperfect self-defense, all requests apparently in writing. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 4-325(b). The written requests are not included in the record before us, and we do not know how they were phrased. In any event, there is no indication that they were denied because they did not correctly state the law and clearly they were not fairly covered by instructions actually given. After the judge had charged the jury, the only requested instructions preserved were those of Dykes seeking instructions on perfect and imperfect self-defense. The prosecutor said that he was not going to argue his request for an instruction of imperfect self-defense, and he did not argue it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">.
