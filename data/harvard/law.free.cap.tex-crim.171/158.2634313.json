In making a left turn immediately before or as he entered an intersection, the appellant turned his car in front of the motorcycle causing his right front fender to collide with the front wheel of the motorcycle. Appellant\u2019s car skidded three feet beyond the point of impact. The driver of the motorcycle was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">Appellant did not testify or offer any evidence in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Appellant contends that there is no evidence that an assault or striking was committed by the appellant or that he committed any act or acts of negligence, hence this conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">The offense of assault with a motor vehicle may be committed by the collision of the vehicle with the person\u2019s body or with the vehicle in or on which the person is riding thereby causing injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to such person. 8 Tex. Jur. 2d 12, Sec. 373; Schultz v. State, 137 Tex. Cr. R. 164, 128 S.W. 2d 36; Swift v. State, 143 Tex. Cr. R. 351, 158 S.W. 2d 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The evidence is sufficient to show that the appellant while operating his automobile by either, or all, or any combination of the acts alleged negligently collided with the motorcycle thereby causing injuries less than death to the operator thereof. Therefore appellant\u2019s contention is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The evidence sustains the conviction and no error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">ON appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"b186-8\">DICE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Appellant strenuously insists that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction because there was no proof that his automobile struck either the injured party or the motorcycle upon which he was riding, but on the contrary the evidence shows that the motorcycle struck appellant\u2019s automobile. Appellant insists that, upon such facts, the conviction cannot be sustained under our holding in Fannin v. State, 168 Tex. Cr. R. 593, 331 S.W. 2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Under the facts, we do not deem Fannin v. State, supra, here controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">In the Fannin case, the information alleged that the accused \u201ccollided\u201d with Linda M. Hamilton, the injured party, and the evidence was undisputed that the automobile in which she was riding ran into the automobile driven by the accused. There was an absence of any proof that the accused \u201ccollided\u201d with the injured party as alleged in the information. In the case at bar, the information did not allege that appellant committed the aggravated assault by \u201ccolliding\u201d with Foursee McFadden, Jr., the injured party, but that he committed the assault \u201c* * * by then and there negligently colliding with a motor vehicle, to-wit, a motorcycle * * * being driven by the said Foursee McFadden, Jr. * * *.\u201d The evidence adduced in the instant case, including the testimony of the two investigating officers, is sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>support the finding of the jury that appellant negligently collided with the motorcycle being driven by the injured party as alleged in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Remaining convinced that a proper disposition was made of the case in our opinion on original submission, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
