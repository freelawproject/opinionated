The judgment final recites that the appellants and their attorney appeared in person and announced ready for trial; and that \u201call things having been agreed upon and stipulated\u201d, and the principal did not appear to answer \u201cthe charge by indictment herein filed and then and there pending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">No plea to the jurisdiction, on the ground there was no order of transfer, appears to have been made until after the entry of judgment and notice of appeal. In counties in which there are two or more district courts having concurrent jurisdiction in all felony cases with statutory authority to transfer cases from one to the other, the plea to the jurisdiction, because of the omission of such order, comes too late after notice of appeal. Hickox v. State, 104 Tex. Cr. R. 649, 285 S.W. 621; Brady v. State, 119 Tex. Cr. R. 178, 44 S.W. 2d 873; Gower v. State, 169 Tex. Cr. R. 81, 332 S.W. 2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">It is insisted that the judgment nisi is defective because it does not show that the principal failed to appear in court at any time she was bound to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">There are no statutory requirements that the judgment nisi recite when the principal was to appear and such re vitals are not shown to be essential to a valid judgment nisi. 8 lex. Jur. 2d 193, Sec. 67; Hodges v. State, 73 Tex. Cr. R. 638, 165 S.W. 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Appellants contend.that the bail bond was materially altered after its execution, therefore, it was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Appellants\u2019 position is that the bond was an out of state bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>made for the sole purpose of releasing the principal who was in jail in Cullman, Alabama, while the state insists that it was made for the principal\u2019s appearance on the charge in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The bond was introduced in evidence. Two.deputy sheriffs whose names appear on the bond in connection with its approval, the custodian of the records of Criminal District Court No. 4 and Byron Benton, one of the sureties, testified as to the making of the bond and its condition at the various times and stages before the entry of the judgment nisi.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The evidence raised an issue of whether there had been a material alteration of the bond after its execution. It is evident that the trial court found against the appellants on the issue of alteration when it rendered judgment against them on the bond. 8 Tex. Jur. 2d 221, Sec. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The other contentions presented have been considered and it is concluded that they do not show error.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
