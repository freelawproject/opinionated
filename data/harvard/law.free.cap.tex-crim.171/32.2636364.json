Irwin, </em>and <em>R. T. Scales, </em>Dallas, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-13\"><em>Henry Wade, </em>Criminal District Attorney, <em>William F.

Two police officers near the store were alerted and they overtook the appellant in a short distance and removed a stole from under his jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Manager Donnell identified the appellant at the trial as the person who was in the store when a stole was taken and that she saw the officer recover a stole from the appellant a few minutes later which was the one missing from the store. She further testified that she had the care, control and management of the store and the merchandise therein including the mink stole which was of the value of $550, and that it was taken without her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The appellant, while testifying, stated that he was drunk at the time in question as he had been drinking vodka for several days and that he did not remember taking the stole, but he did admit that he had been previously convicted as alleged. On cross-examination he admitted several previous felony convictions, but denied having been convicted of others about which he was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Appellant strenuously insists that the state committed error during his cross-examination by asking about the details of the prior conviction, and in asking about prior convictions while reading from memoranda because it showed incorrect information.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">While testifying, the appellant in addition to the prior conviction alleged also admitted convictions in Arizona, Arkansas, and California, but he denied being convicted of two other offenses he was asked about. Appellant called the state\u2019s attorney who cross-examined him and the attorney\u2019s testimony shows that he was using a \u201crecord\u201d as a basis for his question.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">There was no objection to the use of the memoranda of the question and answer about any details concerning his drinking at the time of the safe burglary of Ed Masher\u2019s house which appears from the record to be the offense resulting in the conviction relied on for enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction and no error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
