He stated that they started back toward Odessa, but had automotive trouble and returned to Ketchersid\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>house in Andrews where the young men drank some beer and then went in search of another automobile. He stated that as they were walking through a park one of the men in question hit him in the back of the head and knocked him unconscious; that he came to after midnight, discovered that he was bruised and bloody and his billfold was gone, and he immediately reported the matter to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">Officer Cozart testified that he went to the park in question the following morning after daylight and there found a billfold containing Giles\u2019 identification and a loose one dollar bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Appellant\u2019s confession, which was introduced without objection, recited how Giles had been picked up on the highway and driven to Andrews, where Giles purchased gasoline; it related the automotive trouble and their return to Andrews. It continues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u201cWhen we all got to the ball park, since Gene Giles had been smarting off all night I hit him and knocked him down. Then all the others jumped on him. We saw the car lights of a car coming, so we all ran off. Bill Thompson said he had Giles\u2019 money. Under a street light we counted it and found he had $78.00 which we all divided, and I got $20.00 which I accepted knowing it wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The accomplice witness Watkins testified to practically the same state of facts except that he did not know who struck the first blow which hit Giles. He testified that before the group left in the direction of the ball park he heard Ketchersid whisper something about Giles having some money but that he did not know whether or not appellant heard the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Appellant did not testify or offer any evidence in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">We shall discuss the contentions advanced by the brief. It is appellant\u2019s primary contention that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction for robbery because there is no proof that appellant intended to take Giles\u2019 money at the time he was assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Reliance is had upon Gillard v. State, 128 Tex. Cr. Rep. 514, 82 S.W. 2d 678, in which the accused remained in the automobile while her companions entered the cafe and fobbed the proprietor. The apparent distinction is that Gillard did nothing toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>perpetration of the robbery, while appellant here struck the first blow which rendered Giles unconscious so that he might be robbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Reliance is further had upon Alaniz v. State, 147 Tex. Cr. Rep. 1, 177 S.W. 2d 965. Such case was not reversed on the insufficiency of the evidence but the failure of the court to submit appellant\u2019s defensive theory if that after the fight Perez returned to the scene and took possession of the billfold without Alaniz\u2019s knowledge or that Perez thought the'billfold belonged to Alaniz or Falcon they should acquit. There were no objections to the charge as given in the case at bar, and we do find that the court instructed the jury to acquit appellant of the offense of robbery if they found that he assaulted Giles but they had a reasonable doubt as to whether he intended to take his property. The court further charged on aggravated assault and simple assault and the law of principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We have concluded that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that appellant intended to rob Giles at the time he struck him. They may have concluded that the phrase \u201csince Gene Giles had been smarting off all night,\u201d contained in his confession, was a reference to the display of the pocketbook full of money at the filling station. Be that as it may, this Court upheld a conviction for robbery under a charge on the law of principals where the evidence showed that the accused merely drove the automobile while his companion Allen committed the robbery of the injured party, who was, as in the case at bar, a hitchhiker. See Blair v. State, 138 Tex. Cr. Rep. 247, 135 S.W. 2d 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Appellant\u2019s next complaint relates to argument. It is contended that State\u2019s counsel commented on appellant\u2019s failure to testify. In his argument, appellant\u2019s counsel posed this question, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the State put on this witness stand this boy Bill Thompson * * * ?\u201d In answer thereto, the State\u2019s attorney argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201cHe says why haven\u2019t we done this, why haven\u2019t we done that? But, remember this: Every witness called to'that witness stand, if you please, was called by the State. Right? Not one \u2014 not one, mind you, by the Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Sometime later, appellant\u2019s counsel made a general objection, nowhere indicating to the court that he thought this constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>a comment upon appellant\u2019s failure to testify. We have concluded that, in view of appellant\u2019s argument and the general objection, reversible error has not been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Finding the evidence sufficient to support the conviction and no reversible error appearing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
