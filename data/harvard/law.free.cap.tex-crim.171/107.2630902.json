McAngus, </em>Assistant District Attorney, and <em>Leon Douglas, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, all of Austin, for the state.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>BELCHER, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The conviction is for incest; the punishment two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The typewritten statement of the appellant, which was introduced in evidence by the state, shows the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he was 70 years of age, could not read, could write his name and a few simple words, and had completed the third grade. He admitted signing the statement but stated that \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make any statement at all\u201d and that \u201cI did not make no statement. He (the officer) made it hisself\u201d; and further, the appellant denied the truthfulness of the facts recited in the statement. He testified that when he arrived at the court house about 1:00 P.M. he was placed in jail where he remained until about sundown when he was taken into a small room where he remained while being questioned by the officers until he signed the statement about 3:00 A.M. the next morning; that he had no dinner, supper or food at any time during the interrogation; that the officers cursed and threatened to hit him, called him coward and yellow because he wouldn\u2019t place his hands on the officers; that \u201cI got tired, just like drunk. I was sick, I was weak\u201d and that he signed the statement after the officer \u201cbegged me lots\u201d and told me \u201cto sign and we will give you bond,\u201d but \u201cif you don\u2019t do it, we won\u2019t give you bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Officer Davis, a state\u2019s witness, testified that he first saw the appellant about 6:00 P.M. when he was taken into a little room in the back and that he agreed to make the statement around 1:00 A.M. the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Deputy Sheriff Hullman, a state\u2019s witness, to whom the eighteen line statement was made and who typed it, testified that \u201cHe (appellant) did not readily admit it. * * * But after a while he did.\u201d Hullman stated that he first saw appellant about 5:30 P.M. when he placed him in jail but did not begin interrogating him until about 8:30 or 9:00 P-M. He further stated that there was some four of five hours of talk in the little room but that he didn\u2019t say anything to the appellant about making a statement until probably after midnight and that the appellant signed the statement about 2:30 A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The officers while testifying denied the use by them of any persuasion, threats or coercion upon the appellant in the making of the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In the absence of the jury, the trial judge heard evidence on the voluntary character of the confession and concluded that it was not inadmissible as a matter of law. But he recognized that there was an issue as to whether appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary and in his charge instructed the jury that before they could consider the statement they must find that no threats, duress or physical violence was used to induce him to make the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">By specially requested charge, the appellant called the court\u2019s attention to its failure to instruct the jury that unless they found that the confession was made without compulsion or persuasion they could not consider it. These defensive issues were raised by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Art. 726, V.A.C.C.P., provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u201cThe confession of a defendant may be used in evidence against him if it appear that the same was freely made without compulsion or persuasion * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In Jordan v. State, 163 Tex. Cr. R. 287, 290 S.W. 2d 666, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u201cIn his charge to the jury the court required them to find that the appellant had been warned but did not mention the other defensive matters raised by the appellant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\u201cBy requested charges the appellant called this omission to the court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">\u201cWe have concluded that the case of Cordes v. State, 158 Tex. Cr. R. 529, 257 S.W. 2d 704, 705, is here controlling. There we said, \u2018He was entitled to a distinct submission of each defensive issue raised by the testimony.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">That the jury considered the voluntariness of the statement is evidenced by its written request, during its deliberations, to the judge for a definition of duress which he declined to give them-</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">There was no evidence of the use of physical violence by the officers upon the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">The facts and circumstances surrounding and under which the making and signing of the statement took place entitled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>appellant, in addition to the submission of threats and duress, to a distinct submission of whether the statement was made without compulsion or persuasion. These issues having been raised by the evidence, the failure of the court to either give or respond to appellant\u2019s specially requested charge was prejudicial to his rights and calls for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b136-5\">ON STATE\u2019S SECOND MOTION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"b136-6\">McDonald, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Our opinion on state\u2019s motion for rehearing is withdrawn and the following is substituted therefor:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The state contends that appellant made no objections and reserved no exceptions to the court\u2019s amended charge; that, having failed to do so, any defects were waived; and that no error was shown, therefore, in refusing the special requested charge originally presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">An examination of the record shows only one charge. There is only one file mark on the charge, and it bears no earmarks, signs, or designations showing that it was ever modified or amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">In its motion for rehearing, the state refers to the \u201ctrial court\u2019s qualification to said requested charge.\u201d The court merely used this qualification to complete the bill of exception by showing the instruction given in the main charge, thereby justifying his refusal of the requested charge- This instruction had to be contained in the main charge or it could not have been quoted as it was by the court in his qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">The state\u2019s second motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
