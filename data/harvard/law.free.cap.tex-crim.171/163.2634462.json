The judgment showing a conviction upon a plea of guilty in said cause for \u201cdriving while intoxicated\u201d was introduced in evidence and it was agreed and stipulated that appellant was the same person named in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Appellant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention for reversal is that the judgment of the prior conviction does not support the allegations of the indictment in that he was found guilty of no offense under the law, because the complaint and the information in the prior case were not introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In misdemeanor cases the judgment need not show, by name, the offense for which the accused has been convicted, nor specify the particular count upon which the conviction is based. 12 Tex. Jur., Sec. 348, p. 706; Fowler v. State, 144 Tex. Cr. Rep. 382,162 S.W. 2d 969; Johnson v. State, 163 Tex. Cr. Rep. 185, 289 S.W. 2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">In Coaker v. State, 159 Tex. Cr. Rep. 282, 259 S.W. 2d 220, this court held that it was not necessary to introduce the complaint and the information where the indictment was proper and the judgment was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">We find from the testimony of Officer Lowery, which was admitted without objection, that appellant (in the instant case) told him he had been convicted for \u201cmisdemeanor DWI\u201d in Brazoria County. Further, it was agreed and stipulated that appellant was the same person named in the judgment of conviction which had been introduced in evidence, such judgment showing that it was rendered in the County Court of Brazoria County, upon a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>It is our conclusion that appellant\u2019s admission to Officer Lowery that he had been convicted for \u201cmisdemeanor DWI\u201d in Brazoria County and his agreement and stipulation that he was the same person named in the judgment of conviction for \u201cdriving while intoxicated,\u201d on a plea of guilty in the County Court of Brazoria County, are sufficient to show the prior conviction, as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
