He testified that he got out of the police car at a point 15 or 20 feet from appellant, directed him to pick up the box and place it in the police automobile, observing that it was labeled \u201cOld Crow Whiskey,\u201d and that appellant said, \u201cI have got another one,\u201d and another similar box was found \u201cin that area.\u201d At the trial, the boxes were opened and were shown to contain 96 half pint bottles labeled Old Crow Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 86 proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he went to the spot in the woods to meet his \u201cgirl friend\u201d; that Bullock drove up and asked him where the whisky was; that he replied he knew nothing of any whisky but, in compliance with Bullock\u2019s demand and in his company, he searched in the bushes where Bullock found the two cases of whisky which were introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">The jury chose to accept Bullock\u2019s testimony and reject that of appellant, and we find the evidence sufficient to sustain its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>We have not been favored with a brief in appellant\u2019s behalf.
