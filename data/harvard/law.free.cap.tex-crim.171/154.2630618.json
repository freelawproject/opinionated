An examination of Article 483, V.A.P.C., will reveal that such allegation is not essential when the length of the blade is stated. See Willson\u2019s Criminal Forms, 6th Ed. (1958 Pocket Part), Sec. 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Appellant next attacks the constitutionality of that portion of Article 483, supra, which makes it unlawful to carry on or about the person <em>\u201ca </em>knife with a blade over five and one-half inches in length\u201d on the ground that it is of such doubtful construction that it may not be understood. Reliance is had upon Ex parte Chernosky, 153 Tex. Cr. Rep. 52, 217 S.W. 2d 673, where this court held the phrase \u201cwithout due caution or circumspection\u201d to be so vague and indefinite as to render the statute inoperative because men of common intelligence must guess as to its meaning. There is nothing vague or indefinite in the description of a knife \u201cwith a blade over five and one-half inches in length\u201d and no need to guess at its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Appellant further relies upon Spigener v. State, 166 Tex. Cr. Rep. 466, 314 S.W. 2d 832, where we held that the phrase \u201chand chain\u201d is not well recognized and of such doubtful construction that it cannot be understood. We reiterate that such is not the case before us here. Attention is further called to the recent holding of this Court in Marney v. State, 168 Tex. Cr. Rep. 567, 330 S.W. 2d 623, wherein we held unconstitutional a statute which makes it unlawful to possess mercury without having in one\u2019s possession a bill of sale for the same. An entirely different question is here presented. The legislature has the power to regulate the wearing of arms with a view to prevent crime. Article I, Section 23, Constitution of Texas. Article 484, V.A.P.C., provides reasonable exemptions under which such arms may be carried, and therefore those provisions of Article 483 which are definite and certain are not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
