Upon entering the apartment they saw the deceased, Charles Edward Henry, age 15, lying on the floor at the foot of the bed. He had been shot four times \u2014 in the back of the head, in the left shoulder, the left side, and in the stomach, was unconscious, and died in a short time. The appellant and the deceased were alone in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The evidence shows that the appellant was 38 years of age, an ex-convict, and a homosexual. His written statement, which was introduced in evidence, shows that, prior to March 24, he learned from the officers that the deceased had told them every secret he had told the deceased including that he was an ex-convict. The statement further recites that he remembered getting the gun and shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The appellant did not testify and relied on insanity as his main defense although the court in the charge also submitted the issue of self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The appellant and the state both offered expert and lay testimony on the issue of appellant\u2019s insanity and sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">The jury resolved the issues against the appellant and the evidence is sufficient to support their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence the details of another offense over his objection that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the details were of an extraneous offense for which he was not on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">There is evidence, without objection, that the appellant had been recently released from the penitentiary, was an ex-convict, and a homosexual. On cross-examination of appellant\u2019s brother, appellant objected to the state\u2019s question as to whether the witness knew that the appellant had previously shot a 15 year old boy, which was overruled, but the question was not answered and there was no motion to exclude the question or a request for an instruction that the jury not consider it. The next question was broadened to include whether the witness knew if the appellant had previously shot a boy in Dallas \u201cover this homosexuality, as in this case,\u201d to which there was no objection. The witness answered, without objection, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was for. I knew he shot him.\u201d The court certified in the bill that evidence of appellant having served time in the penitentiary for a felony had been received before the introduction of the complained of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">A further examination of the same witness shows the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">Q. \u201cIn other words, * * * you would take a chance on a man that didn\u2019t know the difference in right and wrong who once shot a fifteen- boy, you would take a chance on him doing it again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">A. \u201cI was in hopes after the boy\u2014 after he had been in trouble once I was in hopes he wouldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">No objection was made to this question and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">It appears from the record that the details of the Dallas incident were before the jury without objection except that the appellant had been there charged with assault to murder. In view of all the evidence in the record, it is concluded that no reversible error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">By Bill of Exception No. 1 it is insisted that error was committed in the opening argument by the state\u2019s attorney as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">\u201c* * * The state\u2019s theory of this case is, and let us start with the date that the defendant, himself, admits that he met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>this boy, November 17,1958, and I say to you right there was when this boy was caught, you might say, by an individual who is no better than a blood sucking vampire. * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">To which the appellant objected because there was no evidence that he was a vampire or bloodsucking and it was inflammatory and prejudicial, which was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The appellant was 38 years of age and the deceased was 15 years old at the time of his death. According to the testimony of Officer Ball, appellant admitted that he was a homosexual and that while serving time \u201c \u2018in the penitentiary they kept me in a well lighted cell so they would know what I was doing at all times.\u2019 \u201d In his written statement appellant stated that he met the deceased November 17, 1958, and that they had been homosexual friends from then until his death. An officer testified that he told the appellant that the deceased\u2019s mother \u201cwas worried about something going on between them\u201d and appellant promised \u201cto leave him alone\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The argument, when considered in the light of the definition of a vampire as \u201cone who lives by preying on others,\u201d particularly the young and healthy, and when weighed in connection with all the facts and circumstances in evidence \u2014 the unnatural relationship of the parties and the background and setting in which the killing occurred as shown by the evidence \u2014 does not call for a reversal. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd. Ed., The Encyclopedia Americana.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Bills of Exception Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 6 as grouped in appellant\u2019s brief, complain of the state\u2019s argument in alluding to appellant\u2019s failure to testify; of the failure of appellant to support his written statement wherein he told someone to call an ambulance; that the various acts of state\u2019s counsel were improper and that they sought to mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">No objections to the above matters are shown in the bills of exception. Ordinarily, objections to the jury argument and the grounds therefor must be made at the time it occurred in order to be reviewed by this court. This rule has been applied in numerous cases in which a life sentence and the death penalty has been assessed. Brown v. State, 121 Tex. Cr. R. 528, 51 S.W. 2d 616; Doswell v. State, 158 Tex. Cr. R. 447, 256 S.W. 2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">In Bill of Exception No. 7 it is contended that the state\u2019s at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>torney erred when he argued that several pictures were found in appellant's room, but only one is in evidence and then said \u201cI don\u2019t blame them for not wanting you to see the rest of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">The objection that it invited the consideration of evidence outside of the record was sustained by the court and the jury was instructed not to consider the statement. In this no error is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The other contentions urged for reversal have been carefully considered and it is concluded that they do not show error.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
