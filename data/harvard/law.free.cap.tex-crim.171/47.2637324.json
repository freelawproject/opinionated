They made out a prima facie case that the accused is a fugitive from justice and subject to extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">The appellant did not testify or call any witnesses, but he offered the affidavit of Jack Barth who apparently is the same person that signed the complaint charging appellant with the crime of disposing of mortgaged property. Said complaint and warrant of arrest issued thereon in connection with the requisition were introduced in evidence by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">An examination of the affidavit of Jack Barth reveals no issue or defense in favor of the appellant.
