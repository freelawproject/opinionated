The State of Texas, Appellee, this day decided, (page 17, this volume), in which the conviction of appellant for unlawfully selling whisky to Texas Liquor Control Board Inspector Ralph C. Elliott in Coleman County, Texas, a dry area, was affirmed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The facts in the two cases are substantially the same and the state\u2019s proof shows that, on the date alleged, the appellant not only sold a pint of whisky to Inspector Elliott in Coleman County but also sold a pint of Tom Moore Whisky to Inspector Wallace N. Coburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Appellant\u2019s conviction in the instant case is for the sale made to Inspector Coburn and we find the evidence sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">While the proof shows that appellant\u2019s dealings with the liquor agents were contemporaneous, it shows that such constituted two separate transactions and sales of liquor to the two liquor agents, for both of which appellant may be separately prosecuted and convicted. Walker v. State, 146 Tex. Cr. R. 138, 171 S.W. 2d 887 In refusing appellant\u2019s motion to consolidate the two cases and in trying the cases separately, the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The record presents no formal bills of exception and there are no objections to the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">By informal bills of exception, appellant complains of the court\u2019s action in sustaining the state\u2019s objections to certain questions propounded by appellant to the state\u2019s witnesses on their cross-examination. The bills are deficient and present nothing for review in that they fail to show what the answer of the witnesses would have been. Mayes v. State, 165 Tex. Cr. R. 123, 304 S.W. 2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">Finding the evidence sufficient to support the conviction and no reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
