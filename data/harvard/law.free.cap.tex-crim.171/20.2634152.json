The complaint and information in each case properly charged an aggravated assault under Art. 1147(5), V.A.P.C., which provides that an assault and battery shall become aggravated \u201cwhen the instrument or means used is such as inflicts disgrace upon the person assaulted, as an assault and battery with a whip or cowhide.\u201d In charging the offense under this subdivision, it was not necessary to allege that appellant was an \u201cadult male.\u201d Slawson v. State, 39 Tex. Cr. R. 176, 45 S.W. 575; Gray v. State, 158 Tex. Cr. R. 214, 254 S.W. 2d 319; and Fowler v. State, 169 Tex. Cr. R. 172, 333 S.W. 2d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Briefly, the state\u2019s testimony shows that on the night in question the prosecuting witnesses, two girls 16 and 18 years of age, attended a dance at the Y. W. C. A. in the city of Houston. Around 10:00 p.m. they left the dance floor and went to the ladies rest room. After they entered, appellant came into the rest room and went into a compartment. In some five minutes, appellant came out of the compartment with his pants unzipped, holding his penis in his hand. Appellant then proceeded to grab the wrist of one of the prosecuting witnesses with his hand and then grabbed the wrist of the other. Thereupon, the girls screamed and ran out of the rest room. Appellant also ran outside and was caught by some boys who were present at the dance. Both prosecuting witnesses testified that appellant\u2019s acts caused them to have a feeling of shame and embarrassment and inflicted disgrace upon each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">As a witness in his own behalf, appellant testified that, on the night in question, he had consumed a quantity of beer and whiskey, and was in such condition that he could not remember many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>of the things which happened after he reached the dance. Appellant stated that he did not remember the incidents about which the prosecuting witnesses testified, and called a witness who corroborated his testimony with reference to his being drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We find the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Appellant filed a plea of former conviction in which he alleged that on August 12, 1960, he was found guilty in Corporation Court No. 3 of the City of Houston, upon a plea of nolo contendere, of the offense of indecent exposure arising out of the same transaction for which he was on trial in the instant cases. Proof was offered by appellant in support of the plea. Complaint is made to the court\u2019s overruling of the plea and refusing to submit the same to the jury. In overruling the plea, the court did not err. Art. 536, V.A.C.C.P., provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u201cA former judgment of acquittal or conviction in a court of competent jurisdiction shall be a bar to any further prosecution for the same offense, but shall not bar a prosecution for any higher grade of offense over which said court had not jurisdiction, unless such judgment was had upon indictment or information, in which case the prosecution shall be barred for all grades of the offense\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Under the statute, appellant\u2019s prosecution in corporation court, upon complaint for indecent exposure, would not bar his prosecution in the county court for the higher grade offense of aggravated assault. Henkle v. State, 27 Tex. App. 510, 11 S.W. 617; Caudle v. State, 57 Tex. Cr. R. 363, 123 S.W. 413; and Ex parte Hernandez, 126 Tex. Cr. R. 71 303 S.W. 2d 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Finding the evidence sufficient to support the conviction and no reversible error appearing, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
