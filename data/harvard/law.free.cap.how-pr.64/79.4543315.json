Before the time to serve the answer expired the defendant settled with the plaintiff personally and obtained a receipt in full of all claims, and the defendant\u2019s attorney notified the attorneys for the plaintiff of the settlement. After notice that they would not recognize the settlement as being prejudicial to their lien for costs and services the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys entered judgment for the full amount demanded in the complaint on failure to plead, served a satisfaction of judgment, excepting and leaving the .judgment standing to the amount of their lien for services and costs, and issued execution for the same. Ro notice of lien was served on the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-11\">The defendant made a motion that the judgment be vacated or that the default be opened.'</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-12\"><em>H. B. Whitbeck, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN\">1st. The judgment is void because the claim on which it is based was settled before judgment. 2d. The plaintiff\u2019s attorneys have no lien because no notice of lien was served. 3d. The lien specified in section 66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>only extends to costs and does not cover the attorney\u2019s bill for services.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-5\"><em>James B. Dill (Dill &amp; Chandler, </em>attorneys), for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avv\">1st. The \u2022plaintiff\u2019s attorneys have a lien upon the judgment for their costs and services <em>(Code, sec. </em>66, <em>as amended in </em>1879; <em>Foreman </em>agt. <em>Edwards, </em>14 <em>Weekly Dig., </em>409). 2d. The defendant\u2019s contention that this lien is limited to costs is untenable. The Code changed the rule limiting an attorney\u2019s lien to costs and extending it to compensation for his services <em>(Marshall </em>agt. <em>Meech, </em>51 <em>N. Y., </em>140; <em>Wright </em>agt. <em>Wright, </em>70 <em>N. Y., </em>100; <em>In re Knapp, </em>85 <em>N. Y., </em>284.; <em>Matter of Wilson &amp; Greig, McCarty's Code Pro. R. [vol. </em>2], <em>No. </em>2, <em>p. </em>165). 3d. Ho notice of lien is required under the Code. 4th. The practice of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys was proper <em>(McCabe </em>agt. Fogg, <em>11 Law Bulletin [monthly], </em>71).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b102-8\">Freedman, <em>J</em>.</author>\n<p id=\"Aio\">I still adhere to the views expressed by me in <em>McCabe </em>agt. <em>Fogg. </em>In reading the cases cited to the contrary it must be constantly borne in mind that the amendment of section 66, which is relied on by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, was made in 1879, and not before. The motion must therefore be denied, with ten dollars costs; but as the question is one which should be settled in this court the defendant, in case of appeal to the general term, may have a stay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
