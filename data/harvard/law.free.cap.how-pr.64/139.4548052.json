When arraigned he interposed objections to the finding of the indictment in various forms, all however, centering in this, that the grand jury which found the indictment, was drawn from the names of persons selected by the recorder (a local judicial officer) of the city of Albany, and by the supervisors of the several towns (the recorder taking the place of the seventeen supervisors of the city), and from the petit jury list numbering some 2,500 persons, instead of from a list of three hundred persons selected exclusively by the supervisors of the city and county, as required by the Revised Statutes (3 <em>R. S. [7th ed.], </em>2558, <em>sec. </em>1), and which proceeding in that regard was taken under and pursuant to section 1041 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881, whereas, as was insisted, such amendment was unconstitutional in so far as it provided for the selection of grand jurors in and for the city and county of Albany, as it was a local act within article 3, section 18, of the constitution, which prohibits local laws for for selecting, drawing, summoning or impannellng grand or petit jurors. The objections were overruled. A plea of not guilty was entered. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the trial, objection was taken to the petit jury on the same grounds which were also overruled. Conviction and sentence followed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-5\"><em>Held, </em>that the conviction should be affirmed (Learned and Boches, <em>JJ., </em>concurring; Westbrook, <em>J., </em>dissenting).</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-6\">The Code of Civil Procedure which governs the case provides no way by which such a question can be raised <em>(Per </em>Learned <em>and </em>Bockes, <em>JJ.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-7\">A motion to quash, or to set aside an indictment should be made upon affidavits, and the Code prescribes no method of reviewing a decision thereon (Learned, <em>P. J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-8\">There is no constitutional provision which allows a party always to appeal to the highest court, even when his grievance is that a constitutional right has been infringed (Learned, <em>P.

J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-10\">There being no way of ascertaining whether chapter 582, of the Laws of 1881, was reported by Code commissioners, except by evidence <em>aliunde </em>the chapter in question of the acts of the legislature, said chapter cannot be held to be an infraction of the fundamental law, as the constitutionality of laws cannot be permitted to depend on possibly varying decisions of courts and juries on mere questions of fact as to which the legislature had special knowledge (Learned, <em>P. J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-11\">The objections to the indictment were in the nature of a challenge to the array. They went to the entire panel. The mode of presenting the questions is however immaterial (Bockes, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-12\">The Revised Statutes limited challenges to grand jurors to an objection against the prosecutor or complainant serving on the jury, on the theory that the substantial rights of the prisoner would be protected on the trial before the petit jury (Bocres, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-13\">Irregularities in the selection or drawing of grand jurors, not affecting the substantial rights of the accused as regards the question of his guilt or innocence, is not a good ground of challenge to the array (Bockes, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-14\">The recorder, although acting under an unconstitutional law in selecting the list from which the grand and petit jurors were drawn, was, as to the act of selection, a <em>de facto </em>officer, and his selection cannot be questioned collaterally; and this rule is not changed because there was no dispute as to the title to bis office, the objection being to the exercise of additional duties created by a law fundamentally bad. His action had the sanction of an apparent law duly certified to him and to the people of the state (Bockes, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b162-15\">The paper presented by the defendant was not a plea <em>'\u2022 </em>to an indictment,\u201d and as such controlled by section 332 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Neither was it a challenge to the array of grand jurors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>nor to an individual grand juror, and therefore controlled either as to form or substance. The objection he made was radical; it was aimed at the jurisdiction of the court to place him on trial, and denied that he was indicted, as no grand jury had presented the accusation upon which he was arraigned (Westbrook, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-5\">The Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be construed as intending to deprive a person of a constitutional right, and if it be capable of any such construction, which it clearly is not, such a barrier would be futile, for it is a legal impossibility by a statute to deprive a party of his right to claim constitutional protection. Under color of legislative enactment, a grand jury cannot be organized in a mode forbidden by the constitution, and prevent, under like color of legislation, the aggrieved party from being heard in assertion of his rights (West-brook, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-6\">By section 18 of article 3 of the Constitution, it is declared, \"The legislature shall not pass a private or local bill in any of the following cases, * * * selecting, drawing', summoning or impanneling grand or petit jurors,\u201d and by section 35 of same article, it is provided \"that sections 17 and 18 of this article shall not apply to any bill or the amendment to any bill which shall be reported to the legislature by commissioners who have been appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes.\u201d These provisions are clear. Chapter 533, of 1881, is not an amendment to a <em>bill, </em>but is an amendment of a <em>law </em>in full force at the time of the passage of the former, and not having been reported by commissioners, is void (Westbrook, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-7\">It is elementary that a body of men, no matter of whom composed, has, either of its own volition or upon the summoning and call of other than the authority of law, no power to resolve itself into a grand jury, and when professing to be thus organized, to accuse any one, by what it may call an indictment, of an infamous crime and subject him to a trial therefor (Westbrook, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-8\">It is clearly the prerogative of the court to ascertain and decide whether, in the passage of any bill, a constitutional provision was violated (Westbrook, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-9\">The authorities have settled these principles : First. That mere irregularities by an officer in doing that which he is authorized to do will not vitiate the thing done. Second. When duties properly and legally belonging to the office of which an individual is in possession have been performed by such incumbent, that which has been thus done will be upheld as to the parlies affected thereby, and courts will not, in collateral proceedings, inquire into the right of the individual to hold the office and to discharge the duties which lawfully appertain to such office (Westbrook, <em>J.),</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-10\">But no such principles are involved in this case. The recorder assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>to do an act not properly appertaining to his office, as the constitution forbade conferring - upon him such power by a local law (West-brook, <em>J.).</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b164-5\"><em>Friery </em>agt. <em>People </em>(2 <em>Keyes, </em>424); <em>Carpenter </em>agt <em>People (64 N.

When this prerequisite to a trial and conviction was not obtained, and a human being is in prison, without this safeguard of his rights having been observed, the court should rather stretch than curtail its power to review (Westbrook, J.).</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b164-7\"><em>Third </em>Department, <em>General </em>Term, November, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">Appeal from a judgment of conviction for grand larceny, rendered in the court of sessions of Albany county. At the September (1881) term of said court of sessions, an indictment was found against the defendant for grand larceny, alleged to have been committed in the city of Cohoes, August 2, 1881. At the March (1882) term of said court of sessions, the defendant was brought into court, when he presented the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">And the said John Petrea comes in his own proper person, \u2022and having heard the said indictment read, says that the state ought not further prosecute the said indictment against him the said John Petrea, because he says that (names of jurors), all of the grand jurors by whom the said indictment was found and returned into the said court at the said March term thereof, were not, all of them, the above named grand jurors, nor any one of them, at the time they so acted, and at the time the said indictment was found and returned, duly and legally selected and qualified to act as such grand jurors, in this,-they, the said grand jurors, nor any one of them, had not then and there been drawn from a list of the names of three hundred persons prepared by the supervisors of the county of Albany, as is required by and provided for in and by the Revised Statutes of this state, or from any list of the names of any other or different number of persons what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ever, prepared by the said supervisors of said county of Albany to serve as grand jurors, but that, on the contrary thereof, the said grand jurors herein before particularly named, and each and every one of them, who found and returned the said indictment, were drawn by the officers named by law from the box containing the names of petit jurors selected for said county of Albany, under and pursuant to the provisions of chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881, entitled \u201cAn act to amend section one thousand and forty-one of the Code of Civil Procedure,\u201d under the pretense and claim that said chapter 532 was a valid and constitutional enactment and law, and that it superseded and repealed, the provisions of the Revised Statutes regulating the subject; whereas it is averred and insisted by the defendant that the provisions of the said chapter 532, in so far as they relate to the city of Albany and the county of Albany, are obnoxious to and in contravention of the requirements of the constitution of the state of New York, which forbids the passage by the legislature of a private or local bill for selecting, drawing, summoning or impanneling grand jurors, and that the said chapter 532 was not reported to the legislature by any commissioner or commissioners who had been appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes; by reason of the premises the said defendant has been deprived of the benefit and advantage of the superior care and discrimination required and theretofore used in selecting grand jurors, owing to the limited number of persons permitted by the wisdom of the legislature to be selected, and from which persons shall have been drawn to act as grand jurors in the consideration of his case; and that the result of said unconstitutional law compels the selection of grand jurors, and the grand jurors who found said indictment were selected from an ill-assorted, indifferently collected list of names, many being incompetent, exceeding in number 2,500, and being the petit jurors\u2019 list, and none of said grand jurors so drawn and hereinbefore specifically named were the same, but were wholly and entirely different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>persons from the persons who should have been drawn pursuant to the provisions of the Bevised Statutes aforesaid, whereby he has been deprived of his constitutional rights in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">And this the said J ohn Petrea is ready to verify.

The grand jury which found and presented the indictment herein, :and the petit jury which tried the case were organized under and by virtue of chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881. The claim made by the defendant, as his plea and objections show, is that the act in question', so far as it affects the city and county of Albany, is in conflict with the constitution, as amended November 3, 1874. Article 3 of section 18 of the constitution provides: \u201c The legislature shall not pass a private or local bill in any of the following cases: * * vr Selecting, drawing, summoning or impanneling grand or petit jurors. \u201d This provision is qualified by section 25 of the same article, which provides: \u201cSections 17 and 18 of this .article shall not apply to any bill, or the amendments to any bill, which shall be reported to the legislature by commissioners who have been appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes.\u201d 1. Reference to the statutes will show that there have been no such offices or officers as \u201c commissioners who have been appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes \u201d subsequent to May 1, 1878, and, therefore, said chapter 532 oould not have been reported as provided for in said section 25. The statutes relating to the subject are as follows : Chap. 33, Laws of 1870 ; chap. 467, Laws of 1873 ; also Id., p. 1007; chap. 212, Laws of 1874; chap. 520, Laws of 1875; Laws of 1877, p. 141. Laws of 1876 (1 <em>S. L., pp. </em>176, 177) contained this provision: \"The term of office of the said commissioners is hereby extended to the first day of May, in the year eighteen hundred and seventy-eight.\u201d 2. Prior to the passage of chapter 532, Laws of 1881, aforesaid, the Code of Civil Procedure nowhere made provision for the drawing, summoning or impanneling of grand jurors for Albany county; ;the Revised Statutes provided the method as follows: \u201cSection 1. The .\u25a0supervisors of the several counties of\" this state, except the city and (County of New York, at their annual meetings in each year, shall prepare ia\u00a1list of the names of three hundred persons to serve as grand jurors at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the courts of oyer and terminer and courts of sessions to be bold in their respective counties during the then ensuing year, and until new lists shall be returned \u201d (3 <em>R. S. </em>[6th <em>ed.], </em>1015 ; 3 <em>R. S. </em>[7th <em>ed.], </em>2558). (The foregoing section is taken from article first, entitled \u201cOf the return and summoning of grand juries, their powers and duties.\u201d) 3. Said chapter 532 is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b169-5\">Chapter 532.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\">An Act to amend section one thousand and forty-one of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-8\">\u201c Section 1. Section one thousand and forty-one of the Code of Civil Procedure is hereby amended so as to read as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-9\">Sec. 1Q41. Each ward of the city of Utica is considered a town for the purpose of this article; and the supervisor and assessor of that ward must execute the duties of the supervisor; town clerk and assessors of a town, as prescribed in the foregoing sections of this article, except that a duplicate of the list of jurors made by them must be filed in the office of the clerk of the city. In the city of Albany the recorder of said city shall perform the duties imposed by this title upon the supervisor, town clerk and assessors of towns. In Albany county, grand jurors shall hereafter be drawn from the box containing the names of petit jurors selected for said county in the same manner as petit jurors, and thereafter no separate list of grand jurors shall be prepared for said county. In each of the other cities of the state the like duties must be performed by the officers, and in the manner prescribed by law. A city, wherein two or more assessors are elected for the entire city, is considered a town for the purposes of this article, except where the officers who are to perform the duties of the supervisor, town clerk or assessor, as prescribed in this article, are specially designated by law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-10\">4. The following gives the section as it was prior to the foregoing amendment:</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-11\">Rule in Cities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-12\">\u201c Sec. 1041. Each ward of the city of Albany or Utica is considered a town for the purposes of this article; and the supervisor and assessor of that ward must execute the duties of the supervisor, town clerk and assessors of a town, as prescribed in the foregoing sections of this article; except that a duplicate of the list of jurors made by them must be filed in the office of the clerk of the city. In each of the other cities of the state, the like duties must be performed by the officers and in the manner prescribed by law. A city wherein two or more assessors are elected for the entire city, is considered a town for the purposes of this article, except where the officers who are to perform the duties of the supervisor, town clerk or assessor, as prescribed in this article, are specially designated by law,\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-13\">(Article second, from which the foregoing is taken, relates to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>jurors alone.) The ten hundred and forty-first section, read in connection with the ten hundred and thirty-fifth section, gives the method of selecting petit jurors, anterior to alleged amendment of section 1041. \u201cSection 1035. The supervisor, town clerk, and assessors of each town, must meet on the first Monday of July, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, and in each third year thereafter, at a place within the town, appointed by the supervisor ; or in case of his absence or of a vacancy in his office, by the town clerk, for the purpose of making a list of persons to serve as trial jurors for the then ensuing three years. If they fail to meet on the day specified in this section, they must meet as soon thereafter as practicable.\" 5. The sweeping change proposed to be made may be thus seen at a glance ; it attempts completely to revolutionize the existing system. It provides that the grand jurors in Albany county shall be drawn from the petit jurors' box, and the names of proposed petit jurors, so far as Albany city is concerned, are to be selected, not as theretofore by the seventeen supervisors, but by the recorder of the city of Albany. And this change is purely local, being limited to the city of Albany.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-5\">II. The amendments to the third article of the constitution, ratified in 1874, were the product of the constitutional commission appointed by Gov. Hoffman in 1872. The state had just emerged from a period of special and pernicious local legislation, and our people demanded restrictive measures. It was in obedience to the popular opposition to the vice of local laws solemnly enacted for every square mile of territory in the state, as special emergencies arose, that the article in question was formed. The committee of the commission who formulated said article, consisted of Messrs. E. Brooks, F. Kernan, H. V. Howland and C. L. Tracy. (As reported by them it did not contain the twenty-fifth section.) The reasons of the commission for its adoption, as stated by the committee, are to be found in journal of constitutional commission of 1872 and 1873, page 304. The journal of the commission also shows that the twenty-fifth section was. afterwards added by the revision committee. <em>(Page </em>455.) At that time' Code commissioners were at work, resulting in the adoption, in 1876;-, of the first thirteen chapters of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the remaining nine chapters in 1880, and afterwards the Code of Criminal Procedure. The amendments aforementioned, recommended by the constitutional commission, were adopted by the legislature of 1873 <em>(Session Laws, p. </em>1401) and of 1874 <em>(Session Laws, p. </em>927), and ratified by the people in November, 1874. The value of the full report of the com mittee above given, stating their reasons at length why the article in question was proposed for adoption as .part of the organic law of the state, is understood when the opinions of eminent jurists in expounding constitutional law are studied. Walworth, Ch., says: \u201cOne mode of construing this section is, to take the constitution as we find? it,, without reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the manner in Which its different parts were proposed and adopted; and another is, to look at the proceedings of the convention and endeavor thereby to discover the probable intention of the framers of the constitution as we now find it \u201d <em>(Clark </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>26 <em>Wend., </em>602). Bronson, J., referring to the debates of a constitutional convention, said: \u201cWe have here the most unequivocal proof \u2014 evidence which no man can fail to see, wink as hard as he will \u2014 that the framers of the constitution meaiit precisely what they said\u201d <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Purdy, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>37; <em>Cooley's Const. Lim. [4th ed.], </em>80). Although the rule contended for by the defendants may occasion inconvenience, it will make no difference. \u201c It is highly probable that inconveniences will result from following the constitution as it is written. But that consideration can have no weight with me. It is not for us, but for those who made the instrument, to supply its defects\u201d (Bronson, <em>J., Oakley </em>agt. <em>Aspinwall, </em>3 N. <em>Y., </em>568; <em>Story on Const., sec. </em>407; <em>The People </em>agt. <em>Morrell, </em>21 <em>Wend., </em>563).</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">III. It is submitted that, so far as Albany is concerned, chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881 is a local bill, and therefore falls within the constitutional inhibition, as it attempts specially to provide for the selecting and drawing of grand and petit jurors for this particular locality <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Hoffman, </em>60 <em>How. Pr., </em>324; <em>affirmed, </em>24 <em>Hun, </em>142; <em>Wenzler </em>agt. <em>People, </em>58 <em>N. Y., </em>525; <em>Kerrigan </em>agt. <em>Force, </em>68 <em>N. Y., </em>383; <em>Sedg. on St. and Const. Law [Pomeroy\u2019s Ed.], </em>529 <em>n). </em>(1.) If the title of chapter 432 run thus: \u201cAn act in relation to grand and petit jurors in the city and county of Albany,\u201d would a claim be made that it was not a local act within the intent and prohibition of the constitution? Does it alter the effect by mixing these local regulations in an amendment to a general act? Clearly not. It is a plain case of attempted evasion of the constitution, which the courts will not tolerate. The court of appeals formulates the rule as follows: \u201cA thing, within the intent of a constitutional enactment, is, for all purposes, to be regarded as within the words and terms of the constitution, and a legislative enactment, evading the terms and frustrating the general and clearly-expressed or necessarily-implied purposes of the constitution is as clearly void as if in express terms forbidden\u201d (T<em>he People </em>agt. <em>Albertson, </em>55 <em>N. Y., </em>50; <em>Matter of N. Y. Elevated R. R. Co., </em>70 N. <em>Y., </em>349; <em>Taylor </em>agt. <em>Com'rs, </em>23 <em>Ohio </em>[N. <em>S.], </em>22; <em>Belleville R. R. Co. </em>agt. <em>Gregory, </em>15 <em>Ill., </em>20; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Allen, </em>42 N. <em>Y., </em>404; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Herman, </em>15 <em>Cent. L. J. [Mo.], </em>129; <em>see </em>14 <em>Reporter, </em>339). Because the act is in the form of an amendment to a general act. or Code, the constitutional objection is not thereby obviated. \u201c It is contended that the Traylor act is but an amendment to the Political Code; that the Political Code contains a general law upon the subject to which the Traylor acts relates and that by this sort of tacking the latter act is converted into a general law. We cannot appreciate the logic or force of the argument. The question is, had the legislature the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>power to pass the act under consideration? * * * If it is a special or local law, then it comes directly within the inhibition of the constitution and never had any validity, for the legislature had no power to enact it. We do not understand how any law can be amended by a void act \u201d <em>(Earl </em>agt. <em>San Francisco B\u2019d of Ed., </em>55 <em>Cal., </em>492). If it is competent to regulate good jurors in Albany county in this way, what is there to prevent sixty-four other local laws, one for evciy other county in the state, dissimilar to each other, and producing by the variety of enactments, the same ignorance of this important subject as now prevails in reference to the law in general of our sister states. Grand jurors being county officers, to require a general law on the subject, necessarily implies one covering the state at large. In no other manner could the provision have effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-5\">IV. No commissioners \u201cwho have been appointed pursuant to law to \u25a0 revise the statutes,\u201d having reported to the legislature said chapter 583, it does not fall within the exception made by the fundamental law. 1. The \u2022language of the exception is plain. To hold that the legislature may amend at will a Code reported by commissioners, would compel a trans.position of sentences of the section in question, and instead of, as it now reads, \u201c shall not apply to any bill or the amendment to any bill which shall be reported,\u201d &amp;c., it would run, \u201c shall not apply to any bill which shall be reported, &amp;c., or the amendments to any such bill.\u201d Such a construction would he a practical nullification of the restrictions in the constitution and open the door to special legislation, without limit and on any subject. 3. The district attorney, in the court below, conceding that section 104L \u201cwas a local act,\u201d inquired, with apparent amazement, \u201cis the amendment to that local act unconstitutional ? Must all amendments to any local act or law contained in the Code he reported by commissioners appointed to revise the statutes? \u201d We answer, in the language of the constitution, that \"the legislature shall not pass a private or local bill for selecting grand or petit jurors, except or unless such bill shall have been reported by the commissioners,\u201d &amp;c. Thus saith the fundamental law. Does it mean what it says? The prohibition is general. The legislature shall not pass a (any) private or local hill on that subject. A bill is strictly a draft of an act of the legislature before it becomes a law; a proposed or projected law (1 <em>Burrill\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>204). The word is frequently used in this sense in the constitution <em>(See secs. </em>13, 14, 15 <em>and </em>16 <em>of art. </em>3, <em>and sec. </em>9 <em>of art. </em>4). It is expressly provided that \u201c no law shall be enacted except by bill\u201d <em>(Secs. </em>14, <em>art. </em>3). There are other instances, however, where the word is used as a synonym for act or law <em>(See sec. </em>12, <em>art. </em>7). And it is manifestly used in both of those senses in section 35 of article 3, as we shall have occasion to show hereafter. In section 18, however, of the same article, the words \"bill\u201d and, \"law\u201d are each used in their strict grammatical sense\u2014the word \u201c bill \u201d in speaking of proposed laws, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>and the word \u201claw\u201d in referring to bills passed or adopted, or to be adopted by the legislature. \u201c The legislature shall not pass a private or local bill in any of the following cases (specifying them), but the legislature shall pass general laws providing for these cases,\u201d &amp;c. <em>(Sec. </em>18). The prohibition, then, contained in section 18 is absolute and universal. It extends to any and all cases of proposed laws, private or local, for any of the purposes specified. All legislation, either to create a new law or to amend an old one, is interdicted, except by bill; and then follows the provision that no private or local \u201c bill \u201d shall be passed for selecting jurors, which is tantamount to saying that there shall be no legislation on that subject of a private or local character. The prohibition, therefore, necessarily includes proposed amendments to old laws as well as projected new laws. This result ought not to surprise the district attorney, because this precise answer has been given to the same question in analogous cases by the highest judicial authority. Section 16 of the same article of the constitution provides that \u201c no private or local bill * * * shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.\u201d And it has been repeatedly held that this prohibition extends to amendments of private or local laws <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Hills, </em>35 N. <em>Y., </em>449; <em>People </em>agt. <em>O'Brien, </em>38 N. Y., 193). The act in question then, as an amendment of a local law, clearly falls within the constitutional prohibition, unless it is saved by the exception created by section 25. But that section merely excepts from the general prohibition \u201cany bill, or the amendments to any bill, which shall be reported to the legislature by commissioners who have been appointed to revise the statutes.\u201d It is an undisputable fact that this act was not so reported, and hence does not come within the terms of this saving clause. Nor is it possible to construe the language of this exception so as to reach any other conclusion. Nothing is saved, if private or local, no matter what it may be called, a bill, an act, a law or an amendment to a bill, act or law, unless reported to the legislature by the commissioners. But as some stress may be laid upon the use of the words \u201c amendment to any bill,\u201d in the exception, it may be well to pause a moment on this aspect of the question. It has been suggested that the insertion of these words in section 25, and their omission in section. 18, justifies the inference that the prohibition in the latter section was not intended to include amendments to-local laws. It is a sufficient answer to this criticism that section 25 was not limited in its operation as an exception to the prohibition contained in section 18. It was also intended to qualify the provisions of section 17 on another subject, and the language of -the exception was therefore adapted to the provisions of both of the previous sections to which it is equally applied. But if this were otherwise, and section 25 were designed merely to limit the effect of section 18, it would not sustain the conclusion thus sought to be deduced. An exception cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>well be more comprehensive in meaning than the rule it is designed to qualify, and hence the insertion of this clause in the exception proves that it was deemed necessary in order to limit the operation or effect of the previous prohibition. Besides, the sovereign people who adopted these new constitutional provisions will be presumed to have been familiar with the prior provisions contained in section 16, and with the judicial construction which had been given to the phrase \u201cprivate or local bill \u201d in that section, as already stated. And it will also be presumed that the same words were afterwards used to convey the same ' meaning in section 18. Nor would it follow from this view that the legislature must adopt, <em>verbatim, </em>the bill or amendment as reported by the commissioners. A reasonable construction must be given to the language used to give effect, not to defeat, the intention of the framers of the constitution. The evident policy and object of the provision was,; .that private or local bills, including amendments to local laws, should originate with and be reported by a legal commissioner, and that such bills in all their essential features, should be ratified or rejected by the legislature. But while accepting the bill thus proposed in its general scope and purpose, the legislature would doubtless have the power to change the phraseology or to rearrange the details of the measure according to its own views of policy and propriety. Indeed, the only limit to the exercise of the legislative discretion, in this respect, would be that the bill thus modified in the course of its passage, must not be shorn of its distinguishing characteristics as originally reported by the commission. This view is strengthened by the provisions of section 17 of article 1 of the constitution, as originally adopted in 1846, and the practical construction! given this language by the legislature and the courts down to the present time. \u201c The legislature, at its first session after the adoption of this constitution, shall appoint three commissioners whose duty it shall be to reduce, into a written and systematic Code, the whole body of the law of this State, or so much and such parts thereof, as to the said commissioners shall seem practicable and expedient. And the said commissioners shall specify such alterations and amendments therein, as they shall deem proper, and they shall at all times make reports of their proceedings to the legislature,\u201d etc. <em>(Art </em>1, <em>sec. </em>17). Under those provisions the commissisners reported to the legislature, from time to time, political, civil and criminal codes of the whole body of the law, as well as of civil and criminal practice in the courts, none of which were ever adopted by the legislature, except the old Code of Procedure, which was subjected to many alterations and amendments in the course of its passage. Nor is it true that this peremptory prohibition, properly enforced, would render all existing local laws on the subject specified \u201cfixed, unalterable, irrepealable.\u201d The design, doubtless, was to prevent further local legislation on these subjects, and to Compel the adoption of general laws for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the governance of cases not provided for by the local laws then in force. Whenever an existing local law needed amendment to make it effectual, the new policy of \"the constitution, as expressed in section 18, article 3, requires not the passage of a new local bill or amendment, but the repeal of the old law and the enactment of a general law providing for the emergency. But even if all the practical results suggested by the district attorney in the court below were the necessary outcome of this construction of the constitution, they could not properly affect or change the necessary conclusion. The language of the prohibitory clause is clear definite and peremptory. In such a case it is the imperative duty of the legislature to obey the constitutional mandate, and if the legislature fails in this respect, the courts must not hesitate to recognize and enforce the paramount law <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Albertson, </em>55 <em>N. Y., </em>50). Finally, if the legislature is hampered by these restrictions, the district attorney, in an argument on this subject, made before the Albany oyer and terminer, entertained (and no doubt still has) distressing fears of the failure of parliamentary government. But he should remember that this, after all, is a republican, not a parliamentary government. The legislature with us, is not omnipotent, but subject to all the limitations imposed by the constitution. In the language of the commission which proposed these provisions as they are now incorporated in the fundamental law, \u201cthe experience of the legislature and the judgment of the people have for many years demonstrated the necessity of less local legislation, and the wisdetn, whenever it is possible, of requiring general laws to take the place of special acts,\u201d and no better evidence can be given of the wisdom and justice of the construction of these provisions for which we contend, than the complaints of the district attorney concerning the practical results which must be anticipated. As these results are in harmony with the policy which led to the adoption of these provisions, they afford the most conclusive reason why they should be strictly and rigorously enforced. 3. The ten hundred and forty-first section of the Code, attempted to be amended by chapter 532 aforesaid, contained no reference to grand jurors prior thereto. It related to trial jurors only. If new matter so entirely incongruous to the original text can be thus injected, why will not the Code of Civil Procedure be the happy medium through which every scheme, venture, enterprise, speculation and obnoxious measure, forbidden by the constitution, be carried to a successful and triumphant legislative success and conclusion. Let us examine, for a moment, the extraordinary things in store for the people of the state, unless the defendant\u2019s theory is sustained. First. The Code might be amended so as to change the names of persons. Second. Or with reference to roads, or draining swamps, in particular localities. Third. Or locating or changing a county seat. Fourth. Or to incorporate a village. Fifth. Or to regulate the method of finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>and drawing indictments, and the course of criminal procedure, including change of venue, in the city and county of Albany. Or any of the other acts .forbidden by the section in question, and everyone of these would be just as germane to the Code as the attempt to incorporate a part of the criminal procedure relating to grand jurors in the Code of Civil Procedure. A contrary construction will carry joy to the hearts of the legislative jobbers, who thereby will be able to ply their vocations in the above enumerated cases, and which we have good evidence were intended to be forbidden by the constitution. Why should there be different rules for each separate county; are we not a homogeneous people ? Does Albany require different methods from those that answer the wants of the adjoining counties of Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady or Schoharie ? If the sensational comments of the district-attorney in the court below have any foundation, the county of Albany should be governed by some sultan or potentate appointed by some friendly and not so wicked a power as prevails in Albany county. Experience teaches that the elements which can elect every one of seventeen supervisors of the city, may readily capture a nomination and elect a recorder, and then, according to the district attorney, as expressed in the court below, the end comes. 4. The courts will not construe the constitution so as to thwart its evident intent and purpose (9 <em>Wheat., </em>81); or suffer it to be eluded <em>(People </em>agt <em>Utica Ins. Co., </em>15 <em>Johns., </em>358). The phraseology of the section proves that the intention of the constitution was to close the doors; it devitalized and rendered nugatory the enacting prohibitory clauses only as the result and effect of the report of commissioners who had been appointed, thereby expressly rejecting the idea of future commissioners, presumptively from an assured confidence in the integrity and ability of the commissioners then serving. \u201c In interpreting clauses we must presume the words have been employed in their natural and ordinary meaning. Says Marshall, Ch. J. ; 1 The framers of the constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense, and to have understood what they meant \u2019 \u201d <em>(Cooley's Const. Lim. [4th </em>ed.], 72). \u201c The objection of construction, as applied to a written constitution, is to give effect to the intent of the people in adopting it. In the case of all written laws, it is the intent of the law giver chat is to be enforced \u201d <em>(Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., </em>68). It was competent for the Code commissioners to report a bill or an amendment thereto, and in fact they have frequently done so. The word \"which\u201d must be understood to relate to that which precedes it, and to cover both propositions, the bill and the amendments to any bill. The office of a proviso, generally, is either to except something from the enacting clause, to restrain its generality or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation of it, as extending to cases not intended to. be brought within its purview <em>(Minnis </em>agt. <em>U. S., </em>15 <em>Peters, </em>423 ; <em>Wyman </em>agt. <em>Southard, </em>10 <em>Wheat., </em>1, 30). A proviso in a statute is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>strictly construed ; it takes no case out of the enacting clause which is not fairly within the terms of the proviso (U. <em>S. </em>agt. <em>Dickson, </em>15 <em>Peters., </em>141 ; <em>Potter\u2019s Dwarris Stat., </em>118, <em>n. </em>11). 5. The rules of interpretation and construction are the same with reference to written agreements, statutes or constitutions. These rules afford a safe guide in ascertaining the constitutional intent as to the section under discussion. Remembering the language of the section, it is submitted that <em>Coxson </em>agt. <em>Doland </em>(2 <em>Daly, </em>66), decides the controverted proposition. It holds that \u201cthe grammatical rule, which is also the legal rule in construing statutes, is, that when general words occur at the end of a sentence they refer to and qualify the whole, while if they are in the middle of a sen fence, and sensibly apply to a particular branch of it, they are not to be extended to that which follows.\u201d Judge Miller, in <em>Lambert </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(76 <em>N. Y., </em>225 et <em>seq.), </em>discusses the question as to the effect to general words at the end of an affidavit, and approves of the rule laid down in <em>Coxson </em>agt. <em>Doland (see, also, Van Noy </em>agt. <em>Failing, </em>7 <em>N. Y. Weekly Digest, </em>485 ; <em>The King </em>agt. <em>Inhabitants of Shifton, </em>8 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress., </em>94), where the principle is applied. In section 25, the general words are at the end of the sentence, and within these authorities must be held as relating to all that precedes it, and consequently the general words \u201c which shall be reported,\u201d &amp;c., include \u201c any bill, or the amendments to any bill.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">V. Independent of the statute terminating the term of office of the commissioners to revise the statutes, the fact is that chapter 583 in question was introduced without the agency or knowledge of anyone who ever had been appointed a commissioner to revise the statutes. Some rules of evidence on the subject are material. 1. The burden rests upon those who sustain this law to prove it to be constitutional. It must be shown that the constitutional prerequisites were complied with <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Commissioners, </em>54 <em>N. Y., </em>276). 2. It is competent to use the journals of either house to impeach a law apparently invalid. They may be resorted to in ascertaining whether an act was passed by a two-thirds vote <em>(Purdy </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>4 <em>Hill, </em>384, <em>per </em>Paige <em>and </em>Franklin, <em>Senators; De Bor </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>14). <em>The People </em>agt. <em>Devlin </em>(33 <em>N. Y., </em>269), holds that it is not competent to show, after a bill has been passed by both houses and sent to the governor, that one of the houses passed a resolution recalling the bill; but Potter, J., says <em>(p. </em>270): \u201c Whenever any act or proceeding of such a body becomes necessary to be shown as evidence, such journals may be received <em>(Berry </em>agt. <em>Baltimore Railroad Company, </em>41 <em>Md., </em>446). \u201c Each house keeps a journal of its proceedings, which is a public record, and of which the courts are at liberty to take judicial notice. If it should appear from these journals that any act did not receive the requisite majority, or that in respect to it the legislature did not follow the requirements of the constitution, or that in any other respect the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>was not constitutionally adopted, the courts may act upon this evidence, and adjudge the statute void \u201d <em>(Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. [4th ed.], </em>164, <em>citing numerous cases; see, also, Brady </em>agt. <em>West, </em>50 <em>Miss., </em>68; <em>Bradley </em>agt. <em>West, </em>60 <em>Mo., </em>33; <em>The Elevated Railroad Cases, </em>3 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>372; <em>Town of Ottawa </em>agt. <em>Perkins, </em>94 <em>U. S., </em>260; <em>see </em>13 <em>Federal Rep., </em>238, 728).</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-5\">VI. The organization of the grand jury which found this indictment cannot be upheld upon the theory that the act of the recorder in selecting the jurors from which the jury was drawn, was that of a <em>defacto </em>officer. The legal principle that the acts of a <em>defacto </em>officer cannot be questioned collaterally, has no application to the case. 1. The recorder was a <em>defacto </em>and a <em>de jure </em>officer. No one questioned his right to occupy that office, and there was and is no contest as to his title. In all the cases that the principle contended for by the people has been invoiced there existed a dispute as to which one of two or more claimants was the <em>de jure </em>officer. Here an effort is made to transfer by statute a part of the duties of existing officials, county officers, the supervisors, to another existing official, a city officer, the recorder. We object to this transfer of official duties, not to Mr. G-ould\u2019s title to the office of recorder. Our contention, therefore, is, that the recorder is assuming to act, in selecting grand jurors, under a law which, being unconstitutional, affords no cover or protection for such acts, and they are simply void. Like the case of <em>Kelly </em>agt. <em>Bemis </em>(4 <em>Gray, </em>83), a justice of the peace issued a warrant for the arrest of a person under a law afterwards held to be unconstitutional. An action for false imprisonment against the justice was sustained, the court saying: \u201cUnder a government of limited and defined powers, where, by the provisions of the organic law, the rights and duties of the several departments of the government are carefully distributed and restricted, if any one of them exceeds the limits of its constitutional power, it acts wholly without authority itself, and can confer no authority upon others. The defendant could derive no power or jurisdiction from a void statute \u201d <em>(Barker </em>agt. <em>Stetson, </em>7 <em>Gray, </em>54; <em>Gross </em>agt. <em>Rice, </em>71 <em>Me., </em>241). These and other authorities make apparent the distinction broad and \"clear between the claim for an office and a claim to discharge additional functions created by an unconstitutional law <em>(Thompson &amp; Merriam on Juries, sec. </em>138; <em>Robinson\u2019s Elem. Law, sec. </em>359). It is submitted that the law is settled in our state, that where one acts as an officer under a commission issued without authority, or under an unconstitutional law, no one is bound and no one is protected under it <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Blake, </em>49 <em>Barb., </em>9; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Albertson, </em>8 <em>How. Pr., </em>363; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Carter, </em>29 <em>Barb., </em>208; <em>Williams </em>agt. <em>Garrett, </em>12 <em>How. Pr., </em>456; <em>Hamlim </em>agt. <em>Dingman, </em>5 <em>Laws., </em>64; <em>See People </em>agt. <em>Kelsey, </em>34 <em>Cal., </em>475). 2. Judge Cooley say\u00e1: \u201c When a statute is adjudged to be unconstitutional, it is as if it had never been. Rights cannot be built up under it; contracts which depend upon it for their consideration are void; it constitutes a protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>to no one who has acted under it, and no one can be punished for having refused obedience to it before the decision was made. And what is true of an act void <em>in toto, </em>is true also as to any part of an act which is found to be unconstitutional, and which, consequently, is to be regarded as having never at any time been possessed of any legal force \u201d <em>(Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., </em>227). 3. <em>Carpenter </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(64 <em>N. Y., </em>483) does not apply to the case at bar. There the prisoner claimed that one Douglas Taylor was the rightful commissioner of jurors of New York county, but that one Thomas Dunlap, claiming to act as such commissioner under an appointment from the mayor, actually selected the jury. Dunlap was, therefore, claiming title to an office, and his title thereto was disputed. The court says \u201c he was, therefore, a <em>de facto </em>officer. \u201d But no one disputes the right of recorder Gould to his office. His title thereto is perfect. He assumes, however, as in the case of <em>Kelly </em>agt. <em>Bemis </em>(4 <em>Gray, </em>83), to act under a law which is invalid, and to such unlawful action we object. In other words, the question is not whether he had a right to act as recorder, but whether any recorder had a right to so act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-4\">VII. Plainly the act of the recorder in designating the names of the persons from whom grand and petit jurors are to be drawn is a selection within the constitutional provision. 1. Chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881, the one in question, declares the act of the recorder to be a selection, for the word \u201cselected\u201d is used. The grand jury are to be drawn-from the box containing the names of petit jurors selected for the county. And who selects for the city of Albany? The recorder. 2. The constitution follows the order prescribed in and by the Revised Statutes and. the logical arrangement of the text-books: First, \"selecting;\u201d second, \u201cdrawing;\u201d third, \u201csummoning;\u201d fourth, \u201cimpanneling\u201d <em>(Article </em>3, <em>section </em>18). The first step is provided for in the Revised Statutes in this wise: \u201cInpreparing such lists\u201d (of grand jurors) \u201cthe said board of supervisors shall select such persons only as they know, or have good reason to believe, are possessed of the qualifications by law required of persons to serve as jurors for the trial of issues of fact, and are of approved integrity, fair character, sound judgment and well informed (3 <em>R. S. </em>[7th ed.], 2558, <em>sec. </em>3). Section 10 <em>(Id.) </em>provides for the drawing by the county clerk in presence, etc. Section 12 <em>(Id.) </em>provides for summoning, etc. Chapters 4 and 5 of <em>Proffatt on Jury Trials (secs. </em>114, 145) arranges the methods in the same manner as the constitution \u2014\u201c selected,\u201d \u201c drawing,\u201d \u201csummoning,\u201d \u201cimpanneling.\u201d He says: \u201c But according to the system in some of the states, as, for instance, in the state of New York, they\u201d (the grand jurors; \" are selected from the body of the county by the board of supervisors, and separate ballots containing their names are placed in a box kept by the clerk of the county, from which the requisite number are drawn by lot to form the jury\u201d <em>(Sec. </em>47). These words of the consti <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>tution, prior to the adoption, thereof, as will he thus seen, had a definite and fixed meaning in law, and the courts will give the same meaning and effect to the words of a constitution as they were understood prior thereto <em>(Cooley on Const. Lim. [4th ed.], </em>64). The recorder is required to perform the duties of supervisor, town clerk and assessors. AVhat. were their duties? The Code of Civil Procedure, defining them <em>(sec. </em>1036), provides: \"At the meetings specified in the last section, the officers present must select from the last assessment-roll of the towns, and make a list of the names of all persons whom they believe to be qualified to serve as trial jurors, as prescribed in the last article.\u201d The subsequent sections provide for the drawing, summoning, &amp;c., the jurors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">VIII. Our claim is that the grand jury should have been selected under \u2022 and pursuant to the Revised Statutes, the Code provision being void; the Revised Statutes were not repealed <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Tiphaine, </em>3 <em>Park. Cr. </em>R., 241; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Clear, </em>11 Nev., 39; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Johnson, </em>11 Nev)., 148). 1. \u201c Compliance with the forms and mode pointed out by statute for summoning a grand jury is necessary; any omission or violation of the mode will be sufficient to justify tile quashing of the indictment \u201d <em>(Proffatt on Jury Trial, sec. </em>46; <em>McQuillen </em>agt. <em>State, </em>8 <em>Smed. &amp; M., 587, </em>597; <em>Stokes </em>agt. <em>State, </em>24 <em>Miss., </em>621; <em>Wash, on Cr.

The defendant has the right to raise the question of invalidity of the law, and he has taken every step essential to be entitled to a hearing thereon. 1. He filed a plea in abatement and moved to quash, and also set aside the indictments. Objection was duly taken to the petit jury. 2. The ancient statute, 11 Henry IV, chapter 9 (and which; so far as applicable, became part of our common law, 1 <em>Kent Corn., </em>473), secured the right to object to an indictment in these words: \u201cThat from henceforth no indictment be made by any such persons but by inquest of the king\u2019s lawful liege people, in the manner as was used in the time of his noble progenitors, returned by the sheriffs or bailiffs of franchises, without any denomination to the sheriffs or bailiffs of franchises before made by any person of the names which by him should be impanneled, except it be by the officers of said sheriffs or bailiffs of franchises, sworn and known to make the same, and other officers to whom it pertaineth to make the same, according to the law of England. And if any indictment be made hereafter in any point to the contrary, that the same indictment be also void, revoked, and forever holden for none\u201d (2 <em>Hale P. C., </em>355 ; 16 <em>Am. Law Review, </em>219). The statute prescribed no formula, and the courts have recognized various ways of reaching and remedying any objections to the grand inquest. 3. The ordinary method of objecting to a grand jury is by plea in abatement (1 <em>Bish. Crim. Pro., sec. </em>748; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Green</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>wood, </em>5 <em>Porter, </em>474; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Leaben, </em>4 <em>Dev., </em>305; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Freeman, </em>6 <em>Blackf, </em>248; <em>Barney </em>agt. <em>State, </em>12 <em>Smed. &amp; Marsh., </em>68; <em>see subd. </em>8, <em>this point). </em>4. And a motion to quash the indictment (1 <em>Bish. Crim. Pro., sec. </em>747). 5. The court may receive the suggestions from an <em>amicus cwim (People </em>agt. <em>Jewett, </em>3 <em>Wend., </em>314; 16 <em>Am. Law Rev., </em>221; <em>Bonlo </em>agt. <em>State, </em>51 <em>Ala., </em>19; <em>McEthannon </em>agt. <em>People, </em>92 <em>Ill., </em>369, 372). 6. Although challenges to the array of grand jurors are abolished, the court may grant relief to a defendant on special motion <em>(United States </em>agt. <em>Reed, </em>2 <em>Blatch., </em>436; <em>United States </em>agt. <em>Tallman, </em>10 <em>Blatch., </em>29; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Southwell, </em>46 <em>Cal., </em>153) It is inherent in courts to control the proceedings taken therein, and the common law established by the statute of Henry vests in our superior courts the power to do justice to defendants without reference to forms. To illustrate, take the ease provided for by section 370 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is declared therein that the dismissal of a charge by one grand jury does not prevent its being again submitted to another grand jury as often as the court may direct. But without such direction it cannot be again submitted. Suppose that, without such direction, a resubmission was made and an indictment found and presented, would there be no remedy for the defendant ? The Code, in express terms, provides none; but to prfevent the consummation of such an outrage and the defiance of the express mandate of the Code, the inherent right of the court to protect its own dignity and to control its proceedings, would be sufficient authority to right the wrong so done <em>(Baldwin </em>agt. <em>New York, </em>42 <em>Barb., </em>549; <em>McGuire </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>2 <em>Park. C. R., </em>162; <em>see </em>13 <em>Northwestern Rep., </em>477). The offense charged in the indictment is alleged to have been committed on the 3d day of August, 1881; this being anterior to the Code of Criminal Procedure going into effect, we are not in any way embarrassed by its provisions, as they apply only to cases occurring after September 1, 1881, when said Code went into effect <em>(Code of Crim. Pro., secs. </em>962, 953; <em>The People </em>agt. <em>Sessions, </em>10 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>192). Independently of this statutory reservation, the legislature could not deprive the defendant of any substantial right he had at the time of the commission of an alleged offenise <em>(Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. </em>[4th ed.] 331). The rules therefore governing pleas in abatement prior to the Code, prevail in this case. Mr. Bishop says, adopting the definition of Starkie: \u201cPleas in abatement are founded either on some defect apparent on the face of the record, or upon some matter of fact extrinsic of the record, which render it insufficient\u201d (1 <em>Bish. Crim. Pro., sec. </em>416). The proper time to interpose a plea in abatement is before plea of not guilty <em>(McQuillan </em>agt. <em>State, </em>8 <em>Smedes &amp; Marsh., </em>587; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Allen, </em>43 <em>N. Y., </em>28; <em>Ward </em>agt. <em>State, </em>48 <em>Ind., </em>289). An objection to the mode of selecting persons from whom grand jurors are to be drawn, can be taken advantage of by the defendant by a plea in abatement after indictment found <em>(Clare </em>agt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>State, </em>30 <em>Md., </em>163; <em>Stokes </em>agt. <em>State, </em>24 <em>Miss, </em>621; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Dutell, </em>49 <em>Greene, </em>125; <em>Portis </em>agt. <em>State, </em>23 <em>Miss., </em>578; <em>Elkins </em>agt. <em>State, </em>1 <em>Tex. App., </em>539; <em>Schackleford </em>agt. <em>State, </em>2 <em>Tex. App., </em>385; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Vance, </em>31 <em>La. Ann., </em>398). The incompetency of the grand jurors who find a bill is a matter which may be pleaded in abatement <em>(Nugent </em>agt. <em>State, </em>19 <em>Ala, </em>540; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Foster, </em>9 <em>Texas, </em>65; <em>Jackson </em>agt. <em>State, </em>11 <em>Texas, </em>261; <em>Rawls </em>agt. <em>State, </em>8 <em>Sm. &amp; Marsh, </em>599; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Rickey, </em>5 <em>Halst., </em>83; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Greenwood, </em>5 <em>Porter, 474, </em>483; <em>Shropshire </em>agt. <em>State, 7 Eng., </em>190; <em>Baker </em>agt. <em>State, </em>23 <em>Miss., </em>243; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Brooks, </em>9 <em>Ala., </em>10; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Wills, </em>11 <em>Humph, </em>222). \u201c Since the statute has abolished challenges to the array (2 <em>R. S., </em>724, <em>secs. </em>26, 27), it may be conceded that a plea in abatement can be interposed to an indictment setting forth that the finding of the indictment was by an illegal body\u201d (Fancher, <em>J., Stokes </em>agt. <em>People N. Y. Sup. Ct., reported </em>1 <em>Whart. Cr. Law, sec. </em>472, <em>n. c). </em>Where the petit jury have not been drawn in the mode prescribed by law, the trial, conviction and sentence are null and the prisoner stands as though he had riot been tried <em>(State </em>agt. <em>Da Rocha, </em>20 <em>La. An., </em>356; <em>U. S. </em>agt. <em>Woodruff, </em>4 <em>McLean, </em>105). 11. If the legislature pass an act-in contravention of the constitution, it would be illogical and revolutionary to sustain any other dodtrine, but that it cannot pass another act either contemporaneously or subsequently providing that one affected by the unconstitutional law cannot take advantage of it. Every one has a vested right to claim the benefit of constitutional provisions, and he must have some way of asserting his right. \u201c There is no doubt * * * that a statute which should deprive a party of all legal remedy would necessarily be void \u201d <em>(Potter's Dwarris Stat., </em>474). \u201cThe legislature may abolish courts and create new ones, and it may prescribe altogether different modes of procedure in its discretion, though it cannot lawfully, we think, in so doing, dispense with any of those substantial protections with which the existing law surrounds the person accused of crime \u201d <em>(Cooley\u2019s Const. Law </em>[4th <em>ed.], </em>331; <em>Flint River Steamboat Co. </em>agt. <em>Foster, </em>5 <em>Geo., </em>194). If, therefore, it be claimed that the proper construction of the Code of Criminal Procedure will prevent a defendant from interposing any objection to a grand jury on fundamental points, it runs clearly in conflict with the constitution. That instrument <em>(art. </em>1, sec. .2) declares that trial by jury in all cases in which it has been heretofore used, shall remain inviolate forever; also <em>(art. </em>1, <em>sec. </em>6) provides that no person shall be held to answer for a capital .or otherwise infamous crime (except in certain cases named), unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury. In criminal cases jury trials are jealously guarded. Constitutional provisions cannot be waived, for it is deemed in such cases that there are more than personal interests involved, that the rights and interests of the public are concerned <em>(Proffatt on Jury Trial, sec. </em>113). It would be incompetent for the legislature to abolish .the trial by jury, or to enact that a defendant could not in any way at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>time object to an illegal jury; or in the case of an indictment so to arrange it that an unlawful body of men could assemble and assume to act as a grand jury, perpetrating outrages by presenting unfounded indictments and then say to the persecuted parties you cannot object to this body. A body of men not constituted as the law provides is not a grand jury, and those accused of crime have the right before being placed on trial for a criminal accusation to have the benefit of presentment or indictment by a legal grand jury, as the constitution could not have intended to mean an illegally organized grand jury. \u201c The right must not be restricted by \u25a0conditions which would practically impair or render it unavailing. While it is decided to be reasonable in civil cases to require a bond for the prosecution of an appeal to a jury, or to pay costs or to prepay the jurors fees in the first instance when a jury is demanded, the same restrictions are not permitted in criminal cases. Hence a statute requiring a court upon appeal in a criminal case to impose a penalty in case of conviction in double the amount imposed by the court below, is, in that respect, unconstitutional \u201d <em>(Proffatt on Jury Trial, sec. </em>103; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Gurney, </em>37 <em>Me., </em>156; <em>Lord </em>agt. <em>State, Id., </em>177; <em>McClear </em>agt. <em>State, </em>11 <em>Neb., </em>45).</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">X. The chapter in question is a plain and clear violation of the constitution. The duty of courts in such case is well expressed by judge Smith in <em>Clark </em>agt. <em>City of Rochester </em>(24 <em>Barb., </em>466): \u201cIt is the exclusive province of the legislature to enact the laws and to pass upon all questions relating to their expediency, the time, manner and mode of their operation. It pertains to the judiciary to interpret the laws thus enacted, and to carry the same into effect. Acting in common with the legislature, under the constitution, which both are sworn alike to support, it is our duty to bring all laws, when called upon in due form to enforce them, to the touchstone of the constitution, and to pronounce against the validity of all acts clearly in conflict with the fundamental law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">XI. The judgment of conviction should be reversed, and as the indictment is fatally defective, the defendant should be discharged <em>(Sauser </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>8 <em>Hun, </em>302-305).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-7\">D. <em>Cady Herrick, </em>district-attorney, for the people.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-8\">I. The conviction should not be reversed for refusal to quash indictment. The general rule being that an indictment charging the higher crimes will not be thus summarily disposed of <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Walters, </em>5 <em>Parker, </em>661).</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-9\">II. The paper filed containing the objection to the grand jury did not constitute a plea to the indictment <em>(Cox </em>agt. <em>People, </em>80 <em>N. Y., </em>500, 510). As to challenges to grand jurors, see 3 Revised Statutes <em>(6th ed.), </em>1018, sections 27, 28; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Harriott </em>(3 <em>Parker, </em>112).</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-10\">III. The manner in which the jurors were selected is something to which the defendant can take no exception, as he has no interest in it. <em>(Friery </em>agt. <em>People, </em>2 <em>Keyes, </em>425; 2 <em>Abb. Ct. of App., </em>229).</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>IV. It is sufficient to maintain the authority of the grand jury to investigate criminal charges and find indictments valid in their nature that the body acted under color of lawful authority. Irregularities do not affect it <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Dolan, </em>6 <em>Hun, </em>232; 6 <em>Id., </em>493; 64 <em>N.

The Code of Criminal Procedure expressly prohibits challenge to the array <em>(Sec. </em>238). The Code was <em>intended to </em>simplify the law and reduce it to a complete and harmonious whole <em>(Hickman </em>agt. <em>Pinkney, </em>81 <em>N. Y., </em>211, 215; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Brooklyn, </em>69 <em>N. Y., </em>605).</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">VI. The challenge to the petit jury was properly overruled <em>(Wharton\u2019s Pl. &amp; Pr., sec. </em>607; <em>Proffatt on Jury Trial, sec. </em>149; <em>Pringle </em>agt. <em>Huse, </em>1 <em>Cow., </em>436, <em>n.; Gardner </em>agt. <em>Turner, </em>9 <em>Johns., </em>261).</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\">VII. The only law enacted by a legislature that cannot be amended or repealed is one that embodies a contract (5 <em>McLean, </em>161; 28 <em>Ind., </em>364; 23 <em>Ind., </em>150; 14 <em>Wis., </em>623).</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-8\">VIII. Hitherto the argument has proceeded upon the assumption that the act in question was not reported by commissioners to revise the statutes. Is it clear to the court that the act must have been so reported to make it constitutional? If the court is in any doubt it must uphold the law. Nothing but a clear violation of the constitution will justify the \u25a0court in overriding the legislative will <em>(C. C. R. Co. </em>agt. <em>Twenty-third St. R. R. Co., </em>54 <em>How., </em>180; <em>Matter of N. Y. El. R. R., </em>2 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>413). .Every presumption is in favor of the validity of legislative enactments. 'They are presumed to be passed in accordance with the constitution (70 <em>N. Y., </em>356), and every intendment and presumption is in favor of the rconstitutionality of legislative enactments (9 <em>Hun, </em>190; 54 <em>How., </em>180; 17 N. <em>Y. </em>549; 3 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>413; 70 <em>N. Y., </em>342). We know that in 1877, 11880 and 1881, Codes reported by commissioners to revise the statutes \u2019Were enacted into laws. The laws of 1847 <em>(p. </em>66) provides the first commissioners, and for filling vacancies. The presumption then is, that if the law required them to report the amendment in question before the 'legislature could lawfully enact it into a law, that they did so report it, - or the legislature would not have passed it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-9\">IX. Proof cannot be given to show that the act or amendment in questtion was not reported by commissioners (33 <em>N. Y., </em>279, 283; 70 <em>N. </em>Y., 351).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b184-10\">Learned, <em>P. </em>J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZa\">The prisoner was indicted September 19, 1881. When arraigned he filed a plea setting forth certain talleged defects in the forming of the grand jury which .\u25a0indicted him. The district attorney filed a replication and the (prisoner a rejoinder. The prisoner offered to prove certain \u00bffacts set up in his plea. The court excluded the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and, on the motion of the district attorney, overruled the rest of the plea. Thereupon the defendant demanded a trial and pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Ho such plea as that offered by the defendant is now allowed <em>(Code Crim. Pro., secs. </em>273, 332). And a plea must be oral <em>(Sec. </em>333). It was proper, therefore, to require the prisoner to plead one of the three pleas authorized by section 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The prisoner, upon pleading not guilty, moved to set aside the indictment on the ground that the grand jury was unlawfully selected and drawn, and for the reasons stated in his plea, and offered to prove certain facts by legislative journals and by oral testimony. The offer was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">He also moved to quash the indictment on the said grounds. This was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The Code of Criminal Procedure seems to have substituted a motion to set aside an indictment for the former motion to quash <em>(Sec. </em>313). It must be set aside, when it is not found indorsed and presented as prescribed in sections 268 and 272. The only ground which the prisoner makes is that none of the persons who, as grand jurors, found the indictment were grand jurors. <em>&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">A motion to quash an indictment, and so a motion to set it aside, should be made upon affidavits. Ho affidavit appears in this case. We know of no practice by which the prisoner on such a motion offers to prove certain facts and endeavors to take exceptions to the exclusion of such offer. The proceeding is not a trial, but a mere motion, which must be based on affidavits. There are none here.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Again, so far as we can discover, the Code of Criminal Procedure has not provided for any review of the order granted on such a motion. Section 517 says that, on appeal, any intermediate order, forming a part of the judgment-roll as prescribed in section 485, may be reviewed. On turning to section 485 it will be found that the judgment-roll is not required to contain the proceedings on a motion to set aside the indictment. So that we find no authority for the review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of an order setting aside or refusing to set aside an indictment. If it be suggested that the proceedings on that motion should appear in the bill of exceptions, and hence in the judgment-roll, the contrary is shown by section 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Furthermore, we find no order whatever refusing to set aside the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The legislature may well have thought that, as an indictment is only an accusation, it was sufficient to give the trial court power to set it aside, and was unnecessary to permit appeals from the action of that court;</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">It is, however, urged by the prisoner that the constitution provides that a person shall not be held to answer for such a crime, except on indictment of a grand jury <em>(Art. </em>1, <em>sec. </em>6). That the body which indicted him was not a legal grand jury; and.that, therefore, he cannot be constitutionally deprived of his right to assert that he was not so indicted. That may be so ; the prisoner did assert that he was not legally indicted, by his motion to set aside the indictment; and that was decided against him. <em>We </em>do not understand that there is any constitutional provision which allows a party always to appeal to the highest court, even when his grievance is that a constitutional .right has been infringed. When, and on what grounds, appeals shall be allowed are questions for the legislature.:. So that unless a right of appeal has been given from an order, refusing to set aside an indictment, we cannot hear that question. This paper was not a challenge to the array of grand juries, for none is allowed <em>(Code Crim. Pro., sec. </em>258). And after indictment found there could plainly be no challenge to the grand jury individually <em>(Sec. </em>239). So far as the indictment is concerned, the prisoner\u2019s remedies are those given in section 313. But if we could review the refusal to set aside the indictment, we should find no error. Proceedings are not affected 'by imperfection in matters of form <em>(Code Crim. Pro. sec. </em>285). A grand jury is defined in section 223 ; the prisoner\u2019s allegation is that the persons who found the indictment were drawn by the officers, under claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u00bbf law, from the petit jury box instead of the grand jury box. But if this be a ground of objection, it must be so under section 238, subdivision 1, Code of Criminal Procedure. And that section leaves it to the discretion of the court to discharge the panel. The court in which the indictment was found had jurisdiction. Persons were returned to that court as grand jurors, and were sworn and acted as such, and thus they formed a legal grand jury <em>(Dolan </em>agt. People, 13 <em>Sup. Ct. N. Y., </em>494).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The prisoner having pleaded not guilty, a jury was ordered to be impanneled. Thereupon it appears the prisoner\u2019s counsel objected to the panel of jurors, and to each juror, upon the ground that chapter 532 of-the Laws of 1881 was unconstitutional, being a local act, &amp;c., \u201c and offered to substantiate the \u25a0 same by proof, which was objected to, sustained and an exception taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">An objection to a panel of jurors and to each juror must have been intended as a challenge, that being the only mode known to the law of making such objection <em>(Code Crim. Pro., sec. </em>359).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">N ow, the first difficulty in regard to this challenge to the pan el is, that such a challenge must be in writing <em>(Sec. </em>363). Mo written challenge appears. The so-called plea referred only to the grand jurors. The next difficulty is that no facts are stated sufficient to constitute a challenge. It is not alleged that the petit jurors were drawn under chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881. Again, none of the proceedings required by sections 365 and 366 were taken. So that here was no exception to the challenge <em>(Sec. </em>364); a denial of the challenge <em>(Sec. </em>366); a trial of the challenge <em>(Sec. </em>377). We do not know whether the court held the challenge to be sufficient, or the allegations to be untrue. Mor does it even appear what evidence was offered, so that we can judge whether it was properly excluded or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">If we overlook all these difficulties and suppose that the court held the challenge insufficient, was there any error ? A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>challenge to the panel can he founded only on a material departure, to the prejudice of the defendant, from the forms presented by the Code of Civil Procedure in respect to the drawing and return of the jury <em>(Sec. </em>362). The other ground contained in that section is not claimed. The forms prescribed for the drawing and return of the jury are found in the Code Civil Procedure <em>(Secs. </em>1043 <em>to </em>1048). An examination of those sections will show that there is nothing in them on which this challenge could be based. It is not alleged that the clerk did not conduct the drawing of ju-rors in the very manner prescribed by these sections. His duty is to draw the jury from the box containing the ballots <em>(Sec. </em>1027). These ballots he is previously to prepare <em>(Sec. </em>1038). The right to challenge the panel, says nothing in express words as to a challenge for any material departure in respect to the preparing of the ballots. And the legislature may have thought that against the introduction of improper persons by the clerk, in preparing the ballots, the prisoner was sufficiently protected by his right to challenge individual jurors for cause <em>(Code Crim. Pro., secs. </em>375 <em>to </em>377).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Por if we overlook all the difficulties which we have seen stand in the prisoner\u2019s way on this appeal, and inquire what would have been his ground of complaint if he had properly presented it, we shall find it to be this: that the county clerk, in preparing ballots and putting them in the box under section 1038, Code of Civil Procedure, put in names which had not been selected by the proper officers. It is not claimed that a list had not been made out and filed with the clerk, or that he did not make his ballots from such list. But it is claimed that such list was not made out by the officers authorized to make the same; but was made by other officers claim ing the legal right. Hor is it pretended that there was any list from which the clerk could prepare ballots, except that list from which he did prepare them. How, then, can it be claimed that in drawing this jury the clerk departed from the forms of section 1047, Code of Civil Procedure. The legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>lature may well have refused to give any right of challenge for any fault or error in the preparation of the jury list; provided only that the clerk properly drew the trial jury from the box of ballots-prepared by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Assume then, for the present, that the list of names of all persons believed to be qualified to serve as trial jurors was made up by the wrong officers; what is that to the prisoner ? If any juror drawn on the trial is objectionable, he can be challenged. This list is made up, and the system of drawing jurors by the clerk is adopted <em>\u201c </em>to secure a due and uniform distribution of jury duty, and to guard the great body of jurymen from the fraud or favoritism of the drawing and summoning officers \u201d <em>(Friery </em>agt. People, 2 <em>Abb. Ct. App., </em>230). Challenges to the array existed formerly for the reason that there might be prejudice on the part of the sheriff. \u00a1Now since such prejudice cannot affect the drawing, these challenges have been limited as above stated <em>(Code Crim. Pro., sec. </em>362), and there must be a departure u to the prejudice of the defendant.\u201d \u00a1No prejudice to the prisoner is' shown or suggested. These irregularities are of no consequence (C<em>ar </em>agt. <em>People, </em>80 <em>N. </em>Y., 500).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">But further, if the question of the constitutionality of chapter 532, \u00a1Laws of 1881, were before us, we could not hold it to be unconstitutional. The restriction on the legislature contained in section 18, article 3 of the Constitution, is qualified by section 25 of the same act. The restriction does not apply to any bill or the amendments to any bill which shall be reported to the legislature by commissioners who have been appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes. If this law is to be held unconstitutional, then it must be upon a finding of the fact that it was not so reported. Whether or not there were any such commissioners in 1881 is not decisive. They may have reported the bill several years before, although it was not passed by the legislature until 1881. We do not say that such is the fact; only that it is possible. Then the constitutionality of the law must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>depend, not on the construction of language which is a matter of law, and, therefore, of conclusive judicial decision, but on a question of fact, which may be found by one tribunal in one way and by another tribunal in another. On the trial of this present case, the court might, on the question of fact, have found that the commissioners did report the bill, and have held the law, therefore, constitutional. At the next court the same question may arise, and the court may find that the commissioners did not report the bill, and, therefore, hold the law unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">When the constitution permitted the legislature to pass such a law, if reported to them by certain commissioners, it necessarily made the legislature the judges of the fact whether the law had been so reported. Their decision must be conclusive. No other rule would be tolerable. The constitutionality of laws cannot be permitted to depend on the possibly varying decisions of courts or juries on mere question of fact, especially on a fact as to which the legislature had special knowledge <em>(Matter of N. Y. Elev. R. </em>R., 70 <em>N. Y., </em>351; <em>People </em>agt. Doolin, 33 <em>N. Y., </em>279).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The judgment and conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The same in the other case against the same prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Bockes, <em>J</em>. The defendant was indicted in the Albany county sessions, September, 1881, for the crime of grand larceny, committed in August of that year. He was tried at the March term of that court, 1882, was found guilty, and was sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary for the period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">When arraigned he interposed objections to the finding of the indictment in various formsall, however, centering in this: that the grand jury which found the indictment was drawn from the names of persons selected by the recorder of the city of Albany, instead of from a list of names of persons selected by the supervisors of the county, and from the petit jury list; which proceeding, in that regard, was taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>under and pursuant to section 1041 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by chapter 532 of the Session Laws of 1881; whereas, as was insisted, such section, as amended, was unconstitutional in so far as it provided for the selection of grand jurors in and for the county of Albany by the recorder of that city; hence that the grand jury should have been selected and drawn under and pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, which, as was claimed, remained in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The objections so urged against the indictment was overruled by the court and the defendant was put to his plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The objection interposed was in the nature of a challenge to the array. . It went to the entire panel, and was based on on alleged vice or irregularity in the selection of the grand jurors by whom the indictment was found. It can make no difference as regards the examination of the question before the court, that the objection was made by formal plea, like a plea in abatement to the jurisdiction of the court or for misnomer. This was but a mode of presenting the question for decision. The point to be determined by the court was whether, on the alleged facts, the indictment was regularly found \u2014 whether the defendant was bound by the law to make answer to it, on the merits, as to his guilt or innocence. The mode of presenting the question is quite immaterial. Whatever may be the form of its presentation, the question is whether the objection, based on the alleged facts, was properly overruled. It is proposed, however, to examine the case in all its aspects, at least in so far as is needful to dispose of it as here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel insists that the question presented for decision must be considered under the provisions of the Revised Statutes; this, on the hypothesis that the act of 1881 <em>{chap. </em>532) is unconstitutional and void, and that, as a consequence, the provisions of the Revised Statutes bearing on the subject remain in force. '</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Now let this be conceded and let it be also admitted that the objection to the indictment is, in effect, a challenge to the array, and should be so considered, and the objection is met and answered by section 28 of the Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S., </em>724, <em>marginal paging), </em>which declares that no challenge to the array of grand jurors shall be allowed in any other cases than such as are specified in the last preceding section (27), which section (27) does not include the ground here relied on. As was said by Sellen, J., in <em>Dawson </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(25 <em>N. Y., </em>404-405), this statute \u201climits the grounds of challenge by persons charged with crime to the prosecutor or complainant making the charge, and the witnesses to sustain it.\u201d This provision was doubtless intended to cover matters of singularity in obtaining the panel of grand jurors, recognizing the fact that the substantial rights of the accused could be and would be fully protected to him on the trial upon the indictment before the petit jury. If, therefore, it be assumed that the case is one of challenge to the array, and that the question raised is to be controlled by the provisions of the Revised Statutes, it follows that the objection urged is nullified by the sections above cited <em>(Carpenter </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>64 <em>N. Y., </em>483). Besides, it has been repeatedly decided that irregularities in the selection or drawing of grand jurors not affecting the substantial rights of the accused, as regards the question of his guilt or innocence, is not good ground of challenge to the array <em>(Friery </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>2 <em>Keyes, </em>424; <em>Cox </em>agt. <em>The People </em>80 <em>N. Y., </em>500-511; <em>Dolan </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>64 <em>N. Y., </em>485; <em>Same case, in Sup. Ct., </em>6 <em>Hun, </em>232 <em>and </em>493). In Dolan\u2019s case the question was considered (as stated by judge Dajstiels), on what was relied upon as a plea in abatement <em>(See, also, statement of the case </em>64 <em>N. Y., </em>486-487). In this case judge Earl says: \u201c Courts do not look with indulgence upon objections to irregularities in the mode of selecting or drawing grand jurors committed without fraud or design, which have not resulted in placing upon any panel disqualified jurors.\u201d But the defendant\u2019s counsel insists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>that these authorities relate to mere irregularities, and do not reach the case in hand, inasmuch as the ground of objection here is vital, such as (if admitted) depriving the array of the character of a legal panel. \u00a1Mow in Dolan\u2019s case, the ground urged was the same as is here urged, to wit: that the pretended grand jury which found the indictment was not a grand jury in and for the city and county (64 <em>N. Y., </em>486-487); that it was not \u201clawfully created and organized\u201d (6 <em>Hun, </em>495); yet the objection was held inadmissible. The objection in that case was as \u201c vital \u201d and as much deprived \u201cthe array of the character of a legal panel \u201d as in the present. I shall have occasion hereafter to refer more particularly to the ground of objection in Dolan\u2019s case. But attention is here called to the remarks of judge Eabl in that case. The learned judge says: \u201c The plea contains no allegation of any corruption, dishonesty or unfairness on the part of any of the officers in selecting and drawing the grand jurors, or of any design to injure the defendant or any other person, and it contains no allegation that any of the persons who were upon the grand jury which indicted the defendant did not possess the qualifications of grand jurors, or that any person was upon the jury who would not have been there if all the forms of law which are claimed to have been disregarded had been complied with. It is not apparent how the alleged irregularities harmed the defendant, and it is certain that they had no relation whatever to the question of his guilt or innocence of the crime charged. Under such circumstances the indictment should be upheld, unless the facts pleaded point out some vital error.\u201d As above suggested, the objection there under consideration was no less vital than it is in this. The remarks of Mr. justice Daniels, in Dolan\u2019s case, when in this court, are in line with those of judge Eabl above quoted (6 <em>Hun, </em>494; <em>see, also, The People </em>agt. <em>Dolan, </em>6 <em>Hun, 232, and Friery </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>1 <em>Keyes, </em>424). From these and other cases it would seem, therefore, that these alleged errors urged by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ant as ground of objection to the indictment are untenable, inasmuch as it is not made apparent that he was or could be in any way injured or prejudiced by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">But there is another answer to the objections- urged which seems entirely conclusive against their allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The court in which the indictment was found had undoubted jurisdiction of the case. The list of names of persons to serve as grand jurors was made up from the right source \u2014 that is, from the body of the court \u2014 and the names of the persons drawn to serve as grand jurors were, as must be presumed? certified to the court in due form by the record. It is not pretended but that they were drawn by the proper officers; nor but that they were, one and all, duly qualified to serve and act as grand jurors in and for the county of Albany; nor but that they were honest, intelligent and impartial, were duly summoned and impanneled in due form, and in all respects performed the duties of grand jurors according to the forms of law. Considered as officers of the law to aid in the administration of justice in criminal cases, they constituted a <em>defacto </em>body in the exercise of legal functions, under color of lawful authority. So it was held in <em>The People agt. Dolan </em>(6 <em>Hun, </em>232), that it was sufficient to maintain the authority of the grand jury to investigate criminal charges and find indictments valid in their nature, that the body acted under color of lawful authority, and according to the case of <em>Thompson </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(6 <em>Hun, </em>135), it would not alter this conclusion even if the selection of the grand jurors involved, in the proceeding, the acts of an officer holding his office under an unconstitutional law. It was then decided that such officer must be deemed an officer <em>de facto, </em>whose acts could not be brought in question in a collateral proceeding between other parties. True, this latter decision was made with reference to the panel of petit jurors, but the principle thus declared is equally applicable to a case where like objection is urged to the panel of a grand jury. But the decision in Thompson\u2019s case meets and answers the precise point urged here, to wit: that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>recorder of the city of Albany assumed to act and did act in the selection of the jury list without authority, under and pursuant to an unconstitutional law. It was then directed that a challenge to the array by the accused could not be sustained, even were it true that the panel was selected by the commissioner of jurors, appointed under an unconstitutional law; that such officer must be deemed to be an officer <em>defacto, </em>whose acts could not be brought in question in a collateral action or proceeding. It is the well settled rule that the title of an officer <em>de facto </em>cannot be assailed collaterally; that the acts of such officer are valid in so far as the public and third persons are concerned <em>(Thompson </em>agt. <em>The </em>People, 6 <em>Hun, </em>138, <em>and cases there cited ; Dolan </em>agt. <em>The </em>People, 24 <em>N. Y., </em>495 ; <em>Carpenter </em>agt. <em>The </em>People, 24 <em>N. Y., </em>483; <em>Dolan </em>agt. Mayor, 68 <em>N. Y., </em>278, 279; <em>see, also, 5 Wait\u2019s Actions and Defenses, </em>7, <em>and the many cases there cited). </em>As above stated, it matters not that one of the officers, through whose instrumentality the jurors were obtained, held his position under an unconstitutional law. In <em>Thompson </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>a challenge to the array was interposed \u2014 the alleged ground thereof being that the panel of jurors was selected by Dunlap, acting as a commissioner of juror under appointment by the mayor of the city of Hew York, in pursuance of an alleged unconstitutional law. The district attorney demurred to the challenge, and it was disallowed. It was then said, \u201c it is enough, in all cases, when such a question is raised collaterally, that the person acting as an officer is discharging the duties of the office under color of right, evidenced by his possession of the office, and by exercising its functions under the power of an appointment or election independently of the question of legal title; hence the court below was entirely right in holding that Dunlop\u2019s official acts could not in this case be questioned by challenge on the ground alleged.\u201d To the same effect are the remarks of Daniels, J., in <em>Dolan\u2019s case </em>(6 <em>Hun, </em>499), where the objection urged was of the same character as in <em>Thompsons case </em>(64 <em>N. Y., </em>483), and where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the objection was raised by what was designated as a plea in abatement. A like objection was raised in <em>Carpenter's case </em>(64 N. Y., 483), to wit: That the act of the legislature under which Dunlop was appointed commissioner of jurors was unconstitutional. The court held that he was an officer <em>de </em>facto, whose acts were valid as to the public; that this validity of his appointment cannot be drawn in question in this collateral manner. In <em>The State </em>agt. <em>Carroll </em>(38 <em>Conn., </em>449), it was decided that one acting under color of an appointment by or pursuant to a public unconstitutional law before it was adjudged to be such, was to be deemed an officer <em>de facto, </em>and that his acts as such were valid as to the public and third persons. This subject received a very elaborate examination in this case on the authorities, as well as those of older date, as of a more recent period. In <em>The Commonwealth </em>agt. <em>McCombs </em>(56 <em>Penn., </em>436), it was held that a person who holds an office under the apparent authority of a statue as an officer <em>de facto, </em>whose title could not be assailed collaterally, even though the statute be unconstitutional. But it is said that the office of recorder was well filled by an officer holding under authority good both in fact and law; that it is not disputed that he was recorder and might well perform the duties pertaining to that office. But the point is urged that other rights and powers were attempted to be conferred on him by an unconstitutional law. The case, however, is not changed by this view of it; and for the reason that the recorder was an officer <em>de facto </em>as regards the duties imposed on him by the law here challenged \u2022\u2014 as much so as if a new office had been thereby created and he had been appointed to perform its duties. He was not a usurper as regards the performance of those duties in any legal sense. A usurper is one who undertakes to perform official acts without .any color of right. Here the recorder acted certainly under color of right. His action had the sanction of an apparent law, duly certified to him and to the people as a valid law of the'state. It may, too, be here added that it stands undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>that the legislature, under a certain condition or state of facts, had the constitutional right to pass precisely this law. How, every law which the legislature may pass is presumed, when duly certified as a law of the state, to he valid. To meet this point, \"a fact was averred which, if proved, would, as was insisted, render the law unconstitutional. But proof, of such fact would be inadmissible <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Devlin, </em>33 <em>N. Y. </em>269, <em>and cases there cited; Matter of N. Y. Elevated R. R. Co., </em>70 <em>N. Y., </em>351). In this latter case judge Earl puts the inquiry, <em>\u201c </em>can the court take proof for the purpose of showing a statute, valid and regular upon its face, to be unconstitutional?\u201d and gives a negative answer. Then, in executing such law, or in executing any law, indeed, duly certified as a valid law of the state, can it be maintained that the officer appointed to carry its provisions into effect acts, in so doing, without the semblance or color- of authority ? The cases above cited, and many others referred to in those cases, answer this question in the negative. It is repeatedly and repeatedly declared in the decisions of the courts that an unconstitutional law gives the semblance or color of authority to its provisions. There was nothing decided in <em>Lambert </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(76 <em>N. Y., </em>220), in conflict with the cases above cited. The precise point here under discussion was not in that case; and as it seems the views of the several members of the court on the subject then considered were not in all respects in harmony. We conclude, therefore, that the objection here urged against the indictment was properly overruled; and this whether it be deemed to be a challenge to the array or considered as a plea in abatement. In either case the ground of objection must be held untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">So far the case has been considered without regard to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">But if the case is to be determined under the provisions of this Code, which went into effect on the 1st of September, 1881, before the indictment was found <em>(see section </em>962), and admitting the invalidity of the law of 1881, because of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>alleged unconstitutionality, thereby section 238, the objection, being a challenge to the panel or array, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">This section (238) declares that no challenge can be allowed to the panel or to the array of the grand jury; but provides that the court may, in its discretion, discharge the panel and order another to be summoned in certain specified cases. This section, however, has application to proceedings to be taken before indictment found. The proceedings permissible to the accused after indictment are provided for in subsequent sections. Section 312 provides that the defendant may, when arraigned, move the court to set aside the indictment, or may demur or plead thereto. Sections 312 and 313 declare in what cases only he may have the- indictment set aside. The specified grounds of such motion do not touch the case in hand. We are then brought to section 321, which declares that the only pleading allowed to the accused is either a demurrer or a plea. Section 322 declares the cases in which a demurrer may be interposed, and confines the demurrer to matters appearing on the face of the indictment. This section has here no application. Then section 332 provides for three kinds of pleas, to wit: Guilty, not guilty, and former conviction or aquittal. No other pleas are allowed by the Code. The objection in this case, therefore, considered even as a formal, technical plea of matter in abatement was inadmissible under the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus, if it be admitted that the case is to be determined under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\u2019 the objection urged was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In view of the conclusions above reached, it becomes unnecessary to examine the question raised by the defendant\u2019s counsel as to the validity of the act of June 16, 1881 <em>(chapter </em>532). We are of the opinion that the defendant was properly put to his plea to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">He pleaded not guilty. On the trial, upon such plea and in the outset, the same objections were <em>\u201c </em>interposed to the panel of the petit jury as had been previously urged against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the panel of the grand jury, to wit: that the jurors had been selected from the body of the county, under and pursuant to the act of June 16, 1881, chapter 532, which act, as was claimed, was in violation of the constitution and void in so far as it provided for the selecting and drawing of jurors in and for the county of Albany. This was in effect, and in fact, a challenge to the array of the petit jury. Was this-objection or challenge properly overruled ? The same answer must be given as was above made to the objection to the panel of grand jurors, that is: the jurors were selected. from the right source \u2014 from the body of the county; they were duly drawn, summoned and returned to the court pursuant to the provisions of the law, by officers acting under the color of lawful authority; and they were in all respects duly qualified and competent to act as petit jurors in and for the county of Albany. According to the decisions above cited, the objection was properly disallowed, because the officers through whose action the jurors were selected, drawn and summoned were officers defacto, if not <em>dejxtre \u2022 </em>officers in possession of office, acting under color of lawful authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">It should be added, perhaps, that section 562 of the Code of Criminal Procedure fully answers the objection interposed to the panel of trial jurors, if it be admitted that the case comes within its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">It follows, therefore, that without considering the question as to the constitutionality of the act of 1881, the conviction and judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Mem.\u2014 The decision in the case against the defendant for grand larceny disposes of this case also.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">It should be noted, however, that this case is undeniably subject to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which went into effect before the offense charged in the indictment was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Conviction and judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Westbrook, <em>J. </em>(dissenting)</author>\n<p id=\"A-R\">Involving, as this case does, the constitutionality of the law <em>(chap. </em>532 <em>of the Laws of </em>1881), under which grand and petit jurors are selected in and for the county of Albany, and unable to agree with my associates either in their conclusion that the conviction for the crime of grand larceny should be affirmed, or in the arguments assigned by them for such conclusion, it would seem to be proper that my reasons for such dissent should be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On the 19th day of September, 1881, there was filed with the clerk of the county of Albany, a paper purporting to be an indictment found by a grand jury of the court of sessions of Albany county, accusing the appellant, John Petrea, of the crime of grand larceny, committed at the city of Cohoes on the 2d day of August, 1881.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">On the 21th day of March, 1882, Petrea was brought before the court of sessions of Albany county to answer to the .alleged indictment. Seeking to avail himself of the consti\u2022tutional protection <em>(art. </em>1, <em>sec. </em>6), that \u201c no person shall be \u00a1held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime \u201d (\u25a0(except as is stated in the section referred to) \u201c unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury,\u201d the accused filed a -written plea or objection, which denied the finding of an \u00a1Indictment against him by a grand jury, and claimed as the -\u00bfnecessary corollary that the court had no jurisdiction to place 'him upon trial for an alleged infamous crime, bio objection \u25a0was taken by the people to the form or manner of presenting ;tlie question, and the court, in rendering its decision, did not \u25a0put \u00a1it upon the ground that a formal motion to quash the \u00a1\u2022so-called indictment upon affidavit served had not been made, bior-would any such objections, if made, been tenable <em>(Clare </em>agt. <em>The State, 30 Md., </em>165; <em>Stokes </em>agt. <em>The State, </em>24 <em>Miss., </em>621; <em>State </em>agt. <em>Newhouse, </em>29 <em>La.

The paper presented was not a plea <em>\u201c to </em>an indictment,\u201d and as such controlled by section 332 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It admitted no indictment, and denied that one had been found. Neither was it a challenge to the array of grand jurors, nor to an individual grand juror, and therefore controlled either as to form or substance by sections 238 and 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The prisoner, so far as the case discloses, was not present at the organization of the body, called a grand jury, and had no opportunity to challenge it either as a whole or in part. The labors of the men composing it were ended, but in the possession of the tribunal before which the accused was brought was a paper said to be an indictment found by a grand jury, which he was called upon to answer. The objection he mode was radical, it was aimed at the jurisdiction of the court to place him on trial, and denied that he was indicted, upon the ground that no grand jury had presented the accusation upon which he was arraigned. No objection was urged to a form, none to an informality in the exercise of a power conferred. The point made went much further. It insisted, not only that the paper was no indictment, as it was claimed to be, but that its existence and presence was a violation of the fundamental law, and the attempt to try him thereon an outrage upon his rights as a citizen. Unless, then, the court is -prepared to hold that every paper bearing the external form and impress of an indictment is one in fact, and that what it purports to be cannot be questioned by the party arraigned, then the written objection made to the alleged indictment, if true in the statement of facts, and sound in its legal conclusions, could not possibly be overruled upon the grounds that it was not such a plea as the Code <em>(sec. </em>332) allowed, nor such a challenge to grand jurors as is provided for by other (338, 339) sections. The Code cannot be construed as intending to deprive a person of a great constitutional right, and if it be capable of any such construction, which it clearly is not, such a barrier would be futile, for it is a legal impossibility by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>statute to deprive a party of his right to claim constitutional protection, or to state the proposition more clearly with reference to this case, it is impossible, under color of legislative enactment, to organize a grand jury in a mode forbidden by the constitution, and prevent, under the like color of legislation, the aggrieved party from being heard in assertion of his rights. ' Its author, and the body which adopted it as a law, intended no such absurdity as an attempt to prevent by an enactment defining and limiting the grounds of challenge to grand jurors, or the pleas to be made to an indictment when one is properly found, a preliminary inquiry by the court to ascertain whether there is, in fact, an indictment. before it, to which the accused is compelled to answer. This proposition is so elementary and fundamental \u25a0 that its soundness will be assumed, and attention will be given to the contents of the paper filed and the proceedings thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The substance of the paper submitted by the prisoner to the court was that the alleged indictment to which he was asked to plead was not an indictment in fact, because not found by a grand jury of the county of Albany. That not a single one of the individuals named and called therein grand jurors W'as a grand juror in fact, because not a solitary member of that body had been selected, summoned or called according to law, but one and all had been selected, summoned and called under and in pursuance of chapter 532 of the Laws o\u00ed 1881, which was \u201cobnoxious to, and in contravention of, the constitution of the state of Hew York, which forbids the passage by the legislature of a private or local bill for selecting, drawing, summoning or impanneling grand jurors, and that the said chapter 532 was not reported to the legislature by any commissioner or commissioners who had been appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">By the replication to this plea, the district attorney admitted and declared that the \u201c said grand jury was selected and drawn pursuant t\u00f3 chapter 532'of the Laws of 1881, as in said plea stated; and as to the other allegations, matters and things in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>said plea stated, he denies the same, each and all; and this he, the said district attorney, prays may be inquired of by the countrv.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The prisoner filed a rejoinder to such replication in which he said, \u201c that all matters of fact in his said plea stated are true, and constitute good and sufficient reasons for sustaining the same; and the said John Petrea joins issue upon the allegations in said replication stated ; and of this he, the said John Petrea, puts himself upon the country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The court then held that the legal presumption was in favor of the constitutionality of the law, and that the burden was upon the prisoner to show that the act of 1881 was not one reported to the legislature by the commissioners of the Code. Whereupon the counsel of the prisoner <em>\u201c </em>offered to prove by the clerk of the senate, by the commissioners appointed to revise the statutes, by the journal of the legislature of 1881, and by the original law itself, that the law in question was not reported to the legislature by any commissioner or commissioners who are or had been appointed, pursuant to law, to revise the statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">This evidence was objected to by the counsel for the people <em>\u201c </em>as immaterial, incompetent and inadmissible,\u201d which objection was sustained and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The defendant then offered to prove by the same kind of evidence mentioned in his first offer, \u201c that the said act of 1881 was introduced in the legislature by a member of that body, who was not and never had been a commissioner appointed to revise the statute or any statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">This offer was also overruled, and on the motion of the people \u201c the balance of defendant\u2019s plea \u201d was \u201c overruled,\u201d and he was called upon to plead, the court saying: \u201c In this case we have to say that it was the defendant\u2019s duty to file objection to the legality of this statute at the earliest practical moment after the indictment was found. He omitted to do that, and we think he should not be permitted to avail him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>self of the plea at this late day, and so hold.\u201d To this decision there was also an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">So far as the case discloses, the defendant did make his objection at the first opportunity. When brought before a court to answer an accusation of crime alleged to be an indictment, it was then, and only then, his duty to interpose his objection. Prior to that time, the act of 1881, and proceedings thereunder, did not concern him any more than they did any other citizen. It was enough to do just what he did do, to wit, upon his arraignment make the point. This was not only then done in the manner already mentioned, but after his offers and written plea were overruled he renewed them by a motion and an ,offer of proof. This was also refused, and the several rulings of the court sharply present the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\"><em>First. </em>Conceding that the act of 1881 was not \u201c reported to the legislature by commissioners who have been appointed to revise the statutes,\u201d is the enactment for that reason unconstitutional ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\"><em>Second. </em>Had the accused the right to show that it had not been so reported?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\"><em>Third. </em>Conceding that the statute is unconstitutional, and that the so-called grand jury which undertook to find the alleged indictment was organized thereunder, is the defendant without remedy ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">These questions will be discussed in the order they have been stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">In the consideration of the one first propounded, it is necessary to have clearly in mind the constitutional enactment. By section 18 of article 3 it is declared : <em>\u201c </em>The legislature shall not pass a private or local bill in any of the following cases: * * * Selecting, drawing, summoning or impanneling grand or petit jurors;\u201d and by section 25 of the same article it is provided that \u201c sections seventeen and eighteen of this article shall not apply to any bill, or the amendments to any bill, which shall be reported to the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>lature by commissioners who have been appointed pursuant to law, to revise the statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">These constitutional provisions are clear. \u201c A private or local bill * * selecting, summoning or iinpanneling grand or petit jurors \u201d could not be passed unless the same was \u201c reported to the legislature by commissioners who \u201d had \u201cbeen appointed pursuant to law to revise the statutes.\u201d There may possibly, owing to the peculiar phraseology o\u00ed section 25, be some doubt whether or not the bill to be introduced, and all amendments thereto as well, should be reported by the commissioners. The act, however, certainly requires that the bill, which, when passed and approved, becomes a law, must be reported by such commissioners, and whether amendments to such bill, in the course of its passage, must also emanate from the same source, or could be adopted by the legislature, upon the suggestion of any of its members, is of no importance to the question before us. The literal reading of the section would seem to exempt only such bill and such amendments as were reported by the commissioners from the prohibition contained in section 18; while the intention, probably, was' to give the legislature power to amend the bill when reported from the commission, as it might see lit. Speculation as to this point is, however, useless. The act of 1881 is not an amendment to a bill, but is an amendment of a law in full force, at the time of the passage of the former, and as the right of amendment, unless reported by the commissioners, existed, if at all, only whilst the report of such commission was in the form of a bill, by no possibility can section 25 be held to confer the power to so amend the work of such commission after it had become a law, as to make a valid legal enactment giving to the county of Albany a law, applicable to it, and to it only, for \u201c selecting, drawing, summoning or impanneling grand or petit jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Having demonstrated the proposition that the act of 1881, if it gave to the county of Albany a local jury law, which had not been reported by the commissioners appointed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>revise the statutes, must be unconstitutional and' void, the next inquiry is, what does the act seek to accomplish ?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The second article of chapter ten of the \u201c Code of Civil Procedure,\u201d as adopted by the legislature, provided a \u201c mode of-selecting, drawing and' procuring the attendance of trial jurors in ordinary cases,\u201d but had no application to grand jurors. By it the supervisor, town clerk and assessors of each town made out the list, from which such trial jurors were to be drawn. By section 1041, \u201ceach ward of the city of Albany or Utica, is considered a town for the purposes of \u201d that \u201carticle, and the supervisor and the assessor of that ward must execute the duties of the supervisor, town clerk and assessor of a town, as prescribed \u201d in the preceding sections of that article. Special provision is also made in regard to other cities, but this is of no importance to the present discussion, and will not be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The act <em>(chap. </em>532) of 1881 undertakes to amend section 1041 of the Code by declaring that, \u201c in the city of Albany, the recorder of said city shall perform the duties imposed by this title \u201d (that is to say, the provisions of the Code in regard to the obtainment of trial jurors) \u201c upon the supervisor, town clerk and assessors of towns; \u201d and that thereafter, \u201c in Albany county grand jurors shall be drawn from the box containing the names of petit jurors selected for said county in the same manner as petit jurors, and hereafter no separate list of grand jurors shall be prepared for said county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The changes made by this statute, if valid, are radical. To the recorder of the city of Albany, only, and in contradistinction, as it is believed, of the powers of that officer in any other city in the state, is confided the duty of preparing the jury list, and from such list, when prepared by him, both the grand and petit jurors are to be drawn. Prior to its enactment, the recorder had nothing to do with the preparation of the lists from which either was selected. The preparation of that from which the trial jurors were to be obtained was by the Code of Civil Procedure devolved upon other officers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that of the grand jurors, except in the city and county of \u00a1New York, was to be prepared by \u201c the supervisors of the several counties of this state * * * at their annual meeting in each year \u201d (3 <em>R. S. [6th ed.], </em>1015; 3 <em>R. S. [7th ed.], </em>2558), the two lists being separate, and the ballots for the drawing kept in separate and distinct boxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">These new provisions applicable to the city and county of Albany alone, and to no other county of the State, very clearly make for it a local law for the selection, drawing, summoning or impanneling, or both, grand and petit jurors, and unless reported as a bill by the commissioners to amend the statutes, was clearly unconstitutional, because the passage of any such bill by the legislature was strictly forbidden. Was the bill, which is claimed to be a law, a report from the commissioners appointed to revise the statutes ? This brings us to the second question which this case involves, and that is: Had the accused the right to show that it had not been so reported ?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We have already seen that the court of sessions was powerless to try or to punish the accused for the commission of the alleged crime unless he was properly accused by a legal grand jury through and by the form of an indictment. It is useless to argue that a body of men, no matter of whom composed, has either of its own volition, or upon the summoning and call of other than the authority of the law, to resolve itself into a grand jury, and when professing to be thus organized to accuse anyone, by what it may call an indictment of an infamous crime and subject him to a trial therefor. This proposition is elementary and needs neither argument nor authority to uphold it. If this be sound, as will readily be conceded, it is proper to ask, can a legislative enactment forbidden by the constitution become operative upon the citizen because the court to which objection thereto is made requires extraneous evidence to show the act is within the constitutional prohibition ? He who seeks to uphold the judgment rendered in this cause must show that the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>propounded requires an affirmative answer, and that courts are powerless to determine whether or- not an alleged law has been passed despite a constitutional provision forbidding its enactment. The offer upon the trial was so broad and specific as to include every species of evidence attainable upon any such subject as that involved. It included the inspection of the original bill, the journals of both houses, the evidence of the cleric of the senate, of members of the commission, and of individuals,' and all was excluded upon the ground that the party, who was then for the first time arraigned, was too late with his objection and his offer of proof in its support. If the act had professed to have been passed because reported by the commissioners, or if the inquiry proposed had impugned.the good faith of the legislature by imputing to it some motive or intent other than that evinced by the language of the enactment, the question might be more embarrassing. No proof, however, tending to impeach either legislative declaration or motive, was offered. The desire was simply to show that the alleged law, when reported as a bill, did not emanate from the only source possible under the constitution \u2014 the commissioners appointed to revise the statutes. So far from attempting any discourtesy to the legislature by an imputation upon its motives or its truth, the offer of evidence was an appeal to its own declaration upon its original bill, and to its own record of its proceedings, which it had itself approved. The offer was rejected, and the decision refusing the production and inspection of \u201c the original act itself \u201d was directly contrary to that of the court of appeals <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Commissioners of Highways of </em>Marlborough, 54 N. Y., 276); and the offer of proof by the production of the journals of the two houses was certainly proper <em>(Purdy </em>agt. <em>The </em>People, 4 Hill, 384 ; <em>De Bow </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>14; <em>Warner </em>agt <em>Beers, </em>23 <em>Wend., </em>166, <em>see note; Cooley's Const. Lim. [4th ed.], </em>164). It is not necessary, however, to multiply authorities upon what seems to be self-evident. It is clearly the prerogative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>court to ascertain and decide whether in the passage of any bill a constitutional provision was violated. This duty and power so clearly devolve upon the court, that the enunciation thereof is sufficient. No case holding to the contrary was cited, and it is believed that none can be found. <em>In Matter of Elevated Railroad Company </em>(70 <em>N. Y., </em>327, 351) nothing opposed to it was decided. The law under consideration in that case was general in its terms \u2014 applicable to- all elevated railroads in the city and county of New York \u2014 and its constitutionality was attacked upon the ground, that it was not what it professed to be, and really was a special statute for the benefit of a particular corporation. It was of such an attempted inquisitorial inquiry into the motives of the legislature in opposition to the words of the law, that judge Earl wrote, when he held that such an inquiry could not be tolerated; but neither he, nor any judge, has ever held that when the constitution requires a bill to be reported through a particular channel to become a valid law, that an inquiry to ascertain such fact could not be made. The application of the principle claimed by the people in this case would nullify the constitution, for then, in spite of its mandate to the contrary, there could be among the statutes of the state an unconstitutional law in fact, but still to be obeyed and enforced in spite of the constitution, because a judicial dictum forbade inquiry as to its origin. In a state, the fundamental law of which confers and limits power, no principle having such a result can be upheld. It, therefore, follows that the rejection of the offers was clearly erroneous, notwithstanding the attempt to sustain such rejection upon a ground not considered by the court below in announcing its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We are now brought to the third question which this case involves. Conceding the unconstitutionality of the act of 1881, under which the so-called grand jury presenting the paper called an indictment was organized, is the defendant without remedy ? It is gravely argued and claim.ed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>people that he is. It is said that a body acting as a grand jury, everyone of its members having the personal, qualifications requisite for a grand juror, having presented to the court the jraper called an indictment, it became one in fact, to which the prisoner was bound to answer upon the merits, and upon which he could be tried and convicted. Is this sound ?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">To state such a proposition, it would seem, is to answer it. Why, if it be correct, have any law for selecting, drawing or summoning a grand jury ? Why should not the court simply direct the sheriff, or any other officer, to go out and summon such men as he pleases, or why, even, should not the court direct him who to summon, without the cumbersome machinery of a general list of names, the drawing of the persons to serve in the presence of witnesses, and the observance of any of the safeguards of statutes? ' No one would tolerate or uphold such a procedure, for such orders by the court would not only be without the color of law, but also against its commands ; and yet a case depending for support upon a like violation of legal principles is before us. Under and by what authority was the so-called grand jury, which professed to accuse the defendant of an \u201cinfamous crime\u201d organized. It was a body of men drawn from a list of names made out and selected by an officer to whose office no such duty belonged, and which names, in defiance of law, if the act of 1881 is unconstitutional, were improperly and unlawfully mingled in one box, from which both grand and petit jurors were drawn. Not only was the recorder of the city of Albany unauthorized to prepare any such list for that purpose, but he was positively forbidden to make it, for no person can undertake to execute the machinery of a statute, which the legislature is forbidden to adopt, without having the constitutional forbidding made applicable to himself. If, then,.the alleged indictment of the defendant and his conviction are to be upheld, they must be upon some principle which, in spite of the constitution, shall uphold in the county of Albany for the disposal and trial of this case not only, but of all others, a system for obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>both grand and petit jurors created by a local statute. Is such a proposition maintainable ? The claim is that it can be by adjudged cases upon the theory that what an officer does under color of legislative authority will, as to persons affected by it, be upheld. In other words, that the machinery of a supposed law for the obtainment of jurors in the county of Albany shall be kept in operation, though forbidden by the constitution, upon a legal rule, sanctioned by judicial authority, which deprives the constitution of its power and makes inoperative and void one of its most positive commands. Let us see if any court has ever so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Preliminary to any detailed examination of the cases to which we have been referred, it is proper to enunciate the principles upon which they all depend, and to show their inapplicability to the one before us. Those principles are: 1st. That mere irregularity by an officer in doing that, which he is authorized to do, will not vitiate the thing done, and, second, when duties properly and legally belonging to the office of which an individual is in possession, have been performed by such incumbent, that which has been thus done will be upheld as to the parties affected thereby, and courts will not, in collateral proceedings, inquire into the right of the individual to hold the office, and to discharge the duties which lawfully appertain to such office.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Ho such principles are involved in the case before us. It is not urged that any officer has irregularly exercised powers with which he was clothed, but it is claimed that an officer has not only exercised a power unconferred, but also that as such exercise of power was under color of a pretended law, which the constitution of the state declared to be inoperative and void, that which he undertook to do was forbidden by the fundamental law' of the state, because, if the enactment of the so-called statute law is forbidden, every act in execution thereof must be equally forbidden. Heither does the accused question the title of the officer (the 3\u2019ecorder of the city of Albany) to the office he filled. He admits that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>officer properly held the official position, under color of which was prepared the pretended jury list, from which the so-called grand jury was drawn. The claim is, that the duty of preparing such list and the right to prepare it did not belong to the office which the recorder held, and, also, that as he undertook to prepare such list in the execution of a supposed law, the enactment of which the constitution forbade, that which he did do was in defiance of the supreme authority of the state \u2014 the will of its people embodied and declared in its constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">It will readily be seen, if the thread of this opinion has 'been f\u00f3llowed, that the points in this discussion have been correctly stated. In examining, then, the cases cited to sustain the conviction and judgment appealed from, no search will be made to see, if the accused can avail himself of a mere irregularity in the exercise of a power actually conferred upon an officer, nor to learn that he .must be remediless if he only questions the discharge of duties properly belonging to an office, upon the ground that its possessor had no legal title, for all this is at once conceded ; but we are gravely asked to seek for a solemn opinion, or some judicial dictum upholding as a sound legal proposition, that when an officer performs an act not appertaining to his office, and which, also, he is forbidden to do, such action when injurious to personal rights cannot be questioned, because the officer has assumed to do it, and in fact has done it. This is no strained statement. Even the non-professional mind will recognize its accuracy, and having made it, some of the cases cited will be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In <em>Friery </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(2 Keyes, 424), the challenge was to the array of trial jurors. Such objections <em>(pages </em>433, 434) related to the impartiality of the sheriff who summoned them, and the alleged non-observance of all required forms in the drawing. The court held that these objections were unavoidable; that the provisions of the statutes <em>(pages </em>452, 453) were only \u201c directory to those whose duty it is to select, draw and summon. * * * * The omission to properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>work the statute machinery by the drawing and summoning officers is a question between the people and those officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The brief extracts from the opinion of Judge Weight, just given, show that in Friery\u2019s case the officers authorized to draw and summon the jurors had performed that duty, and that the machinery of the law had been worked by the officers charged with that duty. In the case before us, if the act of 1881 be void, that which was done was entirely unauthorized. There was no \u201c machinery \u201d of any law worked, because there was no law making any; there was no list of names prepared from which the selection of so-called jurors was made, for that which is against the fundamental law, is such an absolute nullity that it has no existence as a fact capable of recognition as such by any court. That which is called by those names is improperly so designated. They may have borne the semblance and likeness of the things by which they are named, but an appeal to the fundamental law strips off the mask which gives the appearance of substance and reveals the hollowness of any such pretense.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In <em>Carpenter </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(64 <em>N. Y., </em>483) the point presented was, that one Douglass Taylor, who was the <em>de jure </em>commissioner of jurors in and for the city and county of Hew York, had not selected the grand jury, which indicted the prisoner, but one Thomas Dunlap, who was <em>de facto </em>commissioner, had performed that duty. The decision of the court was, that as to the office of commissioner of jurors appertained the right of selecting, such selection was valid because made by an individual holding the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In <em>Dolan </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(64 <em>N. Y., </em>485) the same question which arose in the Carpenter case was made, with the point added, that among the names upon the list from which the grand jury was obtained were a few which had been improperly placed thereon. The decision of the court upon the first point was similar to that made in the Carpenter case; and as to the second, it held among other things <em>(page </em>493) that \u201c no authority can be found holding that in such a case the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>list is irregular and void so that none of the persons in it could be drawn for grand jurors, because a few names, without fraud or design, were, as we may assume, by accident or oversight, also put upon it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In the case before us there was neither \u201c accident or oversight.\u201d In the preparation of the list every name was placed upon it by forethought and design, and the whole list is ' irregular and void, because made without and against the authority of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In <em>Cox </em>agt. <em>The People </em>(80 <em>N. </em>Y., 500), it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Mere irregularities in the drawing of grand and petit jurors do not furnish a ground for reversing a conviction, unless it appears that they operated to the injury or prejudice of the prisoner; \u201d and that when a challenge to the array of trial jurors had been overruled, because not verified, an offer by the court, subsequently made, to receive evidence in supj&gt;ort of such challenge, and its declination by the prisoner, precluded him \u201c from insisting upon the exception to the ruling,\u201d and that he \u201c must be regarded as having abandoned his challenge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">It is impossible, however, to examine in detail every case to which we have been referred. If the distinction herein before stated, between the right to inquire collaterally into the title of an incumbent of an office, and the right to question acts, which do not appertain to the office under color of which they are done, is remembered, none presents any difficulty. An individual may possess an office by an unconstitutional law, but if he only performs the acts, which the office may do, such acts, when done, are valid, because he is a <em>defacto </em>officer. When,, however, an individual holding an office, either <em>defacto </em>or <em>de jure, </em>or both, does an act which his office does not authorize to be done, that action cannot be sustained. A man, for example, in possession of an office of a justice of the peace, though not its rightful incumbent, may render, in a case within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, a judgment valid between the parties thereto, but he cannot, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>by consent, render a valid judgment in an action which the office is forbidden to hear. He who is in possession of the office of recorder of the city of Albany may do every act appertaining to that office, but he cannot exceed the powers conferred by law upon the office, and to this proposition it is scarcely necessary to add the statement, that power attempted to be conferred by an unconstitutional statute is as much unconferred as if the attempt to confer it had not been made. The power and authority of an office must be conferred by valid laws and there is no legal principle which justifies the assumption of power upon the ground that it has been assumed. The adoption of such a rule would be utterly subversive of personal rights and place every one at the mercy of an official who chose to exercise power beyond that which had been conferred. Let. us see the result of its adoption in this case. The point has already been alluded to in the general course of argument, but a more full reference thereto is justified by its importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">That the constitution of the state has positively forbidden the enactment of a local law operative in and applicable to the county of Albany only, for selecting, drawing, summoning or impanneling grand or petit jurors,\u201d unless as a bill it was reported to the legislature by <em>\u201c </em>commissioners who have been appointed\u2019 pursuant to law to revise the statutes,\u201d will be conceded. That the section of the constitution thus forbidding such enactment was intended to be operative is known from its language, and the reason for its adoption are shown by the report of the committee (Messrs. Brooks, Hern\u00e1n, Howland and Tracy) which reported it to the constitutional commission. It Was designed to secure uniformity in the administration of justice throughout the State, and to prevent the passage of a local bill, which might be aimed at its corruption. The origin of the act is also as a fact too well known to suggest any doubt as to its source, or an intimation even that it was reported from the commission to revise the statutes. If, then, the act of 1881, though within the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>stitutional forbidding, is still to be upheld, not only for the present case, but for all others arising within the county \u00f3f Albany, upon any of the theories upon which it has been sought to be maintained (other than those upholding its constitutionality), what becomes of the constitutional provision <em>\\ </em>Instead of being operative, it has become a dead letter \u2014 instead of being observed and kept, it has become 'of no account \u2014 instead of the constitution being the superior of the courts which it has created, judges composing them have become its superiors, and by the adoption of legal rules have made laws higher than the constitution. To no such doctrine should any judicial sanction be given, and though in this case the supposed law may have worked no individual injustice, and may never in any, it is impossible to sustain what has been done thereunder upon any such ground. That which the constitution declares shall not be done, when done, can never be upheld, even though mere abstract justice has been accomplished. The act is against public policy, subversive of government, and therefore never to be sanctioned, but should be promptly pronounced inoperative and void by judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The proceedings down to the time of the impanneling of the alleged trial jury have now been examined, and such examination leads me irresistibly to the conclusion that the court of sessions erred in overruling the objections taken to the alleged indictment, and in excluding the evidence in support thereof. The same questions were again made upon . the impanneling of the trial jury, and the rulings were also the same. These it will be unnecessary to examine, as the reasoning already given is applicable, and the last point made \u2014 that none of the questions which have been considered are (presented by the appeal \u2014 will now be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">It is insisted that section 511 of the Criminal Code only brings before the court for review such matters as by section 485 form a part of the judgment-roll. Grant this, and what follows ? By section 485 \u201c the bill of exceptions, if there be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>one,\u201d forms a part of such roll, and as one was made and forms a part of the roll, in this case, which shows that the proceedings and decisions hereinbefore detailed were had and made, we have all before us. It is absolutely impossible to separate the arraignment and proceedings thereon from the trial, for they were a part thereof as completely as that which transpired after the trial jury was impanneled. The arraignment, the objections to the alleged indictment, the offer of proof to sustain them, the plea to the merits, and all that then occurred, followed consecutively upon the same day, and all formed a part of one trial, the history of which we have before us, and no one exception then taken is more completely before us than any other. Section 485 of the Code speaks of no exceptions, apart from \u201c the bill of exceptions, if there be one,\u201d being contained in the roll of judgment. It does, it is true, enumerate copies of certain papers as also forming a part of such roll, but as to all exceptions which come before the court on appeal, they must be contained in the bill of exceptions. Neither is it true that section 455 prevents exceptions of this character from forming a part of this bill, That section expressly provides that an exception \u201cin the trial of an indictment * * may be taken by the defendant, to a decision of the court * * in deciding any question of law \u201d provided the \u201c substantial rights \u201d of the defendant are thereby \u201cprejudiced.\u201d It is, it seems to me, a contracted view of statutes and personal rights, which thus seeks to hamper this appeal. The ruling of the court below involved one of the most sacred rights of a man \u2014 his right to be tried for a crime only when indicted by a grand jury organized according to law. When this prerequisite to a trial, and conviction was not obtained, and a human being is in prison without this safeguard of his rights having been observed, this court should rather stretch than curtail its power to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">It remains for me simply to enunciate in conclusion my opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed. It would be more pleasant to agree with associates whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u2022learning and integrity I respect, than to differ from them, -but a most careful study of the questions involved in the maintainability of the jury law of Albany county, not only in this case, but in others argued at its court of oyer and terminer, leads -me irresistibly to the conclusion that chapter 532 of the Laws of 1881, by which the jury system for that county purports to be created is unconstitutional and therefore void.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
