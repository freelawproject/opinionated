Y. COMMON PLEAS.</court>\n<parties data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"b353-5\"><em>In re </em>the Assignment of John A. Swezey and Joseph Dart to John A. Bagley for the benefit of creditors\u2014And the papers on appeal to the general term from two special term orders.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-6\"><em>Assignment act\u2014Papers on appeal\u2014Separation of papers on two appeals in same proceeding </em>\u2014 <em>Opinion of cowrt below to be inserted in appeals from orders in non-enumerated motions </em>\u2014 <em>Papers not used to be </em>expunged\u2014 <em>Code of Civil Procedure, sections </em>135:1, 1356 <em>and </em>1361 \u2014 <em>Supreme Court Pules </em>40 <em>and </em>41.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-7\">Where, in a proceeding under the assignment act to compel the attendance of one of the assignors before a referee for examination respecting a trade-mark, as a witness, on the application of creditors, two appeals are taken by the assignor, namely, one from an order denying a motion to set aside the original order directing such examination, and the other from an order denying a motion for a stay of proceedings and leave to apply to another judge for such stay, the papers on the two appeals are bound up and served together:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b353-8\"><em>Held, </em>the papers on appeal are obnoxious to the objection of respondent\u2019s motion that they be separated.

A motion was thereafter made by Dart to set aside the original order directing his examination. The motion was denied and the examination directed to proceed before George B. Pentz, Esq., as referee. Then another motion was made on behalf of Dart for a stay of proceedings, pending a proposed appeal to the general term from the order denying his first motion. The latter motion was also denied. From each of the two orders Dart appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\">The papers on appeal from the two motions were bound up together and so served. An opinion of judge Van Hoesen, which was filed with his decision in the latter motion, was not made a part of the appeal papers served ; other important papers used on the motion were omitted, as respondents claimed, including an adjournment signed by Dart in person. Besides, among the printed papers was found an opinion of judge Lawrence of the supreme court, said to have been rendered in some equity suit in that court, concerning the same trade-mark \u201c Peerless,\u201d which was also the subject of the proposed examination before the referee. The motion comes before the court on an order to show cause why the appeal papers should not be separated so that the papers under each appeal and each order be printed and bound by themselves; why the papers should not be settled so as to contain all used and filed on the motion under which the orders appealed from were made and entered only; and for other and further relief.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-6\"><em>Chauncey B. </em>Ripley, for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-7\">I. The papers must be separated; at all events it must be determined by the special term what papers are the basis of each appeal <em>(Code Civ. Pro., secs. </em>1353, 1356, 1361; <em>Rules Supreme Ct., </em>40, 41).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-8\">II. The absence of judge Van Hoesen\u2019s opinion is fatal <em>(Rule Supreme Ct., </em>41).</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-9\">IIL The papers specified as used on the motion should all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>be inserted as they appear on the files of the assignment clerk <em>(Code Civ. Pro., sec. </em>1353).</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\">IV. Those not used and not found on the files should be expunged, including the opinion of Lawrence, J. <em>(Id. and secs. </em>1356, 1361).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\">V. The papers used and filed are enumerated in the orders entered, and they alone should be inserted. Among those are the adjournments ; one signed by assignor Dart in person <em>(Orders on file in cleric's office).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-7\">VI. The motion should be granted, with costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-8\"><em>Edward K. </em>Jones, opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-9\">I. The two orders relate to the same subject-matter, and so need not be separated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-10\">II. The opinion is only required to be inserted under appeals from orders in cases of enumerated motions. These are cases of non-enumerated motions, and the opinion need not be inserted <em>(Rules </em>41, 42).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-11\">III. All other papers used are inserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-12\">IV. The opinion of judge Lawrence was referred to by counsel on the argument of the motions at special term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-13\">V. The motion to resettle should be denied.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b355-14\">Van Hoesen, <em>J</em>.</author>\n<p id=\"AOD\">The papers on appeal are obnoxious to the objections made by Mr. Eipley, and his motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">The papers submitted on each order should be separated. My opinion should be inserted. The opinion of judge Lawrence was never read to me, nor submitted to me; but if it had been, it would not have affected my decision. This observation is not intended to apply any want of respect for judge Lawrence, or for his opinions, but is made because that decision has no bearing on the question involved in this proceeding. The indorsement of Dart at the adjournment should appear.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
