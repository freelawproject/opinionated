[shall be guilty of an offense]. We affirmed the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">Appellant has petitioned for rehearing on the basis of <em>U. S. v. Kavazanjian, </em>623 F.2d 730 (1st Cir. 1980), in which the court overturned a conviction under \u00a7 1324(a)(4). We doubt that <em>Kavazanjian </em>was correctly decided, but even if it was it does not control the case before us. There the defendants were charged in count one with acts of conspiracy, one of which acts was conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1324 by encouraging or inducing the entry into the United States of aliens not lawfully entitled to enter or reside here. Counts two and three charged substantive violations of \u00a7 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">The gist of the scheme carried out by defendants in <em>Kavazanjian </em>was to arrange, for a fee, for aliens to come to this country under the travel without visa (TWOV) privilege which permits an alien traveling from one foreign country to another with a stopover in the United States to proceed in \u201cimmediate and continuous transit\u201d through this county without passport or visa. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(4)(C) (1970). One traveling under TWOV must establish that he has confirmed means to leave the country, he must depart within eight hours or on the next available transport, and the responsibility for his custody lies in the transportation line that brought him to the United States unless INS intervenes. <em>Kavazanjian, </em>623 F.2d at 733. When the aliens involved in the scheme arrived at American airports defendants would take them (or steer them) to INS at the airport and on their behalf make application for parole, a temporary status available for foreign nationals seeking asylum in the United States because of persecution in their native countries. In some instances defendants spirited the aliens out of the airport without INS ever seeing them. After leaving the airport the aliens involved would have to later establish their right to asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-17\">\u201cEntry\u201d is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13) (1970) as \u201cany coming of an alien into the United States, from a foreign port or place or from an outlying possession.\u201d The court in <em>Kavazanjian </em>held that a conviction under \u00a7 1324(a)(4) required an \u201cactual or contemplated entry.\u201d In finding the meaning of \u201centry\u201d under \u00a7 1324(a)(4) the court adopted from other contexts a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>judicial gloss on physical presence consisting of freedom from restraint. It then reasoned that aliens entering under TWOV were not free from restraint but in the custody of the transportation company awaiting transportation out. Nor were they freed from restraint when under parole, because parole entails restraint and, in any event, has been held not to affect or constitute \u201centry\u201d. The court considered that the scheme might be a fraud and based upon misrepresentations by the aliens but nevertheless, in the end, any one of them might receive parole and then be granted asylum (and thus would never have \u201centered\u201d). As to those who fled the airport, on similar reasoning it was held that they committed no offense because later they were actually paroled. Finally, the court held that the offense could not be predicated upon the possibility that an alien ultimately might be granted asylum \u2014 and thus have moved from a \u201cnon-entered\u201d status to an \u201centered\u201d status because the possibility of asylum was too speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The appellant was not involved in any comparable Tinker to Evers to Chance scheme that for purposes of \u00a7 1324(a)(4) left his possible criminal responsibility in limbo. He contemplated bringing his passengers to the United States. He brought them by boat, clandestinely and at night, to the Miami docks. His passengers did not assert any status parallel to the TWOV privilege. They had no means for leaving the country if the United States did not admit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The ultimate thrust of the petition for rehearing is that appellant cannot be found to have violated the statute because his passengers were paroled (and thus were under restraint, and one under restraint has never \u201centered\u201d the country). Parole is a humanitarian device that permits an alien physically present in the country to have his status remain undetermined, without his being considered to have \u201centered\u201d the country, while his right to asylum is determined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[A]s the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cThe parole of aliens seeking admission is simply a device through which needless confinement is avoided while administrative proceedings are conducted. It was never intended to affect an alien\u2019s status .. .. \u201d <em>Leng May Ma v. Barber, </em>357 U.S. 185, 190, 78 S.Ct. 1072, 1075, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246 (1958) (construing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h), which pertains to aliens \u201cwithin the United States\u201d). The statutory provision authorizing the grant of parole specifically embraces this principle, stating that \u201csuch parole of such alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien...\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5) (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-12\"><em>Kavazanjian, </em>623 F.2d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">It would be a misuse of the parole concept to conclude that one who physically transports into the United States persons not otherwise entitled to come in cannot be guilty under \u00a7 1324(a)(4) if the United States grants parole to those brought in while it determines whether they should be given asylum. Indeed petitioner\u2019s rationale would apply as well if the persons brought in were arrested and confined, that is, placed under restraint in the purest sense. The petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
