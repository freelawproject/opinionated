CLARK, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">Plaintiff in this action, William Edward Green, brought suit against The Wanskuck Company and its division, The Edmands Company (hereinafter \u201cEdmands\u201d), pursuant to diversity jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Plaintiff sought relief under Texas\u2019 doctrine of strict liability, alleging that a machine designed and manufactured by Edmands was defective, unreasonably dangerous to plaintiff, and that such defective condition had caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The jury returned a unanimous verdict on November 16, 1979, finding in answer to interrogatories that, (1) defendants\u2019 product was defective, unreasonably dangerous to plaintiff, and that the defective condition was a producing cause of the accident in question, (2) $80,000 would fairly and reasonably compensate the plaintiff for the injuries he sustained as a result of the accident and (3) plaintiff assumed the risk of the occurrence in question. The court then concluded from the third interrogatory that Green and the intervenor, Texas Employers\u2019 Insurance Association, would take nothing by reason of their suit. From this judgment plaintiff Green now appeals. We reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">Green was employed as a machine operator by Aluminum Corporation of America (ALCOA) at its Scottsville, Texas, plant. The plant, which produces electrical conduit cable, first employed the plaintiff in May, 1973, as a helper in the Finishing Department, and approximately a year and a half prior to the accident, Green was transferred to the job of \u201cheavy machine operator.\u201d On February 7, 1977, Green serviced a machine designed, manufactured, and sold by the defendant. The machine, known in the industry as a \u201cfour-wire heavy duty twisting machine,\u201d twisted electrical fibers together in a fashion analogous to a spinning wheel to form one single electrical cable.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">The machine was purposefully designed to require gear changes in order to vary the diameters of the cables produced from the electrical fibers. In order to change the diameter a machine operator was expected to first loosen the central gear with a wrench, and then, placing both hands around the sharply-pronged circumference, to pull the gear down and off the first shaft, lift it up, and place it on the top of a second shaft. Because the gearbox was located within a few feet of the floor, the machine operator was required to kneel on the ground in order to achieve visibility and leverage. On the day of the incident appellant Green followed exactly this procedure in order to vary the diameter of the cable width.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The gear in question weighed 52 pounds and was coated with oil from the machine\u2019s oil bath lubrication system. At the time of the injury appellant loosened the gear with an Allen wrench, placed his hands around the circumference of the gear, and began to pull it downward along the shaft. As he pulled, the gear slipped off the end of the shaft, fell to the ground, and crushed Green\u2019s left ring finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Believing that he had severed his finger, appellant sought immediate attention from ALCOA\u2019s company physician, Dr. Cash. Cash sewed off the artery and then stitched the severed skin back together. Following this primary care, appellant underwent surgery on three occasions, and following the second surgery, developed blood clots in his left leg and was treated for phlebitis. Shortly after the operation to remove blood clots from appellant\u2019s leg, Green\u2019s surgeon, Dr. John Adams, referred appellant to a psychiatrist in Shreveport, Louisiana, Dr. William Wilkinson, who treated Green for \u201csevere depression\u201d for approximately two years. Between January, 1978, and May, 1978, while under Wilkinson\u2019s supervision, appellant was hospitalized for treatment of the depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Appellant originally brought suit against The Edmands Company in two counts, one in negligence and one in strict liability. At the close of the evidence, however, the court refused to instruct the jury on the negligence count as requested by appellant. Furthermore, over counsel\u2019s objection, the court instructed the jury that if appellant had assumed the risk of using appellee\u2019s product, appellant would not be entitled to recover for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">On appeal we are faced with the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">(1) Whether the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to submit appellant\u2019s requested jury instructions for recovery based on negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">(2) Whether there was insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to justify the submission of the assumption of risk instruction to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">(3) Whether the trial court\u2019s formula for discounting future damages was more stringent than the law required?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">(4) Whether the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to admit evidence of appellant\u2019s auxiliary employment benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">The trial court refused to grant appellant\u2019s requested instructions in negligence on the ground that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to justify the submission of the issue to the jury. Having carefully reviewed the record, including the transcript from trial, we agree with the trial judge. The transcript reveals that appellant tried his suit and introduced evidence based, primarily if not entirely, upon a theory of strict liability. Having failed to receive the expected results below, appellant may not now claim reversible error on the ground that a negligence instruction should have been submitted to the jury when insufficient evidence was presented at trial to justify such a submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">Although appellant designates three separate witnesses as having introduced evidence of an industry-wide standard of care, we do not find this claim supported by the transcript. A careful reading of the testimony of appellant\u2019s witnesses, John Gustafson, Gerald Rennell, and Perry Zetterlund, yields little testimony which could be construed to establish a violation of the standard of due care. We are further persuaded by appellant\u2019s opening statement to the jury, where counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">I have requested a jury in this case, because I want people like you to decide the justice in this case for Mr. Green. I want you to decide whether this machine was defective, and unreasonably dangerous. That is the whole issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">Tr. Trans., 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">We conclude that appellant failed to introduce sufficient evidence to justify a negligence instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">Turning next to the question whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the submission of an assumption of risk instruction to the jury, we find appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>lant\u2019s position meritorious. \u201cThe function of the reviewing court with respect to instructions is to satisfy itself that the instructions show no tendency to confuse or mislead the jury with respect to the applicable principles of law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Applying this principle to the facts before us, we agree that the submission of the instruction on assumption of risk was not justified by the evidence. The internal inconsistency of the interrogatories suggests that the instructions had the effect of misleading the jury with respect to the ultimate issue of liability, and the minimal requirements for a finding of assumption of risk were unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Assumption of risk is, of course, a proper defense to a strict liability suit. This court, in a diversity appeal, is required to apply the law of the forum in considering the substantive right under which the case is brought,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Texas Supreme Court clearly established in <em>Henderson v. Ford Motor Co., </em>519 S.W.2d 87, 90 (Tex.1975), that \u201cthe form of contributory negligence which consists in voluntarily and unreasonably proceeding to encounter a known danger, and commonly passes under the name of assumption of risk, is a defense under this Section [\u00a7 402A of the Restatement Second, Torts] as in other cases of strict liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In 1967 Texas extended the tort theory of strict liability set forth in \u00a7 402A to defective products which cause physical harm to persons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because appellant brings suit under \u00a7 402A, we are bound to apply the rulings of the Texas courts which have interpreted and applied that provision. In <em>Maxey v. Freightliner Corp., </em>623 F.2d 395 (5th Cir. 1980),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this court, in a diversity appeal originating in Texas, considered a suit which had been brought on behalf of the children of a truck driver who was killed when the fuel tanks on a tractor trailer he was driving ruptured and ignited. The district court set aside the jury\u2019s verdict that plaintiffs\u2019 decedent had assumed the risk by use of the manufacturer\u2019s product on the ground that assumption of risk was unsupported by the evidence. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, setting forth the standards which governed its determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">Knowledge of the <em>specific defect </em>and appreciation of the dangers created by the defect are required to sustain a finding of assumption of the risk. <em>Bailey v. Boatland, </em>585 S.W.2d 805 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Houston 1979). Cases in Texas on <em>Volenti </em>or assumption of the risk are clear in <em>requiring subjective knowledge and intelligent appreciation of the specific danger involved. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">In <em>Rabb v. Coleman, </em>469 S.W.2d 384 [, 387] (Tex.1971), the Supreme Court of Texas stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">The intelligent choice to expose oneself to a danger presupposes <em>an awareness of that particular danger. </em>The success of the <em>volenti </em>defense in Texas cases has turned on whether or not it was established that the plaintiff knew he was exposing himself to the danger which in fact caused him harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">623 F.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">Similarly, in <em>Henderson v. Ford Motor Company, </em>519 S.W.2d 87, 91 (Tex.1974), the Supreme Court of Texas formulated the test this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-17\">We do recognize that the assumption of risk defense requires a <em>voluntary </em>encounter with the danger of risk \u2014 which means by free and intelligent choice .... [In determining] whether an issue of assump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tion of risk was raised by the evidence ... under the Texas cases the inquiry is whether Mrs. Henderson voluntarily exposed herself to the risk with knowledge and appreciation of the danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">As these cases make clear, the mere fact that an individual might have, or should have, been aware of the particular risk, is insufficient to establish the defense. As a matter of law, evidence of voluntariness is an absolute prerequisite for submission of the instruction to the jury. An individual who has no choice but to encounter the risk cannot be found to have voluntarily encountered the risk. The trial court accurately set forth these requirements in its charge to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">This [assumption of risk] is a subjective test. The Defendants must show that Plaintiff, himself, actually had knowledge and appreciation of the danger. A showing that Plaintiff should have known or appreciated the danger would not establish that Plaintiff assumed the risk at the time of the injury in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">You are instructed that the Plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of a risk is not voluntary, if the Defendant\u2019s conduct has left him <em>no reasonable alternative </em>course of conduct in order to avert harm to himself or another, or to exercise or protect a right or privilege of which the Defendants have no right to deprive him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Tr. Trans., 497-98 (emphasis added). With these requirements in mind, we consider the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Mr. George Green, Jr., a consulting engineer and the defendants\u2019 own witness, testified that the four-wire twisting machine was designed in order to require individuals to manually change gears according to the procedures which were followed by the appellant. Furthermore, defendants failed to introduce evidence that Green had engaged in procedures unanticipated by the manufacturer in changing the gear in question. In fact, the company\u2019s expert witness confirmed that the \u201cmachine was designed so that workers had to put their hands around the teeth of the gear to change the gears\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and admitted that although alternative methods could have been devised to avoid manual gear changes, none was provided. One alternative would have been to provide \u201cT-wrenches\u201d which could be used to grasp the gear prongs and eliminate the necessity of gripping the gear barehanded. In response to the question \u201c[A]re the T-wrenches any aid in moving it [the gear] from one shaft to another?\u201d, defendants\u2019 witness responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">I think the T-wrenches in this particular installation, sir, would serve a purpose, sir, and assist the operator. One thing it gets him off \u2014 up off the floor a little bit. Since this thing is installed down in a pit it\u2019s very difficult for him to reach it. He doesn\u2019t have to reach under the gear to be able to pull it off. He can reach the T-handles which give him an additional four, five or six inches of height.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Tr. Trans., 408. Nevertheless, defendants failed to provide T-wrenches, or any other alternatives, but rather anticipated that operators would use their hands. Appellant did so and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Looking to the instructions given by the trial court and considering, again, that voluntariness is a mandatory prerequisite to a finding of assumption of risk, the evidence presented at trial cannot be squared with the minimal legal requirements for submission of assumption of risk instructions to the jury. The trial court\u2019s assumption of risk charge accurately summarized the law in stating that \u201cacceptance of the risk is not voluntary, if the Defendants\u2019 conduct has left him [plaintiff] no reasonable alternative course of conduct.\u201d Where, as here, appellant followed the procedures contemplated by the manfacturer who offered no alternative course of conduct to accomplish the task, we conclude that appellant cannot be found to have assumed the risk. As a matter of law, insufficient evidence was presented at trial to justify the submission of this instruction to the jury, and, accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Appellants also argue that the trial court instructed the jury to discount future damages to their present cash value at an overly stringent rate. We have read the instructions and find no error. The trial court instructed the jury to discount the future damages at a rate \u201cin which an ordinary and prudent person in this area would invest his funds for such a term.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not agree that this formulation conflicts with the \u201cunskilled investor\" standard which this court is required to apply. In <em>Johnson v. Penrod Drilling Co., </em>510 F.2d 234, 240 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Starnes v. Penrod Drilling Co., </em>423 U.S. 839, 96 S.Ct. 68, 46 L.Ed.2d 58 (1975), this court held that future earnings should be discounted to their present cash value, provided the discount rate was not computed \u201cupon a basis that ... call[ed] upon the beneficiaries to exercise ... [investment] skill, for where this is necessarily employed, the interest return is in part earned by the investor rather than by the investment.\u201d In the instant case the discount rate did not require the beneficiary to exercise special financial skill, but merely \u201cordinary and prudent\u201d skill, and therefore we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Appellant\u2019s fourth and final point is that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to admit evidence of appellant\u2019s auxiliary employment benefits. We find no merit in this argument because it misstates the facts. Although evidence of auxiliary benefits is generally admissible in determining damage awards for future lost earnings, such damages are limited to \u201cthe gross earnings lost due to defendant\u2019s wrong or neglect.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>510 F.2d at 237. Where, as here, appellant attempted to introduce evidence of auxiliary benefits in an exhibit which included the total cost of all benefits furnished by the employer, including benefits which appellant would never have received, the trial court properly excluded the exhibit. Had plaintiff below offered to introduce only those auxiliary benefits to which plaintiff would have been entitled, we might now consider appellant\u2019s auxiliary benefits argument. Because the trial judge was never given an opportunity to rule on this issue, however, we cannot consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We REVERSE and REMAND for entry of judgment for plaintiff consistent with the finding of the jury.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">.
