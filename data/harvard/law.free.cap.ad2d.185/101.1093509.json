Defendant William Blacknall\u2019s conviction was previously affirmed by this court. Defendant Jamel Blackmail\u2019s appeal was heard later, resulting in a modification of the judgment on the ground that the statutory definition of \"physical injury\u201d was not satisfied by the record evidence. In Jamel Blackmail\u2019s appeal, we reversed the conviction for counts two and three of the indictment, charging, respectively, robbery in the second degree and burglary in the first degree, and dismissed counts two and three of the indictment [185 AD2d 108 (decided herewith)]. We now recall and vacate our prior order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>affirming William Blacknall\u2019s conviction and apply the same reasoning to modify his conviction, <em>sua sponte, </em>in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\">William Blacknall was acquitted of count two of the indictment, which charged him with robbery in the second degree on a theory of causing physical injury to a non-participant (Penal Law \u00a7 160.10 [2] [a]), but was convicted of count one charging robbery in the second degree on a theory of being aided by another person actually present (Penal Law \u00a7 160.10 [1]). The robbery conviction was properly affirmed, but the burglary conviction, based on causing physical injury, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">With respect to defendant\u2019s conviction under the indictment, charging burglary in the first degree, defendant\u2019s conviction under count three must be reversed for failure to prove physical injury to a non-participant. As is here relevant, the proof at trial showed that the brothers entered the apartment of the complainant, Angel Rivera, and that one of the brothers grabbed Rivera around the neck while the other demanded to know where Rivera\u2019s money was. After the brothers had located Rivera\u2019s money and taken it from him, they punched him in the stomach and fled. When asked if he felt any pain when he was punched, Rivera testified: \"Yes, at that moment I felt a little pain, but after that I tried to get after them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\"Physical injury\u201d is defined as \"impairment of physical condition or substantial pain\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 [9]). While the issue of whether the People have proven that defendant caused the victim substantial pain is generally one for the jury <em>(see, People v Rojas, </em>61 NY2d 726, 727), there is a threshold level below which the question becomes a matter of law. In <em>Matter of Philip A. </em>(49 NY2d 198, 200), the Court held that where the victim testifies merely that he \"was hit, that it caused him pain, the degree of which was not spelled out\u201d, the evidence was insufficient to establish substantial pain. That is the case here as well, where there was absolutely no indication respecting the degree of pain suffered by the complainant or of any residual impairment or need for medical attention <em>(see, People v Brown, </em>145 AD2d 301, <em>lv denied </em>73 NY2d 1012; <em>People v Oquendo, </em>134 AD2d 203, <em>lv denied </em>70 NY2d 959).
