The situation presented is that Corn Products Eefining Company, a New Jersey corporation, owned a tract of about 26 acres in Edgewater, a borough of Bergen County, together with the building thereon and some personal property therein contained. In 1942 the realty was taken over by the national government in a statutory eminent domain proceeding, the details of which are of no present importance. At the time of that transfer, the property was subject to the annual tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>for 1942. Under the law this tax liability is to be divided between former and new owner proportionately to the respective periods of ownership during the tax year. <em>R. S. </em>54 :A-56. The date of transfer of title was May 2d: so, for convenience of discussion, we treat the date as May 1st, and the period of Corn Products ownership as terminating with April 30th, and consisting of 4/12 or 1/3 of the taxing year. It follows, of course, that Corn Products was liable for 1/3 of the annual tax on the realty, and the whole tax on the personalty, which did not pass to the national government.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The realty tax for the year as finally settled amounted to ................ . $56,162.61</p>\n<p id=\"Ash\">of which Corn Products owed for four months (1/3 of the tax year) $18,720.87</p>\n<p id=\"AgB\">Corn Products also owed taxes on the personalty which did not pass to the national government, for the whole year, amounting to...... 5,666.36</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Total tax liability of Corn Products Company .................. $24,387.23 Corn Products actually paid in all . $51,017.94</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Over-payment by Corn Products Company ................ $26,630.71</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">Judgment for that amount will be entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">Tf the tax liability of Corn Products be figured as including the two days in May, at $15.38 per day, the over-payment will be reduced by $30.76 and judgment go for $25,599.95, with interest.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
