S. </em>43:21 \u2014 19. The applicable part of the cited section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">\u201c(i) (1) \u2018Employment\u2019 means service, including service in interstate commerce performed for remuneration or under any contract of hire, written or oral, express or implied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">\u201c(6) Services performed by an individual for remuneration shall be deemed to be employment subject to this chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the commission that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201c(A) such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services, both under his contract of service and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJj\">\u201c(B) such service is either outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed, or that such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enteprise for which such service is performed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqH\">\u201c(C) such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In <em>Electrolux Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Review, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>157, the Court of Errors and Appeals held that all services performed by an individual for remuneration were employment within the purview of the act, unless all three tests enumerated above as A, B, C, are met. Referring to test B it is obvious that the service to be performed by the specialty artists in this case was not \u201coutside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed.\u201d Since the service does not meet test B above quoted, it is, under the cited decision, to be considered employment subject to the act. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
