She also has a right of way for all purposes appurtenant to said premises along her northerly boundary line, the right of way being ten feet in width and extending easterly from South Park Street to a public municipal parking plaza recently established by the Town of Montclair. The town acquired the fee to the ten-foot strip of land subject to relator\u2019s right as indicated in the conveyances. The public parking plaza is a large affair designed for the accommodation of nearly 200 automobiles at one time and has installed upon it parking meters.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The relator contends that there has been \u201ca taking of her property\u201d and asks for a writ of <em>mandamus </em>to compel the town to institute condemnation proceedings in accordance with the doctrine enunciated in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>1-36 <em>N. J. L. </em>183.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The issue is presented by a rule to show cause under which no depositions were taken but is submitted on a stipulated state of facts. Included therein is the deed <em>(Exhibit R-l) </em>creating the relator\u2019s easement described as \u201cTogether with a right of way for all purposes from Bradford Place to the rear of said premises over a strip of land ten feet in width adjoining the above described property on the north, which said right of way shall be appurtenant to the above described premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In the facts agreed upon, under the following subtitle, \u201cAs to Possession of the Town of Montclair,\u201d there is a statement of the population of the town and the fact that it paved and \u201cis using the premises described in Schedule fB\u2019 as an entrance to the principal municipal parking plaza of said Town.\u201d Under subtitle \u201cExhibits,\u201d in the last paragraph it is stipulated: \u201c* * * the encroachments on the property of Relator were made inadvertently and have this date been removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The relator contends that \u201cprivate property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation;\u201d that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>destruction, restriction, diminution or interruption by public authority of the rights of an owner of a private right of way constitute a taking within the moaning of the constitutional provisions relating thereto;\u201d that \u201can interference by public authority with a private right of way created by express grant constitutes an impairment of contract;\u201d and that \u201cthe owner of the servient tenement cannot materially affect or alter the rights and duties of the owner of an easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Yone of these legal conclusions are disputed by the respondents. In answer to the first point they contend \u201cthere has been no interference in any way with the relator\u2019s easement, nor has it been extinguished in whole or in part.\u201d As to the second point they \u201cdo not deny that they cannot interfere with the relator\u2019s right of way, but they insist that there has been no such interference, nor do the stipulated facts show' any.\u201d As to the third point the respondents say they \u201cdo not deny that if they interfere in any way with the legal rights of the relator in the right of way the property should be condemned.\u201d As to the fourth point the respondents admit they must not interfere with the relator\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Assuming without admitting the legal principles advanced by the relator, and taking into consideration her admission on oral argument that she had no exclusive right, we are unable to find proof in the case establishing an interference with or an extinguishment of the relator\u2019s easement or right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Before a writ of <em>mandamus </em>is allowed the right of the relator and the public duty sought to be enforced must both be clear and certain. <em>Beronio </em>v. <em>Pension Commission of </em>Hoboken, 130 <em>N. J. L. </em>620.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The relator has failed to meet the burden of proof required and the rule to show cause will therefore be discharged, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
