The application for writ of <em>certiorari </em>was made July 7th, 1947. The applicable statute <em>R. S. </em>40:55-46 provides that \u201cNo writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review any decision of the Board of Adjustment shall issue unless application therefor be made within thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board. * * *\u201d A reasonable statutory limitation upon the time within which <em>certiorari </em>may issue has been held constitutional and what is a reasonable limitation will be determined upon the facts of each case as it arises. <em>Owen et al. </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>145.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">We deem that a thirty day limitation within which to apply for a writ of\u2019 <em>certiorari </em>to review a decision of a Board of Adjustment is a reasonable one and that prosecutor\u2019s application was not within time. The rule to show cause is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
