A month later Howard billed the appellant' for the coat and several dresses and instituted suit for collection. Appellant, having been informed of the part payment, settled the claim for $150. Four months later he found a copy of the original invoice for the coat, addressed to Mrs. Boorstein, on which was written, \u201cBalance to be paid in cash.\u201d Interpreting this to mean the coat was not purchased on his credit, he'demanded the return of the $150, for which sum this action was brought.
