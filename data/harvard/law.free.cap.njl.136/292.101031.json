On October lOtli, 1946, the respondent moved the dismissal of the petition upon the ground that the petition was not filed within two years from the date of the accident or within two years from the date of any compensation to the petitioner\u2019s decedent and that, therefore, the Bureau was without jurisdiction. The motion was denied without the filing of any reasons for the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">By <em>R. S. </em>34:15-41 it is provided that in ease of personal injury or death all claims for compensation on account thereof shall be forever barred unless the petition is filed with the secretary of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau as prescribed by <em>R. S. </em>34:15-51. The latter section provides that every claimant \u201cshall, unless a settlement is effected or a petition filed under the provisions of section 34 :15-50 of this title, file a petition in duplicate with the secretary of the bureau in his office, at the state house, in Trenton, within two years after the date on which the accident occurred, or in case an agreement for compensation has been made between the employer and the claimant, then within two years after the failure of the employer to make payment pursuant to the terms of such agreement; or in case a part of the compensation has been paid by the employer, then within two years after the last payment of compensation.\u201d There is no showing or allegation of any of the exceptions named in the statute. The time period is jurisdictional. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Beller Electric Supply Co., </em>100 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>444; <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Newark Hardware, &amp;c., Co., </em>107 <em>Id. </em>24; <em>affirmed, </em>109 <em>Id. </em>266. <em>Cf. Stockheimer </em>v. <em>The Carwin Co., </em>135 <em>Id. </em>49. The failure to file the petition within the statutory period barred the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The order in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau will be reversed, with costs. The record will be remanded to the end that an order dismissing the petition be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
