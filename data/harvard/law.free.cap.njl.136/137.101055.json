S. </em>34:15-7, <em>et seq.) </em>in these circumstances, established by stipulation of the parties and supplemental testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">On August 8th, 1942, the deceased employee, Peter Hardt, suffered death by an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment with prosecutor \u201cas a barge captain or bargeman,\u201d while the barge to which he was assigned was moored in Harrison, New Jersey, to a pier in the Passaic River, at that point a navigable water of the United States. The fatality occurred at about 10:00 f. m., in this wise, according to the stipulation: \u201cThe decedent had gone ashore from the barge and after visiting the Peanut Bar at Harrison with friends and relatives was returning to the barge and upon reaching the pier found that the tide had lowered some three feet and that the barge itself was away from the pier a distance of some three feet or so. The decedent jumped from the pier or dock to the barge, landing on the deck of the barge, in an upright position, but for some reason not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>disclosed, decedent lost liis balance and fell backwards into the Passaic River and died as a result of drowning. * * * There was a ladder on the barge but apparently the decedent did not take the ladder from the barge to go to the Peanut Bar some two hours or so before the accident.\u201d The decedent\u2019s niece, an eye-witness, testified that he \u201csat down on the edge\u201d of the dock and \u201cput his hands down and then he heaved.\u201d The vessel had a \u201cnarrow\u201d walk around its outer edge; and it was upon this that the decedent \u201clanded\u201d when he jumped or sprang from the dock. The decedent was required to be upon the barge \u201call the time\u201d day and night, termed \u201ca twenty-four hour da}\u2019;\u201d and he was the \u201ccaptain\u201d in charge and the sole occupant of the vessel. This was the case also while the barge was in transport. .It had a cabin and sleeping quarters. The decedent was paid a monthly wage of $135. But he was given no subsistence; and there was testimony that during his absence from the barge on the occasion in question he procured some provisions for a voyage to Buffalo, New York, which he was about to make on the vessel \u2014 a journey requiring between 30 and 35 days. The employer is in the marine transport business. He \u201cis a resident of New York;\u201d and \u201cthe home port of the barge is located in New York State.\u201d The barge was moored to the Harrison pier a day or two before the fatal accident, on its arrival from the State of New York, \u201cand was being loaded with a cargo of scrap metal for delivery to Buffalo.\u201d As captain, the decedent had general supervision of the barge while in port and in transport. He had been in prosecutor\u2019s employ but two days when the mishap occurred. Tie rendered no service in the loading and unloading of the vessel\u2019s cargo, nor was he obliged to do so; and he had no shore duties. Generally, it was incumbent on him to throw, fasten and release lines at docks and in the canal locks, take the lines of the tugs and, presumably, care for the cargo. The employer testified, and there was no showing otherwise, that the decedent\u2019s duties consisted of making \u201cthe barge fast to the dock.\u201d pumping it out, placing the hatch cover after the loading of the boat, taking \u201cgeneral care of the barge,\u201d uncoupling file barge and making it fast to tbe walls of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>canal locks on the route to Buffalo, \u201ccoupling up\u201d the barge after it had passed through the locks, \u201csteering the boat behind the tug\u201d in the process of moving it through the locks, thirty-five in all on the trip to Buffalo, and to light the navigation lamps at night. The vessel had no motive power' of its own; it was moved by towing.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">After the reversal of a judgment of the Compensation \u2022Bureau dismissing the petition and the remand of the cause for further proceedings (23 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>369; 44 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>690), there was an award of compensation in the Bureau which was affirmed in the Hudson Common Pleas. The Common Pleas Judge conceived the issue to be whether the accident \u201chappened on land or on navigable waters.\u201d He found that the decedent \u201cjumped from the dock, landed on the barge in an unright position, lost his equilibrium, fell backward into the water and was drowned;\u201d that although it was stipulated that the decedent \u201clanded on the deck of the barge,\u201d he \u201cwas there only momentarily on his way from the pier to the water\u201d and he did not reach \u201cthe barge in the usual sense which means he arrived there safely or securely,\u201d and thus the'accident \u201coriginated on the land where the deceased first exerted the strength to jump and caused his body to move first to the barge momentarily and then to the water.\u201d These cases are cited in support of this reasoning: <em>The </em>Alna, 297 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>673; <em>Union Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, </em>211 <em>Cal. </em>398; 295 <em>Pac. Rep. </em>513; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Linde-Griffith Construction Co., </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>608.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">It is urged on behalf of the employer that \u201cthe cause is maritime\u201d and exclusively the subject of federal cognizance. The argument <em>contra </em>is that the barge \u201chad been withdrawn from navigation,\u201d and the decedent was not a seaman within the purview of the admiralty law, as supplemented by the Jones Act (41 <em>Stat. </em>988, 1007, <em>ch. </em>250; 46 <em>U. S. C. </em>A., \u00a7 688); and that \u201cthe accident arose on \u2018land\u2019 \u201d and so is remediable under the State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction reposes in the government of the United States. Article III, section II of the Federal Constitution extends the judicial power of the United States \u201cto all cases of admiralty and maritime juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>diction;\u201d and article I, section VIII confers upon the Congress authority to provide for the execution of all powers vested by the constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof. Section 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 <em>Slat. </em>76, <em>ch. </em>20) vested in the District Courts of the United States \u201cexclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, * * * saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.\u201d This exclusive jurisdiction was carried into the revision of the Judicial Code of 1911, in substantially the same language. 36 <em>Stat. </em>1091, <em>ch. </em>231. Of the legislative history, more hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The jurisdiction of the admiralty over torts, injuries and offenses of necessity depends upon the locality of the act. In the early English admiralty, it did not extend to waters <em>infra corpus comitalus. </em>In this country, the jurisdiction in admiralty extends to acts committed on the high seas and other navigable waters. The English limitation adverted to is not applicable here. Thus, in the exercise of this jurisdiction, the federal Supreme Court distinguished between injuries occurring on land and those suffered by persons engaged in maritime employment on a vessel in navigable waters. In 1914, it was held that a stevedore engaged in loading and stowing the cargo of a ship lying in port in navigable waters was performing a maritime service, and his rights and liabilities in ease of injury were matters within the admiralty jurisdiction. <em>Atlantic Transport Co. </em>v. Imbrovek, 234 <em>U. S. </em>52; 34 <em>S. Ct. </em>733; 58 <em>L. Ed. </em>1208. Three A-ears later, in <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. Jensen, 244 <em>U. S. </em>205; 37 <em>S. Ct. </em>524; 61 <em>L. Ed. </em>1086, the court ruled that stevedoring is maritime in nature and the extension, by express provision, of the benefits of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of the State of Yew York to longshoremen injured while so engaged conflicted with the cited clause of the federal Coustitution, and was invalid <em>pro tanto. </em>State legislation is an invasion of the federal domain, it was there declared, \u201cif it contravenes the essential purpose expressed by an act of Congress, or works material prejudice to the characteristic features of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>general maritime law, or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.\u201d This limitation, it was said, \u201cis essential to the effective operation of the fundamental purposes for which such law was incorporated into our national laws by the constitution itself.\u201d And it was pointed out that the remedy provided by workmen\u2019s compensation statutes \u201cis of a character wholly unknown to the common law, incapable of enforcement by the ordinary processes of any court, and is not saved to suitors from the grant of exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d Later on, in 1922, the court held that the local law governed in the case of a longshoreman injured on the land, although engaged in unloading a vessel, and hence the state compensation act applied. <em>State Industrial Commission </em>v. <em>Nordenholt Corp., </em>259 <em>U. S. </em>263; 42 <em>S. Ct. </em>473; 66 <em>L. Ed. </em>933. In 1917 and 1922, there were amendments to sections 24 and 256 of the Judicial Code, purporting to save to \u201csuitors,\u201d not only the right of a competent common-law remedy, but also \u201cto claimants for compensation for injuries to or death of persons other than the master or members of the crew of a vessel their rights and remedies under the workmen\u2019s compensation law of any State, District, Territory, or possession of the United States, which rights and remedies when conferred by such law shall be exclusive.\u201d 40 <em>Stat. </em>395, <em>ch. </em>97; 42 <em>Stat. </em>634, <em>ch. </em>216; 28 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41, 371. But these amendments were declared unconstitutional as an unwarranted delegation of the legislative power of the Congress and as destructive of the uniformity which the constitution had established and thus a subversion of the constitutional grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts. <em>Knickerbocker Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>253 <em>U. S. </em>149; 40 <em>S. Ct. </em>438; 64 <em>L. Ed. </em>834; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Dawson &amp; Co., </em>264 <em>U. S. </em>219; 44 <em>S. Ct. </em>302; 68 <em>L. Ed. </em>646; <em>Nogueira </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co., </em>281 <em>U. S. </em>128; 50 <em>S. Ct. </em>303; 74 <em>L. Ed. </em>754.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The decision in <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen, supra, </em>and the cases which followed, \u201ccaryed out a domain in which * * * state law could not constitutionally afford compensation to maritime employees;\u201d and the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (44 <em>Stat. </em>1424, <em>ch. </em>509; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>33 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 901) was adopted in 1927 \u201cto fill that gap in the system of workmen\u2019s compensation.\u201d <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Warner Co., </em>321 <em>U. S. 565; </em>64 <em>S. Ct. </em>747; 88 <em>L. Ed. </em>931. This statute grants compensation coverage for disability or death of \u201can employee\u201d as the result of \u201can injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) * * * if recovery for the disability or death through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by state law,\u201d but by sections 2 (3) and 3(a) (1) excludes from such coverage \u201ca master or member of a crew of any vessel.\u201d 33 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 903. This was in keeping with the expressed preference of the seamen\u2019s unions for the remedies of the maritime law over the proposed scheme of compensation. Thus, the design of this act was to provide compensation to employees in maritime service, except a master or member of a crew of a vessel, for disability or death ensuing from injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States where recovery therefor through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings might not validly be provided by state law. <em>Nogueira </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co., supra. </em>By section 5, the remedy provided by the act is made exclusive. 33 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 905. And so, section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act (known as the Jones Act), <em>supra, </em>granting to \u201cseamen,\u201d at their election, the benefit of the provisions of the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act, has no application to those entitled to compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. This classification has a sound constitutional basis. <em>Nogueira </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co., supra; South Chicago Goal and Dock Co. </em>v. <em>Bassett, </em>309 <em>U. S. </em>251; 60 <em>S. Ct. </em>544; 84 <em>L. Ed. </em>732.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Thus it is that the remedy for the injury or death of a member of the crew of a vessel upon the navigable waters of the United States lies in the maritime law as supplemented by the Jones Act, <em>supra. </em>For the remedies thus afforded, see <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Warner Co., supra. </em>The deceased emplo}ree was in that category. A barge is a vessel within the view of the Jones Act, even though it has no motive power of its own, for it is a means of transportation on water; and the \u201ccrew\u201d may consist of the man in sole charge of the vessel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>on a voyage. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Warner Co., supra. </em>Here, the decedent, like the worker in the cited case, \u201cperformed on the barge functions of the same quality as those performed in the maintenance and operation of many vessels;\u201d they differed from the functions of any other \u201ccrew\u201d only \u201cas they were made so by the nature of the vessel and its navigational requirements.\u201d This provision is to be assayed in the light of the anterior ruling that the term \u201cseamen\u201d included longshoremen engaged on a vessel docked in navigable waters in the work of loading or unloading. <em>International Stevedoring Co. </em>v. <em>Haverty, </em>272 <em>U. S. </em>50; 47 <em>S. Ct. </em>19; 71 <em>L. Ed, </em>157; <em>Northern Goal and Dock Co. </em>v. <em>Strand, </em>278 <em>U. S. </em>142; 49 <em>S. Ct. </em>88; 73 <em>L. Ed. </em>232. The aim of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act was to provide compensation for those who \u201care mainly employed in loading, unloading, refitting, and repairing ships.\u201d <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Warner Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We have no occasion to consider whether an accidental injury on land suffered by a crew member such as the decedent in going to and from the vessel for the purpose here indicated would be compensable under the State Compensation Act. Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, <em>supra, </em>incorporated into the admiralty law, is applicable where a seaman suffers personal injury or death \u201cin the course of his employment.\u201d Yet, as we have seen, the state law ordinarily governs where the cause of action arises upon the land. See, also, <em>The Admiral Peoples, </em>295 <em>U. S. </em>649; 55 <em>S. Ct. </em>885; 79 <em>L. Ed. </em>1633. The fatal accident here occurred upon the water, and, since it was a navigable water, the legal consequences of the accident are determined by the maritime law. Neither a seaman nor a longshoreman engaged in loading or unloading a vessel lying in navigable waters could constitutionally have compensation under a state law for an injury sustained upon the vessel. An act of Congress so providing would constitute an infringement of the maritime jurisdiction reserved by the constitution to the government of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">It was stipulated that after \u201clanding\u201d on the deck of the barge, in an upright position, the decedent lost his balance \u201cfor some reason not disclosed;\u201d and the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Common Pleas proceeds upon the hypothesis that at the moment when the decedent \u201clost his equilibrium,\u201d he had not yet \u201creached the barge * * * safely or securely.\u201d But this is a misapprehension oi the law. It is not a circumstance determinative of this question that the decedent\u2019s loss of balance followed the \u201cjump\u201d from the deck to the barge, assuming that the finding of a causal connection is not at variance with the stipulation; it was an accident upon the water nevertheless. Loss of balance is a hazard incident to the boarding of a boat in such circumstances. The early cases ruled that the admiralty had jurisdiction where the injury occurred while the victim was disembarking by a ladder or gangplank connecting the vessel with the shore, before he was entirely free from the ship and had safely reached the shore, but that in boarding a vessel the jurisdiction of admiralty did not attach until the person had reached the ship, and was entirely separated from the shore. <em>The Ainu, supra. </em>But this was an arbitrary formula that seemed io ignore the essentials of admiralty jurisdiction under the constitution; and eventually the ladder or gangplank provided for ingress or egress to or from the ship came to be regarded as a part of the ship\u2019s equipment and one so using it for ingress or egress as at the time within the admiralty jurisdiction. <em>Vancouver S. S. Co. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>288 <em>U. S. </em>445; 53 <em>S. Ct. </em>420; 77 <em>L. Ed. </em>885; <em>The Admiral Peoples, supra; Brady </em>v. <em>Roosevelt Steamship Co., </em>318 <em>U. S. </em>575; 63 <em>S. Ct. </em>425; 87 <em>L. Ed. </em>471; <em>Fan Shen Hang </em>v. <em>Prestlein, </em>88 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>42; <em>certiorari </em>denied, <em>Fan Shan Hang </em>v. <em>Prestlein, </em>301 <em>U. S. </em>705; 57 <em>S. Ct. </em>938; 81 <em>L. Ed. </em>1359; <em>Kibadeaux </em>v. <em>Standard Dredging Co., </em>81 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>670; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>52 <em>Fed. Supp. </em>98; <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>17 <em>Id. </em>252; <em>The Berwindglen, </em>14 <em>Id. 992.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">As we have seen, jurisdiction in admiralty over torts and injuries of this class depends upon the locality of the injury; and, after all, the ultimate and basic test is whether the injury occurred on the land or on navigable water. Did the substance of the injury originate on the land or on navigable water in the sense that its consummation somewhere was inevitable? Here, the substance and consumma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tion of the wrong or injury took place on navigable water and not on the land. The decedent \u201clanded\u201d in an upright position upon the barge after he \u201cjumped\u201d from the dock. Whether the loss of equilibrium was due to the movement of the vessel upon the water, or from another cause, we have no way of knowing; but, whatever the reason, the mishap was in essence an occurrence upon the water remediable under the maritime law only. There was not, in the \u201cjump\u201d from the dock to the vessel, the commencement on the land of inevitable injury. The drowning of the decedent was not the result of an accident upon the land, but rather the consequence of his fall from the vessel; and this was just as much a mishap upon the water as if the fall had occurred while the decedent, in boarding the barge, was using a ladder-provided for the purpose \u2014 even more so, for the fatal fall was from the vessel itself. Nothing happened on the land; the decedent merely left the dock by a somewhat perilous course, disregarding the established means for safety in making the passage, although his niece, her father and her cousin \u201cjumped\u201d from the dock to the barge without incident immediately after the mishap. What was done here was not the less within the admiralty jurisdiction because the decedent sought to board the vessel without the use of the ladder supplied for that purpose. Workers whose duties oblige them to board and leave vessels on navigable waters are in those endeavors engaged in what is essentially a maritime activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">While this is a borderline case, it is not referable to the marginal area arising from the blending of federal and state jurisdictions where the individual case suggests characteristics of both and so does not lend itself to absolute classification, and the doctrine of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Department of </em>Labor, 317 <em>U. S. </em>249; 63 <em>S. Ct. </em>225; 87 <em>L. Ed. </em>246, has no pertinency. There, the employee was a structural steel worker whose employer was subject to the State Compensation Act, but who at the time was engaged in the performance of a contract for the dismantling of an abandoned drawbridge which spanned a navigable river \u2014 essentially a land structure. The workman was employed to aid in the cutting of the steel, both on the bridge itself and on the barge underneath to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the cut steel had been removed for towage to a storage point. The activity was in the main of a local rather than a maritime nature. Compare <em>Martin </em>v. <em>West, 222 U. S. </em>191; 32 <em>S. Ct. </em>42; 56 <em>L. Ed. </em>159; <em>Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. </em>v. <em>Rohde, </em>257 <em>U. S. </em>469; 42 <em>S. Ct. </em>157; 66 <em>L. Ed. </em>321; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Parker, supra; DeGraw </em>v. <em>Todd Shipyards Co., </em>134 <em>N. </em>J. <em>L. </em>315. And in the Davis case, the State Compensation Act, unlike our own, applied to \u201call employees or workmen * * engaged in maritime occupations for whom no right or obligation exists under the maritime laws.\u201d The general presumption of constitutionality in favor of the state statute was invoked to sustain the state action in a case involving \u201cdoubtful and difficult factual questions,\u201d where there was \u201cno conflicting process of administration.\u201d The federal authorities had. taken no action under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act; and it was not shown that the employer had made the special payments required by the act or controverted payment in the manner therein prescribed. The \u201ctwilight zone\u201d was held to include \u201cpersons such as the decedent who are, as a matter of actual administration, in fact protected under the state compensation act.\u201d This conception does not do violence to \u201cthe characteristic features of the general maritime law\u201d\u2019 or the uniformity of its operation. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The judgment of the Common Pleas is reversed, without costs; and, since the facts have been stipulated, the cause is remanded with direction to dismiss the petition for compensation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
