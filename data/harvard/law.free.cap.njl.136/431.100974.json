Her husband sues <em>per quod.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">We find no evidence to sustain the judgment. There was proof only of defects in the concrete pavement resulting from ordinary wear and tear. There was no evidence of a structural deficiency in the sidewalk, or of faulty repair, or of any condition attributable to actionable negligence by defendant. Injury ensuing from defects in a sidewalk due to want of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>repair merely is not actionable. A landowner is not answerable for defects in a public sidewalk caused bjr w*fear and tear of the elements or public use, and not chargeable to his own wrongful act. And where a duty simply to maintain the sidewalk in a state of repair is laid bjr statute or local ordinance upon the owner or occupant of premises abutting upon a public street, its non-performance does not give rise to a cause of action in favor of one injured by a defect due to wear and tear. <em>Rupp </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>70 <em>N. J. L. </em>7; <em>McKeown </em>v. <em>King, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>251; <em>Braelow </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>100 <em>Id. </em>156; <em>Glass </em>v. <em>American Stores Co., Inc., </em>110 <em>Id. </em>152; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Jersey Central Power and Light Co., </em>111 <em>Id. </em>112; <em>Savarese </em>v. <em>Fleckenstein, </em>111 <em>Id. </em>574; <em>Volke </em>v. <em>Otway, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>553; <em>La Freda </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>125 <em>Id. </em>489; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Sanatorium, </em>127 <em>Id. </em>255; <em>Zemetra </em>v. <em>Fenchel Realty Co., Inc., </em>134 <em>Id. </em>358. The duty thus imposed is public in nature, for breach of which a private action will not lie. The principle is firmly established in our jurisprudence; and the legislature has not deemed it politic to enlarge the liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
