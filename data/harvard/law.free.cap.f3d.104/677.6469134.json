HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">The Texas Department of Transportation (TDOT) appeals the district court\u2019s order that affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying TDOT\u2019s motion to dismiss an adversary proceeding brought against it by debtor AER-Aerotron, Inc., to recover on various contract claims. The lower courts ruled that the debtor\u2019s action was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment because TDOT had waived its immunity by filing a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding. We hold that TDOT did not waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">In 1991, TDOT contracted with AER-Aer-otron for the installation of a statewide radio system. Things did not go well, and each side blames the other. In any event, TDOT terminated the contract in December, 1992. In January, 1993, AER-Aerotron filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in North Carolina. Although not listed in any of the schedules, TDOT was aware of the filing from the outset. Nevertheless, between February and October, 1993, TDOT sent four letters to AER-Aerotron demanding the refund of some $396,000 already paid under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">On April 24, 1994, AER-Aerotron filed an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court against TDOT for $224,000 allegedly owed for equipment accepted under the contract, plus other damages arising out of the cancellation of the contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Asserting that the action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, TDOT moved to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">The bankruptcy court denied the motion to dismiss on the ground that the letters sent by TDOT after it was aware of the bankruptcy filing were an \u201caffirmative demand\u201d that constituted a waiver of its Eleventh Amendment right to immunity from suit in federal court under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 106(a) (1993). <em>In re Aer-Aerotron, </em>172 B.R. 202 (Bankr.E.D.N.C.1994). On appeal, the district court remanded to the bankruptcy court for reconsideration in light of, the intervening enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-394, 108 Stat. 4150. On remand, the bankruptcy court found that the letters constituted a \u201cwritten informal proof of claim\u201d that was \u201csufficient to waive sovereign immunity\u201d under the new statute. <em>In re AER-Aerotron, Inc., </em>181 B.R. 268 (Bankr.E.D.N.C.1995). This order was affirmed by the district court, and TDOT brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">The bankruptcy court decided the case the first time under the pre-Reform Act version of \u00a7 106(a), which provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A26o\">a governmental unit is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which such governmental unit\u2019s claim arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-15\">Although the States generally have Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court, this immunity may be waived. <em>See, e.g., Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, </em>495 U.S. 299, 304, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 1872, 109 L.Ed.2d 264 (1990) (\u201cThe Eleventh Amendment bar to suit is not absolute. States may consent to suit in federal court.\u201d). The courts had not, however, reached a consensus as to what exactly constituted a waiver under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-16\">At one end of the spectrum were those cases that had held that the mere existence of a claim by the state was sufficient for a waiver. <em>See, e.g., In re Craftsmen, Inc., </em>163 B.R. 88 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1993). Further along were cases finding a waiver in affirmative action by the state evidencing a claim, <em>see In re Town &amp; Country Home Nursing Services, Inc., </em>963 F.2d 1146 (9th Cir.1991) (offsetting overpayments against Medicare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>reimbursements due debtor), and in written demands to the debtor of the sort at issue in this case. At the furthest point were those cases finding waiver only upon the filing of a formal proof of claim with the court. Although we had not yet addressed the issue in a waiver of immunity case, we had tended to employ a fairly lenient definition of what constituted a claim in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., In re Davis, </em>936 F.2d 771, 775-76 (4th Cir.1991) (\u201cFor an amended claim to be allowed in the absence of a prior written informal claim, the creditor ... must undertake some affirmative action to constitute sufficient notice that he has a claim against the estate.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">The bankruptcy court, after determining that \u201csome affirmative conduct\u201d was required before waiver would be found, held that the post-petition letters sent to AER-Aerotron constituted a waiver of the State\u2019s immunity from suit in federal court by the debtor to recover for a claim arising out of the same contract that was the source of TDOT\u2019s claim. TDOT appealed to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">On October 22, 1994, while the appeal of the first bankruptcy court decision was pending, the 1994 Bankruptcy Reform Act went into effect. The Reform Act purports to abrogate state governmental immunity in numerous respects; for example, states may not claim immunity from sanctions for violating the automatic stay provisions. <em>See </em>11 U.S.CA. \u00a7 106(a)(1) (West Supp.1996). However, the waiver provisions of \u00a7 106(a) of the former statute found their way into the Reform Act in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-7\">A governmental unit <em>that has filed a proof of claim in the case </em>is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to a claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which the claim of such governmental unit arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">11 U.S.C.A \u00a7 106(b) (West Supp.1996) (emphasis added). In adding the language highlighted above, Congress clearly eliminated those situations in which the mere existence of a claim would suffice to constitute a waiver. The question on remand to the bankruptcy court was how much more the Reform Act had changed the rules for finding a waiver.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\">The bankruptcy court framed the question as whether the new \u00a7 106(b) required that a <em>formal </em>proof of claim be filed in order for a waiver to be found. The legislative history was sparse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-13\">Section 106(b) is clarified by allowing a compulsory counterclaim to be asserted against a governmental unit only where such unit has actually filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. This had the effect of overruling contrary case law, such as [3 named cases] that interpreted \u00a7 106(a) of [pre-Reform Act] law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-14\">Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 \u2014 Section-by-Section Description; 140 Cong.Rec. H10752-01, H10766 (1994). The district court noted that, inasmuch as each of the three cases cited in the congressional report held that the mere existence of a claim was enough to constitute a \u00a7 106(a) waiver, the legislative history points toward eliminating <em>only </em>those waivers unaccompanied by affirmative action by the governmental unit. The court then concluded that informal written proofs of claims, such as TDOT\u2019s letters to AER-Aerotron, continue to constitute waivers in the same manner as under pre-Reform Act law; instead of using the term \u201cfiled ... in the case,\u201d Congress \u201ccould very easily have chosen to include the phrase \u2018filed ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>with the court.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Texas Dept. of Transp. v. AER-Aerotron, </em>No. 5:95-CV-146-H at 11 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 10, 1995) (order). AER-Aer-otron appealed again.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">The statutory interpretation issue is simply stated: Does a written post-petition demand sent to a debtor <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> satisfy the statutory waiver requirement of a \u201cfiling of a proof of a claim in the case\u201d? At a minimum, as noted above, \u00a7 106(b) removes from consideration the possibility that the mere existence of a claim against the debtor by the State still constitutes a waiver of that State\u2019s immunity. Even if the language of the statute were not sufficient on this point, the inclusion of the three cases noted in the legislative history as being expressly overruled settles the issue. The bankruptcy and district courts erred, however, in concluding that because <em>only </em>these three cases were expressly noted, Congress intended to maintain the expansive view of waiver \u201ccommonly found in bankruptcy practice_\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">When we are confronted with a question of whether a State has consented to be sued, the general rule is that we.will find a waiver \u201conly where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no <em>room </em>for any other reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., </em>483 U.S. 468, 473, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2946, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Perhaps the standard should be no less stringent when we are considering a Congressional attempt to define waiver. However, our interpretation of \u00a7 106(b) rests on that most basic guide to the meaning of statutes, the words of the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">The new \u00a7 106(b) injects <em>three new </em>related requirements: \u201cfiled,\u201d \u201cproof of claim,\u201d and \u201cin the case.\u201d Surely something in writing\u2014 something capable of being \u201cfiled\u201d \u2014 is required, and \u201cin the case\u201d connotes the involvement of the bankruptcy court clerk to some degree with the written filing. \u201cProof of claim\u201d is a specifically defined concept. Although the letters from TDOT arguably satisfy the definition of \u201cproof of claim\u201d in Rule 3001(a) \u2014 \u201ca written statement setting forth a creditor\u2019s claim\u201d \u2014 the same rule also prescribes an official form for claims. Rule 5005, however, requires that \u201cproofs of claim ... required to be filed by these rules ... shall be filed with the clerk....\u201d The plain meaning of the words of the statute leads us to conclude that TDOT did not \u201cfile[ ] a proof of claim in the case\u201d when it sent the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">We hold simply that a State\u2019s transmission to a debtor of a written demand for payment of a claim, without more, does not constitute the \u201cfiling of a proof of claim in the case\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 106(b) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. TDOT is immune from the suit that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">TDOT urges us to find a basis for reversal in the recent decision in <em>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), in which the Court held that Congress is powerless to abrogate the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity under the Indian Commerce Clause of Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Constitution. The Court has remanded one bankruptcy case for reconsideration in light of the <em>Seminole </em>decision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and perhaps the handwriting is on the wall that the abrogation provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act will suffer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>same fate as the statutes involved in <em>Seminole. See, e.g., Matter of Midland Mechanical Contractors, Inc., </em>200 B.R. 453 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1996) (abrogation provisions of \u00a7 106 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 Code do not affect the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity). Nevertheless, in light of our determination that TDOT did not \u201cfile a proof of claim\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 106(b) of the Reform Act, we have no occasion to address the broader constitutional question. <em>See State of Md. v. E.P.A., </em>530 F.2d 215, 227 (4th Cir.1975) (\u201c[I]f a case can be decided on either of two grounds one involving a constitutional question, and the other, a question of statutory construction or general law, the court should decide on the basis of the latter.\u201d), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>431 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 1635, 52 L.Ed.2d 166 (1977). There is simply no need to determine if Congress, acting pursuant to its Article I bankruptcy powers, <em>could have </em>abrogated the States\u2019 immunity when, under the circumstances of the case before us, abrogation never came into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">For essentially the same reasons we do not address abrogation, we decline to offer conjecture as to what ramifications <em>Seminole </em>might have with regard to Congress\u2019s power to define the circumstances under which a State is deemed to have <em>waived </em>its Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>See Parden v. Terminal Ry. of Alabama State Docks Dept., </em>377 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964) (question of waiver is one of federal law). The courts that have addressed the waiver issue in the wake of <em>Seminole </em>appear to agree that the filing of a formal proof of claim still acts as a waiver of immunity with regard to claims of the debtor arising out of the same transaction. <em>See In re Sacred Heart Hosp., </em>199 B.R. 129 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1996). Some courts have found that a formal proof of claim acts as a waiver in other respects. <em>See In re Headrick, </em>200 B.R. 963 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.1996) (State\u2019s filing of a proof of claim acted as a waiver of the State\u2019s immunity from sanctions for violations of the automatic stay); <em>In re Burke, </em>200 B.R. 282 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.1996) (same; violation of discharge injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">We realize that the power to define waiver can become the functional equivalent of the power to abrogate. Indeed, defining waiver as anything less than \u201cthe sort of voluntary choice which we generally associate with the concept of constitutional waiver\u201d permits Congress to do indirectly what it perhaps could not do otherwise. <em>Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare v. Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, </em>411 U.S. 279, 296, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 1623-24, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring). Again, however, inasmuch as we have already determined that TDOT did not \u201cfile[J a proof of claim in the case\u201d and, therefore, never brought the statutory waiver provisions into play, we end the matter there.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">The order of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss AER-Aerotron\u2019s adversary proceeding against TDOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">. The bankruptcy case was subsequently converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding, and the trustee intervened as a party plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">. Much of the caselaw on the subject of informal proof of claims has arisen in the context of late claims rather than waiver. <em>See In re Houbigant, </em>190 B.R. 185, 187 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1996) (\"The informal proof of claim is an equitable principle developed by courts to alleviate the harsh results of strict enforcement of the bar date.\u201d).

Texas asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court. The bankruptcy court and the district court held that Texas had waived its sovereign immunity by sending demand letters to AER-Aerotron with knowledge that it was a debtor in possession. The letters related to the inadequacy of AER-Aerotron\u2019s contractual performance. The bankruptcy court and the district court interpreted 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106 to provide that such demand letters constituted a \u201cproof of claim in the case\u201d and therefore amounted to a waiver under \u00a7 106. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>That section, as amended in 1994, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-4\">(a) Notwithstanding an assertion of sovereign immunity, <em>sovereign immunity is abrogated </em>as to a governmental unit to the extent set forth in this section with respect to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-5\">(1) [referring to this section 106]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-6\">\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-7\">(b) <em>A governmental unit that has filed a ;proof of claim in the case is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity </em>with respect to a claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which the claim of such governmental unit arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">The majority has today reversed the lower court\u2019s ruling by holding that \u201ca State\u2019s transmission to a debtor of a written demand for payment of a claim, without more, does not constitute the \u2018filing of a proof of claim in the case,\u2019 as that term is used in \u00a7 106(b) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.\u201d Op. at 680. Based on that statutory interpretation, the majority concludes that Texas did not waive its sovereign immunity. Because of the outcome that the majority reaches through its statutory interpretation of \u00a7 106, it concludes that \u201cwe have no occasion to address the broader constitutional question\u201d of whether the Eleventh Amendment bars this suit or bars Congress\u2019 attempt to define a state\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. Op. at 680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">While I would agree with the statutory interpretation placed on 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(b) by the majority, I conclude that we must address the Eleventh Amendment issue first because it determines our power as a court to make <em>any </em>statutory interpretation. And if we were to conclude that we have the power to construe the statute, we would still have to decide whether Congress had the power, under Article I, section 8, clause 4, of the Constitution, to enact a provision that defines when a State waives sovereign immunity before the federal bankruptcy courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">In the bankruptcy court, in the district court, and on appeal before us, Texas has raised two interrelated threshold constitutional questions: (1) whether we have authority to reach the merits of a statutory interpretation when Texas contends that it has not consented to this suit filed in federal court and (2) whether Congress overstepped its power in purporting to abrogate Texas\u2019 immunity under Article I, section 8, clause 4 of the Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because federal power to adjudicate against states is at issue, we cannot, as a matter of convenience, decide the statutory meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106 in order not to reach the constitutional questions. Rather, we must first answer the constitutional questions to determine whether, in the face of such a challenge, we have the power to adjudicate matters beyond the questions of our power and Congress\u2019 power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-15\">The Eleventh Amendment is phrased to limit jurisdiction of the federal courts as follows: \u201cThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XI. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the Eleventh Amendment to recognize that \u201cit is inherent in the nature of [state] sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.\u201d <em>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 1122, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996) (citations omitted). In <em>Seminole Tribe, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits Congress\u2019 attempt to authorize suits by Indian tribes against the states.. <em>Id. </em>The Court observed that \u201cfederal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting states \u201cwas not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hans v. Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 15, 10 S.Ct. 504, 507, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890)). Accordingly, we must first address whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Texas waived the benefit of the constitutional limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">Moreover, if <em>Seminole Tribe </em>made anything clear, it is that Eleventh Amendment immunity is a function of a State\u2019s sovereign constitutional status, not Congress\u2019 Article I powers. <em>See id. </em>at -, 116 S.Ct. at 1131-32 (\u201cThe Eleventh Amendment restricts the judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction\u201d). Accordingly, Congress\u2019 enactments under Article I are irrelevant to whether a state retains its Eleventh Amendment immunity because Congress lacks power to affect that immunity in the exercise of its Article I powers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">Thus, by analyzing Texas\u2019 immunity only in terms of Congress\u2019 Article I enactments, I believe that the majority has committed the very error identified in <em>Seminole Tribe. </em>By analyzing the question as it has, the majority suggests that states are amenable to suits in federal courts when Congress, acting pursuant to its Article I bankruptcy power, deems it so. Congress, I respectfully suggest, lacks such power in our system of federalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">Instead of interpreting an Article I enactment of Congress, I believe we must apply the constitutional doctrine of Eleventh Amendment waiver. To find a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, \u201cwe require an unequivocal indication that the state intends to consent to federal jurisdiction that otherwise would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, </em>473 U.S. 234, 238 n. 1, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3145 n. 1, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985). Since there is no such unequivocal indication here, I would agree with the majority that Texas has not waived its sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">In approaching the question without regard to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106, I do not mean to suggest that the statute incorrectly describes those actions which constitute a state\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. But such actions constitute a waiver of immunity <em>not </em>because Congress in \u00a7 106 has said so. <em>Seminole Tribe </em>held that Congress\u2019 Article I powers are irrelevant to an Eleventh Amendment waiver. Instead, a state\u2019s actions waive immunity when such actions are independently sufficient under Eleventh Amendment doctrine. Thus, although 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106 may restate the law of Eleventh Amendment waiver, it does not establish the law on the subject.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">. Although 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(b) speaks of when a state is \"deemed to have waived sovereign immunity,\u201d \u00a7 106(a) says that state immunity is <em>\"abrogated </em>... to the extent set forth in this section [106].\u201d (Emphasis added). Congress apparently believed that the \u201cdeemed waiver\u201d of \u00a7 106(b) was the extent of abrogation under \u00a7 106(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1186-11\"><em>. </em>The Supreme Court affirmed Congress' power, not involved here, to affect state immunity in federal court through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Seminole </em>Tribe, - U.S. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 1128.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
