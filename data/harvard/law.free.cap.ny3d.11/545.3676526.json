The Appellate Division majority erred in imposing a new, impossible-to-meet \u201cconsumer acceptability\u201d burden on plaintiffs, a radical and unprecedented step that effectively immunizes the entire cigarette industry from defective design claims. (Voss <em>v Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>59 NY2d 102; <em>Micallef v Miehle Co., Div. of Miehle-Goss Dexter, </em>39 NY2d 376; <em>Gonzalez v Delta Intl. Mach.

The Appellate Division correctly dismissed appellants\u2019 negligent design claim because there was no evidence of a safer design that would have utility similar to that of regular cigarettes. <em>(Voss v Black &amp; Decker Mfg.

This Court should affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s decision and order because it relies upon well-settled principles stated in <em>Voss v Black &amp; Decker Mfg.

Appellants\u2019 argument requires this Court to go beyond its defined role in this state\u2019s tripartite system and imposes a paternalistic view of products liability not considered in New York jurisprudence. <em>(MacPherson v Buick Motor Co., </em>217 NY 382; <em>Micallef v Miehle Co., Div. of Miehle-Goss Dexter, </em>39 NY2d 376; <em>Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v State of New York, </em>8 NY3d 14; <em>Matter of 89 Christopher v Joy, </em>35 NY2d 213; <em>FDA v Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 US 120; <em>Klostermann v Cuomo, </em>61 NY2d 525; <em>Codling v Paglia, </em>32 NY2d 330; <em>Pommells v Perez, 4 </em>NY3d 566; <em>Matter of Jensen v Southern Pac.

New York products liability law, as well as American products law generally, weighs heavily the interests of consumers in being allowed to choose products they deem useful and enjoyable. <em>(Voss v Black &amp; Decker Mfg.

Ignoring the fact that consumers of regular cigarettes would not choose to smoke, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed alternative cannot be justified on the ground that cigarettes represent a special category of products that deserve to be banned from further sale or consumption. <em>(McCarthy v Olin Corp., </em>119 F3d 148; <em>Estate of White v R.J.

Plaintiffs cannot prevail on a \u201creasonable alternative design\u201d theory without evidence comparing the utility of regular and ultralight cigarettes. <em>(Dreisonstok v Volkswagenwerk, A.G., </em>489 F2d 1066; <em>Monahan v Toro Co., </em>856 F Supp 955; <em>Dyson v General Motors Corp., </em>298 F Supp 1064; <em>Denny v Ford Motor Co., </em>87 NY2d 248; <em>United States v Carroll Towing Co., </em>159 F2d 169; <em>Lavespere v Niagara Mach. &amp; Tool Works, Inc., </em>910 F2d 167.) II. Plaintiffs offer no reason why their case should be treated differently from any other \u201creasonable alternative design\u201d case. <em>(Linegar v Armour of Am., Inc., </em>909 F2d 1150; <em>Singleton v International Harvester Co., </em>685 F2d 112.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b627-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b627-6\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Plaintiffs claim that two cigarette companies were negligent in designing their product, in that they should have used lower levels of tar and nicotine. We agree with the Appellate Division that plaintiffs failed to prove an essential element of their case: that regular cigarettes and \u201clight\u201d cigarettes have the same \u201cutility.\u201d The only \u201cutility\u201d of a cigarette is to gratify smokers\u2019 desires for a certain experience, and plaintiffs did not prove, or try to prove, that light cigarettes perform this function as well as regular cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Norma Rose, who died during the pendency of this appeal, smoked for more than 40 years, consuming more than a pack a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>day of regular cigarettes. Beginning in the late 1960s, the products she smoked were manufactured by the American Tobacco Company and Philip Morris USA Inc. Ms. Rose quit smoking in 1993, and was diagnosed two years later with lung cancer and another condition allegedly caused by smoking. She and her husband brought a number of claims against American Tobacco\u2019s successor (Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation), Philip Morris and a third company. All their claims except one for negligent product design were dismissed at the trial level and are not now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">A jury found that American Tobacco and Philip Morris negligently designed the cigarettes Ms. Rose smoked and, in later phases of the trial, awarded compensatory and punitive damages. The Appellate Division reversed the resulting judgment, with two Justices dissenting, and granted judgment in defendants\u2019 favor (53 AD3d 80 [2008]). Plaintiffs appeal to us pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a), and we now affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In <em>Voss v Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co. </em>(59 NY2d 102, 108 [1983]), speaking of a claim of strict product liability, we said: \u201cThe plaintiff... is under an obligation to present evidence that the product, as designed, was not reasonably safe because there was a substantial likelihood of harm and it was feasible to design the product in a safer manner.\u201d While this is a negligence, not a strict liability, case, similar requirements apply\u2014specifically, plaintiffs here had to prove that \u201cit was feasible to design the product in a safer manner.\u201d This means, to use again the language of Vbss, the plaintiffs must show \u201cthe potential for designing . . . the product so that it is safer but remains functional\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 109).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Here, plaintiffs presented evidence from which a jury could find that light cigarettes\u2014cigarettes containing significantly lower levels of tar and nicotine\u2014are \u201csafer\u201d than regular cigarettes, but they did not show that cigarettes from which much of the tar and nicotine has been removed remain \u201cfunctional.\u201d The function of a cigarette is to give pleasure to a smoker; plaintiffs have identified no other function. Plaintiffs made no attempt to prove that smokers find light cigarettes as satisfying as regular cigarettes\u2014indeed, it is virtually uncontested that they do not. Both regular and light cigarettes are available on the market, and the enhanced dangers that come from smoking regular cigarettes are well known, but large numbers of consumers continue to prefer regular cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>It is not necessary in every product liability case that the plaintiff show the safer product is as acceptable to consumers as the one the defendant sold; but such a showing is necessary where, as here, satisfying the consumer is the only function the product has. A cigarette is a different kind of product from the circular saw in <em>Voss, </em>whose function was to cut wood, or the molding machine in <em>Robinson v Reed-Prentice Div. of Package Mach. Co. </em>(49 NY2d 471 [1980]), whose function was to melt and form plastic.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">We find an apt analogy, as the Appellate Division did, in <em>Felix v Akzo Nobel Coatings </em>(262 AD2d 447 [2d Dept 1999]). The product involved in <em>Felix </em>was a quick drying lacquer sealer made from a highly flammable solvent base. The plaintiff argued that a safer design was \u201cfeasible,\u201d because a sealer can be made from a water base, but the plaintiffs expert \u201cadmitted that the water-based products take hours longer to dry\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 448). The court in <em>Felix </em>found that this \u201cfunctional difference\u201d defeated the plaintiffs case; the plaintiff failed to produce evidence \u201cthat there was an alternative, safer design\u201d serving the same function <em>(id. </em>at 448, 449). Similarly, here plaintiffs\u2019 case fails because plaintiffs failed to show that light cigarettes are equivalent in function, or utility, to regular ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Of course we are conscious, as everyone must be, of the irony in speaking of cigarettes\u2019 \u201cutility.\u201d A strong argument can be made that, when the pleasure they give smokers is balanced against the harm they do, regular cigarettes are worse than useless. But it is still lawful for people to buy and smoke regular cigarettes, and for cigarette companies to sell them. To hold, as plaintiffs ask, that every sale of regular cigarettes exposes the manufacturer to tort liability would amount to a judicial ban on the product. If regular cigarettes are to be banned, that should be done by legislative bodies, not by courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b629-7\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Bf\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. Plaintiffs met their burden of establishing that defendants were able to design a safer cigarette that maintained the functionality of a regular cigarette (see Voss <em>v Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>59 NY2d 102, 109 [1983]). The majority concludes, however, that plaintiffs were required \u201cto prove that smokers find light cigarettes as satisfying as regular cigarettes,\u201d and were further obligated to prove that cigarettes serve some function other than to provide plea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>sure (majority op at 550). In my view, this language improperly shifts the burden of proving consumer acceptability to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">At trial, defendants moved \u201cto offer evidence tending to prove that the \u2018safer alternative design\u2019 suggested by plaintiffs was not feasible because it was not acceptable to consumers (i.e., not commercially viable)\u201d (10 Misc 3d 680, 696-697 [2005]). The trial court denied that motion, concluding that evidence of commercial viability of the lighter cigarette was irrelevant to its feasibility or functionality <em>(id. </em>at 699). That was error and, therefore, I would remit the matter to Supreme Court for a new trial to permit defendants the opportunity to present proof of the alleged commercial unacceptability of the lighter cigarette as compared to the regular cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Jones concur with Judge Smith; Judge Pigott dissents in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
