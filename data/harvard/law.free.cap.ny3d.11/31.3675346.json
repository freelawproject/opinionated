The People offered them a plea bargain under which Baret would plead guilty to one count of sale and Nunez to one count of attempted sale. Under the People\u2019s proposal, Baret would get a 2 to 6 year sentence, and Nunez would get probation. The deal was offered on a \u201cno-split\u201d basis: it was not available to either defendant unless both agreed to it. Both did, and their pleas were accepted after each told the court that no one had forced him to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Before being sentenced, Baret moved to withdraw his plea. In support of his motion, he submitted an affidavit, saying that he had initially rejected the deal when his lawyer told him about it. (Unlike our dissenting colleague [at 35 n], we think it clear from the record that Baret\u2019s lawyer was not also representing Nunez.) Baret\u2019s affidavit continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201cShortly thereafter, Mr. Nunez approached me and began to put pressure on me to plead guilty so that he could get Probation. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cMr. Nunez told me that T better do the right thing and plead guilty\u2019 or he would make sure he \u2018did the right thing.\u2019 He continually told me that his life was \u2018on the line\u2019 and that he would \u2018do what he had to do\u2019 if I didn\u2019t plead guilty. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cGiven these express and implied threats from Mr. Nunez, I felt in danger of physical reprisal if I did not plead guilty. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201cOn December 23, 1996,1 appeared in Part 38 with [my lawyer] and Mr. Nunez. I was feeling a great deal of pressure from Mr. Nunez. My attorney told me I had to make a decision to plead or go to trial on that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">\u201cUnder such pressure, I agreed to plead guilty and accept a State prison sentence of two to six years. I was in shock during the plea proceeding and did not have a clear idea what I was doing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Supreme Court denied Baret\u2019s motion without a hearing. The Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting on the ground that a hearing should have been held (43 AD3d 648 [1st Dept 2007]). A Justice of the Appellate Division granted leave to appeal to this Court, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">When a defendant moves to withdraw a guilty plea, the \u201cfact-finding procedures\u201d to be followed \u201crest largely in the discretion of the Judge to whom the motion is made\u201d <em>(People v Tinsley, </em>35 NY2d 926, 927 [1974]). \u201cOnly in the rare instance will a defendant be entitled to an evidentiary hearing\u201d (\u00bfd.). Here, Supreme Court\u2019s exercise of discretion in denying Baret\u2019s motion without a hearing finds ample support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">Baret\u2019s affidavit suggests, but does not unequivocally say, that he pleaded guilty only because he was afraid Nunez would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>have killed or injured him if he did not. The affidavit does not say what basis, if any, Baret had for believing that Nunez was able to carry out this threat. And the threat itself, couched in ambiguous language, is presented without any specific context. The affidavit does not tell us when or where Nunez spoke to Baret, how often, or whether in person or on the telephone. Nor does the affidavit describe Baret\u2019s response. It uses such vague expressions as \u201c[s]hortly thereafter,\u201d \u201ccontinually,\u201d and \u201ca great deal of pressure.\u201d One would expect a man who had in truth been threatened with violence, and found the threat credible enough that he would accept a 2 to 6 year prison term rather than defy it, to be able to tell his story in much more specific detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We have no basis for disturbing the conclusion of both courts below that Baret\u2019s showing of involuntariness was too flimsy to warrant further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b112-7\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFW\">(dissenting). Because I think that connected pleas have an inherent tendency to coerce and, thus, deserve heightened scrutiny, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">At the core of the constitutional requirement that a guilty plea be entered voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently <em>(see People v Fiumefreddo, </em>82 NY2d 536, 543 [1993]) is the additional, unremarkable requirement that there \u201cbe an affirmative showing on the record\u201d that defendant waived his or her constitutional protections <em>(id.). </em>In my view, defendant\u2019s allegations of coercion\u2014though not a model of specificity\u2014under the circumstances sufficiently raised doubts about the voluntariness of his guilty plea such that, at a minimum, an uncumbersome evidentiary hearing was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">This Court has long rejected \u201ca formalistic approach to guilty pleas, preferring instead to leave the ascertainment\u201d of the satisfactoriness of pleas \u201cto the trial court\u2019s \u2018sound discretion exercised in cases on an individual basis\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>People v Nixon, </em>21 NY2d 338, 355 [1967]). However, on guilty plea withdrawal motions, defendants \u201cshould be afforded [a] <em>reasonable </em>opportunity to present [their] contentions and the court should be enabled to make an informed determination\u201d <em>(id. </em>[citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added]). This principle applies with greater force in the context of connected pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Here, defendant initially made it known to his first attorney that he wished to plead not guilty. The People then offered him and his codefendant a connected plea which would fail if either declined the offer. Prior to sentencing, and with new counsel, defendant moved to withdraw his previously entered plea. Defendant alleged, in a sworn affidavit, that not long after the plea offer was made, his codefendant \u201cbegan to put pressure on me to plead guilty so that he could get Probation\u201d; that defendant had \u201cbetter do the right thing and plead guilty\u201d or he (the codefendant) would make sure that defendant \u201cdid the right thing.\u201d Defendant stated that his codefendant \u201ccontinually told [him] that his life was \u2018on the line\u2019 and that he would \u2018do what he had to do\u2019 if [defendant] didn\u2019t plead guilty.\u201d Given these threats, defendant stated that he \u201cfelt in danger of physical reprisal\u201d were he to decline the plea offer.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In my view, defendant\u2019s allegations were not facially incredible. As Justice Marlow in dissent below observed, it is unremarkable that defendant did not show fear or otherwise suggest that his plea was involuntary, or outright accuse his co-defendant of physical threats since the latter was present at the allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We must take care to ensure that a guilty plea is not induced by fraud or coercion. On their face, the plea allocution minutes indicate that defendant satisfied all constitutional requirements for a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea <em>(see generally People v Nixon, </em>21 NY2d 338 [1967]). The problem, however, is that in certain cases, sole reliance upon the allocution presumes too much about what has previously taken place (or not) off the record. While the majority correctly takes stock of this reality, it fails to go one step further to recognize that in some cases, a defendant\u2014all sincerity and a good faith fear in the alleged threats of coercion notwithstanding\u2014will simply not be in a position to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>provide the kinds of specific facts sufficient to warrant further inquiry that the majority here requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Absent the kind of specificity the majority demands, defendants who find themselves in such a predicament would never be heard to complain. Although specificity in allegations of coercion entails matters of degree, and each case must be evaluated on its own facts, where nothing else existed to call defendant\u2019s credibility into question, we should discourage courts from rendering summary determinations that risk depriving defendants of the opportunity, however brief, to make an uncomplicated case of coercion, outside codefendant\u2019s presence (see <em>People v Picciotti, </em>4 NY2d 340, 344 [1958] [\u201cThe manner in which (a) statement (of coercion) . . . was made (if made at all), the circumstances surrounding its utterance, its impact upon the accused, . . . (and) whether reasonable, are matters to be considered and passed upon\u201d at a hearing]).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The hearing court here decided defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing, on submission of his affidavit only. It is difficult to adequately evaluate defendant\u2019s allegations on paper when he has never been afforded the opportunity to stand before the court uninfluenced by his codefendant\u2019s presence. Moreover, the court\u2019s frame of reference, in evaluating defendant\u2019s submission without a hearing, is the allocution minutes; so it is no surprise that the hearing court, in its four-page written decision on the motion spent all but a single sentence to state, in summary form, that defendant \u201cfailed to substantiate his allegations of coercion.\u201d The rest is dedicated exclusively to the uncontested, <em>facial </em>adequacy of the allocution minutes. As Justice Marlow noted in dissent, the allegations, if true, portray a picture of \u201ca defendant whose free will was beclouded by the coercive force of his codefendant\u2019s threats of future violence had defendant maintained his not guilty plea,\u201d and \u201cof a desperate codefendant who would not stop at acts of violence! ] to avoid going to prison\u201d (43 AD3d 648, 652 [2007]). This would not be an unreasonable conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Lastly, I would simply note that although the plea is a vital instrument of judicial administration, a connected plea should not devolve into a situation whereby a defendant feels irretrievably ensnared by a previously entered guilty plea which, in retrospect, may have been at best ill-advised or, at worst, silenced at allocution by the very presence of a coercive agent. It should not be that only defendants with an intimate understanding of his or her codefendant\u2019s wherewithal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>make good on a promised threat of future harm should, in effect, receive the benefit of a closer look at alleged threats of coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse and order a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Pigott concur with Judge Smith; Judge Jones dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\"> Defendant additionally asserted that he and his codefendant were represented by the same counsel at the pleading stage, and that their mutual counsel also put pressure on him to accept the connected plea. The People countered that the defendants were, instead, represented by separate counsel. It is unclear from the record, however, which version is accurate. In any event, even if defendant was represented by separate counsel, defendant indicated that his attorney advised him that if he did not accept the plea, his codefendant would not receive the plea offer. Though obviously not exceedingly probative, it does provide some context (however marginal) for defendant\u2019s allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
