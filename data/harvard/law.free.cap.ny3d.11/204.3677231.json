This Court has subject matter jurisdiction to review the order from which the Appellate Division granted leave to appeal. <em>(Burke v Crosson, </em>85 NY2d 10; <em>Barile v Kavanaugh, </em>67 NY2d 392.) II. Questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. <em>(Matter of Beekman Hill Assn. v Chin, </em>274 AD2d 161; <em>Fleming v Graham, </em>10 NY3d 296.) III. Partial contractual indemnification provisions, such as that between Judlau Contracting, Inc. and Thunderbird Constructors, Inc. here, are valid and fully enforceable under General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1. <em>(Itri Brick &amp; Concrete Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

Found., Inc., </em>315 F Supp 2d 504.) IV. General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1\u2019s legislative history supports enforcement of partial contractual indemnification provisions: the purpose of the statute is payment of damages according to fault. <em>(Burgos v 213 W. 23rd St. Group LLC, </em>48 AD3d 283; <em>Quevedo v City of New York, </em>56 NY2d 150; <em>County of Onondaga v Penetryn Sys., </em>84 AD2d 934; <em>Brown v Two Exch.

The enforcement of partial contractual indemnification provisions is consistent with the principles of common-law contribution. <em>(Dole v Dow Chem.

Where, as here, the indemnification agreement purports to require indemnification of a partially negligent party, General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 renders the agreement void and unenforceable. <em>(Itri Brick &amp; Concrete Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>89 NY2d 786; <em>Brown v Two Exch. Plaza Partners, </em>76 NY2d 172; <em>Smith v Xaverian High School, </em>270 AD2d 246; <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v State Ins. Fund, </em>266 AD2d 518.) II. The express terms of the indemnification agreement between Judlau Contracting, Inc. and Thunderbird Constructors, Inc. require indemnification for Judlau\u2019s negligence. <em>(Levine v Shell Oil Co., </em>28 NY2d 205; <em>Liff v Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., </em>29 AD2d 665, 23 NY2d 854; <em>Drzewinski v Atlantic Scaffold &amp; Ladder Co., </em>70 NY2d 774; <em>Walsh v Morse Diesel, </em>143 AD2d 653; <em>Velez v Tishman Foley Partners, </em>245 AD2d 155.) III. The indemnification provision at issue contains no terms expressly excluding indemnification for Judlau Contracting, Inc.\u2019s negligence. <em>(Itri Brick &amp; Concrete Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>89 NY2d 786; <em>County of Onondaga v Penetryn Sys., </em>84 AD2d 934, 56 NY2d 726; <em>Brown v Two Exch. Plaza Partners, </em>146 AD2d 129, 76 NY2d 172; <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v State Ins. Fund, </em>266 AD2d 518.) IV. To construe the phrase \u201cto the fullest extent permitted by law\u201d as implying that the negligence of the promisee should be excluded, so as to salvage an indemnification provision that would otherwise violate General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1, would be contrary to the legislative intent. <em>(Itri Brick &amp; Concrete Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>89 NY2d 786.) V. The cases cited by Judlau Contracting, Inc. generally do not support enforcement of partial indemnification based solely upon the phrase \u201cto the fullest extent permitted by law.\u201d <em>(Murphy v Columbia Univ., 4 </em>AD3d 200; <em>107 W. Apt. Corp. v K &amp; J Restoration, </em>19 Misc 3d 1106[A], 2008 NY Slip Op 50570[U]; <em>Rhodes-Evans v 111 Chelsea LLC, 44 </em>AD3d 430; <em>Jackson v City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>of New York, </em>38 AD3d 324; <em>O\u2019Connor v William Metrose Ltd.

Co. </em>(89 NY2d 786 [1997]) as to whether section 5-322.1 of the General Obligations Law allows a general contractor\u2014who has been found to be partially at fault\u2014to enforce an indemnification provision against its subcontractor for that portion of damages attributable to the negligence of the subcontractor. We conclude that the statute does permit a partially negligent general contractor to seek contractual indemnification from its subcontractor so long as the indemnification provision does not purport to indemnify the general contractor for its own negligence. As such, the provision is enforceable and does not violate General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">An action for damages was brought by plaintiff, Stephen J. Brooks, an ironworker, against general contractor, Judlau Contracting, Inc., for injuries sustained on the job while employed by subcontractor, third-party defendant Thunderbird Constructors, Inc. The construction project involved the renovation and restoration of a highway overpass. Upon grabbing onto a perimeter safety cable installed by defendant, Judlau, the cable came loose causing plaintiff to fall 18 feet to the pavement below and sustain injury. Judlau asserted a third-party claim for contractual indemnification against Thunderbird. The action was bifurcated\u2014a damages trial as to the underlying tort was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tried by a jury and the third-party contractual indemnification claim by the court. Following trial, Supreme Court granted Thunderbird\u2019s motion for a directed verdict dismissing Judlau\u2019s third-party claim holding that Judlau\u2019s installation of the safety cable in an \u201cineffective and unsafe manner\u201d was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs accident, that Judlau was accordingly actively negligent \u201cat least to some degree\u201d and that such negligence foreclosed Judlau\u2019s entitlement to contractual indemnification from Thunderbird.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201c[a] covenant, promise, agreement or understanding in, or in connection with ... a contract or agreement relative to the construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of a building . . . purporting to indemnify or hold harmless the promisee against liability for damage arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property contributed to, caused by or resulting from the negligence of the promisee, his agents or employees, or indemnitee, whether such negligence be in whole or in part, is against public policy and is void and unenforceable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of Judlau\u2019s third-party complaint against Thunderbird (39 AD3d 447 [2007]). It held that General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 bars contractual indemnification and that the contractual provision at issue was unenforceable, and further that the evidence in the underlying tort action established that Judlau negligently installed a safety cable causing plaintiffs injury. The court certified a question of law as to whether its order was properly made insofar as it affirmed the dismissal of the third-party claim for contractual indemnification. We now reverse and answer the question in the negative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">There appears to be no dispute that Judlau is prohibited from filing a common-law contribution claim against Thunderbird because Thunderbird is plaintiffs employer and plaintiff did not sustain a grave injury within the meaning of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11. Judlau asserts, however, that a claim for contractual indemnification lies since Thunderbird\u2019s negligence also contributed to plaintiffs injuries in that Thunderbird, having control of the workplace, failed to provide plaintiff with the necessary safety equipment to prevent his fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Unlike the indemnification provisions voided in <em>Itri Brick, </em>enforcement of the indemnification provision currently before us will not result in Judlau being indemnified for its own acts of negligence; rather, it is being indemnified only for those acts attributable to the subcontractor, Thunderbird. The indemnification provision of the agreement provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">\u201c[t]he Contractor shall not be liable for any loss or casualty incurred or caused by or to the Subcontractor. The Subcontractor shall maintain full and complete insurance on its work until final accep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tance of the General Contract. The Subcontractor assumes all risk of loss for all of its work regardless of whether the Subcontractor had previously been paid for it. The Contractor is not responsible to provide any protective service for the Subcontractor\u2019s benefit. The Subcontractor shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, hold the Contractor and the Owner, their agents, employees and representatives harmless from any and all liability, costs, damages, attorneys\u2019 fee, and expenses from any claims or causes of action of whatever nature arising from the Subcontractor\u2019s work, including all claims relating to its subcontractors, suppliers or employees, or by reason of any claim or dispute of any person or entity for damages from any cause directly or indirectly relating to any action or failure to act by the Subcontractor, its representatives, employees, subcontractors, or suppliers. The Subcontractor acknowledges that specific consideration has been received by it for this Indemnification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Contrary to Thunderbird\u2019s assertion, this provision does not violate General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 as it does not require Thunderbird to indemnify Judlau for its own negligence. The provision is clear, obligating Thunderbird to indemnify Judlau only when it is shown that damages were caused by Thunderbird\u2019s own negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">As we stated in <em>Itri Brick, </em>the Legislature enacted General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 in order to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">\u201cprevent a prevalent practice in the construction industry of requiring subcontractors to assume liability by contract for the negligence of others. The Legislature concluded that such \u2018coercive\u2019 bidding requirements unnecessarily increased the cost of construction by limiting the number of contractors able to obtain the necessary hold harmless insurance, and unfairly imposed liability on subcontractors for the negligence of others over whom they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>had no control. The agreements also needlessly created expensive double coverage for hold harmless or general liability insurance\u201d (89 NY2d at 794).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Since \u201c[o]ne should not be held to answer for the wrongful acts of another unless he is in the insurance business, assuming risks in return for payment of premiums\u201d (Sponsor\u2019s Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1981, ch 964, 1981 NY Legis Ann, at 502), for us to hold today that a partially negligent general contractor may never seek contractual indemnification for the wrongful actions attributable to its subcontractor would leave the general contractor liable for the negligent actions of its subcontractor. Such an outcome would be contrary to the intent of General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 that payment of damages be made according to fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Thunderbird asserts that the language \u201cto the fullest extent permitted by law\u201d broadens the subcontractor\u2019s liability to require full contractual indemnification, which includes indemnification for Judlau\u2019s negligence and is thus rendered void by General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1. We disagree. That language contemplates partial indemnification and is intended to limit Thunderbird\u2019s contractual indemnity obligation solely to Thunderbird\u2019s own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Our holding that the phrase \u201cto the fullest extent permitted by law\u201d limits rather than expands a promisor\u2019s indemnification obligation is supported by the holdings of other courts that have likewise held that such phrases create a partial indemnification obligation on behalf of the subcontractor promisor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Recognizing that these precedents are not binding on us\u2014and that there likewise are many decisions negating partial indemnification\u2014we adopt the broader interpretation as the more sound. Indeed, there is no language within General Obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tions Law \u00a7 5-322.1 that prevents partial indemnification provisions such as the one currently before us from being enforced in a case where it is shown that both a general contractor and its subcontractor are joint tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs, appellant Judlau\u2019s third-party complaint against third-party defendant Thunderbird should be reinstated and this case remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\">.
