II. The Appellate Division majority erred in granting summary judgment where plaintiff failed to establish its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law because (a) the notice of termination was predicated upon a lease that was declared a \u201cnullity\u201d for its purported attempt to exempt the subject apartment from the Rent Stabilization Law, and (b) there was no evidence in admissible form tending to establish that defendant maintained her primary residence at any location other than at the subject premises. <em>(Drucker v Mauro, </em>30 AD3d 37; <em>Riverside Syndicate, Inc. v Mun-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>roe, </em>10 NY3d 18; <em>Draper v Georgia Props., </em>94 NY2d 809; <em>Glenbriar Co. v Lipsman, </em>5 NY3d 388.)

II. The Appellate Division properly held that appellant failed to meet the primary residence criteria under the rent stabilization laws. III. The Appellate Division properly remanded the owner\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees and use and occupancy to the lower court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b394-7\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">We hold that, at least in the absence of unusual facts, a foreign national who is in the United States on a tourist visa cannot meet the \u201cprimary residence\u201d requirement of New York City\u2019s rent regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Defendant\u2019s landlord brought this ejectment action to remove her from a rent stabilized apartment in Manhattan. The landlord alleged that \u201cthe Premises are not occupied ... as the Tenant\u2019s primary residence.\u201d In support of a motion for summary judgment, the landlord submitted photocopies of pages from defendant\u2019s passport, showing that she is a British citizen and was admitted to the United States on a \u201cB-2\u201d visa, commonly known as a tourist visa. In response to the motion, defendant submitted no evidence as to her primary residence, essentially taking the position that the landlord had failed to meet its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Supreme Court denied the landlord\u2019s motion (2005 NY Slip Op 30126[U] [2005]), but the Appellate Division reversed, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>two Justices dissenting (46 AD3d 186 [2007]). The Appellate Division granted defendant leave to appeal, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Under the Rent Stabilization Code (RSC), a landlord may recover possession of a rent stabilized apartment from a tenant whose lease has expired if the apartment \u201cis not occupied by the tenant ... as his or her primary residence\u201d (RSC [9 NYCRR] \u00a7 2524.4 [c]). The Code does not define \u201cprimary residence\u201d except to say that \u201cno single factor shall be solely determinative,\u201d and to list \u201cevidence which may be considered\u201d in making the determination (RSC \u00a7 2520.6 [u]). An appellate court has defined the term as \u201can ongoing, substantial, physical nexus with the . . . premises for actual living purposes\u201d <em>(Emay Props. Corp. v Norton, </em>136 Misc 2d 127, 129 [App Term, 1st Dept 1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">But while the rent regulations require a \u201cprimary residence\u201d in New York, the holder of a B-2 visa is required to have a \u201cprincipal, actual dwelling place\u201d outside the United States. Federal regulations make B-2 visas available to aliens who are \u201cvisitors for pleasure\u201d of the kind described in section 101 (a) (15) (B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC \u00a7 1101 [a] [15] [B]; <em>see </em>8 CFR 214.1 [a] [1] [i]; [2]). That subsection of the statute applies only to \u201can alien . . . having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning\u201d (8 USC \u00a7 1101 [a] [15] [B]), and \u201cresidence\u201d is defined as \u201cprincipal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent\u201d (8 USC \u00a7 1101 [a] [33]).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Thus, if her B-2 visa is valid, defendant has a \u201cprincipal, actual dwelling place in fact\u201d outside the United States. How she could at the same time have a \u201cprimary residence\u201d in New York City is something she has not explained. The distinction between \u201cprimary residence\u201d and \u201cdomicile\u201d <em>(see Emay Props., </em>136 Misc 2d at 128), relied on by Supreme Court and the dissenting Justices in the Appellate Division, is not relevant, because neither defendant\u2019s status under the rent regulations nor her immigration status depends on domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">We conclude that, at least absent some unusual circumstance, a primary residence in New York and a B-2 visa are logically incompatible. No such unusual circumstance exists here. Perhaps there are rare cases in which a tenant could show that her principal dwelling place for immigration purposes is in one place, and her primary residence for rent regulation purposes in another, but defendant has not even tried to make such a show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ing. Nor has she suggested that her B-2 visa was issued in error, or has become invalid. Thus, we need not consider whether someone who is in the United States illegally may have a primary residence in New York for rent regulation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed with costs. The certified question should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b396-6\">Ciparick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWG\">(concurring). Because I cannot agree that, as a matter of law, a foreign citizen with a B-l (business) or a B-2 (tourist) visa is automatically precluded from maintaining a primary residence under New York\u2019s rent stabilization laws, and because I further disagree with the proposition that \u201ca primary residence in New York and a B-2 visa are logically incompatible\u201d <em>(see </em>majority op at 317), I write separately. I nonetheless concur in the result as I believe summary judgment was properly granted in this ejectment action since there are no triable issues of fact remaining as to the issue of primary residency considering the unrebutted evidence of the tenant\u2019s sporadic and tenuous ties to the occupancy of the apartment, her B-2 \u201ctourist\u201d visa, her admissions that she has not occupied the apartment for over three years (albeit due to a mold condition), reports from building personnel and the lack of New York State tax returns or other proof of residence. Defendant\u2019s attempt to rebut plaintiff\u2019s contentions in an attorney\u2019s affirmation pertaining to solely the issue of an alleged mold condition is insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) \u00a7 2524.4 (c) allows a landlord to refuse to renew a stabilized tenant\u2019s lease if the tenant does not occupy the premises as a \u201cprimary residence.\u201d The purpose of this law is to alleviate the shortage of housing in New York City by returning underutilized apartments to the marketplace for residents who need them <em>(see Matter of Herzog v Joy, </em>74 AD2d 372, 374 [1st Dept 1980], <em>affd for reasons stated below </em>53 NY2d 821 [1981]; <em>see also </em>Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1971, ch 371, 1971 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2608). It is axiomatic that residents of New York City who may be in dire need of affordable housing should be able to obtain such housing before occupants who reside elsewhere and misuse rent-stabilized properties as, for example, warehouses, pieds-a-terre for occasional visits or for other more nefarious purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The landlord bears the initial burden of showing that the tenant did not utilize the apartment as a primary residence <em>(see Glenbriar Co. v Lipsman, </em>5 NY3d 388, 392 [2005]). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the terminology \u201cprimary residence\u201d is, as the majority notes, left undefined by the Code, appellate courts have described it as \u201can ongoing, substantial, physical nexus with the controlled premises for actual living purposes\u2014which can be demonstrated by objective, empirical evidence\u201d <em>(Emay Props. Corp. v Norton, </em>136 Misc 2d 127, 129 [App Term, 1st Dept 1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"A0is\">The Code does, however, outline the evidentiary factors to be considered in determining primary residency. In doing so, it provides in unequivocal terms that \u201cno single factor shall be solely determinative\u201d (9 NYCRR 2520.6 [u]), because a court should consider all of the relevant evidence, if applicable, including: (1) the address listed by the tenant on any tax return, driver\u2019s license, motor vehicle registration or other document filed with a public agency; (2) the tenant\u2019s address for voter registration; (3) the amount of time the tenant occupies the rent-regulated apartment, specifically if the tenant occupies the apartment for less than an aggregate total of 183 days in the most recent calendar year; and (4) any subletting of the apartment <em>(see </em>9 NYCRR 2520.6 [u] [l]-[4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Although this record is replete with indicia of tenant\u2019s non-primary residency, the majority relies on just a single factor\u2014 her B-2 visa status <em>(cf. Glenbriar, 5 </em>NY3d at 391, 393 [parties put forward evidence of several factors in arguing primary residence] ; <em>Draper v Georgia Props., </em>94 NY2d 809, 811 [1999] [same])\u2014giving undue weight to federal immigration laws in addressing this case which is governed by the Rent Stabilization Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">United States Constitution, article I, \u00a7 8 (4) provides that the federal government has sole authority over immigration matters. The federal government passes immigration laws with a totally different purpose and intent than the Rent Stabilization Code. Consequently, the use of similar terminology in an immigration law should not define the important rights and protections for tenants under our rent stabilization laws. Thus, an analysis of a tenant\u2019s immigration status should not be dispositive or, in certain cases, even relevant to a resident\u2019s ability to maintain rent-stabilized housing <em>(see Balbuena v IDR Realty LLC, </em>6 NY3d 338, 362-363 [2006] [violation of immigration laws alone cannot prevent recovery of damages for work-related injuries]).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Furthermore, as stated in the dissenting opinion below, it is unclear under our current immigration laws whether a B-l or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>B-2 visa holder may be able to stay in the United States for more than one year. B-l and B-2 visa holders may obtain six-month extensions <em>(see 8 </em>CFR 214.2 [b] [1]), or they may be able to adjust their status by being granted (1) political asylum <em>(see e.g. Pavlova v Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>441 F3d 82 [2d Cir 2006]); (2) student visas (F-1 visas) <em>(see e.g. Ayoub v Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>708 F2d 721 [6th Cir 1982] [table; text at 1982 US App LEXIS 11305]); or (3) temporary-worker privileges <em>(see e.g. Urban v Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>123 F3d 644, 646 [7th Cir 1997]). Thus, the fact that a resident has a B-1 or B-2 visa may not adequately define the duration of residency as adjustments in immigration status can often result in a protracted stay and in some cases be coterminous with the duration of a rent-stabilized lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">I thus conclude that the evidence submitted by plaintiff, including defendant\u2019s immigration status, her extremely limited use of the apartment and the lack of documentary evidence linking her to the residence establishes a prima facie case of nonprimary residence. Because defendant has failed to submit evidence to rebut plaintiffs contentions and likewise to demonstrate that she maintains a substantial physical nexus to the apartment, summary judgment for plaintiff is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Smith; Judge Ciparick concurs in result in a separate opinion; Chief Judge Kaye taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
