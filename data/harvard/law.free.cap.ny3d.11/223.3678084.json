Martin </em>of counsel), <em>Bryan Cave LLP (James R. DeVita, Austin V. Campriello </em>and <em>Kathryn E. Gebert </em>of counsel), and <em>Stephen E. Kaufman, P.C. (Stephen E.

Dennis Kozlowski, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asn\">I. Mr. Kozlowski was severely prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s error in allowing David Boies to testify about his extensive investigation and give his opinion on defendants\u2019 guilt. <em>(People v Graydon, </em>43 AD2d 842; <em>People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431; <em>People v Garcia, </em>76 AD2d 867; <em>People v Bailey, </em>58 NY2d 272; <em>People v Huston, </em>88 NY2d 400; <em>People v Hackett, </em>228 AD2d 377; <em>People v Placencia, </em>157 Misc 2d 397.) II. The prosecution should not have been permitted to use against Mr. Kozlowski David Boies\u2019s testimony about a statement allegedly made by Mr. Swartz that incriminated Mr. Kozlowski. III. The admission of the testimony of David Boies was highly prejudicial and was not harmless error. <em>(People v Hardy, </em>4 NY3d 192; <em>People v Creasy, </em>236 NY 205; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230.) IV. The trial court erroneously quashed a defense subpoena on David Boies\u2019s law firm. V Mr. Kozlowski\u2019s conviction of stealing a $20 million finder\u2019s fee paid to Frank Walsh and a charity should be reversed because Walsh, an investment banker, earned the fee and because Mr. Kozlowski and Walsh believed that Mr. Kozlowski had the authority to pay it. <em>(People v Ricchiuti, </em>93 AD2d 842; <em>People v Chesler, </em>50 NY2d 203; <em>People v Cahill, </em>2 NY3d 14; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490; <em>Cohen v Hallmark Cards, </em>45 NY2d 493.) VI. The Court should reverse the convictions for stealing bonuses to which Mr. Kozlowski was legally entitled. <em>(Weiner v Diebold Group, </em>173 AD2d 166; <em>Bayer v Oxford Univ. Press, Inc., </em>270 App Div 586, 296 NY 780; <em>People v Foster, </em>73 NY2d 596; <em>People v Zinke, </em>76 NY2d 8; <em>People v Ricchiuti, </em>93 AD2d 842; <em>People v Chesler, </em>50 NY2d 203.) VII. The Court should reverse the artwork convictions because Mr. Kozlowski had the authority to purchase art for Tyco and there was no evidence he did not intend to repay the money he borrowed to purchase art for himself. <em>(People v Jennings, </em>69 NY2d 103.)

Morgenthau, District Attorney, </em>New York City <em>(Amyjane Rettew </em>and <em>Gina Mignola </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AId\">I. The evidence fully supports the verdict convicting defendants of stealing the three multi-million-dollar and midyear \u201cbonuses\u201d they took in 1999 and 2000 without the board of directors\u2019 knowledge or approval. <em>(Nickerson v Volt Delta Resources, </em>211 AD2d 512; <em>People v Hines, </em>97 NY2d 56; <em>People v Gray, </em>86 NY2d 10; <em>People v Finger, </em>95 NY2d 894; <em>People v Santos, </em>86 NY2d 869; <em>People v Foster, </em>73 NY2d 596; <em>Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307; <em>People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342; <em>People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620; <em>People v Green, </em>5 NY3d 538.) II. The jury had ample reason to find defendants guilty of stealing $12 million worth of restricted stock in the summer of 2001. <em>(People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342.) III. The jury properly convicted defendants of stealing minions of dollars L. Dennis Kozlowski used to buy himself artwork. <em>(People v Kramer, </em>92 NY2d 529; <em>People v Vandermuelen, </em>42 AD3d 667; <em>People v Norman, </em>85 NY2d 609; <em>People v Jennings, </em>69 NY2d 103; <em>People v Yannett, </em>49 NY2d 296; <em>People v Robinson, </em>284 NY 75; <em>People v Meadows, </em>199 NY 1; <em>Boyle v Petrie Stores Corp., </em>136 Misc 2d 380; <em>People v Ponnapula, </em>266 AD2d 32.) IV. The jury properly found defendants guilty of stealing the $20 million they secretly paid to Frank Walsh. <em>(Cohen v Hallmark Cards, </em>45 NY2d 493; <em>People v Chesler, </em>50 NY2d 203; <em>People v Ricchiuti, </em>93 AD2d 842.) V. The trial judge properly found that Mark Swartz\u2019s explanation of his 1999 bonus was a statement in furtherance of defendants\u2019 ongoing conspiracy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>retain possession of the money they had stolen. <em>(People v Ryan, </em>263 NY 298; <em>Lutwak v United States, </em>344 US 604; <em>People v Van Vleet, </em>256 AD2d 1181; <em>United States v Knuckles, </em>581 F2d 305; <em>United States v Warren, </em>578 F2d 1058; <em>People v Storrs, </em>207 NY 147; <em>United States v Grubb, </em>527 F2d 1107; <em>United States v Papia, </em>560 F2d 827; <em>United States v Thompson, </em>476 F2d 1196; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230.) VI. The judge\u2019s rulings about the Boies firm\u2019s work were sound and the jury heard no improper opinion evidence. <em>(People v Hackett, </em>228 AD2d 377; <em>People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431; <em>People v Graydon, </em>43 AD2d 842; <em>People v Smith, </em>2 NY3d 8; <em>People v Cronin, </em>60 NY2d 430; <em>People v Huston, </em>88 NY2d 400; <em>People v Bailey, </em>58 NY2d 272.) VII. Defendants cannot obtain a new trial on the basis of documents they conceded were privileged, especially without any showing that the documents contain any information that could have affected the jury\u2019s assessment of any material issue. <em>(People v Le Grand, </em>67 AD2d 446; <em>People v Yavru-Sakuk, 4 </em>NY3d 814; <em>People v Rutter, </em>202 AD2d 123; <em>Pennsylvania v Ritchie, </em>480 US 39; <em>Davis v Alaska, </em>415 US 308; <em>People v Washington, </em>86 NY2d 189; <em>People v Kelly, </em>88 NY2d 248; <em>People v Howard, </em>87 NY2d 940; <em>People v Flynn, </em>79 NY2d 879; <em>People v Gissendanner, </em>48 NY2d 543.) VIII. The jury\u2019s verdict and defendants\u2019 admissions to the sentencing judge authorized the court to impose a fine of up to twice the amount of defendants\u2019 gain, and the fines actually imposed were far less than that authorized amount. <em>(Apprendi v New Jersey, </em>530 US 466; <em>Ring v Arizona, </em>536 US 584; <em>Cunningham v California, </em>549 US 270; <em>United States v Booker, </em>543 US 220; <em>Blakely v Washington, </em>542 US 296; <em>People v Rivera, </em>5 NY3d 61; <em>People v Horne, </em>97 NY2d 404; <em>United States v Reifler, </em>446 F3d 65; <em>United States v Dupes, </em>513 F3d 338; <em>United States v Oladimeji, </em>463 F3d 152.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-5\"><em>Cohen &amp; Gressler LLP, </em>New York City <em>(Mark S.

A threat to individual liberties arises from \u201cdeputized\u201d corporate investigations. <em>(United States v Stein, </em>440 F Supp 2d 315.) II. Defendants may lose access to critical impeachment evidence in the possession of \u201cdeputized\u201d corporate counsel. <em>(People v Rosario, </em>9 NY2d 286; <em>People v Kelly, </em>88 NY2d 248; <em>United States v Rodriguez, </em>496 F3d 221; <em>In re Qwest Communications Intl.

The trial court\u2019s order quashing defendants\u2019 subpoena for potentially critical impeachment evidence undermines core Sixth Amendment protections. <em>(People v Gissendanner, </em>48 NY2d 543; <em>Weatherford v Bursey, </em>429 US 545; <em>Washington v Texas, </em>388 US 14; <em>In re Martin Marietta Corp., </em>856 F2d 619; <em>Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284; <em>People v Chipp, </em>75 NY2d 327; <em>United States v Hubbell, </em>530 US 27; <em>Davis v Alaska, </em>415 US 308; <em>People v Thurston, </em>209 AD2d 976; <em>Pennsylvania v Ritchie, </em>480 US 39.) IV. The work product doctrine should not bar defendants\u2019 right to obtain core impeachment evidence. <em>(Washington v Texas, </em>388 US 14; <em>Hickman v Taylor, </em>329 US 495; <em>United States v Nixon, </em>418 US 683; <em>Cheney v United States Dist.

We conclude that this testimony\u2014and the prosecutor\u2019s summation comments thereon\u2014did not convey such an opinion. Second, we hold that Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in quashing defendants\u2019 subpoena duces tecum, which sought the factual portions of certain interview notes and a memorandum prepared during the course of the internal investigation. Although defendants satisfied the minimal threshold showing necessary for enforcement, the materials defendants requested are shielded from production by the qualified privilege covering trial preparation materials <em>(see </em>CPLR 3101 [d] [2]). Finally, we do not reach the question whether the fines imposed under Penal Law \u00a7 80.00 violated <em>Apprendi v New Jersey </em>(530 US 466 [2000]), because we conclude that if error exists it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Defendants are the former chief executive officer (L. Dennis Kozlowski) and chief financial officer (Mark H. Swartz) of Tyco International Ltd., a publicly-held diversified manufacturing company. After a nearly six-month trial, a jury convicted defendants of 12 counts of first degree grand larceny (Penal Law \u00a7 155.42), eight counts of first degree falsifying business records (Penal Law \u00a7 175.10), one count of fourth degree conspiracy (Penal Law \u00a7 105.10 [1]) and one Martin Act count of securities fraud (General Business Law \u00a7 352-c [5]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The principal charges concerned defendants\u2019 theft of four multimillion-dollar \u201cbonuses\u201d between 1999 and 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Defendants\u2019 convictions arose primarily out of their abuse of two Tyco loan programs: the Key Employee Loan Program (KELP) and the relocation loan program. KELP allowed defendants and other executives to borrow funds to pay taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock. The relocation loan program covered certain moving expenses incurred when the company transferred an employee to a new geographic area. Defendants did not, however, utilize these programs for permissible purposes. Instead, they incurred debts under them that were used to finance opulent lifestyles.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>For example, in 2001, Swartz assisted Kozlowski in charging $12.75 million in purported KELP loans to cover the cost of nine paintings, including a Monet and a Renoir. These paintings were hung in a $30 million Fifth Avenue apartment that Kozlowski shared with his wife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kozlowski also purchased a $7.2 million Park Avenue residence, which he later relinquished as part of a divorce settlement, by charging it to his Tyco relocation account as a no-interest loan. Additionally, Kozlowski utilized KELP loans to finance millions of dollars in jewelry purchases and an $8.3 million stake in a New Jersey sports partnership. Swartz similarly had millions of dollars in company loans transferred to his personal accounts to cover the costs of personal expenditures and investments. By August 1999, Kozlowski and Swartz owed Tyco $52.7 million and $17.4 million, respectively. To satisfy these obligations, defendants turned to Tyco\u2019s \u201cIncentive Compensation Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Under the Plan, defendants were entitled to a base salary regardless of the company\u2019s performance, but had the potential to earn \u201cperformance awards,\u201d or bonuses, by exceeding certain performance goals or \u201churdles.\u201d These awards took the form of cash payments and the vesting of restricted stock. In general, Swartz\u2019s potential awards were half those of Kozlowski\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Performance goals were established by Tyco\u2019s four-member Compensation Committee, under authority delegated to it by the corporation\u2019s board of directors. The Incentive Compensation Plan specifically provided that prior to any payments the Committee would certify that the performance goals had been satisfied. Such certification generally took place at the close of Tyco\u2019s fiscal year, which ended on September 30, when audited financial results were available.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Committee would review information packages prepared by employees working under the direction of defendants. In addition, Swartz would appear before the Committee to explain whether that year\u2019s performance goals had been satisfied. Following its review, the Committee\u2014acting as a whole\u2014would determine whether any bonuses were due defendants and record its awards in the official minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">These procedures were not employed with respect to the four so-called \u201cmega-larceny\u201d bonus counts, under which the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>convicted Kozlowski and Swartz of stealing $77 million and $44.5 million, respectively. Two of these bonuses\u2014those paid in August 1999 and August 2000\u2014took the form of reductions of debts that defendants owed Tyco. During the relevant time periods, defendants\u2019 loan balances were considerable. Even after they ordered bonus payments of $25 million (Kozlowski) and $12.5 million (Swartz) in August 1999, Kozlowski still owed $27.7 million and Swartz owed $4.9 million. Those amounts did not decrease over time. Indeed, in August 2000, when defendants facilitated a second round of \u201cloan-forgiveness\u201d bonuses, including a \u201ctax gross-up,\u201d that were valued at $32.97 million for Kozlowski and $16.6 million for Swartz, their respective loan obligations stood at $25 million and $8.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The remaining bonus counts concerned payments made in November 2000 and August 2001. In the first, defendants ordered cash payments for themselves, totaling $17.2 million (Kozlowski) and $8.65 million (Swartz). In connection with the November 2000 bonus, defendants also received $8.2 million (Kozlowski) and $4.1 million (Swartz) worth of stock. The August 2001 bonus took the form of a vesting of restricted stock. After the bonus transaction was processed, defendants sold that stock for $8.2 million (Kozlowski) and $4.1 million (Swartz).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Common to all four of these bonuses was the absence of documentation in the information packets provided to the Compensation Committee or that Committee\u2019s minutes authorizing the bonuses that defendants received. In addition, every member of the Compensation Committee who was available to testify at trial denied approving these purported bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Defendants asserted, however, that the bonuses had been properly authorized. As to the first three bonuses, their claim rested primarily upon Kozlowski\u2019s communications with the late Philip Hampton, the former chair of the Compensation Committee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kozlowski testified that he had explained the justification and mechanics of these bonuses to Hampton. According to Kozlowski, Hampton\u2019s response was that he was \u201cfine with\u201d the bonuses and that he would \u201chandle\u201d the authorization of the payments by \u201cdealing with the issues\u201d raised by the Compensation Committee and by requesting additional materials from Kozlowski and his subordinates, if necessary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Defendants proffered no documentation from Hampton or Kozlowski reflecting these assurances. Swartz did assert that he made certain presentations to the Compensation Committee and the board, but also offered no evidence to support that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Hampton died prior to defendants\u2019 receipt of the August 2001 bonus. Kozlowski claims that this bonus was approved by Stephen Foss, then-chair of the Compensation Committee. After Kozlowski told him that the bonus had been approved, Swartz ordered that it be processed. Under the heading \u201cFY 2001 Projected Incentive Plan Projected Payments,\u201d the Compensation Committee\u2019s October 2001 minutes contain a resolution stating that the restricted stock bonus \u201cvested on June 20, 2001.\u201d But defendants had already sold this stock to a Tyco subsidiary in August 2001, long before the Compensation Committee passed this retroactive vesting resolution. There is no documentation or third-party testimony demonstrating that the Committee was aware at the time of passage that such sales had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In April 2002, Tyco retained the law firm of Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner LLP (Boies Schiller) to conduct an internal investigation into Kozlowski\u2019s payment of a $20 million investment banking fee to a member of the company\u2019s board, Frank Walsh.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The May 17, 2002 retention letter memorializing this engagement states that it encompassed \u201cany litigation arising from or relating to\u201d a review and analysis of transactions between the company and \u201ccertain of its directors and officers.\u201d Such litigation, including a federal multi-district litigation in a federal court in New Hampshire, did in fact eventually commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">At least a dozen Boies Schiller attorneys assisted in the investigation, which was headed by the firm\u2019s founding partner, David Boies. Although initially confined to the circumstances surrounding the Walsh payment, the Boies Schiller investigation expanded in June 2002, when Kozlowski resigned as CEO after being indicted for his failure to pay sales taxes owed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>artwork that he purchased. On June 3, 2002, the Boies Schiller attorneys began looking into whether Tyco\u2019s directors and officers had engaged in improper transactions with company funds. In connection with this assignment, they interviewed Tyco\u2019s employees and directors. These interviews occurred following Kozlowski\u2019s departure from Tyco.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On July 17, 2002, Boies interviewed Swartz regarding the August 1999 bonus. Boies met with Swartz alone and he did not take notes or otherwise memorialize the interview. That same day, Boies met with director, and then-interim CEO, John Fort to report the results of his interview with Swartz; Swartz was present for a portion of this meeting. Subsequently, Boies also met with Tyco\u2019s new CEO, and Fort\u2019s replacement, Ed Breen, regarding Swartz\u2019s continued employment and recommended that Tyco\u2019s board of directors accept a severance package that would pay Swartz $50 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">As part of their investigation, Boies Schiller attorneys also interviewed Tyco\u2019s directors. As evidenced by Boies Schiller\u2019s retention letter, the purpose of these interviews was to assist the company in preparing for potential litigation, particularly shareholder derivative suits. Thus, on June 6, 2002, a Boies Schiller attorney interviewed director Fort. As summarized in privilege logs that Tyco filed in connection with the federal multi-district litigation in New Hampshire, this interview concerned the \u201cWalsh payments.\u201d On August 12 and 13, 2002, Boies Schiller attorneys interviewed all the surviving members of the Compensation Committee\u2014directors Stephen Foss, Peter Slusser and James Pasman. The federal privilege logs summarize these interviews as concerning the KELP and relocation loan programs, \u201cCompensation Events\u201d and \u201cUse of Company Assets.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">On August 1, an agreement was reached whereby Swartz would resign from Tyco\u2019s board of directors immediately, but continue as CFO until a successor was found. The August 1 agreement also limited Swartz\u2019s severance, in the event that he was terminated as CFO prior to being convicted of a felony, to $50 million. This reduced Tyco\u2019s severance obligation, as set forth in an earlier retention agreement, by $100 million. Around the time that the August 1 agreement was entered, Tyco publicly announced that Swartz would leave the company when a new CFO was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>On August 14, Tyco\u2019s board voted to approve the August 1 agreement. After that date, however, Swartz continued to serve as Tyco\u2019s CFO until he was terminated on September 11, 2002, one day before he was indicted. In that capacity, he participated in investor conference calls as one of Tyco\u2019s spokespersons and signed Tyco\u2019s 10-Q as its representative under the federal Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The subpoena duces tecum in question, joined in by Kozlowski, was served by Swartz\u2019s counsel on October 13, 2004\u2014 approximately six months after the initial mistrial in this case\u2014in preparation for defendants\u2019 second trial. It sought from Boies Schiller \u201c[a] 11 memoranda and notes of [the firm\u2019s] personnel (or forensic accountants working on their behalf) relating to interviews of employees, directors or auditors of Tyco.\u201d The relevant interviews covered a range of 19 topics, including executive compensation, the $20 million payment to Frank Walsh and the payment or recording in Tyco\u2019s books and records of the bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">On behalf of Tyco, Boies Schiller moved to quash the subpoena, arguing that it was overbroad and impermissibly sought disclosure of materials shielded by the attorney-client and work product privileges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response, defendants\u2019 counsel submitted an affirmation, which attached as an exhibit the federal privilege logs. Defendants placed a check mark next to 72 privilege log entries, which, they said, identified the documents responsive to their subpoena.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Defendants acknowledged that there was \u201clittle dispute\u201d that the requested materials were either attorney-client or work product privileged, but claimed that Tyco waived both privileges. According to defendants, waiver had occurred through: (1) Tyco\u2019s production to the District Attorney of a large volume of privileged documents, predating the Boies Schiller investigation, (2) testimony by Tyco\u2019s in-house and corporate counsel and employees regarding privileged conversations prior to the investigation, (3) the introduction in evidence of privileged communications and work product prepared by Tyco\u2019s corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>and litigation attorneys before the investigation, (4) Boies\u2019s direct testimony at the first trial, and (5) Tyco\u2019s having \u201ccooperated] fully\u201d with the District Attorney\u2019s investigation by responding to document requests and questions from that office and preparing employees for interviews with assistant district attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">To justify their demand for the director-witness interview notes, defendants argued that such documents \u201cgo directly to the issues underlying this indictment\u201d and \u201clikely reflect a better recollection by those witnesses of details and facts th[a]n the witnesses had at trial, or will have upon a retrial almost three years after the interviews.\u201d In sum, defendants argued that they were entitled to these privileged documents because they are \u201crelevant and material\u201d and because they \u201cmore than adequately identified those specific memoranda and notes th[at] . . . [are] responsive to the subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In response, Tyco argued that defendants had not shown a substantial need for the Boies Schiller work product and an inability to duplicate the same because \u201cSwartz and his lawyers have access to the same witnesses Tyco does. He can interview them, he has already cross-examined them, and he can investigate them as well as Boies Schiller did.\u201d In addition, Tyco contended that disclosure of attorney-client and work product privileged documents produced \u201cin the ordinary course of Ty-co\u2019s business\u201d or for \u201clitigations no longer at issue,\u201d which the company referred to as \u201chistorical privileged communications,\u201d could not effect a subject matter waiver over privileged materials prepared in the course of a subsequent internal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Finally, Tyco asserted that defendants\u2019 \u201csupposition]\u201d that it had \u201cpresented to the District Attorney the substance of <em>everything </em>contained in its attorney\u2019s memoranda and notes [was] . . . incorrect\u201d (emphasis added). The company argued that it could respond to subpoenas and document requests, answer questions and otherwise cooperate with the District Attorney\u2019s Office without \u201cpresenting . . . Boies Schiller\u2019s analysis and strategy from its investigation.\u201d To bolster this point, Tyco cited the statement of an assistant district attorney during the related criminal trial of Tyco\u2019s former general counsel, Mark Belnick: \u201cI cannot agree with the representation that the Boies firm have been reporting the results of their interviews to the District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d At oral argument, Tyco\u2019s counsel stated that, with respect to \u201cBoies Schiller\u2019s communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>with the District Attorney\u2019s Office . . . there w[as]n\u2019t disclosure of Boies Schiller work product\u201d and that \u201cTyco did not disclose the results of its investigation to the District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On January 14, 2005, Supreme Court quashed the subpoena. The court ruled that no waiver of the work product privilege had occurred because \u201cthere is no showing that Tyco has disclosed work product created by Boies, Schiller to the District Attorney.\u201d In addition, the court concluded that defendants were not entitled to the director-witness materials under CPLR 3101 (d) (2) because, although they pointed to the importance in this case of the witnesses\u2019 knowledge and the passage of time since the interviews were undertaken, defendants had not explained why they could not have sought to conduct their own interviews of these witnesses at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">At trial, defendants did not move to reopen the subpoena question following the director-witnesses\u2019 testimony. In the course of Boies\u2019s direct, however, they objected that they had not seen a privileged memorandum that described how Boies Schiller had discovered the illicit August 1999 bonus. The prosecutor responded by reiterating Tyco\u2019s claim that no materials prepared by Boies Schiller during the investigation had been shared with the People, stating: \u201cI want to emphasize that neither the defense nor the prosecution has access to . . . materials that have been held to be privileged.\u201d Defense counsel further explained, however, that \u201c[i]t seems like that memorandum is the sole source of information that [Boies is] relying on for his testimony, and I think it would be inappropriate for us not to have access to [it].\u201d The court agreed and ordered production of the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Defendants were convicted and Supreme Court imposed concurrent prison terms of SVs to 25 years on each of the four bonus counts. In addition, the court ordered joint restitution of $134,351,397 and that fines of $35 million and $70 million be imposed on Swartz and Kozlowski, respectively. With one exception\u2014where the amount was $3 million less\u2014each of these fines corresponded to the amounts set forth in the indictment and amounts that defendants affirmatively testified to having taken. Responding to defendants\u2019 constitutional argument against imposition of the fines, Supreme Court held that \u201cApprendi applies to the terms of prison sentences as opposed to fines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The Appellate Division affirmed in all respects <em>(see </em>47 AD3d 111 [2007]). The court concluded that Boies\u2019s testimony and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s summation comments thereon did not convey Boies\u2019s personal opinion as to defendants\u2019 guilt of the crimes charged; that defendants\u2019 subpoena was properly quashed because \u201cthe documents sought were not material and exculpatory\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 120); and that there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation because defendants had \u201cnot dispute[d] the amount of their gains from the acts in question\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">A Judge of this Court granted defendants leave to appeal (10 NY3d 767, 772 [2008]) and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Defendants first argue that they are entitled to a new trial because of the prejudicial effect of Boies\u2019s testimony and the People\u2019s summation comments on that testimony. Because the testimony and summation complained of merely set forth facts enabling the jury to draw an inference of defendants\u2019 guilt, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">As an initial matter, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the People to elicit Boies\u2019s background, a general overview of internal investigations and the scope of the Tyco investigation. Defendants assert that testimony regarding Boies\u2019s credentials\u2014including his having lectured on the topic of internal investigations\u2014and his statement that law firms conducting internal investigations often work both with forensic accountants specially trained to ferret out \u201cwrongdoing\u201d and with law enforcement authorities, impermissibly cast a \u201cpatina of officialdom\u201d over Boies Schiller\u2019s work on behalf of Tyco. This background testimony was not unduly prejudicial. Indeed, such testimony is generally admissible, especially where, as here, it provides helpful context for the jury about complex subject matter, such as an internal investigation. In addition, such evidence was also admissible to allow the jury to evaluate defendants\u2019 contention that Boies\u2019s representation of Tyco in ancillary civil litigation gave him a motive to slant his testimony in favor of the People <em>(see </em>2-401 Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 401.04 [4] [a]). We turn then to the substance of Boies\u2019s direct testimony at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The purpose of Boies\u2019s testimony was twofold. First, the People sought to use Boies\u2019s account of his conversation with Swartz to undercut defendants\u2019 claim that they had taken the August 1999 bonuses in good faith <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 155.15). Second, in response to Swartz\u2019s eliciting testimony tending to show that the board continued to employ him as CFO after it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>was aware of the August 1999 bonuses, Boies\u2019s testimony as to his conversations with Tyco\u2019s board and senior management were used to establish how the company reacted once it became aware of evidence suggesting that Swartz may have violated company compensation procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Boies\u2019s testimony on these subjects was limited to a firsthand factual account. Thus, Boies told the jury that, on July 17, 2002, he explained to Swartz that his firm\u2019s investigation had uncovered \u201cno documentation,\u201d either from Tyco\u2019s board or the Compensation Committee, authorizing the August 1999 multimillion-dollar bonuses. Boies then explained that Swartz\u2019s response to this factual assertion was that a \u201cjournal entry\u201d authorizing those payments was \u201ca mistake.\u201d As Boies further testified, never in the course of the July 17 interview did Swartz refer to the KELP loan reduction authorized by this journal entry as \u201ca bonus.\u201d Rather, said Boies, Swartz stated that he instructed Tyco\u2019s director of financial operations, Mark Foley, to process the loan reductions because Kozlowski had told him to do it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, Boies testified that Swartz agreed that he would make good on his mistake by repaying the money with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Similarly, Boies\u2019s testimony concerning his interactions with Tyco\u2019s senior management and its board did not stray from its factual focus. Thus, Boies explained that during the July 17 interview he told Swartz that in response to questioning from Boies Schiller attorneys, Foley stated that Swartz directed him to process the August 1999 bonuses. Boies then recounted for the jury another July 17 meeting with director Fort during which Swartz confirmed his undertaking to repay the August 1999 bonus with interest; Boies then told the jury that Swartz did eventually discharge that obligation. Further, Boies explained that he provided new CEO Breen with certain \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d concerning Swartz, which carried an \u201cinherent\u201d recommendation regarding Swartz\u2019s continued employment. Indeed, said Boies, Breen decided to terminate Swartz \u201cas soon as a replacement could be identified\u201d and to reduce his role as CFO in the interim. Boies then discussed the mechanics of the August 1 agreement that facilitated the removal of Swartz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>as a director and limited his CFO-related severance to $50 million. He told the jury that he had advised the board to accept the agreement at the August 14 board meeting and that the board had, in fact, voted in favor of approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It is fundamental that facts, such as those Boies provided regarding his firm\u2019s investigation of the 1999 bonus, his conversations with Swartz and Fort, his recommendation to Breen and his advice to the board \u201care the appropriate subject of evidence\u201d <em>(see People v Creasy, </em>236 NY 205, 222 [1923]). At bottom, defendants\u2019 complaint is that Boies was permitted to rebut their testimony and theory of the case with certain facts that may have led the jury to convict. This, however, is not prohibited. The line is crossed not when a witness relates facts that may be prejudicial, but when he or she conveys\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014a personal opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s criminal guilt <em>(see id. </em>at 209, 221-222; <em>People v Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d 431, 439 [1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 assertion, this case is markedly different from <em>Ciaccio. </em>There, a police detective was called to corroborate a victim\u2019s account of a hijacking by answering a hypothetical question that assumed the facts set forth in the victim\u2019s testimony. We held that the detective\u2019s testimony that the victim\u2019s account \u201cwas not unusual\u201d constituted improper opinion evidence because it usurped the function of the jury to test the credibility of the victim-witness <em>(see Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d at 439). What was impermissible about the testimony was that its sole purpose was to bolster the testimony of another witness by explaining that his version of the events was more \u201cbelievable\u201d <em>(id.). </em>It was thus the equivalent of an opinion that the defendant was guilty, which is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Here, in contrast, Boies testified to facts. This testimony was in no sense hypothetical. Indeed, defendants were provided with Boies Schiller\u2019s work product memorandum that led to the discovery of the 1999 bonuses. Boies\u2019s testimony, when considered as a whole, relayed to the jury his preliminary findings during the investigation and the reaction of Tyco\u2019s directors and senior management when they were confronted with those findings. For example, Boies\u2019s discovery that \u201c[t]here was no documentation\u201d of the bonuses does not constitute a legal conclusion of guilt\u2014the jury still had to determine defendants\u2019 intent at the time of the taking. Similarly, testimony that Breen resolved on the basis of Boies\u2019s \u201cinherent\u201d recommendation to remove Swartz immediately or that the board took Boies\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>advice and agreed to pay Swartz $50 million in severance to facilitate such removal are not conclusions but facts, which\u2014at most\u2014support an inference of criminal guilt. Kozlowski and Swartz vigorously argued that they were entitled to the bonuses and never contested receiving them. And Swartz maintained that the board stood behind him even after it learned of his alleged improprieties. The People were entitled to present evidence casting doubt on those theories. In sum, Boies recounted facts, which the jurors, in light of their experience, could use to test the merits of the charges levied against defendants <em>(see Creasy, </em>236 NY at 222; <em>Ciaccio, </em>47 NY2d at 439).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We likewise reject defendants\u2019 assertions that the prosecutor\u2019s summation of Boies\u2019s testimony was prejudicial. Defendants place particular emphasis on the prosecutor\u2019s statement\u2014made in response to defendants\u2019 assertion that Tyco\u2019s directors had branded them as scapegoats to avoid their own civil and criminal liability\u2014that the board only became aware of defendants\u2019 illicit activities \u201cafter the forensic auditors had come in and combed through all the tens of millions of pages that are the books and records of Tyco [a]nd after the Boies lawyers ha[d] done their investigation.\u201d But this, as well as the prosecutor\u2019s references to Boies\u2019s factual testimony, did not convey a \u201cpersonal belief or opinion\u201d regarding the trial evidence or defendants\u2019 guilt <em>(see People v Bailey, </em>58 NY2d 272, 277 [1983]). Instead it quite properly \u201cconcentrated, in argument, on proved facts and circumstances and the inferences to be drawn therefrom\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The second issue we address is whether Supreme Court abused its discretion in quashing defendants\u2019 subpoena. Our standard for enforcing a third-party subpoena duces tecum was set forth nearly 30 years ago in <em>People v Gissendanner </em>(48 NY2d 543, 550 [1979]). Under it, defendants must proffer a good faith factual predicate sufficient for a court to draw an inference that specifically identified materials are reasonably likely to contain information that has the potential to be both relevant and exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Here, the People\u2019s case centers on the charge that defendants\u2019 bonuses were not approved by the Compensation Committee or the board of directors. Defendants maintain that the bonuses were properly approved through the efforts of either the late Philip Hampton or Stephen Foss. Among other things, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>subpoena seeks specifically identified statements made by the director-witnesses regarding key issues in this case, including, most notably, compensation events. Although defendants have certainly not made a robust showing under <em>Gissendanner, </em>we disagree with the People\u2019s contention that defendants were simply fishing for \u201cgeneral credibility\u201d evidence <em>(see Gissendanner, </em>48 NY2d at 548). Indeed, the trial court implicitly recognized as much by confining its written opinion on the subpoena application to questions concerning the applicability of the work product and trial preparation privileges <em>(cf United States v Nixon, </em>418 US 683, 703 [1974] [after determining that subpoena is otherwise enforceable court must evaluate whether documents sought are shielded by privilege]).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The proper purpose of a subpoena duces tecum, of course, is to compel the production of specific documents that are relevant and material to facts at issue in a pending judicial proceeding. The relevant and material facts in a criminal trial are those bearing upon \u201cthe unreliability of either the criminal charge or of a witness upon whose testimony it depends\u201d <em>(see Gissendanner, </em>48 NY2d at 550). Here, defendants seek to challenge the director-witnesses\u2019 testimony that they did not approve the four charged bonuses, evidence that bears directly on the question whether defendants took those bonuses under a good faith claim of right <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 155.15 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In meeting the burden for production, defendants need not\u2014 and indeed could not\u2014show that director-witness statements are \u201cactually\u201d relevant and exculpatory <em>(see Gissendanner, </em>48 NY2d at 550).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Gissendanner </em>does mandate, however, that they point to specific facts demonstrating a reasonable likelihood that such material may be disclosed and that they are not engaged in a fishing expedition. In applying this standard, we must give due regard to the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial <em>(Ritchie, </em>480 US at 56; <em>Nixon, </em>418 US at 711).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Here, defendants were not engaged in \u201cgeneral discovery\u201d regarding the director-witness statements. Instead, they identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>fied the specific director-witness interview notes and memorandum that they sought by referring Supreme Court to Tyco\u2019s privilege log. Defendants pointed to undisputed facts, arguing that after the directors were made aware of at least some of defendants\u2019 questionable activities through the Boies Schiller investigation, they continued to permit Swartz to exercise substantial authority as the CFO of Tyco until September 11, 2002\u2014the day before he was indicted\u2014and voted to pay him $50 million in severance just one day after the last of the relevant director interviews. On the basis of these facts, defendants asserted that the \u201cdirectors witnesses . . . did not believe Mr. Swartz had engaged in any wrongful conduct and only \u2018changed their tune\u2019 after the District Attorney obtained an indictment.\u201d The People argue that this factual showing was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We conclude that defendants met their burden under <em>Gis</em>sendanner: they identified specific director-witness statements and proffered facts that permitted an inference that those statements were reasonably likely to contain material that could contradict the statements of key witnesses for the People. In this case, however, there is a claim that the relevant documents are privileged and thus not subject to production. Additional analysis is therefore required.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">As frequently occurs today, the director-witness statements were obtained in the course of corporate internal investigation, which inevitably implicates the attorney-client and work product privileges <em>(see </em>McNeil and Brian, Internal Corporate Investigations, at 18-19 [3d ed] [hereinafter McNeil and Brian]). In that connection, private law firms conducting internal investigations may consult with law enforcement authorities to advance their corporate client\u2019s interest in avoiding potentially serious criminal sanctions <em>(see e.g. United States v Stein, </em>541 F3d 130, 137, 142 [2d Cir 2008]). While collaboration between prosecutors and attorney investigators may provide a public benefit through the more efficient detection and punishment of corporate wrongdoing, it may come at the expense of the proper safeguarding of the rights of individual corporate employees <em>(see Stein, </em>541 F3d at 156-157). Courts must be sensitive to these competing considerations and endeavor to strike an appropriate balance between the rights and interests of law enforcement, corporations and their employees, and the accused. We cannot say that the balance struck by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>trial court here amounts to an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">This case highlights a tension in CPLR 3101\u2019s treatment of attorney work product (which is not obtainable) and trial preparation materials (which may be disclosed \u201conly upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has a substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means\u201d [CPLR 3101 (c), (d) (2)]). The separation of work product and trial preparation materials was apparently an attempt to shield materials protected by the attorney-client privilege from disclosure <em>(see </em>11th Ann Rep of NY Jud Conf, at 152 [1966] [\u201cWhoever drafted the \u2018work product\u2019 provision . . . was doubtless thinking of such things as private consultations between attorney and client and memoranda of them\u201d]; Connors, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C3101:27, at 53-54; Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 347 [4th ed]). Thus, when particular work product is generated for litigation, courts have tended to classify it as trial preparation material, unless it contains otherwise privileged communications <em>(see </em>Connors, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C3101:27, at 53-54).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Here, the director-witness interview notes and memorandum were prepared to assist Tyco\u2019s preparation for civil litigations that eventually commenced. In its motion to quash the subpoena, Tyco asserted that these materials were shielded by the attorney-client privilege, stating at oral argument that \u201c[t]hose are interviews with Tyco employees . . . [who] are communicating with counsel for a . . . legal purpose.\u201d Assuming that these communications were confidential, this assertion may well be correct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this Court, however, neither the People nor defendants urge us to hold that the director-witness interview materials are attorney-client privileged. Instead, defendants assert that those statements are merely conditionally-privileged trial preparation materials, while the People contend that they are absolutely privileged work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>On this record, we conclude that defendants have the better argument. This is because they have limited their request to \u201cthe facts reported to Boies Schiller in th[e] interviews.\u201d Indeed, defendants expressly agreed to permit Supreme Court to redact any material that would reveal opinion work product, or that portion of the interview notes reflecting the Boies Schiller attorneys\u2019 \u201cmental impressions, opinions, or legal theories\u201d <em>(see </em>McNeil and Brian at 47). As we explained <em>(see People v Consolazio, </em>40 NY2d 446, 453 [1976]), the mere fact that a narrative witness statement is transcribed by an attorney is not sufficient to render the statement \u201cwork product\u201d <em>(see also </em>Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 347 [\u201cThe fact that a lawyer has taken a statement from a witness . . . does not transmute the statement into a \u2018work product\u2019: a lay person could have taken it\u201d]; Weinstein-KornMiller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6 3101.47 [\u201cWhere . . . statements of witnesses could not reveal legal analysis or strategy by their disclosure, and legal training might have been used but was not required for their creation, the courts should consider them trial preparations covered by CPLR 3101 (d)\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Although we agree with defendants that the director-witness statements are trial preparation materials and not absolutely privileged, enforcement of their subpoena was directed to the trial court\u2019s discretion <em>(see Gissendanner, </em>48 NY2d at 550; <em>cf. People v Hodge, </em>53 NY2d 313, 319 [1981]). In making its discretionary determination that defendants did not establish an inability to \u201cobtain the substantial equivalent\u201d of the facts contained in the director-witness interview notes without \u201cundue hardship\u201d <em>(see </em>CPLR 3101 [d] [2]; Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6 3101.55), Supreme Court relied upon defendants\u2019 failure to \u201cexplain[ ] why the defense could not have sought to conduct its own interviews of these witnesses at an earlier time.\u201d We cannot say that this conclusion represents an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Defendants made no effort to show any \u201cundue hardship\u201d that would have prevented them from securing their own \u201csubstantially] equivalent\u201d interviews with the director-witnesses <em>(see </em>CPLR 3101 [d] [2]). As Tyco pointed out in its reply submission on its motion to quash, defendants \u201chave access to the same witnesses as Tyco does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Even on appeal, defendants have not proffered an explanation for their failure to seek interviews with the directors at an earlier time or stated whether they ever made an independent attempt to secure the relevant statements, a requirement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>obtaining an attorney\u2019s trial preparation materials <em>(see Hickman v Taylor, </em>329 US 495, 513 [1947] [production of attorney\u2019s account of witness statements is justified only in \u201crare\u201d cases and is not appropriate when potential for \u201cdirect interviews with the witnesses themselves\u201d is possible]; <em>see also In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>219 F3d 175, 192 [2d Cir 2000] [remanding for a determination whether government had \u201cexhausted other means\u201d for obtaining work product and instructing prosecutor to \u201cexplain to the district court why it cannot obtain the information it seeks through other witnesses\u201d]; <em>United States v Reyes, </em>239 FED 591, 602 n 2 [ND Cal 2006]; <em>People v Grady, </em>130 Misc 2d 677, 679 [Sup Ct, Bronx County 1985]).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Since they failed to make the requisite showing of \u201cundue hardship\u201d under CPLE 3101 (d) (2), defendants would only have been entitled to production of the director-witness statements if Tyco had waived the qualified privilege covering those documents <em>(see United States v Nobles, </em>422 US 225, 239 [1975]). The qualified privilege governing trial preparation materials \u201cis waived upon disclosure to a third party where there is a likelihood that the material will be revealed to an adversary, under conditions that are inconsistent with a desire to maintain confidentiality\u201d <em>(see Bluebird Partners v First Fid. Bank, N.J., </em>248 AD2d 219, 225 [1st Dept 1998]). In response to defendants\u2019 specific waiver allegations, Tyco bore the burden of establishing that no such waiver had occurred <em>(see Spectrum Sys. Intl. Corp. v Chemical Bank, </em>78 NY2d 371, 377 [1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The determination of whether and to what extent waiver has occurred is inherently factual and turns on case-by-case considerations of \u201cfairness\u201d <em>(see John Doe Co. v United States, </em>350 F3d 299, 302 [2d Cir 2003], quoting <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>219 F3d at 183). Although review of this discretionary determination is \u201chighly deferential\u201d <em>(John Doe Co., </em>350 F3d at 306), the U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that a trial court properly exercises its discretion when it orders disclosure of \u201cthe portion\u201d of trial preparation materials that is directly relevant to another, previously-disclosed, portion <em>(see Nobles, </em>422 US at 240). Thus, a party is essentially precluded from using its trial preparation materials as both a sword and a shield. In evaluating defendants\u2019 waiver claims, we must confine our analysis to those arguments they asserted before Supreme Court <em>(see People v Nieves, </em>2 NY3d 310, 315 [2004]). We affirm Supreme Court\u2019s discretionary determination that Tyco met its burden of establishing the absence of waiver in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Defendants first argue that waiver occurred when Tyco produced attorney-client and work product privileged materials to the People in response to their grand jury subpoena. Tyco had initially declined to tender these documents because it was conducting a privilege review. Two days before the grand jury\u2019s term was to expire, however, Tyco honored the District Attorney\u2019s demand that it produce the documents to prevent unnecessary delay in the grand jury\u2019s deliberations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendants do not dispute that the documents produced in response to the subpoena do not refer to the Boies Schiller investigation. As Supreme Court found, those documents\u2014which were prepared by Tyco\u2019s in-house and outside counsel\u2014\u201cwere not created for the current criminal case and civil proceedings, but for past litigation, government filings and other corporate actions.\u201d In addition, it can hardly be said that Tyco was wielding the qualified privilege covering these documents as both a sword and a shield since it provided them to both the People and defendants before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that disclosure of historical privileged documents waives the privilege covering trial preparation materials created in a subsequent internal investigation. We decline to so hold. We reach this conclusion because a trial court has discretion to limit waiver of the qualified privilege covering trial preparation to matters actually referenced in disclosed materials. Here, the materials produced to the grand jury did not\u2014and could not\u2014refer to director-witness interview notes and a memorandum produced in a subsequent internal investigation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Next, defendants argue that waiver occurred through Tyco\u2019s cooperation with the District Attorney\u2019s investigation. It is be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>yond dispute that, had Boies Schiller provided the prosecution with the \u201cwritten or recorded statements\u201d of the director-witnesses, or had the People taken such notes themselves, defendants would be entitled to those statements pursuant to the rule of <em>People v Rosario </em>(9 NY2d 286 [1961]; CPL 240.45). But defendants ask us to hold that the statements should have been provided here based upon their conjecture that Boies Schiller attorneys shared the substance of the director-witness statements with the People. Two assistant district attorneys and Tyco\u2019s counsel, all of whom owed duties of candor to the tribunal, denied that this occurred <em>(see </em>Code of Professional Responsibility DR 7-102 [a] [5] [22 NYCRR 1200.33 (a) (5)]). Certainly, it is possible for attorneys to assist prosecutors without divulging their trial preparation materials. Absent some other proof, we conclude that Supreme Court properly held that defendants had not established any disclosure of Boies Schiller work product to the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Defendants also urge that \u201ctestimonial\u201d waivers occurred at the first trial when Tyco\u2019s lawyers and employees testified regarding privileged communications that occurred prior to the internal investigation. Here, again, however, there is no showing that the jury in the first trial needed the director-witness interview notes and memorandum to properly assess the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">But defendants say that \u201cTyco\u2019s [testimonial] waivers were not limited to events that occurred prior to the investigation.\u201d They assert that a Tyco employee\u2019s testimony that Boies asked her about the 1999 bonus and instructed her to \u201creally think about it because he was talking about fraud\u201d and that another Boies Schiller attorney asked her for a relocation loan plan document constituted waiver. This testimony certainly references communications with the Boies Schiller attorneys, but it does not impermissibly use the relevant director-witness statements as both a sword and shield <em>(see In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>219 F3d at 192). Indeed, the referenced testimony does not even mention those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">According to defendants, the \u201cmost damaging\u201d testimonial waiver occurred during the testimony of David Boies. But they point to no impermissible use of the director-witness statements. Boies\u2019s direct testimony was limited to facts concerning the interview with Foley, his July 17, 2002 conversations with Swartz and Fort, his recommendation to Breen regarding Swartz\u2019s continued employment and his recommendation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the board approve Swartz\u2019s severance package. At no point in his testimony did Boies seek to bolster his statements with the aid of the relevant director-witness statements. Moreover, in response to defendants\u2019 specific request, Supreme Court ordered disclosure of a privileged memorandum upon which a portion of Boies\u2019s testimony was based. At that time, defendants did not request any disclosure of the director-witness statements.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, under these circumstances, there was no waiver and no abuse of discretion <em>(compare Nobles, </em>422 US at 239-240 [work product privilege over portions of investigator\u2019s report waived where \u201crespondent sought to adduce the testimony of the investigator\u201d regarding witness statements contained in the report]).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Finally, defendants challenge the constitutionality of the fines that were imposed upon them. They contend that these fines contravened their right to a jury trial, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Penal Law \u00a7 80.00 (1) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201c[a] sentence to pay a fine for a felony shall be a sentence to pay an amount, fixed by the court, not exceeding the higher of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201ca. five thousand dollars; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">\u201cb. double the amount of the defendant\u2019s gain from the commission of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">When a fine is imposed on the basis of \u201cgain,\u201d <em>\u201cthe court </em>shall make a finding\u201d as to that amount <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 80.00 [3] [emphasis added]). This finding may be based upon facts brought out at trial, a plea allocution, sentencing, or a fact-finding hearing conducted pursuant to CPL 400.30 <em>(see </em>Donnino, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law art 80 [\u201cFines\u201d], at 6). Here, Supreme Court did not hold a CPL 400.30 hearing and instead appears to have based defendants\u2019 fines upon facts brought out at trial or conceded in \u201csentencing letters\u201d that defendants filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>In <em>Apprendi v New Jersey </em>(530 US 466 [2000]) and its progeny, the U.S. Supreme Court has set forth three rules delineating when judicial fact-finding in sentencing is impermissible under the Sixth Amendment. First, the Court has directed that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 490). The Court has subsequently referred to this as a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d <em>(see Blakely v Washington, </em>542 US 296, 308 [2004]). Second, the \u201c \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant\u201d (Blakely, </em>542 US at 303; <em>accord United States v Booker, </em>543 US 220, 235 [2005] <em>[Apprendi </em>violation occurs when judges \u201cf(i)nd facts beyond those found by the jury\u201d]). Third, <em>Apprendi </em>violations are subject to harmless-error review <em>(see Washington v Recuenco, </em>548 US 212, 220-221 [2006]). We apply the third of these rules to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Assuming without deciding that an <em>Apprendi </em>violation occurred here, we nonetheless affirm because error, if any, was harmless. Our precedents establish that \u201call the elements of an indicted crime <em>which are not conceded by defendant </em>or defendant\u2019s counsel must be charged [to the jury]\u201d <em>(see People v Flynn, </em>79 NY2d 879, 881 [1992] [emphasis added]; <em>see also People v Walker, </em>198 NY 329, 335 [1910] [\u201c(W)hen a fact, even of great importance, is admitted by the defendant or his counsel in open court during the trial, that fact is established by the admission, and no evidence need be given in relation to it\u201d]). Here, defendants\u2019 trial testimony\u2014with respect to each of those counts upon which the trial court imposed fines\u2014established gains that corresponded to or exceeded the fine amounts. Thus, the <em>Apprendi </em>violation here, if any, was harmless <em>(see Recuenco, </em>548 US at 215).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We have considered defendants\u2019 remaining arguments and conclude that they are either unpreserved or without merit. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">In each case: Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\">.

Without informing Tyco\u2019s board of directors or its shareholders, defendants arranged this payment to Walsh in exchange for his efforts in facilitating Tyco\u2019s merger with the CIT Group in March 2001. Because they believed that payments of less than $15 million did not need to be disclosed in Tyco\u2019s proxy statement, defendants had $10 million paid to Walsh and another $10 million paid to a charity of his choosing. Walsh pleaded guilty to a securities fraud charge for concealing the payment and was sentenced to a fine and a conditional discharge. Defendants were convicted of first degree grand larceny for having approved and facilitated the Walsh payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">.

The Appellate Division held that it was error to admit this statement against Kozlowski under the theory that it was made in furtherance of a conspiracy.

The People do not urge us to adopt the Appellate Division\u2019s framing of the <em>Gissendanner </em>test, which would require defendants to show that \u201cthe documents sought <em>were . . </em>. material and exculpatory\u201d <em>(see </em>47 AD3d at 120 [emphasis added]). In any event, we reject this standard, as it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to satisfy absent review of the relevant documents <em>(see Pennsylvania v Ritchie, </em>480 US 39, 57 [1987]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\">.

A trial court may conduct an in camera review of subpoenaed materials to assess an opposing party\u2019s privilege claims <em>(see Matter of Subpoena Duces Tecum to Jane Doe, </em>99 NY2d 434, 442 [2003]; <em>accord Matter of Nassau County Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated June 24, 2003, </em>4 NY3d 665, 679 n 11 [2005]). Here, however, no such review was necessary because defendants failed to meet the statutory criteria necessary to obtain production of the director-witness statements <em>(see </em>CPLR 3101 [d] [2]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\">. In its letter accompanying production of these documents, Tyco referenced an agreement with the District Attorney, whereby \u201cproduction . . . would not constitute a waiver of any privilege.\u201d In light of our conclusion that these documents were unrelated to the director-witness statements, we need not pass upon the effect\u2014if any\u2014of Tyco\u2019s \u201creservation\u201d of its privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">. Defendants also premise their documentary waiver claims on the introduction in evidence of KELP summaries prepared by UKW\u00a1 a forensic accounting firm that assisted Boies Schiller in its investigation, and the minutes of the board\u2019s August 14 meeting, which described Boies\u2019s recommendation that Tyco fire Swartz and summarized Tyco\u2019s counsel\u2019s discussion with an assistant district attorney regarding Swartz\u2019s potential indictment.
