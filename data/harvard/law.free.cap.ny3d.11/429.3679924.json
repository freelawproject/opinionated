The question is whether the State can recover its remainder interest in an amount equal to the \u201ctotal medical assistance paid\u201d on behalf of the recipient, or whether the State is limited to the amount expended from the trust\u2019s effective date to the recipient\u2019s death. We hold that the State can recover the entire amount paid from any remaining trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Kathleen XX. suffered a grand mal seizure during pregnancy and delivered her son, Abraham, prematurely by emergency cesarean section on July 28, 1992. As a result, Abraham suffered from spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy. He entered custodial care at the Broome Developmental Center (operated by the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disability [OMRDD]) in 1994, and the State assumed the costs of Abraham\u2019s room and care through the Medicaid program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kathleen litigated a successful malpractice suit on Abraham\u2019s behalf against her physicians and the hospital. Prior to a $103 million jury verdict, the action settled for $5 million pursuant to a high-low agreement. The State filed a lien for $1,707,884.95 against the proceeds of Abraham\u2019s settlement, representing the Medicaid costs paid from his entry into custodial care through the date of the jury\u2019s verdict on March 23, 1998 <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 104-b). The State has received full payment of its lien and it is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Payment of the settlement was delayed due to the parties\u2019 dispute regarding allocation of the proceeds. Abraham remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>in care during this time, and the State continued to pay his Medicaid costs until a $2.17 million lump-sum settlement payment made him Medicaid-ineligible. After years of litigation and an appeal to this Court <em>(see Gold v United Health Servs. Hosps., </em>95 NY2d 683 [2001]) the $2.17 million was retroactively placed in a supplemental needs trust (SNT) created on Abraham\u2019s behalf, thereby reviving his Medicaid eligibility. As a result, there exists a gap between the date of the jury\u2019s verdict (also the expiration date of the State\u2019s Medicaid lien)\u2014March 23, 1998\u2014and the date the SNT was funded\u2014September 12, 1999.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reimbursement for Medicaid payments made during this gap is the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Abraham died on June 11, 2003, just shy of his 11th birthday. The SNT Agreement provides that upon Abraham\u2019s death, the trustees must pay the State</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201cto the extent then required by law . . . such amount as shall be necessary to provide reimbursement for expenditures made for medical assistance for Abraham [XX.] . . . through Medicaid . . . and the balance, if any remains, shall be paid to the personal representative of the estate of Abraham [XX.].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Accordingly, the State filed a verified claim against the trust for just over $1.5 million for Medicaid payments made on Abraham\u2019s behalf from March 24, 1998 through the date of his discharge from the Broome Center in October 2001. Kathleen stipulated to payment of the claim, reserving the right to seek a refund. The State alleges that after payment of its claim, there remained approximately $285,000 in the trust plus title to a home purchased for Abraham.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">As relevant to this appeal, Kathleen then petitioned for repayment by the State of $961,810.89, representing the \u201cGap Medicaid\u201d paid from March 24, 1998 to September 12, 1999. She argued that the State was precluded from recovering funds in excess of its Medicaid lien based on res judicata. Supreme Court agreed in part and ordered a partial refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The Appellate Division modified Supreme Court\u2019s order, reversed the partial refund and granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reasoning that the State\u2019s right to reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>bursement derives from the terms of the trust agreement, which designates the State as the primary remainderman. Because Kathleen \u201celected to avail Abraham of the eligibility benefits of an SNT, [she] is now bound by the terms of the trust agreement to reimburse [the State] for all Medicaid expended on Abraham\u2019s behalf\u2019 (36 AD3d 1085, 1089 [3d Dept 2007]). The court also held that res judicata did not apply to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On appeal to this Court, Kathleen solely disputes the State\u2019s right to reimbursement for the period from March 24, 1998 (the day after the malpractice suit\u2019s jury verdict) through September 12, 1999 (the day the SNT was funded).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She concedes that the State is entitled to retain its recovery of Medicaid payments made after the SNT was funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">A supplemental needs trust is a planning tool used to shelter a severely disabled person\u2019s assets for the dual purpose of securing or maintaining eligibility for state-funded services, and enhancing the disabled person\u2019s quality of life with supplemental care paid by his or her trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In New York, the SNT\u2014though not so named at the time\u2014 originated in a 1978 Surrogate\u2019s Court decision in which the court prevented the State from invading the principal of a testamentary trust created by a father for the lifetime benefit of his severely disabled daughter <em>(Matter of Escher, </em>94 Misc 2d 952 [1978], <em>affd </em>75 AD2d 531 [1st Dept 1980], <em>affd 52 </em>NY2d 1006 [1981]). The decision introduced the concept of using a discretionary trust to supplement the care of severely disabled individuals without jeopardizing the individual\u2019s right to government-provided medical care during the beneficiary\u2019s lifetime <em>(see </em>Turano, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 17B, EPTL 7-1.12, at 319). A widely-used planning device among parents of disabled children, in 1993 the Legislature codified the SNT in order to provide clarity and uniformity in the law <em>(see </em>EPTL 7-1.12, as added by L 1993, ch 433, \u00a7 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">In the same year that New York State codified the SNT, the United States Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconcili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ation Act of 1993 (OBRA) to \u201ctighten the eligibility requirements for Medicaid\u201d and to curb abusive asset transfers, especially by the elderly (Rosenberg, <em>Supplemental Needs Trusts for People with Disabilities: The Development of a Private Trust in the Public Interest, </em>10 BU Pub Int LJ 91, 127 [2000]). The general rule is that a Medicaid candidate\u2019s trust assets are considered \u201cavailable resources\u201d and count toward determining that candidate\u2019s eligibility for state services.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Disability advocates\u2014concerned about the viability of trusts created by parents to provide for their disabled children\u2019s futures\u2014lobbied the federal government for protection. One such protection materialized in 42 USC \u00a7 1396p (d) (4) (A)\u2014the federal provision at issue here\u2014by striking a balance between the tightened eligibility requirements and the heightened needs of severely disabled individuals who receive a lump sum of money sizeable enough to end their Medicaid eligibility. Section 1396p (d) (4) (A) states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">\u201c[a] trust containing the assets of an individual under age 65 who is disabled . . . and which is established for the benefit of such individual by a parent, grandparent, legal guardian of the individual, or a court [and which provides that] <em>the State will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of such individual up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual </em>under a State plan under this subchapter\u201d shall not be considered an \u201cavailable resource\u201d of the trust beneficiary and shall not impact his or her Medicaid eligibility (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The Medicaid SNT represented \u201ca departure from the rules governing \u2018available resources,\u2019 which would otherwise make a person ineligible for Medicaid\u201d (Rosenberg, 10 BU Pub Int LJ at 132). The New York State Legislature enacted a substantially similar provision in 1994 <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 366 [2] [b] [2] [iii] [A]).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Here, Abraham\u2019s parents took advantage of the Medicaid SNT provision in order to shelter the multi-million-dollar settlement he received as a result of the malpractice suit. The SNT agreement states that upon Abraham\u2019s death the trust shall terminate and \u201cto the extent then required by law\u201d the trustees must \u201cpay to the State . . . such amount as shall be necessary to provide reimbursement for expenditures made for medical assistance for Abraham [XX.] by the State . . . through Medicaid.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>When interpreting a trust agreement we usually rely on the words of the trust itself. Here, however, the trust refers us to the Medicaid statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Pursuant to federal and state law, the State held a remainder interest in all amounts remaining in the trust \u201cup to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396p [d] [4] [A]) or \u201cup to the total value of all medical assistance paid\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 366 [2] [b] [2] [iii] [A]) on behalf of the trust\u2019s beneficiary. The question before us is whether \u201ctotal medical assistance paid\u201d is limited by the date of the trust\u2019s creation, or whether it extends to the lifetime benefits paid on behalf of the recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Despite the 15 years since the OBRA amendments, we have found limited case law addressing the narrow issue now before us. Thus, we are left with the plain language of the statute and the policy behind its enactment. The words of the statute\u2014 though perhaps surprising at first blush\u2014are clear and absolute. When a trust is established pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1396p (d) (4) (A) or Social Services Law \u00a7 366 (2) (b) (2) (iii) (A), the beneficiary explicitly provides the State with a right to recover the <em>total </em>Medicaid paid on behalf of that individual. There is no temporal limitation. The sole, though substantial, stated limitation on the State\u2019s recovery is the existence of remaining assets in the trust upon the beneficiary\u2019s death. If assets are available, according to the words of the statute the State may recover the total amount of benefits paid throughout the beneficiary\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">This construction advances the underlying purpose of the bargain struck between the SNT beneficiary and the State. The SNT is available only to applicants under the age of 65 with severe disabilities as defined by statute. Unless the applicant placed excess assets in the Medicaid SNT for supplemental care, he or she would no longer be eligible for Medicaid, thus relieving the State of a substantial financial burden. In order to further Medicaid\u2019s purpose of providing medical assistance to needy persons, the State agrees to continue paying Medicaid costs\u2014in instances where it would otherwise be relieved of this obligation\u2014in exchange for the <em>possibility </em>of reimbursement upon the recipient\u2019s death. The State in a sense is like an insurer calculating risk. For every recipient who depletes the trust before death, the State can expect some trusts to have sufficient assets upon a recipient\u2019s death to offset the additional cost of continuing Medicaid payments for these severely disabled individuals who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>otherwise would be ineligible. Moreover, the State\u2019s right to reimbursement occurs only upon the death of the beneficiary\u2014at a time when the life-enhancing purpose of the trust can no longer be effectuated. The Medicaid SNT reflects a policy decision to balance the needs of the severely disabled and the State\u2019s need for funds to sustain the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Nor do the anti-recovery provisions of the federal and state Medicaid statutes change this result. Kathleen XX. asserts that the terms of the SNT must be modified by Medicaid\u2019s anti-recovery provisions. Social Services Law \u00a7 369 (2) (b) (i) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201c[notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this chapter or other law, no adjustment or recovery may be made against the property of any individual on account of any medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of an individual under this title, except that recoveries must be pursued [in circumstances inapplicable to this case].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The federal and state statutes are similar, but New York\u2019s provision restricts the bar to recovery of correctly paid Medicaid \u201cagainst the property of any individual\u201d whereas the federal provision restricts the recovery of correctly paid Medicaid without limiting the source of recovery <em>(see </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396p [b] [1] [\u201cNo adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the State plan may be made\u201d]). All parties agree that the Medicaid paid on behalf of Abraham was \u201ccorrectly paid.\u201d Kathleen XX. argues that the State\u2019s recovery of correctly paid Medicaid from the remainder of the trust assets must be limited to Medicaid paid from the date the trust was established. Any further recovery, she argues, would violate the anti-recovery provisions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The anti-recovery provisions are not applicable to the unique context of SNTs created under 42 USC \u00a7 1396p (d) (4) (A) or Social Services Law \u00a7 366 (2) (b) (2) (iii) (A). The anti-recovery provisions are rules of general applicability for all Medicaid recipients regardless of the severity of disability. The SNT statute, by contrast, specifically addresses the unique and difficult situation faced by severely disabled individuals with assets that are sufficient to end their Medicaid eligibility but insufficient to account for their medical costs. One provision is distinct from the other. There is no need to look beyond the terms of the SNT statute and the terms of the SNT itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>More compellingly, appellant\u2019s construction does not address the anomaly it creates. As stated, no one disputes that the Medicaid paid on behalf of Abraham was correctly paid. That includes Medicaid paid after the establishment of the trust. Therefore, even under appellant\u2019s construction, the State will recover correctly paid Medicaid pursuant to the terms of the SNT. While the date of the SNT\u2019s establishment may be a convenient limitation of the State\u2019s remainder interest, there is no basis in the language of the statutes limiting the State\u2019s recovery of correctly paid Medicaid from that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Moreover, it should be noted that although the express exceptions do not apply to this case, they are helpful to deciphering the application of SNT reimbursement. Generally, the statutes permit the State to recover correctly paid Medicaid in circumstances where the individual or his dependents will no longer need the resources (see <em>generally </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396p [b] [2]; Social Services Law \u00a7 369 [2] [b] [i], [ii], [iii]). Here, too, recovery occurs only upon the recipient\u2019s death and only if assets remain in the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Finally, appellant argues that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arkansas Dept. of Health &amp; Human Servs. v Ahlborn </em>(547 US 268 [2006]) mandates that the anti-recovery provisions apply in this context. We disagree. In <em>Ahlborn, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state\u2019s assignment right to \u201cpayment for medical care from any third party\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396k [a] [1] [A]) grants the state a right only to the portion of a judgment or settlement allocated to medical care and not to portions allocated toward lost wages or pain and suffering. In so holding, the Supreme Court added that Arkansas\u2019s statute\u2014which permitted the state to recover from the entirety of the settlement\u2014conflicted with the anti-lien provision found in 42 USC \u00a7 1396p (a). The anti-lien provision is not at issue in this case and the U.S. Supreme Court expressly declined to address the impact, if any, of the anti-recovery provision in 42 USC \u00a7 1396p (b) <em>(see Ahlborn, </em>547 US at 284 n 13). <em>Ahlborn </em>did not involve the interpretation of an SNT, or the interpretation of the Medicaid SNT statute, and it is therefore inapplicable to the matter before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">We recognize that in this case the State would not have been entitled to reimbursement for Medicaid paid from March 24, 1998 through September 12, 1999 had the SNT not been ere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ated. Equally significant, however, is that Abraham would not have been entitled to receive the benefits of Medicaid throughout his life but for the establishment of the SNT. The language of the statute is plain and clear, and the policy reasons support our interpretation. That the result may sometimes inure to the State\u2019s benefit as opposed to the beneficiary\u2019s estate is the product of a calculated legislative decision and a calculated choice by the family in setting up the SNT.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We have considered appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-11\">. The daily cost of room and care when Abraham entered the Broome Center was $828.42. It rose to $2,164.59 during his six years at the facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\">. The precise dates of this gap vary by a few days throughout the record. We have adopted the dates utilized by both parties in their briefs to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\">. The Appellate Division had remitted to Supreme Court for fact-finding with respect to Kathleen\u2019s additional claim to a refund of $34,633.64, representing Medicaid paid from October 16, 2000 to October 31, 2000. A final judgment of Supreme Court dismissing this claim was entered from which this appeal is now taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. As in virtually every matter that reaches our Court, an argument also can be made for the opposite result\u2014and the dissent does so here. We conclude, however, that the better result is to affirm the Appellate Division. First, the best evidence of legislative intent is the words Congress has used in the governing statute. Congress has said that, in exchange for otherwise unavailable Medicaid assistance, an SNT beneficiary must grant the State a remainder interest in the trust assets equal to the \u201ctotal medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual.\u201d The only limitation, if it can be so labeled, is the limitless word \u201ctotal.\u201d Second, Congress\u2019s decision to make the SNT available to severely disabled individuals (rather than their families) does not mean it is an appropriate planning tool for every situation\u2014each family must weigh its particular circumstances in receiving the benefits of this tool against its potential disadvantages. Whether the State receives a \u201cwindfall\u201d\u2014or nothing\u2014as a result of this bargain, creating the SNT in either event will clearly benefit the severely disabled individual throughout his or her lifetime, which is the very purpose of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b517-7\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aty\">(dissenting). The federal statute that allows use of a supplemental needs trust (SNT) to preserve Medicaid eligibility provides that, after the beneficiary\u2019s death, the State will receive from the SNT \u201can amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396p [d] [4] [A]). The majority reads this to mean \u201cthe total medical assistance paid during the individual\u2019s lifetime.\u201d This is a possible reading, but the words can also be reasonably read to mean \u201cthe total medical assistance paid as a result of the SNT,\u201d and I think that is the meaning Congress is more likely to have intended. Unless the words are read in that way, a class of disabled people\u2014those who received significant Medicaid payments before they had enough money to fund a trust\u2014will never become SNT beneficiaries, because their families will know that the effect of establishing an SNT will be to impoverish their estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The statute defines an SNT as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201cA trust containing the assets of an individual under age 65 who is disabled (as defined in section 1382c (a) (3) of this title) and which is established for the benefit of such individual by a parent, grandparent, legal guardian of the individual, or a court if the State will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of such individual up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual under a State plan under this subchapter.\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396p [d] [4] [A].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The law allows the assets of an SNT to be disregarded in determining eligibility for Medicaid, thus producing an unusual situation: a person eligible for Medicaid who is not poor, and may even be very wealthy. Often, as in this case, the wealth is the result of a recovery in a tort action. Congress allows the use of an SNT to preserve Medicaid eligibility for the possessors of such wealth only where the beneficiary of the trust is seriously disabled\u2014if an adult, \u201cunable to engage in any substantial gainful activity,\u201d or, if a child, afflicted with \u201cmarked and severe functional limitations\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1382c [a] [3] [A], [C] [i]).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The purpose of the statute is \u201cto allow a person with a disability to have an additional source of support during her lifetime\u201d (Rosenberg, <em>Supplemental Needs Trusts for People With Disabilities: The Development of a Private Trust in the Public Interest, </em>10 BU Pub Int LJ 91, 132 [2000]). And since the purpose of the trust is to help the beneficiary, not to enrich his or her heirs, it would not be fair to let the heirs get the assets of the SNT upon the beneficiary\u2019s death without reimbursing the State for Medicaid payments. The arrangement may be thought of as a loan\u2014indeed, a commentator has labeled the SNT a \u201cPayback Trust\u201d and \u201cA Bargain for Life\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 131). The essence of the bargain is that the State pays Medicaid during the beneficiary\u2019s lifetime, and is paid back from anything remaining in the trust after the beneficiary\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">But what of the beneficiary who was already a Medicaid recipient when he or she was poor\u2014before either the SNT or the assets to fund it existed? This was the situation of Abraham, the beneficiary in this case, for several years before he recovered a large tort award. Most of the Medicaid payments made during that time were recouped by the State through the enforcement of its lien on Abraham\u2019s recovery <em>(see Gold v United Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>Servs. Hosps., </em>95 NY2d 683 [2001]), but there remained a period of several months\u2014the period from the date the verdict was rendered to the date it was paid\u2014during which the State paid for Abraham\u2019s care and was not reimbursed for it; during that period, Abraham was entitled to Medicaid simply because he needed medical care and did not have any money. No SNT was necessary to make him Medicaid-eligible. The main issue in this case is whether the State can recover some $472,000 in Medicaid payments made during that interval. (Abraham\u2019s estate disputes a larger sum, but I would resolve that dispute in the State\u2019s favor.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">A similar issue could arise in other cases and involve much larger amounts. Suppose, for example, that an adult who has been a Medicaid recipient all his life, and for whom the State has paid millions, then has an accident resulting in a large tort award\u2014or simply receives a large inheritance. In such a case, the State ordinarily will get none of its Medicaid money back, no matter how immensely rich the former Medicaid recipient has become. With exceptions not relevant here, federal law provides: \u201cNo adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the State plan may be made\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 1396p [b] [1]). In Abraham\u2019s case, if no SNT had been created, this statute would prevent the recovery of the $472,000 at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">But under the majority\u2019s holding, the creation of an SNT changes the picture, and results in a windfall to the State. Because the majority reads \u201ctotal medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual\u201d to mean everything paid during the individual\u2019s lifetime, the effect of the SNT in the case of the hypothetical adult is to make the unrecoverable millions in Medicaid payments recoverable from the SNT at the beneficiary\u2019s death. In practice, this probably will not happen for the simple reason that, if correctly advised, the adult\u2019s family will not create an SNT. But surely there is no good reason why that particular disabled person should lose the benefit of a federal statute designed to help people with similar disabilities. I would therefore read the statute in a way consistent with its purpose, taking \u201ctotal medical assistance paid\u201d to include only the total paid as a result of the SNT\u2019s existence\u2014thus effectuating the loan or \u201cpayback\u201d that the authors of the statute plainly intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The majority says that its construction advances the statutory purpose because it provides the State with a funding source: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201cFor every recipient who depletes the trust before death, the State can expect some trusts to have sufficient assets upon a recipient\u2019s death to offset the additional cost . . . (Majority op at 436.) I am unpersuaded, because the State will actually get its windfall only in the exceptional case where a trust is <em>unforeseeably </em>left with enough assets to pay back pre-SNT Medicaid. Where that event is foreseeable, and where the preSNT Medicaid is substantial, the beneficiary\u2019s family simply will not create the trust at all. In a way, it is true, that this will benefit the State, because there will be no SNT and no Medicaid payments going forward\u2014but it seems highly unlikely that it was Congress\u2019s purpose to benefit the State by deterring the creation of SNTs.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">For these reasons, I would reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Judges Ciparick, Read, Pigott and Jones concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge Smith dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion; Judge Geaffeo taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
