Defendant confessed to the shooting, but claimed that the revolver discharged accidentally. Supreme Court sentenced him as a persistent violent felony offender to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 25 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">On this appeal, we are asked to consider whether defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his allegation that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>of his predicate felony convictions was secured in violation of his constitutional right to counsel. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant an adjournment to gather further evidence in support of his allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">At defendant\u2019s arraignment in August 2005, the People filed with the court, and served on defendant, a \u201cStatement of Two or More Predicate Felony Convictions.\u201d The statement notified defendant of two predicate violent felony convictions: a June 15, 2004 conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree; and a January 23, 1991 conviction for robbery in the first degree. Trial commenced on November 15, 2005, and the jury convicted defendant on November 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">On December 14, 2005\u2014four months after the People filed the persistent violent felony offender statement, and three weeks after the verdict\u2014defendant appeared with counsel for sentencing. Defense counsel informed Supreme Court that defendant had a constitutional challenge to the 2004 conviction, which resulted from a trial in absentia because \u201c[apparently his defense attorney in that case did not participate in the trial, did not cross-examine witnesses, and did not put forth a defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The judge asked defense counsel if he had an affidavit from the lawyer who represented defendant in the 2004 case, or if that lawyer was present. Counsel responded \u201cNo\u201d to both queries, and requested an adjournment to \u201cfile motions.\u201d The judge responded, \u201cWhy should I adjourn it? It\u2019s a surprise to you? Because we discussed it at great length before the trial,\u201d meaning \u201cwhether or not [defendant] was a mandatory persistent violent felony offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">When counsel reiterated that he was challenging the constitutionality of the conviction based on ineffective assistance, the judge interjected that \u201c[defendant\u2019s obligation is to do more.\u201d Counsel then responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">\u201cI believe I have placed on the record the fact that [the] defense attorney in that case . . . did not participate in the trial in any meaningful way. I think if you want to explore it further I think we need to ask [the attorney] why that was the case. I believe that is certainly sufficient to raise a presumption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>He did not receive effective assistance of counsel, his attorney did not participate in the trial[;j complete lack of participation seemingly would constitute ineffective assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Supreme Court stated that, under appellate case law, a lawyer\u2019s deliberate choice not to participate in a trial as a protest does not amount to ineffective assistance, and so \u201cthe law [was] against [defendant].\u201d The judge further observed that she was \u201cnot hearing anything\u201d from counsel \u201cthat says that maybe there was a good thing [the attorney in the 2004 case] could have done once the complaining witness\u201d\u2014defendant\u2019s wife\u2014\u201cshowed up in that case.\u201d Counsel responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, if you want to give me time to order the minutes of that trial. I can\u2019t give you any specifics about the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The judge concluded by observing to defense counsel that he had enjoyed sufficient</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201ctime to prepare a meaningful challenge to this previous felony conviction and right now you just sort of tell me, well, I want more time, I\u2019m entitled to more time, and let me just sort of cast around here. I\u2019m still not hearing any reason to think that there is going to be something developed there, so I\u2019m finding the defendant a mandatory persistent felony offender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The court then sentenced defendant, who appealed both his conviction and his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The Appellate Division affirmed. As for defendant\u2019s sentence, the court concluded that Supreme Court did not err by sentencing him as a persistent violent felony offender \u201cwithout affording him both an adjournment to obtain the transcript of the prior trial and a hearing to determine whether the conviction was unconstitutional\u201d <em>(People v Diggins, </em>45 AD3d 266, 267 [1st Dept [2007]). The Appellate Division reasoned that defendant \u201cadvanced only conclusory allegations, not warranting a hearing, that his conviction for weapons possession was obtained without the effective assistance of counsel\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 268). Further, he \u201chad ample opportunity to obtain the minutes of the prior proceedings for review by the sentencing court, which was not required to grant him an adjournment under the circumstances\u201d <em>(id.). </em>A Judge of this Court subsequently granted defendant leave to appeal (10 NY3d 810 [2008]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">A \u201cpersistent violent felony offender\u201d includes \u201ca person who stands convicted of a violent felony offense . . . after having previously been subjected to two or more predicate violent felony convictions\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 70.08 [1] [a]). Upon finding that a person is a persistent violent felony offender, \u201cthe court must impose an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, the maximum term of which shall be life imprisonment\u201d and the minimum term of which \u201cmust be in accordance with [Penal Law \u00a7 70.08 (3)]\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 70.08 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 400.16 (2) states that the procedure for determining whether a person is a persistent violent felony offender is governed by CPL 400.15. This procedure furthers the principle that a \u201cconviction obtained in violation of one\u2019s constitutional rights may not be used to enhance punishment for another offense\u201d <em>(People v Harris, </em>61 NY2d 9, 16 [1983]; <em>see </em>CPL 400.15 [7] [b] [defendant may \u201ccontrovert an allegation with respect to\u201d a prior conviction on the ground it was unconstitutionally obtained \u201cat any time during the course of the hearing hereunder\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The statute specifies that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201c[w]hen information available to the court or to the people prior to sentencing for a violent felony offense indicates that the defendant may have previously been subjected to a predicate violent felony conviction, a statement must be filed by the prosecutor before sentence is imposed setting forth the date and place of each alleged predicate violent felony conviction\u201d (CPL 400.15 [2]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The statute next provides for a preliminary examination. Specifically, the \u201cdefendant must be given a copy of such statement and the court must ask him whether he wishes to controvert any allegation made therein\u201d (CPL 400.15 [3]). A defendant who \u201cwishes to controvert any allegation in the statement . . . must specify the particular allegation or allegations he wishes to controvert\u201d <em>(id,.). </em>Uncontroverted allegations are deemed admitted <em>(see id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">\u201cWhere the uncontroverted allegations in the statement are sufficient to support a finding that the defendant has been subjected to a predicate violent felony conviction the court must enter such finding\u201d and sentence the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>accordingly (CPL 400.15 [4]). The court is, however, required to hold a hearing \u201c[w]here the defendant controverts an allegation in the statement and the uncontroverted allegations in such statement are not sufficient to support a finding that the defendant has been subjected to a predicate violent felony conviction\u201d (CPL 400.15 [5]). The hearing \u201cmust be before the court without jury\u201d (CPL 400.15 [7] [a]). The People bear the burden to prove \u201cthat the defendant has been subjected to a predicate violent felony conviction . . . beyond a reasonable doubt by evidence admissible under the rules applicable to a trial of the issue of guilt\u201d <em>(id.), </em>but not the prior conviction\u2019s constitutionality <em>(see Harris, </em>61 NY2d at 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Subdivision (6) of CPL 400.15, entitled \u201cTime for hearing,\u201d states as follows: \u201cIn any case where a copy of the statement was not received by the defendant at least two days prior to the preliminary examination, the court must upon request of the defendant grant an adjournment of at least two days before proceeding with the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Thus, the statute contemplates that the court will proceed immediately from the preliminary examination to the hearing unless the defendant did not receive the statement at least two days beforehand. If this two-day notice requirement is met, the decision whether to grant an adjournment of the hearing is within the court\u2019s discretion. This is consistent with the general rule that \u201c[t]he granting of an adjournment for any purpose is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d <em>(Matter of Anthony M., </em>63 NY2d 270, 283 [1984]).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Here, defendant admits that he received the People\u2019s predicate violent felony conviction statement at his arraignment in August 2005, four months before his December 2005 sentencing. Further, Supreme Court was willing to hold an evidentiary hearing based on defendant\u2019s claim that his counsel did not participate in the 2004 trial, as shown by its inquiry whether defendant had an affidavit from that attorney, or if the attorney was present to testify. Thus, the precise issue on this appeal is whether Supreme Court abused its discretion in denying defendant his request for an adjournment to \u201cfile motions,\u201d presumably aimed at gathering evidence to prove that his 2004 felony conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The statute clearly puts defense counsel on notice to be prepared to proceed with an evidentiary hearing so long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the predicate violent felony offender statement is received at least two days before the preliminary examination. Of course, it may not always be feasible for counsel to obtain minutes or other documents in time for a hearing that immediately follows a preliminary examination. But counsel in this case did not suggest that he had made any effort to obtain the 2004 minutes. He did not even specifically request the adjournment for the purpose of procuring the minutes; instead, he merely cited their unavailability as the reason why he could not \u201cgive [the judge] any specifics about the [2004] trial\u201d in response to her questions and observations. In addition, counsel did not provide the judge with an affidavit from the attorney who represented defendant in the 2004 trial, or secure that attorney\u2019s live testimony. He simply asserted that this attorney completely failed to participate in the 2004 trial; however, defendant was concededly tried in absentia, giving rise to an inference that the attorney\u2019s nonparticipation was a protest strategy that would not support a claim of ineffective assistance (see <em>People v Aiken, </em>45 NY2d 394, 399 [1978]). In light of these circumstances, Supreme Court was not required, as a matter of law, to grant defendant an adjournment to try to put together a more persuasive case.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Finally, defendant also asserts that his conviction should be reversed because Supreme Court erred by permitting the jury to consider evidence that he had previously been convicted of three gun-related offenses. The evidence of .defendant\u2019s prior gun-related convictions was highly probative of his intent, however, given that he claimed that the shooting was accidental, and at least suggested in a videotaped statement admitted at trial that he was unaccustomed to handling firearms. As the judge also observed, the witnesses to the shooting (the victim and his roommate) were \u201cextremely impeachable\u201d: they both had prior criminal records; the victim was for a long time unwilling to cooperate with the police and the prosecutors because he was scared of defendant. Importantly, Supreme Court limited the potential for prejudice in two ways: by reading into the record a hare-bones stipulation consisting only of the conviction dates, the names of the crimes and, in two cases, the type of gun involved; second, by repeatedly instructing the jurors to consider this evidence only in relation to the issue of accident, not propensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
