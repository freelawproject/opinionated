Defendant, who was indicted for first degree murder based on his killing of a person he had abducted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>argues that the indictment was legally insufficient because it \u201cdouble counted\u201d the death of the victim, relying on it both as an element of first degree murder and as an element of first degree kidnapping. We reject defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Defendant was indicted for several crimes related to the abduction and death of Patrick Bhola. The first count accused him of murder in the first degree, alleging that defendant \u201cwith intent to cause the death of Patrick Bhola, caused the death of Patrick Bhola by stabbing and beating him about the body\u201d; and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">\u201cPatrick Bhola was killed while the defendant . . . was in the course of and in furtherance of committing the crime of kidnapping in the first degree . . . to wit: the defendant . . . abducted Patrick Bhola and Patrick Bhola died during the abduction and before he was able to return and be returned to safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">After a motion to dismiss the indictment was denied, defendant pleaded guilty to murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. As part of the plea bargain, he signed a waiver of appeal, but the People agreed to an exception to the waiver allowing him to raise on appeal the argument he now advances. The Appellate Division affirmed (43 AD3d 1084 [2007]). A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal (9 NY3d 1007 [2007]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Defendant argues that the facts stated in the indictment do not constitute the crime of first degree murder. This argument attacks the facial sufficiency of the accusatory instrument, and so is not forfeited by defendant\u2019s guilty plea <em>(People v Taylor, </em>65 NY2d 1, 5 [1985]), but it fails on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Penal Law \u00a7 125.27 says, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">\u201cA person is guilty of murder in the first degree when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">\u201c1. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-14\">\u201c(a) . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhG4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201c(vii) the victim was killed while the defendant was in the course of committing . . . and in furtherance of. . . kidnapping in the first degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Penal Law \u00a7 135.25 says, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cA person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and when . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201c3. The person abducted dies during the abduction or before he is able to return or to be returned to safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The indictment in this case tracks the language of these statutes. It alleges the elements of murder in the first degree, including a killing \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a first degree kidnapping, and it also alleges the elements of first degree kidnapping, including the abduction and the death of the person abducted. Defendant argues that the indictment is nevertheless insufficient because it violates a rule against \u201cdouble counting\u201d that defendant finds in <em>People v Cahill </em>(2 NY3d 14 [2003]). Defendant reads <em>Cahill </em>too broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Cahill was indicted for first degree murder based on a killing committed in the course of, and in furtherance of, burglary in the second degree (2 NY3d at 62-63). It is an element of second degree burglary that the person committing it \u201centers or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 140.25). The crime that Cahill intended to commit when he entered the building was the murder he in fact committed; thus, the same criminal intent supported both the murder charge and the aggravating factor, the burglary. Reversing Cahill\u2019s first degree murder conviction, we accepted his argument \u201cthat this circularity is impermissible\u201d (2 NY3d at 64). In this case, defendant says that a similar \u201ccircularity\u201d exists, because the victim\u2019s death is an element both of first degree murder and of the predicate kidnapping crime. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\"><em>Cahill </em>did not hold that, in first degree felony murder cases, the murder and the predicate felony can have no common elements. The problem in <em>Cahill </em>was the double counting of one criminal <em>intent. </em>We said that Cahill\u2019s \u201cconviction cannot stand because the burglary carried no <em>intent </em>other than to commit the murder\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 62 [emphasis added]). We explained that, in defining first degree murder\u2014a crime which could make a defendant eligible for the death penalty\u2014the Legislature required murder and \u201c[a]n additional aggravating factor\u2014murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u2018plus\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 64). But where \u201cthe very same mens rea\u2014the intent to kill\u201d was used to define both the murder and the aggravating factor, the legislative goal of \u201cnarrowing rather than expanding the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty\u201d had not been achieved <em>(id. </em>at 64, 65). The gist of <em>Cahill </em>is that where only one criminal intent, the intent to kill, is shown, defendant\u2019s crime has not been \u201caggravated\u201d to first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">That is not true here. Here, the murder defendant committed and the predicate crime that serves as an aggravation arise from two distinct intents\u2014the intent to kill the victim and the intent to abduct him. The intent to abduct aggravated the crime of murder, and defendant is thus a member of that class of murderers whose crime is significantly worse than ordinary murder\u2014\u201cmurder plus.\u201d It is of no moment that a factual circumstance other than defendant\u2019s intent\u2014in this case, the victim\u2019s death\u2014is an element of both the murder and the predicate felony. <em>Cahill </em>is satisfied by the showing of a second criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The result defendant seeks here would contradict the obvious intention of the authors of the first degree murder statute. The authors specifically included kidnapping in the first degree as a predicate crime, and one of the three subdivisions of the first degree kidnapping statute (Penal Law \u00a7 135.25 [3]) applies only in cases where the victim dies. On defendant\u2019s reading, the Legislature intended to exclude virtually all section 135.25 (3) kidnappings from the first degree murder statute\u2014all except those in which the person abducted dies and the kidnapper murders someone else. Surely, if the Legislature had such an intention it would have said so more plainly. Indeed, that intention is an unlikely one to attribute to the Legislature\u2014an intention to punish one of the most heinous of crimes, kidnapping accompanied by murder of the victim, less severely than many other murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
