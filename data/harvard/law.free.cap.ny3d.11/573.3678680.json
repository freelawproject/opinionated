Like the courts below, we conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Plaintiff Claire Van Kipnis (wife) and defendant Gregory Van Kipnis (husband) were married in Paris, France in 1965. At the time of the parties\u2019 marriage, wife was a Canadian citizen from Quebec studying at the Sorbonne and husband was a citizen of the United States, having recently completed college. Prior to the marriage ceremony, wife had a \u201cContrat de Mariage\u201d drafted under the French Civil Code and arranged for legal counsel to explain the terms of the prenuptial agreement in English to husband. The agreement was executed by the parties on September 30, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Under the provisions of the Contrat de Mariage, the parties opted out of the community property scheme (the governing custom in France) in favor of a separation of estates regime. In relevant part, the agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">\u201cThe future spouses declare that they are adopting the marital property system of separation of estates, as established by the French Civil Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">\u201cConsequently, each spouse shall retain ownership and possession of the chattels and real property that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>he/she may own at this time or may come to own subsequently by any means whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cThey shall not be liable for each other\u2019s debts established before or during the marriage or encumbering the inheritances and gifts that they receive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cThe wife shall have all the rights and powers over her assets accorded by law to women married under the separate-estates system without any restriction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">After the wedding, the parties moved to New York where they resided during their 38-year marriage. Husband was employed in finance while wife worked as a professor at Cooper Union and later as a cultural counselor for the Quebec government. Wife was also the primary caretaker of the parties\u2019 two children, now emancipated. Throughout their marriage, the parties maintained separate accounts and assets, with the exception of the joint ownership of their two homes\u2014a $625,000 house in Massachusetts and a cooperative apartment in Manhattan valued at $1,825,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In 2002, wife commenced this action for divorce and ancillary relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following discovery, but before trial, Supreme Court granted husband\u2019s motion to amend his answer to assert the 1965 prenuptial agreement as a defense to wife\u2019s equitable distribution claims. After the Appellate Division affirmed the order permitting the amendment (8 AD3d 94 [2004]), Supreme Court appointed a Special Referee to conduct a hearing on the issues of equitable distribution, maintenance and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The Referee determined that the French contract provided for the separate ownership of assets held in the parties\u2019 respective names during the course of the marriage. As a result, husband retained his liquid assets of approximately $7 million and wife kept her assets ranging from $700,000 to $800,000. But as to the jointly held properties, which the parties agreed were subject to equitable distribution, the Referee recommended that wife be awarded the Manhattan apartment, together with $75,000 in reimbursement for repairs, and husband be awarded the country home in Massachusetts. After reviewing the statutory factors related to maintenance, the Referee proposed that wife receive $7,500 per month in maintenance until either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>husband or wife dies or wife remarries. Finally, the Referee concluded that legal fees expended in connection with wife\u2019s challenge to the prenuptial agreement were not compensable under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237. After deducting that portion of wife\u2019s claim for counsel fees attributable to contesting the agreement, the Referee awarded wife $92,779.57 in attorneys\u2019 fees. Supreme Court confirmed the Referee\u2019s report. The Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, affirmed (43 AD3d 71 [2007]), and we granted wife leave to appeal (10 NY3d 705 [2008]).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Wife contends that all of the parties\u2019 property should be subject to equitable distribution under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 (B) (5). She asserts that the 1965 agreement, drafted and executed in France, was intended to apply to property ownership during the course of the marriage, but not to the distribution of property in the event of a divorce. In her view, the primary purpose of the agreement was for each spouse to avoid liability for the other\u2019s debts. Belatedly, wife posits that a prenuptial agreement cannot waive a party\u2019s right to equitable distribution under the Domestic Relations Law absent an explicit waiver. Husband counters that the agreement unambiguously provides that the parties shall retain their property separately throughout their marriage and, as a result, all property not held in joint names must be treated as separate property and excluded from equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">It is well settled that duly executed prenuptial agreements are generally valid and enforceable given the \u201cstrong public policy favoring individuals ordering and deciding their own interests through contractual arrangements\u201d <em>(Bloomfield v Bloomfield, </em>97 NY2d 188, 193 [2001] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). As with all contracts, prenuptial agreements are construed in accord with the parties\u2019 intent, which is generally gleaned from what is expressed in their writing. Consequently, \u201ca written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms\u201d <em>(Greenfield v Philles Records, </em>98 NY2d 562, 569 [2002]). Extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent may not be considered unless a court first finds that the agreement is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Prenuptial agreements addressing the ownership, division or distribution of property must be read in conjunction with Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 (B), enacted in 1980 as part of New York\u2019s Equitable Distribution Law. The statute provides that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>unless the parties agree otherwise in a validly executed prenuptial agreement pursuant to section 236 (B) (3), upon dissolution of the marriage marital property must be distributed equitably between the parties while separate property shall remain separate <em>(see </em>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 [B] [5] [a]-[c]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As relevant here, separate property is defined to include \u201cproperty described as separate property by written agreement of the parties pursuant to subdivision three of this part\u201d (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 [B] [1] [d] [4]). Under the statute, a prenuptial agreement may include a \u201cprovision for the ownership, division or distribution of separate and marital property\u201d and is valid and enforceable if it \u201cis in writing, subscribed by the parties, and acknowledged or proven in the manner required to entitle a deed to be recorded\u201d (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 [B] [3]; <em>see also Matisoff v Dobi, </em>90 NY2d 127, 130 [1997]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The Domestic Relations Law therefore contemplates two basic types of prenuptial agreement that affect the equitable distribution of property. First, parties may expressly waive or opt out of the statutory scheme governing equitable distribution <em>(see e.g. Bloomfield, </em>97 NY2d at 193; <em>Housset v Housset, </em>200 AD2d 508, 509 [1st Dept 1994]). Second, parties may specifically designate as separate property assets that would ordinarily be defined as marital property subject to equitable distribution under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 (B) (5). Such property would then remain separate property upon dissolution of the marriage. In either case, the intent of the parties \u201cmust be clearly evidenced by the writing\u201d <em>(Tietjen v Tietjen, </em>48 AD3d 789, 791 [2d Dept 2008]).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Here, the parties\u2019 written agreement, adopting a \u201cseparation of estates\u201d scheme, falls within the second prenuptial agreement category. The agreement specifies that separate ownership of assets applies not only to the property that each party had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>acquired at the time of the marriage, but also to property that they \u201cmay come to own subsequently by any means whatsoever.\u201d It further assures that \u201cwife shall have all the rights and powers over her assets accorded by law to women married under the separate-estates system without any restriction.\u201d Contrary to wife\u2019s argument, the Domestic Relations Law contains no categorical requirement that a prenuptial agreement must set forth an express waiver of equitable distribution. Rather, when read together, Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 (B) (1) (d) (4) and (5) (b) provide that assets designated as separate property by a prenuptial agreement will remain separate after dissolution of the marriage. Such is the case here. Indeed, as recognized by the Appellate Division, with the exception of two jointly owned residences (which were distributed as marital property), the parties did not commingle their separately owned assets throughout their 38-year marriage. We therefore agree with the courts below that the agreement constitutes an unambiguous prenuptial contract that precludes equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 separate property, rendering it unnecessary to resort to extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Turning to the issue of maintenance, which was not addressed by the prenuptial agreement, wife contends that the courts below improperly weighed the factors listed in Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 (B) (6) (a), resulting in an inadequate monthly maintenance award. The record here, however, supports the affirmed findings of the courts below and we perceive no abuse of discretion in their calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Finally, wife submits that the courts below erred in precluding her recovery of legal fees under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 for services provided in opposing her husband\u2019s affirmative defense predicated on the prenuptial agreement. Neither party here seeks to set aside the prenuptial agreement; instead, their dispute centers on whether the terms of the contract apply to the ownership of assets upon divorce. In this respect, her request is similar to the fee application in <em>Ventimiglia v Ventimiglia </em>(36 AD3d 899 [2d Dept 2007]), where attorneys\u2019 fees were awarded to a party who contested her spouse\u2019s affirmative defense based on an antenuptial agreement. Remittal to Supreme Court for reconsideration is therefore necessary because this portion of wife\u2019s fee application should not have been excluded as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by remitting to Supreme Court for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ther proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\">. Husband had also commenced an action for divorce in Massachusetts that resulted in an ex parte, no-fault divorce. The Massachusetts court referred the parties\u2019 economic issues to wife\u2019s pending proceeding in New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">. Marital property is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">\u201call property acquired by either or both spouses during the marriage and before the execution of a separation agreement or the commencement of a matrimonial action, regardless of the form in which title is held, <em>except as otherwise provided in agreement pursuant to subdivision three of this part\u201d </em>(Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 [B] [1] [c] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\">. Noncompliance with the execution formalities outlined in Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 (B) (3) does not invalidate prenuptial agreements that predate the effective date of that subdivision <em>(see Bloomfield v Bloomfield, </em>97 NY2d 188, 194 [2001]). Here, wife concedes that the prenuptial agreement was validly executed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
