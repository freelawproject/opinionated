This Court ought not to extend the purpose of Limited Liability Company Law \u00a7 301 beyond that for which it was enacted. <em>(Agoado Realty Corp. v United Intl. Ins. Co., </em>95 NY2d 141.) II. Oversights such as that of Briggs Avenue LLC should not prejudice the rights of either the insured or the injured parties, where the parties have proceeded diligently upon discovering the facts. III. This Court should interpret the policy provision in appellant\u2019s favor and hold that service upon the Secretary of State without actual delivery to appellant did not trigger the requirement to give notice of the suit under the policy issued by Insurance Corporation of Hannover. <em>(105 St. Assoc. LLC v Greenwich Ins. Co., </em>507 F Supp 2d 377; <em>26 Warren Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>253 AD2d 375.) IV. It was not reasonably possible to give notice of the lawsuit within any prescribed time although it was given as soon as was reasonably possible. V. As a matter of law, respondent waived any claim that notice of the occurrence was late. <em>(General Acc. Ins. Group v Cirucci, </em>46 NY2d 862.) VI. Respondent\u2019s disclaimer was based solely on late notice of suit. <em>(Fabian v Motor Veh. Acc. Indem. Corp., </em>111 AD2d 366; <em>Matter of State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Cooper, </em>303 AD2d 414; <em>Matter of State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Joseph, </em>287 AD2d 724; <em>John v Centennial Ins. Co., </em>91 AD2d 1104; <em>Matter of Eveready Ins.

Lyness </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqS\">I. The instant Court should be persuaded by and accept the sound rationale of existing case law and the opinions of the District and Circuit Courts herein. <em>(26 Warren Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>253 AD2d 375; <em>FGB Realty Advisors v Norm-Rick Realty Corp., </em>227 AD2d 439; <em>Cedeno v Wimbledon Bldg. Corp., </em>207 AD2d 297; <em>Associated Imports v Amiel Publ., </em>168 AD2d 354.) II. The new legislative bill eradicating New York\u2019s long-standing no prejudice rule has no bearing upon this matter. III. Briggs Avenue LLC\u2019s first three points are unpreserved for appellate review by this Court. <em>(Bingham v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>99 NY2d 355; <em>Matter of Salino v Cimino, </em>1 NY3d 166; <em>Elezaj v Carlin Constr. Co., </em>89 NY2d 992; <em>Cummins v County of Onondaga, </em>84 NY2d 322; <em>Haynes v Haynes, </em>83 NY2d 954.) IV. New York Limited Liability Company Law \u00a7 301 actually confirms that notice to the New York Secretary of State\u2019s office constitutes notice to the limited liability company. V. Briggs Avenue LLC\u2019s reliance upon New York\u2019s direct action statute is equally inapposite. <em>(Wraight v Exchange Ins. Co., </em>234 AD2d 916; <em>Jenkins v Burgos, </em>99 AD2d 217; <em>Ringel v Blue Ridge Ins. Co., </em>293 AD2d 460.) VI. CPLR 317 and 318 also afford no basis for this Court to excuse the inexcusable. VII. <em>Agoado Realty Corp. v United Intl. Ins. Co. </em>(95 NY2d 141 [2000]) does not, as contended by Briggs Avenue LLC, suggest that notice to the Secretary of State does not, as a matter of law, constitute notice to defendant. VIII. Insurance Corporation of Hannover is a liability insurer, not a guarantor of Briggs Avenue LLC\u2019s liability to third parties. IX. Insurance Corporation of Hannover has not waived any of its notice defenses.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-6\"><em>Melito &amp; Adolfsen P.C., </em>New York City <em>(Ignatius John Melito, S.

The company was incorporated in 1999. Shaban Mehaj is its manager and only member. As required by Limited Liability Company Law \u00a7 301, Briggs\u2019s articles of organization designated the Secretary of State as its agent to receive service of process. The articles included Briggs\u2019s address, but Briggs later moved, and Mehaj did not notify the Secretary of State of the change. His explanation is that the lawyer who formed the company for him did not tell him of the need to keep the address updated.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">In July 2003, a tenant of the building, Nelson Bonilla, began a personal injury action against Briggs, and served the summons and complaint on the Secretary of State. Because the Secretary of State did not have a current address for Briggs, Mehaj did not receive the summons and complaint and did not know that the lawsuit existed. He learned of it only in April 2004, when Bonilla served directly on Briggs a motion for a default judgment. Briggs then gave notice to its liability insurer, Insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ance Corporation of Hannover (ICH), of the claim against it. ICH promptly disclaimed coverage, relying among other things on a policy provision saying: \u201cIf a claim is made or \u2018suit\u2019 is brought against any insured, you must . . . [n]otify us as soon as practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Briggs brought a declaratory judgment action in Supreme Court against ICH, asking that the insurer be required to defend the <em>Bonilla </em>case. ICH removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the District Court dismissed Briggs\u2019s complaint, holding that ICH\u2019s disclaimer was valid (2006 WL 1517606, 2006 US Dist LEXIS 34854 [2006]). Briggs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which certified to us the following question: \u201cUpon all the facts of this case, given the terms of the insurance policy and the reason for the insured\u2019s failure to give more prompt notice of the lawsuit to the insurer, should the insurer\u2019s disclaimer of coverage be sustained?\u201d (516 F3d 42, 49-50 [2008].)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Our answer to the question is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The validity of ICH\u2019s disclaimer turns on whether Briggs complied with the condition of the policy requiring it to give notice of a lawsuit to ICH \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d Clearly, it did not. It was unquestionably practicable for Briggs to keep its address current with the Secretary of State, and thus to assure that it would receive, and be able to give, timely notice of the lawsuit. Briggs\u2019s failure to do so was simply an oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Briggs relies on <em>Agoado Realty Corp. v United Intl. Ins. Co. </em>(95 NY2d 141 [2000]), in which we held that there was an issue of fact as to whether notice of a lawsuit was given \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d But <em>Agoado </em>is distinguishable. In that case, the Secretary of State sent documents to the insureds\u2019 lawyer, but the lawyer had died, and the insureds claimed they did not know of his death. Thus, in <em>Agoado </em>it may really have been impracticable for the insureds to find out about the lawsuit and give timely notice to the insurer. In this case, however, it is clear that the insured could have prevented the mishap.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Briggs\u2019s argument is essentially that its mistake was understandable; that it caused no prejudice to the insurer; and that the loss of insurance coverage is a harsh result. All this may be true, but it is irrelevant. We have long held, and recently reaffirmed, that an insurer that does not receive timely notice in accordance with a policy provision may disclaim coverage, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>it is prejudiced by the delay or not <em>(Argo Corp. v Greater N.Y. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>4 NY3d 332, 339 [2005]; <em>Security Mut. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v Acker-Fitzsimons Corp., </em>31 NY2d 436, 440 [1972]). While this rule produces harsh results in some cases, it also, by encouraging prompt notice, enables insurers to investigate claims promptly and thus to deter or detect claims that are ill-founded or fraudulent. The Legislature, weighing the competing interests at stake, has recently enacted legislation that strikes a different balance, more favorable to the insured <em>(see L </em>2008, ch 388, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4 [amending Insurance Law \u00a7 3420, applicable to policies issued on or after January 17, 2009]), but that legislation has not yet become effective. The common-law no-prejudice rule applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Accordingly, the certified question should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of the Rules of Practice of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.27), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
