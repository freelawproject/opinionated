D.G. and defendant occasionally talked with and met each other in the ensuing months. In particular, defendant sought D.G.\u2019s assistance in polishing his resum\u00e9 and making contacts in the Syracuse area, where he planned to relocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">According to D.G., by August 2003 she had decided to sever ties with defendant because he was \u201cappearing just a bit too needy and troublesome ... in his behavior.\u201d She claims that she told defendant not to call her again, but he did, and she would relent and talk to him as \u201ca listening ear.\u201d She also encountered defendant in public more often than the odds of a chance meeting would seem to make plausible; for example, he turned up unexpectedly at a party that D.G. hosted for friends at an out-of-town restaurant near her summer home, and at her daughter\u2019s soccer game at the Carrier Dome. On February 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>2004, defendant called D.G., angrily complaining that she no longer made time for him. She responded that he was \u201cnow not giving [her] any choice\u201d about continuing their friendship; she instructed him not to call her again. Defendant, for his part, denies that D.G. ever asked him to stop calling her.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Defendant acknowledges, however, that on or about February 4, 2004 he put together a \u201cto-do\u201d list memorializing a plan to break into D.G.\u2019s home and to shoot D.G. and her husband in front of their three children. The list consisted of eight individually numbered steps; specifically, (1) \u201cpick up 7:00,\u201d (2) \u201ctravel 7:30,\u201d (3) \u201carrive and park and load,\u201d (4) \u201ccorner of property,\u201d (5) \u201cpower enter (door knob + run + seek),\u201d (6) \u201cID\u201d (written above the crossed-out phrase \u201cseek out\u201d) 1, 2 and 3 (possibly a reference to D.G.\u2019s three children) as well as the words \u201chead, knees, back, hands,\u201d (7) \u201cmake children look\u201d and \u201cliving room,\u201d and (8) \u201cfinal shot!\u201d Below this last item on the list, defendant wrote, among other things, \u201csecurity,\u201d \u201cchest shots,\u201d \u201cchildren,\u201d the names of D.G. and her husband, and various body parts. He linked D.G.\u2019s name to \u201cright foot\u201d and \u201chands\u201d; he linked her husband\u2019s name to \u201cknees\u201d and \u201cback.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">On February 4, 2004, defendant responded to a newspaper advertisement offering a Remington 20-gauge shotgun for sale. After having first asked the seller to deliver the gun to him on February 6th, defendant called him back to move their appointment up one day, to February 5th. Defendant also called a friend to confirm that she would, as previously arranged, be staying overnight at his Syracuse apartment on February 5th and that he could borrow her vehicle that evening, which defendant falsely told her he needed \u201cto run some errands and . . . meet a friend for coffee.\u201d Defendant concedes that he advanced his purchase of the shotgun by one day so as to have it available when he had access to the borrowed vehicle, enabling him to carry out the plan he had \u201cconcocted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The friend arrived at defendant\u2019s apartment around 6:40 p.m. on February 5, 2004; the seller of the shotgun, a little later. Defendant lied to the seller that he was buying the shotgun as a gift for his father for skeet shooting, and that \u201csince his father was an elderly gentleman [he] needed something with less of a kick to it.\u201d Defendant wrote the seller a check in the amount of $575 (which the seller tried unsuccessfully to cash the next day) for the shotgun, 25 sabot slugs and a green safety key to lock the trigger. The seller described the shotgun as having a \u201cfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>rifled barrel that shoots only Sabot<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> slugs,\u201d and as \u201creal accurate . . . zeroed for a hundred yards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Defendant then left his apartment at 7:10 p.m., again telling his friend that he needed to borrow her car to run errands and meet someone for coffee. Five minutes later, he returned to ask his friend about the key to the vehicle, because he had been unable to get the door to open. When she \u201casked him if he would like [her] to come down, maybe the lock had frozen,\u201d he was \u201cadamant about no, no no, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll get it and then he left.\u201d About an hour later, at approximately 8:15 p.m., defendant again returned to his apartment. This time, he lied to his friend \u201cthat he had forgotten a library book that he had to return.\u201d He \u201cwalked past [her] to the bookshelf and grabbed a book,\u201d and she saw what \u201clooked like a blanket or something wadded up under his left arm\u201d as he left. Armed with the shotgun, defendant drove from Syracuse to Geddes, where D.G. and her family lived in a house on Cherry Road, at the junction of Cherry and Salisbury Roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Unsure of the exact location of D.G.\u2019s house, defendant parked on Cherry Road south of her address and loaded the shotgun with four slugs\u2014three in the magazine and one in the chamber. He got out of the vehicle with the shotgun in hand. As he walked north along Cherry Road, he concealed the shotgun inside his coat because \u201ca thought came into [his] mind,\u201d that he did not want to be seen with it. As defendant rounded the corner onto Salisbury Road, he realized that \u201cpower entry\u201d was the next step on his \u201cto-do\u201d list. His idea was to \u201ckick down the door.\u201d According to defendant, he began to wonder if he could do that, but he \u201ccouldn\u2019t go home.\u201d He turned into a driveway on Salisbury Road. Defendant testified that he thought about shooting himself with the shotgun, and \u201cit was the grace of God that [he] didn\u2019t commit suicide or what [he] had planned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Between 9:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., a motorist pulled into the driveway of her 85-year-old mother\u2019s house on Salisbury Road after a day of shopping and visiting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She \u201clooked around the neighborhood and . . . saw a man walking up Salisbury Road and . . . made a mental note of it because two ladies going into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the house in the dark is scary.\u201d As she went around to the back of her car to remove some packages, she saw defendant cross over to the side of Salisbury Road where her mother\u2019s house was located, and walk \u201cdown the driveway of [her] mother\u2019s elderly neighbor.\u201d She noticed him \u201cscurr[ying] down the driveway,\u201d which \u201ccaught [her] attention again for [her] mother\u2019s and [her] safety.\u201d She then saw defendant pull a shotgun from beneath his coat. He leaned the shotgun against the neighbor\u2019s house and stood behind some tall shrubbery, seemingly trying to hide from her. Alarmed, the motorist \u201cclosed the back door of [her] car, got in the front door of [her] car, [and] told her mother [they] weren\u2019t going home right away.\u201d The motorist then drove the six blocks to her own house and immediately called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The first deputy to respond to the motorist\u2019s 911 call testified that he received the dispatch informing him of a \u201c[s]uspicious person with a rifle or a weapon\u201d at 9:30 p.m. He arrived at the scene within minutes, driving his patrol car down Salisbury Road in a westerly direction (towards Cherry Road) with his headlights off. He observed defendant standing on the north shoulder of Salisbury Road, just east of the driveway on D.G.\u2019s property. The area was illuminated by a street light. Defendant approached the patrol car, and the deputy asked him if he was the complainant. Defendant responded, \u201cI\u2019m not the complainant, but I have a complaint to report. I have mental problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The deputy got out of his patrol car and asked defendant if he had any weapons. Defendant pointed towards a shotgun placed next to a snowbank, about 20 feet from D.G.\u2019s house and closer to the driveway where her van and two other cars were parked. The snowbank was on the shoulder of the road, abutting a wooden fence on D.G.\u2019s property. After defendant admitted that the shotgun was loaded, the deputy placed him in handcuffs. A second sheriffs deputy soon arrived, and secured the loaded shotgun. This deputy testified that he received the dispatch at 9:30 or 9:35 p.m. and was at the scene within three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The two deputies were soon joined by two town police officers who assisted with frisking and questioning defendant. When asked what he was doing in the area, defendant responded by saying, \u201c[T]hat bitch ruined my life.\u201d When asked whom he was referring to, defendant named D.G. and provided her address. Meanwhile, one of the deputies retrieved 21 sabot slugs and the green safety key from defendant\u2019s coat pockets. One of the police officers found a folded piece of paper in the pocket of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>defendant\u2019s suit jacket. In response to the officer\u2019s question, defendant identified the paper as a \u201cto-do\u201d list.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">A grand jury indicted defendant for attempted murder in the second degree, attempted burglary in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. Following a hearing at which Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the \u201cto-do\u201d list and certain of his statements to police, the case proceeded to trial. At trial, defendant, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, contended that he was not responsible for his acts by reason of mental disease or defect. He also protested at trial that he \u201c[n]ever wanted to take a life,\u201d while acknowledging that he intended to open fire on D.G. and her husband with a shotgun in the confines of their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The jury convicted defendant of all charges. The trial judge, taking into account defendant\u2019s history of mental illness, sentenced him to concurrent terms aggregating 15 years\u2019 imprisonment plus five years of postrelease supervision. The Appellate Division subsequently affirmed, with one Justice dissenting, who granted defendant leave to appeal (50 AD3d 1489 [2008]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Defendant primarily challenges the legal sufficiency of the proof supporting his attempted burglary and murder convictions, arguing that his intent was equivocal and that his actions prior to the arrival of the first deputy did not come \u201cdangerously near\u201d commission of burglary and murder. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People <em>(see People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">A defendant is guilty of attempt \u201cwhen, with intent to commit a crime, he [or she] engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 110.00). In order to constitute an attempt, the defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct must have passed the stage of mere intent or mere preparation to commit a crime\u201d <em>(People v Mahboubian, </em>74 NY2d 174, 189 [1989]). In other words, the defendant must have \u201cengaged in conduct that came \u2018dangerously near\u2019 commission of the completed crime\u201d <em>(People v Kassebaum, </em>95 NY2d 611, 618 [2001], quoting <em>People v Acosta, </em>80 NY2d 665, 670 [1993]). The \u201cdangerously near\u201d standard does not, however, mandate that the defendant take \u201cthe final step necessary\u201d to complete the offense <em>(Mahboubian, </em>74 NY2d at 190; <em>see People v Bracey, </em>41 NY2d 296, 300 [1977]).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Defendant contends that his intent wavered on the night of his arrest, as evidenced by his thoughts of suicide and his place<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ment of the shotgun on the shoulder of the road next to the snowbank. A rational jury could reasonably infer, however, that defendant intended to commit burglary and murder from his \u201cconduct and the surrounding circumstances\u201d (Bracey, 41 NY2d at 301 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). On the evening of his arrest, in accordance with his \u201cto-do\u201d list, defendant borrowed a vehicle, obtained a shotgun and ammunition and drove several miles to the immediate vicinity of D.G.\u2019s house. There was evidence that, in the few minutes that elapsed between the motorist\u2019s 911 call and the arrival of the first deputy, defendant emerged from the shrubbery beside a house on Salisbury Road and brought his loaded shotgun within 20 feet of D.G.\u2019s house. Although, after the fact, defendant claimed that his plan evolved from murder (or murder-suicide) to suicide only, the jury was entitled to discredit that self-serving testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Defendant also argues that his conduct never came \u201cdangerously near\u201d burglary and murder. He emphasizes that the first deputy on the scene found him \u201cjust standing\u201d in the street and that he had not yet picked up the shotgun, walked onto D.G.\u2019s property or tried to enter her home. But a rational jury could conclude that defendant crossed \u201cthe boundary where preparation ripens into punishable conduct,\u201d a determination that \u201cdepends greatly on the facts of the particular case\u201d <em>(Mahboubian, </em>74 NY2d at 190). Defendant\u2019s actions can be characterized as \u201cpotentially and immediately dangerous\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 191): he filled his pockets with 25 sabot slugs, loaded a shotgun capable of hitting a target accurately at a distance of 100 yards with four of these slugs, including one in the chamber, and stood mere steps away from the property of his intended victims, thereby \u201cplacing it in [his] power to commit the offense unless interrupted\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">As we have \u201cexplicitly recognized\u201d in previous decisions, \u201cthere comes a point where it is \u2018too late in the <em>stage of preparation </em>for the law to conclude that no attempt occurred\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 192, quoting <em>People v Mirenda, </em>23 NY2d 439, 446 [1969]). Although defendant seemed to claim that he put the shotgun aside and \u201cmeander[ed]\u201d in the cold aimlessly for half an hour before the first deputy arrived, this is inconsistent with the motorist\u2019s and the deputies\u2019 testimony. They indicated that much less than half an hour elapsed between the time the motorist first spotted defendant propping the shotgun up against her mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>neighbor\u2019s house and the first deputy\u2019s arrival on the scene. There was evidence that defendant moved the shotgun closer to D.G.\u2019s house\u2014placing it on the shoulder of the road bordering her property\u2014during this interval. In short, the jury might have reasonably concluded that there was no homicide here only because an observant motorist made a 911 call and law enforcement authorities responded promptly, cornering defendant before he could burst into D.G.\u2019s house, armed with a shotgun, the next step on his \u201cto-do\u201d list.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that certain evidence was obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and should have been suppressed. Whether the police have engaged in custodial interrogation is a mixed question of law and fact <em>(see People v Paulman, </em>5 NY3d 122, 129 [2005]). Here, record evidence supports the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that the police engaged in threshold questioning designed to clarify the situation\u2014not interrogation\u2014while frisking defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\">. A sabot is a thrust-transmitting sheathing that positions a slug in the gun\u2019s barrel and prevents the escape of gas ahead of the slug, thereby improving accuracy <em>(see </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1028 [10th ed 1996]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">. In an affidavit executed the night of the incident, the motorist said that she arrived at her mother\u2019s house \u201cat about 9:20 p.m.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b546-7\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANeI\">(dissenting in part). I join the majority insofar as affirming the conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. However, because the conduct of defendant did not, in my view, reach the point at which it would be punishable under the law of attempt, I respectfully dissent. As the majority correctly notes, to be guilty of attempted commission of a crime, a defendant must have (1) the specific intent to commit a crime and (2) conduct which comes \u201cdangerously close\u201d to the accomplishment of the crime\u2014mere preparation is not enough <em>(see People v Bracey, </em>41 NY2d 296, 300 [1977]). These requirements correspond to the mens rea and actus reus elements, both of which need to be established in order for a defendant to be guilty of attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Here, there is no question that defendant\u2019s meticulous planning, post-arrest statements, and \u201cto-do\u201d list showed his intent to commit the crime of murder. However, intent by itself\u2014no matter how loathsome\u2014is not sufficient to establish criminal liability for attempt. As the dissent below aptly noted, \u201c[t]he law does not punish evil thoughts\u201d (50 AD3d 1489, 1492 [2008], quoting <em>People v Bracey, </em>41 NY2d at 300, citing <em>People v Sullivan, </em>173 NY 122, 133 [1903]). Even preliminary steps taken in furtherance of a criminal scheme, coupled with the requisite intent, would not constitute an attempt if those steps did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>come dangerously near completion of the crime <em>(see e.g. People v Rizzo, </em>246 NY 334, 339 [1927]; <em>People v Sullivan, </em>173 NY at 135-136).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As for the necessary actus reus element in this case, defendant merely carried out the initial steps in his \u201cto-do\u201d list and was never \u201cdangerously near\u201d completion of the crime. The evidence showed that at the time defendant approached the police admitting his mental problems and his possession of a shotgun, he was 25 to 30 feet from the border of the victims\u2019 property and his weapon was 5 to 10 feet away from him. Defendant never approached the house\u2014no footprints were found in the snowy lawn\u2014and never saw or came close to his intended victims\u2014in fact, one intended victim was not even in the area at that time <em>(see People v Rizzo, </em>246 NY 334 [1927]). It is also unclear whether defendant identified the correct house; after creeping through the neighborhood unsure of the exact location of the victims\u2019 house, defendant laid his shotgun down on a neighbor\u2019s lawn and paced in front of that neighbor\u2019s house. Under these circumstances, defendant\u2019s conduct did not satisfy the dangerous proximity standard (i.e., his conduct had not gone \u201cto the extent of placing it in [his] power to commit the offense unless interrupted\u201d <em>[People v Mahboubian, </em>74 NY2d 174, 191 (1989)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Moreover, in the minutes that elapsed between the neighbor\u2019s call to the police and the arrival of the sheriffs deputy, defendant had ample time to charge into the residence and execute his plan; but he did not. While defendant\u2019s act need not be \u201cthe final one towards the completion of the offense\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 190), defendant did not \u201cpass[ ] that point where most [people], holding such an intention as defendant. . . , would think better of their conduct and desist\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 191). Indeed, rather than proceeding with his plan, defendant disarmed himself and, upon the arrival of the police, surrendered to them. Although defendant\u2019s intent and plans were malevolent, his conduct was at best equivocal and this is insufficient to support a conviction of attempted murder and attempted burglary under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Graffeo, Smith and Pigott concur with Judge Read; Judge Jones dissents in part in a separate opinion in which Judge Ciparick concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
