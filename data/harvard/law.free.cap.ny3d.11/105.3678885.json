The lower court erred in holding that under the doctrine of res judicata, the New York Attorney General was barred by the <em>Allec v Cross Country Bank </em>settlement from seeking consumer restitution in this matter. <em>(Hansberry v Lee, </em>311 US 32; <em>Richards v Jefferson County, </em>517 US 793; <em>Chase Nat.

II. To apply res judicata to a state in these circumstances would exacerbate the problem of \u201cclass action abuse.\u201d <em>(Amchem Products, Inc. v Windsor, </em>521 US 591; <em>United States v East Baton Rouge Parish School Bd., </em>594 F2d 56.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b187-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b187-5\">Ciparick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">This appeal arises out of a special proceeding initiated by the Attorney General, seeking restitution, civil penalties, and injunctive relief for violations of New York\u2019s Executive Law and Consumer Protection Act (see Executive Law \u00a7 63 [12]; General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349, 350). We are asked to determine whether the federal Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) preempts these claims of a fraudulent and deceptive credit card solicitation scheme. We conclude that it does not. We hold, however, that res judicata effect should be granted to a prior nationwide class action settlement agreement, thereby precluding the Attorney General from recovering certain restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Respondent Cross Country Bank (CCB) is a Delaware bank that, since 1997, has actively solicited consumers in the \u201csubprime\u201d credit market to apply for its credit cards. These consumers \u201cgenerally would not qualify for credit under traditional underwriting guidelines and principles.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Certain of CCB\u2019s marketing materials claim that the company\u2019s \u201cpurpose is to help people establish good credit.\u201d Respondent Applied Card Systems (ACS) provided, as relevant here, debt collection services for CCB\u2019s credit card accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">On March 28, 2003, the Attorney General filed a verified petition asserting that CCB\u2019s credit card solicitations and collections practices violated New York\u2019s Executive Law and Consumer Protection Act <em>(see </em>Executive Law \u00a7 63 [12] [fraud]; General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349 [deceptive business practices], 350 [false advertising]). The gravamen of the petitioner\u2019s complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>was that CCB had misrepresented the credit limits that subprime consumers could obtain and that it failed to disclose the effect that its origination and annual fees would have on the amount of initially available credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">For example, in its mail solicitations CCB told consumers that they were \u201cpre-approved\u201d for a credit limit \u201cup to\u201d $2,500 or $1,000. These communications further clarified that the actually-approved credit limit could be substantially less, perhaps as low as $350.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> CCB\u2019s solicitations also explained that upon approval consumers would incur a $100 \u201cAccount Origination Fee\u201d and a $50 \u201cAnnual Fee.\u201d But CCB\u2019s explanation of the fact that those fees would be treated as charges that could greatly reduce the amount of credit initially available to consumers was oblique.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In some cases, the initial fees depleted consumers\u2019 credit limits by approximately 40% or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As relevant here, the verified petition also contained allegations of fraud and deception pertaining to CCB\u2019s marketing of \u201csecured cards,\u201d the Credit Account Protector (CAP) insurance program, the Applied Advantage (AA) cardholder benefit program, and a debt collection device known as \u201cre-aging.\u201d With respect to secured cards,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> petitioner asserted that CCB\u2019s advertisement was deceptive because its banner touted \u201cno late fees*\u201d and \u201cno collections calls*,\u201d but further clarified that such fees would be imposed and such calls made in certain instances. The marketing of CAP was fraudulent and deceptive, petitioner claimed, because the program was advertised as providing coverage in the event of \u201cdeath, disability, unemployment, or family leave,\u201d but\u2014as CCB clarified in an insert and subsequently-mailed certificate of coverage\u2014only life and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>dismemberment benefits were available to New York consumers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As for <em>AA, </em>petitioner asserted that CCB\u2019s practice of automatically enrolling consumers in the benefit program\u2014at a cost of $34.95 per year\u2014unless they expressly opted out of it was deceptive because the opt-out mechanism was confusing and misleading. Finally, petitioner alleged that ACS marketed re-aging as a means for severely delinquent cardholders to bring their accounts current through a series of payments, while failing to explain that over-the-limit fees would continue to accrue throughout the re-aging process and that both these fees and the previously imposed late fees would be due at the conclusion of the re-aging process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">In addition to the alleged fraudulent and deceptive practices described above, the verified petition also set forth certain facts regarding respondents\u2019 late fees, finance charges, balance calculation method, and the lack of any \u201cgrace period\u201d for consumer payments. Pursuant to TILA, these terms must be disclosed in all credit card solicitations. But petitioner claimed that many consumers were \u201cunaware\u201d of the manner in which charges and penalties based upon the terms were assessed to their accounts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to petitioner, these charges and penalties contributed to \u201ctrapping] . . . unwary consumers\u201d in a \u201cvicious cycle of pyramiding debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">On February 11, 2004, Supreme Court issued a decision and order that, in relevant part, held that petitioner was barred by res judicata from seeking restitution for pre-January 1, 2002 \u201cfront-end claims,\u201d or those concerning illegal conduct \u201cat or near the inception of the cardholder relationship,\u201d on behalf of New York consumers who had opted to accept the benefits of a nationwide class action settlement with CCB.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The California Superior Court approved the settlement and dismissal of the action with prejudice on September 30, 2002 (see <em>Allec v Cross </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>Country Bank, </em>No. 802894, final judgment and order of dismissal with prejudice [Sept. 30, 2002]).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In their motion to reargue the February 11 order, respondents asserted that the credit card application and solicitation disclosure requirements set forth in TILA <em>(see </em>15 USC \u00a7 1632 [c]; \u00a7 1637 [c], [e], [f]) and its accompanying regulation, Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226), preempted petitioner\u2019s claims. Following oral argument, Supreme Court held that the claims were not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">After issuing its preemption decision, the court proceeded to find \u201cas a matter of law and fact\u201d that CCB had \u201crepeatedly and persistently\u201d engaged in fraud, deception and false advertising in connection with its credit card solicitations, and that ACS\u2019s marketing of the re-aging process was similarly illegal. These rulings were based on the court\u2019s review of \u201cvolumes of evidentiary proof,\u201d including more than 100 pages of application and solicitation materials, more than 200 consumer complaints and affidavits, and the affidavits of former ACS collection employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">On June 24, 2004, Supreme Court issued an order that, as relevant here, \u201cpermanently enjoined\u201d respondents from engaging in future fraud, deception, and false advertising with respect to: credit limits, initially available credit, late fees and collection calls concerning secured credit card accounts, benefits available under CAP, and the benefits of account repayment plans, such as re-aging. Supreme Court also prohibited respondents from automatically enrolling consumers in AA without express authorization. The Appellate Division affirmed, rejecting respondents\u2019 preemption argument <em>(see </em>27 AD3d 104, 109 [2005]). On January 27, 2006, Supreme Court entered an order awarding the Attorney General approximately $1.3 million in restitution and damages, $7.9 million in penalties and $2,000 in costs. In part, restitution was based upon costs incurred by virtue of the origination and annual fees as well as certain late and over-the-limit fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The Appellate Division modified. Upholding Supreme Court\u2019s res judicata ruling, the court held that the \u201cpublic interest does not justify giving the New York consumers bound by the <em>Allec </em>settlement two chances to receive make-whole relief\u2019 (41 AD3d 4, 8 [2007] [internal quotation marks and brackets omitted]). As to respondents\u2019 appeal, the court held that Supreme Court\u2019s award of restitution for petitioner\u2019s CAP and re-aging claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>was improper. Finally, the court affirmed each of the penalties assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">This Court granted petitioner and respondents leave to appeal and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Under the US Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause (US Const, art VI, cl 2), the purpose of our preemption analysis is singular and straightforward. \u201c[0]ur sole task is to ascertain the intent of Congress\u201d <em>(California Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v Guerra, </em>479 US 272, 280 [1987]; <em>Rosario v Diagonal Realty, LLC, </em>8 NY3d 755, 763 [2007]; <em>see also Medtronic, Inc. v Lohr, </em>518 US 470, 485 [1996] [\u201c(T)he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)]). Preemption can arise by: (i) express statutory provision, (ii) implication, or (iii) an irreconcilable conflict between federal and state law (see <em>Balbuena v IDR Realty LLC, </em>6 NY3d 338, 356 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">When dealing with an express preemption provision, as we do here, it is unnecessary to consider the applicability of the doctrines of implied or conflict preemption (see <em>Cipollone v Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 US 504, 517 [1992, plurality op] [statute\u2019s preemptive scope is \u201cgoverned entirely\u201d by its \u201cexpress language\u201d]). Instead, the resolution in this case turns solely upon proper statutory construction of TILA\u2019s credit card application and solicitation preemption provision (see <em>Matter of Frew Run Gravel Prods. v Town of Carroll, </em>71 NY2d 126, 131 [1987]). In undertaking that task, we are guided by the \u201cstarting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law\u201d unless its intent to do so is \u201cclear and manifest\u201d <em>(New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v Travelers Ins. Co., </em>514 US 645, 654, 655 [1995]; <em>Lohr, </em>518 US at 485; <em>accord Balbuena, </em>6 NY3d at 356).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The preemption provision at issue here was enacted as part of the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988 (FCCCDA), which amended TILA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201c(e) Certain credit and charge card application and solicitation disclosure provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201cThe provisions of subsection (c) of section 1632 of this title and subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of section 1637 of this title shall supersede any provision of the law of any State relating to the disclosure of information in any credit or charge card application or solicitation which is subject to the requirements of section 1637 (c) of this title or any renewal notice which is subject to the requirements of section 1637 (d) of this title, except that any State may employ or establish State laws for the purpose of enforcing the requirements of such sections\u201d (15 USC \u00a7 1610 [e]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Respondents repeatedly assert that section 1610 (e) expressly preempts \u201cany and every state law \u2018relating to the disclosure of information in any credit or charge card application or solicitation.\u2019 \u201d Petitioner counters that its claims are not preempted because they do not relate to the disclosure of credit information, but rather to affirmative deception. Based upon the statutory text, legislative history, and administrative interpretation of section 1610 (e), we agree with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Section 1610 (e) does not preempt every state law that could potentially touch upon any credit information that respondents might choose to include in their credit card applications and solicitations. Instead it preempts those state laws that relate to \u201cdisclosure of information\u201d in credit card applications and solicitations \u201csubject to the requirements of section 1637 (c),\u201d not those that prevent fraud, deception and false advertising. Preemption is limited, then, to laws that purport to alter the format, content, and manner of the TILA-required disclosures and those that require credit issuers to affirmatively disclose specific credit term information not embraced by TILA or Regulation Z <em>(see </em>15 USC \u00a7 1610 [e]; \u00a7 1637 [c] [5]; <em>see also </em>54 Fed Reg 13855, 13863 [\u201cState laws relating to the terms of credit required to be disclosed or the manner in which such terms must be disclosed are preempted\u201d]; Official Staff Interpretations of Federal Reserve System Board of Governors, 12 CFR part 226, Supp I, \u00b6 28 [d] [1] [eff Jan. 14, 2008] [explaining that state laws are preempted when they require the disclosure of credit terms]).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Neither aspect of such preemption is present in this case. This is because New York\u2019s Executive Law and Consumer Protection Act, collectively, do not require respondents to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>close anything. These statutes simply require that they refrain from fraud, deception, and false advertising when communicating with New York consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The misleading statements in respondents\u2019 applications and solicitations regarding potential credit limits, initially available credit, secured card benefits, credit insurance coverage and re-aging benefits, and their deceptive automatic enrollment of consumers in the AA program do not constitute the disclosure of any information \u201cwhich is subject to the requirements of 1637 (c)\u201d <em>(see </em>15 USC \u00a7 1610 [e]).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The only information in a credit card application or solicitation that must be disclosed pursuant to section 1637 (c) is that describing: (i) annual percentage rate, including whether such rate is variable, (ii) annual and other periodic fees, including, \u201cmembership fee[s] imposed for the issuance or availability of a credit card,\u201d (iii) minimum finance and transaction charges, (iv) grace period, (v) balance calculation method, (vi) cash advance fee, (vii) late fee, (viii) over-the-limit fee, and (ix) a statement that charges incurred are due when a periodic statement is received <em>(see </em>15 USC \u00a7 1637 [c] [1] [A] [i] [I], [II]; [ii] [IJ-[III]; [iii], [iv]; [B] [i]-[iii]; [4] [A] [iii]; 15 USC \u00a7 1637 [c] [2] [mandating, with certain exceptions, disclosure of information described in section 1637 (c) (1) (A) in telephone solicitations]; 12 CFR 226.5a [b]). Pursuant to 15 USC \u00a7 1637 (c) (5), however, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the Board) has authority to enact regulations requiring \u201cthe disclosure of information in addition to\u201d that described in section 1637 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The verified petition does make reference to the fact that many consumers were \u201cunaware\u201d of the manner in which certain credit terms, including late and over-the-limit fees, bai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>anee calculation method, and the lack of any grace period, were applied against their accounts. But petitioner \u201ctake[s] no issue\u201d with the substance or sufficiency of respondents\u2019 TILA disclosures and he has obtained no relief based upon consumers\u2019 purported lack of awareness. As we previously have held, the mere fact that a complaint makes reference to certain matters that are preempted by a federal statute does not \u201ctransform\u201d a state law action into one that is preempted under federal law <em>(see Nealy v US Healthcare HMO, </em>93 NY2d 209, 220 [1999]).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Respondents argue, however, that the statutory text compels us to conclude that section 1610 (e) bars the Attorney General\u2019s claims. Their textual argument is based primarily upon the purportedly settled construction of the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d in U.S. Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d does not help respondents. When construing other statutes, the Court has concluded that the phrase has a meaning that \u201c express [es] a broad pre-emptive purpose\u201d <em>(see Morales v Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 US 374, 383 [1992]; <em>accord Rowe v New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., </em>552 US \u2014, \u2014, 128 S Ct 989, 994 [2008]). It has been defined as \u201chaving a connection with, or reference to\u201d the subject matter set forth in a particular preemption clause <em>(see Morales, </em>504 US at 384). But the Court has made clear that the scope of its interpretation of \u201crelating to\u201d is subject to some limitation. This is because \u201c[i]f \u2018relate to\u2019 were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of indeterminancy, then for all practical purposes pre-emption would never run its course\u201d <em>(Travelers, </em>514 US at 655). Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court has \u201ccautioned against an \u2018uncritical literalism\u2019 that would make pre-emption turn on \u2018infinite connections\u2019 \u201d <em>(Egelhoff v Egelhoff, </em>532 US 141, 147 [2001], quoting <em>Travelers, </em>514 US at 656).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">We applied these principles in <em>Nealy </em>to conclude that even when a complaint refers to matters preempted under federal law, no preemption occurs if the effect of the relief sought upon the federal scheme is \u201c \u2018too tenuous, remote, or peripheral\u2019 \u201d <em>(Nealy, </em>93 NY2d at 220, quoting <em>Shaw v Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 US 85, 100 n 21 [1983]). We hold this rule of limitation to be applicable here. Quite simply, petitioner\u2019s claims do not relate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>to the disclosure of federally-mandated information in credit card applications or solicitations. Instead, they relate to the inclusion in those materials of certain fraudulent and deceptive misinformation\u2014none of which is even addressed by the federal disclosure scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The preemption clause at issue here is very different from that in <em>Morales, </em>a case that respondents\u2019 textual argument hinges upon. There, the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA) preempted \u201cany law \u2018relating to rates, routes, or services\u2019 of any air carrier\u201d <em>(Morales, </em>504 US at 378-379, quoting 49 USC Appendix \u00a7 1305 [a] [1] [now codified at 49 USC \u00a7 41713]). Based on the comprehensive preemptive intent evidenced in this provision, the Court had little trouble concluding that a set of purportedly enforceable guidelines adopted by the National Association of Attorneys General, which described in excruciating detail the \u201ccontent and format\u201d of airline advertising, frequent flyer programs, and passenger compensation policies, was preempted <em>(see Morales, </em>504 US at 379, 388, 390-414; <em>see also American Airlines, Inc. v Wolens, </em>513 US 219, 227-228 [1995] [preemptive provision in ADA bars claims under Illinois\u2019s Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act]; <em>Air Transp. Assn. of Am., Inc. v Cuomo, </em>520 F3d 218, 223 [2d Cir 2008] [ADA preempts New York\u2019s Passenger Bill of Rights because that statute requires airlines to provide certain amenities to travelers and therefore relates to \u201cthe service of an air carrier\u201d]). But the reach of section 1610 (e) is not as expansive as that of the ADA preemption provision at issue in <em>Morales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Section 1610 (e) preempts only those state laws that relate to the format, content, manner, or substance of the TILA-required disclosures. Thus, there is no preemption here because neither petitioner\u2019s claims nor the relief he was granted below have any effect upon those disclosures <em>(see Nealy, </em>93 NY2d at 220 [no preemption where \u201c(p)laintiff s claims do not bind an employee plan to any particular choice of benefits, do not dictate the administration of such a plan and do not interfere with a uniform administrative scheme\u201d]; <em>see also Harvey v Members Empls. Trust for Retail Outlets, </em>96 NY2d 99, 106 [2001] [state insurance law and regulation relate to an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) plan because they \u201cimpose a basic benefit structure\u201d]). To the contrary, Supreme Court\u2019s affirmed orders did not mandate any alteration of or addition to the required section 1637 (c) disclosures. Rather, its injunction simply prevents respondents from affirmatively misrepresent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ing the nature of credit terms that, at present, are not even subject to regulation under TILA or Regulation Z. Indeed, petitioner\u2019s entitlement to the relief granted below exists wholly apart from respondents\u2019 section 1637 (c) disclosure obligations; it is based upon <em>\u201ca </em>more general obligation\u2014the duty not to deceive\u201d <em>(see Cipollone, </em>505 US at 528-529 [plurality op]).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">But respondents maintain that Congress\u2019s intent to create a uniform system of disclosure in credit card applications and solicitations militates in favor of preemption. We again emphasize, however, that petitioner\u2019s success in this case does not force respondents to make any alterations to their section 1637 (c) disclosures or to affirmatively disclose any additional credit terms. This is dispositive. In any event, the sort of \u201cindirect economic influence\u201d upon respondents\u2019 solicitations practices resulting from the relief accorded below is not sufficient to overcome the presumption against preemption of state law <em>(see Travelers, </em>514 US at 664 [although ERISA contains a broad, \u201crelating to,\u201d preemption clause New York law imposing surcharges on all insurers was not preempted because the law \u201cd(id) not impose (a) . . . substantive coverage requirement\u201d]; <em>accord Nealy, </em>93 NY2d at 220).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We acknowledge that the U.S. Supreme Court recently reiterated that state tort judgments impose substantive requirements that \u201ccan be ... a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy\u201d <em>(see Riegel v Medtronic, Inc., </em>552 US \u2014, \u2014, 128 S Ct 999, 1008 [2008] [internal quotation marks omitted]). But <em>Riegel </em>is not controlling here for two reasons. First, the Medical Device Amendments preemption provision at issue there is substantively different from 15 USC \u00a7 1610 (e). It preempted \u201cstate requirements \u2018different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable ... to [a medical] device\u2019 under federal law\u201d <em>(see </em>552 US at \u2014, 128 S Ct at 1006, quoting 21 USC \u00a7 360k [a] [1]). The scope of section 1610 (e) preemption is, however, expressly limited to state laws relating to the disclosures specifically required under section 1637 (c), it does not extend to the additional state requirement that respondent must refrain from fraud and deception when making statements about credit terms that are not even within the scope of TILA or Regulation Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Second, unlike the tort law claims in <em>Riegel, </em>the Attorney General\u2019s success in this action will not \u201cdisrupt[ ] the federal scheme\u201d of disclosure mandated under TILA <em>(see </em>552 US at \u2014, 128 S Ct at 1008). Petitioner has not sought relief based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the TILA-required disclosures. Nor has he sought to alter the format, content, or manner of those disclosures. The relief granted below does not impose any additional disclosure requirements upon respondents, it merely precludes them from making fraudulent and deceptive statements regarding certain credit terms <em>(compare Riegel, </em>552 US at \u2014, 128 S Ct at 1008 [state tort law claim preempted because Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) exacting standards for premarket approval of medical devices would be disrupted by judgment \u201cthat requires a manufacturer\u2019s catheters to be safer, but hence less effective, than the model the FDA has approved\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Respondents\u2019 disruption argument assumes that Congress intended the TILA disclosures to provide consumers\u2019 sole protection against credit card companies\u2019 fraudulent and deceptive marketing practices. But the qualified nature of the preemption provision\u2019s text belies that sweeping assertion, as does the statute\u2019s legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The FCCCDA\u2019s House Conference Report states that section 1610 (e) preempts \u201cState credit and charge card disclosure laws\u201d <em>(see </em>HR Conf Rep 100-1069, 100th Cong, 2d Sess, at 22, reprinted in 1988 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, at 3951, 3960). An example of such a law is California\u2019s Areias Credit Card Full Disclosure Act of 1986, which contains application and solicitation disclosure requirements very similar to TILA\u2019s <em>(see </em>Cal Civ Code \u00a7\u00a7 1748.10-1748.12; Furletti, Comment, <em>The Debate Over the National Bank Act and the Preemption of State Efforts to Regulate Credit Cards, </em>77 Temp L Rev 425, 451, 451 n 233 [2004]; <em>see also </em>Wis Stat Ann \u00a7 422.308 [1] [a] [requiring that \u201cevery application for (an) open-end credit plan\u201d shall set forth certain specific information, including \u201c(t)he annual percentage rate\u201d]).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the Senate\u2019s version of FCCCDA would have saved provisions of such state laws that required disclosure of information in addition to that set forth in section 1637 (c) from preemption if they were reenacted within two years of the Act\u2019s passage <em>(see </em>S Rep 100-259, 100th Cong, 1st Sess, at 9-10, reprinted in 1988 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, at 3936, 3945-3946), the Senate compromised and \u201crecede[d]\u201d to the House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>version, which \u201cpreempted the provisions of all state laws <em>with respect to the disclosures mandated under its bill\u201d (see </em>HR Conf Rep No. 100-1069, 100th Cong, 2d Sess, at 21, reprinted in 1988 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, at 3960 [emphasis added]; <em>see also </em>Gelb and Cubita, <em>Credit Card Application and Solicitation Disclosure Legislation: An Alternative to the Rate Ceiling Approach, </em>43 Bus Law 1557, 1564 [1988]). The Attorney General\u2019s claims in this case do not affect any of the mandated disclosures ultimately codified by the FCCCDA nor do they require respondents to make any additional affirmative disclosures regarding their credit products. Thus, this case does not concern the sort of credit card disclosure laws preempted under TILA.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Congress also made clear that, even when enforcing the TILA disclosure requirements, states could use their unfair and deceptive trade practices acts to \u201crequir[e] or obtain[ ] the requirements of a specific disclosure beyond those specified in Section [1637] (c) in the settlement or adjudication of a specific case or cases\u201d <em>(see </em>HR Conf Rep 100-1069, 100th Cong, 2d Sess, at 22, reprinted in 1988 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, at 3960).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In sum, the legislative record shows that Congress only intended FCCCDA to preempt a specific set of state credit card disclosure laws, not states\u2019 general unfair trade practices acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Even more significantly, the Senate Banking Committee Report states that TILA does not preempt \u201cthe use of State mini-Federal Trade Commission [FTC] statutes to address unfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d <em>(see </em>S Rep 100-259, 100th Cong, 1st Sess, at 9, reprinted in 1988 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, at 3945). General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 350 comprise, of course, just such a \u201cmini-FTC\u201d act <em>(see Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20, 26 [1995]; <em>Goshen v Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>98 NY2d 314, 323-324 [2002]). The Senate Report\u2019s understanding of TILA\u2019s disclosure requirements is reflected in the Official Staff Interpretations of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the agency charged by statute with administering TILA <em>(see </em>12 CFR part 226, Supp I, \u00b6 28 [d] [3] [eff Jan. 14, 2008] [\u201c(S)tate laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>credit and charge card applications, solicitations and renewals are not preempted\u201d]; 54 Fed Reg 13855, 13864 [1989] [\u201c(A)ny prohibitions against unfair and deceptive acts or practices (such as state \u2018mini-FTC acts\u2019) . . . are not preempted\u201d]). That interpretation is entitled to great deference <em>(see Ford Motor Credit Co. v Milhollin, </em>444 US 555, 565 [1980] [\u201c(D)eference is especially appropriate in the process of interpreting the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. Unless demonstrably irrational, Federal Reserve Board staff opinions construing the Act or Regulation should be dispositive\u201d]).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Therefore, we hold that petitioner\u2019s Executive Law and Consumer Protection Act claims are not preempted by TILA or Regulation Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">We turn next to the res judicata effect of the <em>Allec </em>settlement upon a portion of the Attorney General\u2019s claims for restitution. Pursuant to California\u2019s procedural rules (Cal Rules Ct rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>3.769 [f]), New York consumers were provided with notice of the settlement and the opportunity to \u201copt-in\u201d to a nationwide settlement class. In exchange for certain payments or account credits, consumers who opted-in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cforever released and discharged [respondents] from any claims ... of any nature . . . that [they] have had in the past, or now have against [respondents], which relate to the solicitation or origination of the cardholder relationship, the \u2018pre-approval\u2019 of persons being solicited for CCB credit cards, the Initial Credit Card Fees, the assignment of credit limits and/or the Disclosure Claims; and all claims set forth in the <em>[Allec] </em>Action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The California court approved the settlement. And the parties do not dispute that the <em>Allec </em>action was dismissed with prejudice, thereby \u201cforever barr[ing]\u201d all settlement class members from prosecuting the released claims against respondents. Under California law, such a finally-approved settlement is entitled to res judicata effect <em>(see e.g. Johnson v American Airlines, Inc., </em>157 Cal App 3d 427, 431, 203 Cal Rptr 638, 640 [1984]; <em>see also </em>Moore and Thomas, Cal Civ Prac Procedure \u00a7 32:17 [2008 ed] [\u201cA judgment rendered in a proper class action is res judicata as to the claims of every member of the class although they are not formal parties to the suit\u201d]).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In New York, res judicata, or claim preclusion, bars successive litigation based upon the \u201csame transaction or series of connected transactions\u201d <em>(see </em>Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 447 [4th ed]) if: (i) there is a judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, and (ii) the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was a party to the previous action, or in privity with a party who was <em>(see Gramatan Home Invs. Corp. v Lopez, </em>46 NY2d 481, 485 [1979]; Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6 5011.08 [2d ed]). Here, the parties\u2019 dispute focuses solely upon the second prong of the res judicata test, privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The Attorney General argues that he is not in privity with members of the <em>Allec </em>settlement class because his interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>seeking restitution on those consumers\u2019 behalf is far broader than their individual pecuniary concerns. Rather, he seeks restitution as a means of deterring future fraud, deception, and false advertising and restoring the public\u2019s trust in the consumer credit marketplace. Amici, the Attorneys General of 30 states, agree with that view and urge us to consider the problem of \u201cclass action abuse,\u201d which, they say, has led to collusive and undervalued settlements such as that entered in <em>Allec. </em>Respondents counter by invoking our traditional solicitude towards settlement agreements, urging us to permit the <em>Allec </em>settlement class members only one opportunity to obtain make-whole relief. We agree with respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Our precedents have repeatedly explained that privity is not susceptible to a hard-and-fast definition <em>(see Watts v Swiss Bank Corp., </em>27 NY2d 270, 277 [1970] [\u201c(T)he term privity does not have a technical and well-defined meaning\u201d]; <em>Gramatan, </em>46 NY2d at 486 [\u201c(P)rivity is an amorphous term not susceptible to ease of application\u201d]; <em>Buechel v Bain, </em>97 NY2d 295, 304 [2001] [\u201c(P)rivity is \u2018 \u201can amorphous concept\u201d \u2019 \u201d]). Although we have provided examples of cases in which privity is present <em>(see Green v Santa Fe Indus., </em>70 NY2d 244, 253 [1987]; <em>see also Buechel, </em>97 NY2d at 305), none of those are applicable here. Ultimately, we must determine whether the severe consequences of preclusion flowing from a finding of privity strike a fair result under the circumstances <em>(see Buechel, </em>97 NY2d at 304-305). This inquiry is, of course, informed by reference to the policies that res judicata is designed to protect <em>(see Matter of Reilly v Reid, </em>45 NY2d 24, 28 [1978]).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">It is a \u201c \u2018familiar doctrine\u2019 \u201d that a class action judgment is binding upon class members who were adequately represented in the action <em>(see Richards v Jefferson County, </em>517 US 793, 800 [1996], quoting <em>Hansberry v Lee, </em>311 US 32, 42 [1940]; <em>see also Taylor v Sturgell, </em>552 US \u2014, \u2014, 128 S Ct 2161, 2172 [2008] [\u201cRepresentative suits with preclusive effect on nonparties include properly conducted class actions\u201d]; Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 41 [1] [e] and Comment <em>e </em>[in properly authorized class actions \u201cpersons within the class are bound by a judgment for or against the representative\u201d]; 18-131 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice\u2014Civil \u00a7 131.40 [3] [e] [iii] [\u201cAll class members will be bound, under (res judicata), by a final judgment in a class action, including a judgment following settlement, assuming the action met the necessary procedural due process prerequisites\u201d]). The adequacy of representation in the <em>Allec </em>ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tion is not at issue here <em>(see </em>Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 42 [1] [d]-[e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Attorney General argues, however, that his interest in protecting the public was not represented at all in the <em>Allec </em>case. Indeed, he points out that he was not provided with notice of the settlement or an opportunity to object to it. Nevertheless, one specific portion of the relief petitioner seeks here\u2014restitution for pre-January 1, 2002 claims\u2014is identical to that which the New York members of the <em>Allec </em>settlement class have already pursued to a final and binding judgment. As to that measure of relief alone, we hold that there is privity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Our conclusion is supported by a core principle of res judicata, a party\u2019s right to rely upon the finality of the results of previous litigation <em>(see Matter of New York State Labor Relations Bd. v Holland Laundry, Inc., </em>294 NY 480, 493 [1945] [\u201c(T)he public tranquillity demands that, having been once . . . tried, all litigation of (a) question, and between (the) parties, should be closed forever\u201d]; <em>Reilly, </em>45 NY2d at 28 <em>[\u201cRes judicata </em>is designed to provide finality in the resolution of disputes\u201d]; <em>cf. Matter of Olympic Tower Assoc. v City of New York, </em>81 NY2d 961, 962-963 [1993] [settlement agreements entitled to res judicata effect]; Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 444 [4th ed] [judgments entered pursuant to settlement are entitled to res judicata effect]). A similar respect for finality has informed our longstanding rule that\u2014absent exceptional circumstances such as duress, illegality, fraud, or mutual mistake <em>(see Mangini v McClurg, </em>24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>NY2d 556, 563 [1969])\u2014a settlement must be enforced according to its terms (see <em>Denburg v Parker Chapin Flattau &amp; Klimpl, </em>82 NY2d 375, 383 [1993]).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Permitting the Attorney General to seek additional restitution on behalf of the <em>Allec </em>settlement class members would undoubtedly \u201cdestroy or impair rights\u201d conclusively established in the <em>Allec </em>case (see <em>Schuylkill Fuel Corp. v Nieberg Realty Corp., </em>250 NY 304, 307 [1929, Cardozo, Ch. J.]). Indeed, the Attorney General has asserted that restitution is about making consumers whole. The problem here is that the <em>Allec </em>settlement class members have already compromised their entitlement to a full measure of make-whole relief in a proper judicial forum <em>(cf. EEOC v Waffle House, Inc., </em>534 US 279, 297 [2002] [\u201c(I)t \u2018goes without saying that the courts can and should preclude double recovery by an individual\u2019 \u201d]). Although we recognize the importance of permitting petitioner to seek restitution to deter Executive Law and Consumer Protection Act violations, we cannot allow him to do so at the expense of undermining a validly-entered judgment of a sister state, which it is our constitutional duty to protect (US Const, art IV, \u00a7 1; 28 USC \u00a7 1738; <em>O\u2019Connell v Corcoran, </em>1 NY3d 179, 184 [2003]; <em>cf. Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v Epstein, </em>516 US 367, 374 [1996] [\u201c(A) judgment entered in a class action, like any other judgment entered in a state judicial proceeding, is presumptively entitled to full faith and credit\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Our holding does not, however, substantially prejudice the public interest served by the Attorney General in pursuing this action. Indeed, respect for the finality of the <em>Allec </em>settlement still permits the Attorney General to seek restitution on behalf of those not bound by the settlement and for the time periods not embraced therein. In addition, the claims for injunctive relief, civil penalties, and costs remain undisturbed. And, as Supreme Court noted, the Attorney General might be able to obtain disgorgement\u2014an equitable remedy distinct from restitution\u2014of profits that respondents derived from all New York consumers, whether within the <em>Allec </em>settlement class or not <em>(see </em>41 AD3d at 8 n 2; <em>cf. Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. v Fischbach Corp., </em>133 F3d 170, 175 [2d Cir 1997] [\u201cAs an exercise of its equity powers, the court may order wrongdoers to disgorge their fraudulently obtained profits\u201d]; <em>accord Official Comm, of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Unsecured Creditors of WorldCom, Inc. v Securities &amp; Exch.

In addition, respondents\u2019 argument that extrinsic evidence of consumer deception is required to establish petitioner\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claims is unpreserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\">.

For example, in one of its mail solicitations, CCB described the origination fee as a \u201cone-time\u201d charge.

After all, \u201c[t]he proposal of regulations is not synonymous with [their] adoption\u201d <em>(see State by Malone v Burlington N., Inc., </em>311 Minn 89, 92, 247 NW2d 54, 55 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Moreover, the Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administration, pursuant to their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, have also recently proposed Regulation AA, a provision of which would prohibit charging fees and security deposits that constitute a majority of a consumer\u2019s credit limit during the first 12 months of the account and would also require credit issuers to spread the cost of fees totaling more than 25% of a consumer\u2019s credit limit equally over the course of the year <em>(see </em>73 Fed Reg 28904, 28923-28925 [May 19, 2008]). The agencies\u2019 rationale for adopting proposed Regulation AA is that the practice of charging fees that quickly deplete a new customer\u2019s credit limit \u201cappears to be an unfair act or practice\u201d under the Federal Trade Commission Act, the very statute General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 350 were modeled upon <em>(id. </em>at 28924). And to support their conclusion that consumers \u201cmay lack the information necessary to avoid harm\u201d from this practice, the agencies cite to the Appellate Division\u2019s initial decision in the instant case <em>(see id. </em>at 28924 [quoting Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion <em>(see </em>27 AD3d at 108) that CCB\u2019s post-2001 solicitations \u201c \u2018did not represent an accurate estimation of a consumer\u2019s credit limit\u2019 \u201d]).

The federal Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) preempts the Attorney General\u2019s bid to impose disclosure requirements on Cross Country Bank\u2019s (CCB) credit card solicitations in the guise of this proceeding seeking injunctive relief, restitution and penalties pursuant to Executive Law \u00a7 63 (12) (fraud) and General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349 (deceptive business practices) and 350 (false advertising). The majority reaches the opposite conclusion by dint of misreading TILA\u2019s special preemption rule for credit or charge card applications or solicitations. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Section 1610 (e) of TILA (15 USC) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">\u201cCertain credit and charge card application and solicitation disclosure provisions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-11\">\u201cThe provisions of subsection (c) of section 1632 of this title [governing the form or manner of disclosure] and subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) of section 1637 of this title [governing the content or substance of disclosure] shall supersede any provision of the law of any State relating to the disclosure of information in any credit or charge card application or solicitation which is subject to the requirements of section 1637 (c) of this title or any renewal notice which is subject to the requirements of section 1637 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(d) of this title, except that any State may employ or establish State laws for the purpose of enforcing the requirements of such sections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The majority reads the clause \u201cwhich is subject to the requirements of section 1637 (c)\u201d to modify \u201cinformation.\u201d Accordingly, the majority reasons, \u201c[t]he scope of section 1610 (e) preemption is . . . <em>expressly limited </em>to state laws relating to the disclosures <em>specifically required </em>under section 1637 (c)\u201d (majority op at 118 [emphases added]). The majority therefore concludes that \u201cthere is no preemption here because neither petitioner\u2019s claims nor the relief he was granted below have any effect upon those disclosures\u201d (majority op at 117). That is, because there is no conflict between TILA\u2019s disclosure requirements and New York\u2019s consumer protection laws, CCB may (and indeed must) devise a solicitation complying with both federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">But the majority\u2019s reading of the statutory text is not correct. It completely</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cdisregards\u2014indeed, is precisely contrary to\u2014the grammatical \u2018rule of the last antecedent,\u2019 according to which a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows . . . While this rule is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning, . . . construing a statute in accord with the mle is quite sensible as a matter of grammar\u201d <em>(Barnhart v Thomas, </em>540 US 20, 26 [2003] [some internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see also </em>2A Singer and Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:33, at 487 [7th ed 2007] [\u201cReferential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent\u201d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Here, the limiting clause \u201cwhich is subject to the requirements of section 1637 (c)\u201d immediately follows and therefore modifies \u201cany credit or charge card application or solicitation,\u201d <em>not </em>\u201cinformation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The Federal Reserve System Board of Governors, which implements section 1610 (e) through its Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226), disagrees with the majority\u2019s textual analysis: the Board\u2019s expression of TILA\u2019s special preemption rule is completely at odds with the majority\u2019s apparent view that the clause \u201cwhich is subject to the requirements of section 1637 (c)\u201d modifies \u201cinformation\u201d rather than \u201capplication or solicitation.\u201d In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>discussion of section 1610 (e), the Board took the position that \u201c[s]tate laws relating to the disclosure of credit information in credit or charge card applications and solicitations subject to the requirements of [15 USC \u00a7 1637 (c)] . . . are preempted\u201d (54 Fed Reg 13855, 13855-13856 [Apr. 6, 1989]). Accordingly, 12 CFR 226.28 (d) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201c(d) Special rule for credit and charge cards. State law requirements relating to the disclosure of credit information in <em>any credit or charge card application or solicitation that is subject to the requirements of [15 USC \u00a7 1637 (c)] </em>(\u00a7 226.5a of the regulation) . . . are preempted. State laws relating to the enforcement of [15 USC \u00a7 1637 (c)] . . . are not preempted\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Concomitantly, the Board has defined those credit or charge card applications or solicitations that <em>are </em>subject to the requirements of section 1637 (c) (credit or charge accounts used primarily by consumers to purchase goods and services), and those that <em>are not </em>(applications or solicitations to open overdraft lines of credit tied to asset accounts accessible by use of a debit card; open-end lines of credit accessed solely by account numbers; home equity lines of credit that may be accessed by the use of a credit or charge card and are subject to the Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act of 1988 amendments to TILA; applications and solicitations to add a credit or charge card to an existing open-end plan) (54 Fed Reg at 13856).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">According to the Board, then, TILA supplants state law \u201crequirements\u201d that \u201crelat[e] to the disclosure of credit information\u201d in certain credit or charge card applications or solicitations (i.e., those that the Board has determined to be subject to the requirements of 15 USC \u00a7 1637 [c]) <em>(id. </em>at 13855); thus, preemption is not limited to \u201cstate laws relating to the disclosures specifically required under section 1637 (c)\u201d (majority op at 118). The Board\u2019s view in this regard is entirely consonant with the statute\u2019s text, and with Congress\u2019 purpose in adopting a special preemption rule in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">At the time TILA was enacted in 1968, \u201cconsumer credit [was] preponderantly small and local in both its nature and operation . . . [T]here [was] no national market for consumer credit. . . outside [a consumer\u2019s] town or city, although there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>[was] some mail order business . . . But generally, the market for consumer credit [was] fairly restricted\u201d (Miller and Rohner, <em>In Search of a Uniform Policy\u2014State and Federal Sources of Consumer Financial Services Law, </em>37 Bus Law 1415, 1415-1416 [1982] [footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted]). In deference to these state interests, TILA preserved state jurisdiction to regulate disclosures in consumer credit transactions, including so-called \u201ctraditional\u201d credit or charge card accounts used primarily by consumers to purchase goods and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Specifically, section 1610 (a) (1) of TILA stated that its provisions did not \u201cannul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d \u201cSince the statute and the legislative history provided the [Board] with little guidance on how to implement the preemption scheme, the [Board] had substantial leeway in deciding how and when state laws would be preempted\u201d (Tidwell, <em>Preemption of State Disclosures by the Truth in Lending Act: The Continuing Quest for a Workable Formula, </em>40 Bus Law 933, 935-936 [1984-1985] [discussing in detail the Board\u2019s interpretation and implementation of TILA preemption from 1969 until the mid-1980s]).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In section 226.6 (b) of the original Regulation Z, the Board counseled that a state law was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with TILA or Regulation Z</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">\u201cto the extent that it required disclosures or actions \u2018different\u2019 from the requirements of the regulation with respect to form, content, terminology, or time of delivery; disclosure of the amount of the finance charge determined in any manner other than that prescribed by the regulation; and disclosure of the APR determined in any manner other than that prescribed by the regulation\u201d (Tidwell at 936).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In addition, section 226.6 (a) of the original Regulation Z \u201cprovided that no other information could be placed with the federal disclosures if it would tend to detract from [them] or mislead or confuse the consumer\u201d (Tidwell at 936).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">It was generally left up to creditors to decide whether a state law was inconsistent, although the Board issued a number of interpretive letters. A creditor was, in fact, permitted to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>an inconsistent state law disclosure so long as it was placed on a separate piece of paper from the TILA disclosures, or below a clearly marked line on the same statement containing the TILA disclosures (12 CFR former 226.6 [c]; Tidwell at 936-937). The Board cautioned creditors \u201cthat when making a determination of what information would not mislead, confuse, or detract from required disclosures, they should be ready to justify their determinations before their enforcement agency and the courts\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 938).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u201cThe gist of the policy toward preemption of state laws during the 1970s\u201d has been summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cState-required disclosures were rarely, if ever, fully preempted in the sense that the creditor was forbidden to use them in contract documents. Instead, <em>creditors remained subject to any state disclosure law that called for more detailed or different information, </em>and creditors were always free to make state-required disclosures, either below a demarcation line or as permissible \u2018additional information\u2019 interspersed among the TIL disclosures ... If a creditor decided to make his own preemption determinations, he ran the risk that a state court might deem the disclosure necessary for contract validity. Therefore, not assuming the risk was considered prudent\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 941 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Not surprisingly, lengthy, complex and confusing credit forms proliferated.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Nonetheless, when Congress passed the Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act (Pub L 96-221 tit VI) in 1980, it only tweaked TILA\u2019s preemption provision: the inconsistency standard remained in section 1610 (a) (1), although the Board was now mandated to determine if a state law requirement was inconsistent upon the request of a creditor, state or interested party. Moreover, a state law disclosure requirement could no longer appear in consumer credit contract documents once the Board decided it was inconsistent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">When it revised Regulation Z in 1981 to bring it in line with the TIL Simplification and Reform Act, the Board framed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>preemption standard very narrowly so as to displace little state law. That is, a state law was now inconsistent only if it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201crequire[d] a creditor to make disclosures or take actions that <em>contradicted] </em>the requirements of the federal law. A state law [was] contradictory if it require[d] the use of the same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the federal law, or if it require[d] the use of a term different from that required in the federal law to describe the same item\u201d (12 CFR former 226.28 [a] [1], as amended at 46 Fed Reg 20848, 20906 [Apr. 7, 1981] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In short, \u201c[t]he \u2018contradictory\u2019 standard\u201d in Regulation Z</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">\u201csimply remove[d] many state disclosure provisions . . . from the scope of preemption and concomitantly allow[ed] compliance with state law in borderline situations. Allowing creditors to comply with state disclosure requirements until the [Board] ma[de] a preemption determination remove [d] any fear of creditor violation of the TILA by making these required [state] disclosures\u201d (Tidwell at 944).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Congress next revisited TILA in a major way in 1988, when it enacted the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988 (FCCCDA) (Pub L 100-583). By 1988, the credit card business was a large, nationwide industry, not \u201cpreponderantly small and local in both its nature and operation,\u201d as had been the case in 1968 when TILA was enacted. In addition, beginning in 1986 with Wisconsin\u2019s enactment of a disclosure statute, state legislation in this area was burgeoning: by the time the FCCCDA was adopted, \u201cat least 11 states and Suffolk County in New York had enacted new cost of credit legislation designed to foster price competition among card issuers\u201d (Gelb and Cubita, <em>The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988: A Federal Alternative to the Rate Ceiling Approach, </em>44 Bus Law 941, 941 n 1 [1989]). So this time, Congress tackled preemption head on, devising a \u201cspecial\u201d rule for disclosure of credit information in credit or charge card applications or solicitations, which \u201cdeparted] radically from\u201d the inconsistency standard, \u201cthe approach which Congress historically [had] adopted in the credit disclosure area\u201d (Gelb and Cubita at 955).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">The FCCCDA dictated what credit information had to be disclosed (15 USC \u00a7 1637 [c], [e], [f]), and the manner of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>disclosure (15 USC \u00a7 1632 [c]) in credit or charge card applications or solicitations. To ensure that the marketplace did not outpace its detailed mandates, Congress in section 1637 (c) (5) provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cRegulatory authority of the Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cThe Board may, by regulation, require the disclosure of information <em>in addition to </em>that otherwise required by this subsection . . . , and <em>modify any disclosure of information required by </em>this subsection . . . , in any application to open a credit card account for any person under an open end consumer credit plan or any application to open a charge card account for any person, or a solicitation to open any such account without requiring an application, if the Board determines that such action is necessary to carry out the purposes of, or prevent evasions of, any paragraph of this subsection\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Section 1610 (e), as previously discussed, then specified that the provisions of sections 1632 (c) (governing the form or manner of disclosure) and 1637 (c), (e) and (f) (governing the content or substance of disclosure) \u201csupersede^] any provision of the law of any State relating to the disclosure of information in any credit or charge card application or solicitation which is subject to the requirements of section 1637 (c)\u201d except to enforce TILA and Regulation Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Congress thus occupied the entire field of cost-of-credit disclosures in credit or charge card applications or solicitations: it set out comprehensive requirements and established a singular <em>federal </em>mechanism (the Board) to add to or modify these requirements to keep abreast of developments in the consumer credit or charge card business. A state may enforce TILA\u2019s disclosure provisions, and surely a state may bring consumer complaints to the Board\u2019s attention and advocate revisions to Regulation Z. The language of section 1610 (e) and the structure of TILA\u2019s regulatory scheme after Congress\u2019 adoption of the FCCCDA, however, belie any notion that a state may use its consumer protection laws to impose additional or different cost-of-credit disclosure on a creditor. The majority\u2019s contrary statutory interpretation produces a patchwork scheme whereby each state may effect different or additional credit disclosure requirements unless and until the Board acts pursuant to section 1637 (c) (5) to regulate the form or substance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>disclosure of the same item of credit information, which would perforce then become \u201cinformation . . . which is subject to the requirements of section 1637 (c).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This, of course, completely undermines the uniformity of the federal regime that Congress devised to govern a nationwide industry. Moreover, it leaves no room for the possibility that the Board may have policy reasons <em>not </em>to mandate a particular disclosure that a state considers to be warranted (see <em>Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp. v Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 US 375, 384 [1983] [Under the Supremacy Clause, \u201ca federal decision to forgo regulation in a given area may imply an authoritative federal determination that the area is best left unregulated, and in that event would have as much pre-emptive force as a decision <em>to </em>regulate\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">As the discussion of the evolution of TILA preemption illustrates, before Congress adopted the special preemption rule, states supplemented federal credit disclosure requirements with regularity. If Congress had wanted this state of affairs to continue, there would have been no need for it to supplant the inconsistency/contradictory standard in section 1610 (a) (1) (as interpreted by the Board in Regulation Z) with the special preemption rule in section 1610 (e). By reading the special preemption rule as it does, the majority has undone Congress\u2019 handiwork: the majority has effectively reinstated the inconsistency/contradictory standard for disclosures in credit or charge card applications or solicitations. While the majority cloaks its interpretation of section 1610 (e) in the garb of the presumption against preemption of state law (majority op at 118), the presumption does not empower a state court to circumvent Congress\u2019 will as expressed in nonambiguous statutory language (\u201cIn all pre-emption cases ... we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act <em>unless that was the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>clear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d [Medtronic, Inc. v Lohr, </em>518 US 470, 485 (1996) (emphasis supplied, internal quotation marks and citations omitted)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In this litigation, the Attorney General has taken the position\u2014approved by the majority\u2014that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\"><em>\u201cthe overall impression </em>of CCB\u2019s representations regarding its credit cards, taken as a whole, was fraudulent and misleading to the average consumer. The flaw in these representations was not that they failed to provide the disclosures required by TILA, but rather that they affirmatively misled consumers and thus violated New York\u2019s consumer protection laws. <em>Because the petition alleges affirmative deception rather than inadequate disclosure, the claim is not preempted by TILA\u201d </em>(appellate brief at 3 [emphases added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">In sum, the Attorney General argued that whether or not CCB\u2019s solicitations comported with TILA or Regulation Z was basically irrelevant because he was only suing to enforce state laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and TILA does not preempt these state laws. He stressed that he did not seek or obtain \u201can order requiring that anything actually be disclosed, but rather requested and received an order enjoining [CCB] from misrepresenting credit terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The foundation for the Attorney General\u2019s analytical edifice is the Board\u2019s discussion of the scope of section 1610 (e) when it revised Regulation Z to implement the FCCCDA. In fact, the Attorney General argues that the Board \u201cdirectly answer[ed] the question posed in this case by declaring that \u2018prohibitions against unfair and deceptive acts or practices (such as state \u201cmini-FTC acts\u201d) also are not preempted,\u2019 \u201d quoting the Board\u2019s commentary accompanying the final version of section 226.28 (d) of Regulation Z (54 Fed Reg at 13864; <em>see also </em>majority op at 121).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">First, the statement that the Attorney General seizes upon is both truncated and taken out of context. The paragraph in which it appears reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-12\">\u201cIn addition, state laws regulating the substance of transactions subject to section 127 (c) [15 USC \u00a7 1637 (c) (applications and solicitations)] or (d) [15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>USC \u00a7 1637 (d) (renewal notice)] are not preempted, nor are state laws preempted that regulate the form or content of the disclosure of information that is unrelated to the scope and content of information required to be disclosed under section 127 (c) or (d). Thus, for example, the following types of state laws are not preempted: laws requiring card issuers to offer a grace period<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or prohibiting certain fees in credit or charge card transactions; laws such as retail installment sales acts and plain language laws,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unless they regulate the disclosure of credit term information in credit and charge card applications, solicitations or renewal notices; laws requiring notice of a consumer\u2019s rights under antidiscrimination or similar laws; and laws notifying consumers about credit information available from state authorities. <em>Finally, state laws regarding the enforcement of the requirements of section 127 (c) or (d) or of any prohibitions against unfair and deceptive acts or practices (such as state \u2018mini-FTC acts\u2019) also are not preempted\u201d </em>(54 Fed Reg at 13863-13864 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">This last sentence accords with the House Conference Report for the FCCCDA, which also discussed the use of mini-FTC statutes <em>solely </em>in the context of enforcing TILA and Regulation Z <em>(see </em>HR Conf Rep No. 100-1069, 100th Cong, 2d Sess, at 21-22, reprinted in 1988 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, at 3951, 3960;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> s<em>ee also </em>Official Staff Interpretations of Federal Reserve System Board of Governors, 12 CFR part 226, Supp I, at 577 [2008 ed]; Gelb and Cubita, <em>Implementation of the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988: The Regulatory Response, </em>44 Bus Law 1427, 1437 [1989] [\u201c(T)he supplementary information accompanying the final regulation indicates that (section 1610 [e]) would not preempt state laws concerning the substance of credit card arrangements [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] or the form and content of disclosures that are unrelated to the scope and content of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>federal application, solicitation, and renewal disclosures\u201d and, \u201c(b)y way of illustration,\u201d offers examples]).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">What is notably missing from the Board\u2019s discussion is any suggestion whatsoever that state mini-FTC laws might\u2014after enactment of the FCCCDA with its special preemption rule\u2014 remain available as a mechanism to impose disclosure requirements on creditors over and above those mandated by TILA and Regulation Z. Indeed, the Board emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201c[s]tate laws relating to <em>the terms of credit </em>required to be disclosed or <em>the manner </em>in which such terms must be disclosed are preempted as to any credit or charge card application or solicitation that is subject to [15 USC \u00a7 1637 (c)] . . . The preemption of such provisions of state law is <em>total, </em>and differs from other provisions of the TILA which generally preempt only inconsistent state laws\u201d (54 Fed Reg at 13863 [emphases added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">This position is in tune with the text of section 1610 (e) and the history of the special preemption rule; it is reflected in the broad wording chosen by the Board to implement section 1610 (e)\u2014i.e., \u201c[s]tate law requirements relating to the disclosure of credit information\u201d (12 CFR 226.28 [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Finally, the Attorney General (and the majority) cannot evade preemption by portraying this enforcement action as a suit to enjoin a misleading and fraudulent \u201coverall impression\u201d rather than \u201cinadequate disclosure.\u201d The only way for CCB to dispel the complained-about \u201coverall impression\u201d\u2014the only way for CCB to comply with Supreme Court\u2019s injunction<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014is to revise and alter the form and content of its solicitations; i.e., to make different and/or additional disclosures <em>(compare </em>majority op at 118 [\u201cWe again emphasize . . . that (the Attorney General\u2019s) success in this case does not force (CCB) ... to affirmatively disclose any additional credit terms\u201d]). Neither the Attorney General nor the majority explains how else CCB may eliminate the alleged misrepresentations from its solicitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Just a few months ago, the United States Supreme Court handed down <em>Riegel v Medtronic, Inc. </em>(552 US \u2014, 128 S Ct 999 [2008]). Riegel sued Medtronic for damages, alleging that a catheter marketed by the company was \u201cdesigned, labeled, and manufactured in a manner that violated New York common law, and that these defects caused [him] to suffer severe and permanent injuries\u201d (552 US at \u2014, 128 S Ct at 1005). The type of catheter implicated in Riegel\u2019s injuries had received premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a federal safety oversight regime created by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA). The MDA includes a preemption provision; specifically, 21 USC \u00a7 360k (a) provides that a state shall not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cestablish or continue in effect with respect to a device . . . any requirement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201c(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under [federal law] to the device, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under [relevant federal law].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The issue in <em>Riegel </em>was whether the FDA\u2019s approval of the catheter precluded the New York common-law tort suit. The Supreme Court (affirming the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit) decided that the MDA preempted Riegel\u2019s civil suit, reasoning that \u201c[a]bsent other indication, [Congress\u2019] reference to a State\u2019s \u2018requirements\u2019 includes its common-law duties,\u201d and these \u201crequirements\u201d were \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d the federal ones (552 US at \u2014, 128 S Ct at 1008). Further, the Court remarked that section 360k did \u201cnot prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations\u201d because in such a case the state duties would \u201c \u2018parallel,\u2019 rather than add to, federal requirements\u201d (552 US at \u2014, 128 S Ct at 1011).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">This is an even clearer case for preemption than <em>Riegel. </em>In <em>Riegel, </em>the preemption provision did not explicitly mention civil tort liability. Here, there can be no doubt that the Attorney General\u2019s claims under the Executive Law and the General Business Law are made under a \u201cprovision of the law of [the] State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>relating to the disclosure of information\u201d in solicitations governed by TILA (15 USC \u00a7 1610 [e]); or, as articulated by the Board, are \u201c[s]tate law requirements relating to the disclosure of credit information\u201d (12 CFR 226.28 [d]). As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[t]he ordinary meaning of [the phrase \u2018relating to\u2019] is a broad one\u2014to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with\u2014and the words thus express a broad pre-emptive purpose\u201d <em>(Morales v Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 US 374, 383 [1992] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). The majority avoids this evident conclusion only by resorting to its faulty analysis that the \u201cscope of section 1610 (e) preemption is . . . expressly limited to state laws relating to the disclosures specifically required under 1637 (c)\u201d (majority op at 118).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The majority also concludes that the MDA\u2019s preemption provision is broader than section 1610 (e) because the former displaces those state requirements that are \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d federal law. Yet again, the majority relies on its erroneous reading of section 1610 (e) to \u201cexpressly limit[ ]\u201d preemption \u201cto state laws relating to the disclosures specifically required under section 1637 (c)\u201d (majority op at 118). In fact (and as discussed previously), the wording of section 1610 (e) illustrates its preemption of the entire field of disclosure of cost-of-credit information in credit or charge card solicitations. Indeed (as discussed previously), under the formerly applicable inconsistency/contradictory standard, states were empowered to enforce state law disclosure requirements that differed from or added to the requirements established for credit or charge card solicitations by Congress in TILA. Congress fashioned the \u201cspecial\u201d preemption rule in section 1610 (e) precisely because it wanted to cut off and fully supplant supplemental state regulation in this area: only the Board may add to or modify TI-LA\u2019s statutory disclosure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Finally (again as discussed previously), the relief that the Attorney General sought (and has obtained) inevitably calls for CCB to alter the format and content of the disclosures in its credit or charge card solicitations of consumers <em>in New York, </em>thus \u201cdisrupting] the federal scheme\u201d envisaged and designed by Congress <em>(Riegel, </em>552 US at \u2014, 128 S Ct at 1008) to \u201cenhance credit shopping\u201d by requiring \u201cmore detailed and uniform\u201d disclosure of credit information to consumers nationwide (54 Fed Reg at 13855; <em>compare </em>majority op at 118).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The majority\u2019s desire to maximize our State\u2019s regulatory reach in the area of consumer protection is unsurprising. And the Board has arguably been slow to appreciate the value to consumers of at least certain of the specific disclosures at issue in this case (see 72 Fed Reg 32948 [June 14, 2007] [proposal by the Board to amend Regulation Z following a comprehensive review of TILA\u2019s rules for open-end (revolving) credit that is not home-secured]). But state pride and good intentions are not enough to justify this lawsuit. To borrow words from the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in a recent preemption case, \u201c[i]f New York\u2019s view regarding the scope of its regulatory authority carried the day, another state could be free to enact\u201d its own laws or bring its own lawsuits to supplement or modify the credit disclosures required by TILA and Regulation Z, thus \u201cunraveling the centralized federal framework\u201d in this area <em>(Air Transp. Assn. of Am., Inc. v Cuomo, </em>520 F3d 218, 225 [2d Cir 2008] [determining that federal law preempts New York State\u2019s Passenger Bill of Rights (General Business Law \u00a7 251-g [1])]). In enacting section 1610 (e), Congress essentially decided that the benefits from a uniform, nationwide regime for disclosure under the aegis of the Board outweighed any loss of protection to consumers under state law. The Supremacy Clause permits Congress to make this judgment, and we are bound to honor it. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Graffeo, Pigott and Jones concur with Judge Ciparick; Judge Read dissents in a separate opinion; Judge Smith taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\">. Interestingly, the TIL Simplification and Reform Act also amended TILA preemption so as generally to permit a creditor, state or interested party to petition the Board to determine whether a state-required disclosure was so similar to the disclosure mandated by TILA that creditors in that state could comply with the state law in lieu of making TILA disclosure <em>(see </em>15 USC \u00a7 1610 [a] [2]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\">. At least I assume that the majority would, at a minimum, acknowledge that if the Board, for example, ultimately amends Regulation Z to require disclosure of the effect of fees or a security deposit upon an applicant\u2019s credit limits in credit card applications <em>(see </em>majority op at 121 n 14), the State could no longer challenge the form or substance of the disclosure of credit limits via a lawsuit grounded in state consumer protection laws. That is, when my colleagues state that \u201c[t]he scope of section 1610 (e) preemption is . . . expressly limited to state laws relating to the disclosures specifically required under section 1637 (c)\u201d (majority op at 118), I assume they must intend \u201cdisclosures specifically required under section 1637 (c)\u201d to include any additional or modified disclosures required in Regulation Z by the Board pursuant to its section 1637 (c) (5) authority. If not, the injury to the federal regime would be even more severe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. <em>See e.g. </em>Personal Property Law \u00a7 413 (3) (c) (ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">. <em>See e.g. </em>General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\">. Here, the Attorney General concededly did not bring this lawsuit to enforce TILA or Regulation Z; therefore, the comment in the House Conference Report to the effect that disclosures beyond those specified in section 1637 (c) might be required or obtained in the settlement or adjudication of such a lawsuit is beside the point here (see majority op at 120).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\">. For example, section 1610 (e) would not have prevented the Attorney General from challenging CCB\u2019s <em>practice </em>of charging fees and security deposits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>that constitute a majority of a consumer\u2019s credit limit for the first 12 months of the account (see majority op at 121 n 14 [discussing proposed Regulation AA, which would regulate this practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act because it \u201cappears to be an unfair act or practice\u201d (73 Fed Reg 28904, 28923 [May 19, 2008])]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AmB\">.
