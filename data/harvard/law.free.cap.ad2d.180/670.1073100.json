The findings of fact as to liability are affirmed.</p><p id=\"b698-7\">We do not agree with the defendants\u2019 contention that the verdict of the jury is against the weight of the evidence. Review of the trial transcripts reveals that the jurors, as they were entitled to do, resolved questions of credibility and conflicts in the testimony of the medical experts testifying on behalf of the defendants and the plaintiff on the issue of causation <em>(see, Felt v Olson, </em>51 NY2d 977; <em>Ciccarella v Graf, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>116 AD2d 615). Under the circumstances we cannot say that the verdict of the jury did not represent a fair interpretation of the evidence presented <em>(see, Nicastro v Park, </em>113 AD2d 129, 132-134).</p><p id=\"b699-4\">Upon a review of the record we find that the award of damages was excessive to the extent indicated <em>(see, Hambsch v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>63 NY2d 723).</p><p id=\"b699-5\">Because the defendants failed to object to the now challenged testimony of the plaintiffs medical expert, any claim of error with respect to the admissibility of that testimony is not preserved for appellate review. Thompson, J. P., Harwood, Rosenblatt and Eiber, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
