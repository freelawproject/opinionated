In any event, the record establishes that defendant understood the significance and effect of his plea and that it was therefore knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made <em>(see, People v Harris, </em>103 AD2d 891). Defendant has also failed to show that defense counsel failed to satisfy the standards for meaningful representation set forth in <em>People v Baldi </em>(54 NY2d 137).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Mikoll, J. P., Yesawich Jr., Mercure, Crew III and Mahoney, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
