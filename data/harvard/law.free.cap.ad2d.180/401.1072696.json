Taking into account, \"among other things, the crime charged, the particular circumstances of the individual before the court and the purpose of a penal sanction\u201d, we perceive no abuse of discretion warranting a reduction in sentence. <em>(People v Farrar, </em>52 NY2d 302, 305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Further, defendant was sentenced in accordance with his plea bargain and within statutory guidelines. \"Having received the benefit of his bargain, defendant should be bound by its terms.\u201d <em>(People v Felman, </em>141 AD2d 889, 890, <em>lv denied </em>72 NY2d 918.)
