There is no evidence that Agrusa made any special use of the area in which the injured plaintiff fell, or otherwise caused or created the alleged sidewalk defect. Consequently, the Supreme Court properly dismissed the complaint insofar as asserted against Agrusa <em>(see, e.g., Little v City of Albany, </em>169 AD2d 1013; <em>Giammarino v Angelo\u2019s Royal Pastry Shop, </em>168 AD2d 423; <em>Sheehan v Rubenstein, </em>154 AD2d 663).
