Such a petition must contain the necessary prayer for appropriate final relief with respect to the property, and a paper which merely asks for the appointment of a receiver pending its hearing, as was the said motion presented in this ease, without any prayer for final relief, is a nullity and confers no jurisdiction upon the court.

The history of the proceeding and the subject matter of controversy and the result reached by the trial court is fully explained and set out in the opinion of this court handed down in this case on June 28, 1907. There is also set out in that opinion the Act of the Legislature of April 11, 1907, which we there construed and held to authorize the course pursued by the trial court, which is objected to in the appeal we are now considering. It is unnecessary for us to recapitulate what was stated in the opinion referred to. We there, in effect, held that the Act of the Legislature referred to was constitutional, which ruling, after further consideration, we adhere to. The Act in question clearly authorized the procedure pursued by the trial court, and the spirit, meaning and purpose of the Act authorized the court, upon dissolution of the permit to do business within this State of the appellant\u2019s company at the instance of the suit by the State, to appoint a receiver for its properties within its jurisdiction. The reason for this conclusion we undertook to state in the opinion referred to, which agrees with the conclusion of the trial judge, as stated in the bill of exception which is a part of the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Independent of the power conferred by the Act of the Legislature reviewed, we are of the opinion that the court had the authority to appoint a receiver by virtue of subdivision 3 of article 1465, Sayles\u2019 Civ. St. 1897. That subdivision is to the effect that a receiver may be appointed where a corporation is dissolved, or is insolvent, or in imminent danger of insolvency, or has forfeited its corporate rights. The corporate right of the appellant company to do business within this State was by virtue of a permit that had been granted to it by the State, and when an action is brought by the State to cancel and dissolve that permit, it is a proceeding which in our opinion comes within, if not the exact letter, the spirit and meaning of that part of the subdivision of the statute which relates to the forfeiture of the corporate rights of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">It is contended by the appellant that in the appointment of the receiver the trial court proceeded without pleading and evidence. The record and proceedings brought to this court by the appellant for our review contains no statement of facts, but there is a bill of exception which was approved by the court, in which it is stated that the court in passing upon the question of the appointment of the receiver, took judicial notice of the facts exhibited in the main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>case upon which the receivership is predicated, and of the judgment and decree rendered in that case, wherein it appears from the record in this case the judgment against the appellant corporation was for a large sum, and also forfeiting its. permit to carry on and conduct its business within this State. That branch of the case in which the receiver was appointed is merely an arm of the main' case, and is incidental to that proceeding. Both of them empower, if they do not expressly direct, the trial court to appoint a receiver when the State obtains its judgment canceling the permit. And there is another provision of the Act of 1907 which authorized a receiver to be appointed when the interests of the State might require it to be done. In view of these statutes, it is folly to say that the trial court must lose sight of the main controversy when he undertakes to appoint a receiver, and that before that jurisdiction can be exercised he must again rehear and review the facts that were established in the original case upon which the receivership depends; and we are of the opinion that the court, was correct in the conclusion that it could take judicial knowledge of the facts established in the main case and the judgment based thereon. The appellant has seen fit to perfect a separate appeal from the order appointing a receiver and it has no statement of facts in the record showing that the facts which the court took judicial knowledge of did not exist and were not sufficient to authorize the action of the court in making the appointment. The effect of the action of the court was to hold that the facts that he took judicial knowledge of were sufficient to authorize and justify the appointment. The record here shows that the State has actually recovered a judgment for penalties and for cancellation of the permit to do business. The presumption will be indulged in favor of the action of the trial court, and, no fact appearing in the record brought up here by the appellant which would negative and destroy the force of this presumption, we must hold that we have in this record facts sufficient to justify the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">It is contended by the appellant not only that the facts are not sufficient, which contention we have just disposed of, but that the appointment was made by the court without being predicated upon any pleading in the nature of a petition or bill by the State asking for and showing grounds for the appointment of a receiver. The document filed by the State upon which the court acted in making the appointment we construe to be of the nature of a pleading. It is addressed to the court, and states facts under the statutes discussed that would authorize the court to appoint a receiver. A general demurrer was interposed, it seems, to this application, and was overruled. It states grounds and reasons why the court should make the appointment, and some of these reasons stated are of the nature embraced in the statutes upon which a court may act in making the appointment. But, however, if it could be held that the application of the State could not be regarded as a petition or a bill or something in the nature of a pleading requesting the appointment of a receiver, or if an instrument of this character but fatally defective, then the question in the case of forfeiture of the franchise or permit and the power of the court to appoint a receiver is set at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>rest by the case of San Antonio Gas Co. v. State, <em>22 </em>Texas Civ. App., 118. It is there, in effect, held that where there is a judgment forfeiting the corporate rights the court can independent of the request of anyone, exercise his judicial discretion as to whether he will or will not appoint a receiver. It is unnecessary to repeat what the court in that opinion says upon the subject. The proposition is forcibly discussed, and the ruling is squarely to the effect that the court can, without request, make the appointment in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">As said before, we find no constitutional objection to the statutes under which the court acted in.making the appointment. What we have said is all that we think necessary to be said in disposing of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
