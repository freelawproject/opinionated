The question of negligence did not depend upon the existence of a rule upon the subject, but upon the exigencies of the situation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-14\"><em>2. </em>\u2014Charge\u2014Misusing Terms \u201cPlaintiff\u201d and \u201cDefendant\u201d\u2014Harmless Error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-15\">Charge in which the terms \u201cplaintiff\u201d and \u201cdefendant\u201d were misused or transposed considered, and held harmless in view of other portions of the charge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-16\">3. \u2014Charge\u2014Negligence\u2014Accident.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-17\">In a suit for personal injuries, the court having charged the jury to find against the defendant' only in the event they found that it was negligent and its negligence was the proximate cause of the injury, it was not error to refuse a special instruction to the effect that negligence could not be presumed from the mere happening of the accident.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-18\">4. \u2014Jury\u2014Majority of Witnesses.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-19\">A <em>jury </em>is not bound to render a verdict according to the testimony of a majority of the witnesses.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-20\">Appeal from the District Court of El Paso County.

Co., 37, p. 1068).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-3\">If negligence by any means could be imputed to the defendant, surely the plaintiff, by his negligent inattention in stepping on the track in front of the moving engine, or in standing upon the ties for four or five minutes, and until knocked down by the engine, with the bell ringing, and- moving at a speed of four miles per hour, contributed directly to his injury.

Rep., 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6o\">The charge is erroneous in this: Because it submitted the issue as to whether or not' the defendant was guilty of contributory negligence, instead of the plaintiff, and was calculated to mislead and confuse the jury.

Johnson, 91 Texas, 572.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-7\">The court erred in refusing the following charge, requested by the defendant: \u201cYou are charged that negligence can not be presumed from the mere happening of the accident, if accident it was.

One is that there was no evidence warranting the submission of the issue, and the other is that the court should not have submitted such issue in the absence of any rule requiring a switchman or other employe to be stationed on the foot-board of the tender for such purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">It was testified to by the witness Borcherding, general foreman of the car department, that he knew a switchman was generally on the footboards in switching in the yards; and that he thought it was necessary for men to be on the footboards the way the engine is going, that he had often seen them there. He did not testify to the existence of a rule to that effect, as is asserted by appellee, but said \u201cI think there is. I do not know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">The evidence was that this dead engine track was not a regular switch track, and was as a rule used only for the purpose of conveying engines to and from the roundhouse. Plaintiff\u2019s duties called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>him to this place and he had been watching the gauge of the oil pump through a little hole in the roundhouse fence. The pump did not seem to be working and plaintiff stepped upon the track and from there was watching the gauge over the fence when he was struck. He testified that he stood there three to five minutes, or something like that, looking over at a car to see if it was taking up oil. In doing this he was looking east and the engine came from the w\u00e9st. There was testimony showing that no warning was given of the approach of the engine, and no one was stationed on the footboard. Plaintiff testified that as a rule this track was not used for switching, but for carrying engines in and out of the roundhouse, and when they had any switching or bringing in of cars to do, some of the crew generally came and told him that they were coming in, that this was the regular practice. That no one told him about this engine coming, and the first he knew about it being upon the track was when it hit him. At that time there was hammering going on and engines in the vicinity were making noises that prevented him from hearing it approach. The place of the accident was ten or fifteen feet from the crossing of a public street. The engineer, Gaddis, testified that there was no person on the footboard of the tender that he saw, and that when he discov\u00e9red plaintiff the latter was looking in the opposite direction. Borcherding, who was the first man to reach plaintiff, testified that he saw no one on the footboard. The testimony of these witnesses, who testified in person, may have impressed the jury as evasive on the subject, and from what they stated or admitted, it seems to us that it was admissible for the jury, to conclude that no switchman was there. Borcherding testified that his attention was on Mr. Wafer, and that if there had been a switchman on the footboard he would have been right near Wafer.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">We conclude that the question of negligence of defendant did not depend on the existence of any positive rule requiring persons to be on the footboards. Whether or not such a precaution was demanded by the dictates of ordinary care, depended not upon a rule entirely, but fundamentally upon the exigencies of the situation. Here was a track used only occasionally and in a limited way by engines or cars in the yards of defendant/ where the track might be used at any time by some employe in performing a duty, as it appears this plaintiff was doing at the time; the employe not suspecting, and having reason, from the ordinary practice in such matters, not to expect, that an engine would attempt to back over it without notice of its approach, and it can not be said, as a matter of law, that ordinary prudence would not require, under such conditions, the precaution of stationing some person on the footboard. The case is not that of a trespasser occupying a track, but of an employe occupying it in the performance of his work. We think the charge complained of was not erroneous. The testimony of plaintiff, if accepted by the jury as the true version of the transaction, as it doubtless was, would acquit him of contributory negligence. They had the right to disbelieve the contrary testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The second and third assignments complain of the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>portion of the charge: \u201cAnd by contributory negligence is meant some negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant which, concurring or co-operating with some negligent act or omission on the part of plaintiff, is the proximate cause of the injury complained of.\u201d Also the following: \u201cIn determining whether or not plaintiff was guilty of negligence, or whether or not defendant was guilty of contributory negligence, you may look to all the surrounding facts and circumstances in evidence before you, bearing upon these issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The part of the court\u2019s charge which explained and submitted the issues the jury were to decide, and for or against whom to find according to their determination of such issues, was so plain and unmistakable that the jury could not have been misled or confused by the inadvertent misplacing of the words \u201cplaintiff\u201d and \u201cdefendant\u201d in the portions of the charge which are complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"AqX\">The fourth and fifth complain of refused charges which were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">1st. \u201cYou are charged that negligence can not be presumed from the mere happening of the accident, if accident it was. Therefore if you find that plaintiff was injured as the result of an accident, not caused by the negligence of the defendant as charged by plaintiff, you will find for the defendant.\u201d This charge we think would have been improper. The court plainly allowed the jury to find against defendant only if it had been negligent and its negligence proximately caused the injury. We do not comprehend how the court could make the matter plainer to men of ordinary intelligence, by charging in addition that an event brought about by negligence is different from a mere accident. It seems to us that what the proposed charge states about accident was more in the nature of argument than useful explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">2d. \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that both the engineer and the plaintiff were guilty of negligence, proximately causing or contributing to plaintiff\u2019s injury, then plaintiff can not recover.\u201d We do not see how this form of expression would have been more serviceable to defendant\u2019s purposes than the charge that the court gave, to find for defendant if plaintiff was guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">We overrule the sixth assignment. The supplemental instruction was not calculated to have the effect claimed for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">The seventh is also overruled. The testimony was amply sufficient to support the finding that there was no switchman on the rear end of the tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The eighth is also overruled. It was for the jury to say whether or not, under the circumstances developed in plaintiff\u2019s testimony, he was guilty of negligence in standing where he did from three to five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">The ninth is that the court erred in refusing a new trial for the reason that the evidence shows that the engineer saw plaintiff when the latter was far enough from the track to he out of danger, but that when the engine approached to within six or eight feet of him, he suddenly stepped on the track and the engineer used every means in his power to prevent said injury, and these facts were established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>by the testimony of the engineer and the witness Borcherding, and the jury were not warranted in disregarding their testimony, they being unimpeached. It seems useless to discuss this, as it assumes that the jury had no right to believe plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">The verdict and judgment entered thereon was for $4500. After-wards, when the motion for new trial came on to be heard, and the court announced that it would grant the motion unless plaintiff would remit $1700, plaintiff entered a remittitur reducing the sum to $2800, which the court approved and then overruled the motion. We find that this amount was not excessive, and overrule the remaining assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
