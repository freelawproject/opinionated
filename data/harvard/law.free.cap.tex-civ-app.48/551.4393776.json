Enc. of Law, 2d ed., page 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-10\">As the origin of the remedy of specific performance was due to the inadequacy of the common law, so the inadequacy of the legal remedy is still the controlling requisite for specific performance. 26 Am. and Eng. Enc of Law, page 17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-11\">A court of equity will not grant relief where the complaining party will not be deprived of any legal right by withholding it, unless he can show clearly that he is entitled to the relief sought. If the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at -law, he must seek his redress there. Waterman on Specific Performance of Contracts, sec. 9, page 12; Levy v. Hill, 50 N. Y. App. Div., 294; Meehan v.

G.

M. Trueheart &amp; Co., were the agents for Chas. R Bishop, the defendant, owner of lots 12, 13 and 14 in block 322, city of Galveston, and that after some correspondence between them about the best price that could be obtained for the property, Bishop by letter of October 11, 1905, named $20,000 as the lowest offer he would entertain, but asked for the opinion of the agents as to what price he should place on it. Adriance &amp; Sons by their letter of October 16, 1905, replied that in their opinion the property would be well sold at $15,000, either cash or part cash and balance in six or - seven percent interest bearing purchase money notes, secured by vendor\u2019s lien. That on the 17th of October, 1905, Adriance &amp; Sons wired him, \u201cCan probably sell the three lots Fourteen Thousand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>dollars, if can obtain $15,000 would consider well sold. Answer.\u201d That on the 19th of October, 1905, Bishop replied by wire: \u201cTelegram received; will accept $15,000 for three lots.\u201d That pursuant to authority so vested in them, Adriance &amp; Sons agreed to sell the property to the plaintiff for $15,000. Believing, from Bishop\u2019s previous letters, interest bearing notes would be acceptable to him in part payment, and finding that the purchaser Tartt was unwilling to give notes bearing six or seven percent interest, as they had advised Bishop by their letter of the 16th of October could, they thought, be obtained, the sale ivas made to Tartt for all cash or at vendor\u2019s option one-fourth cash and balance in three equal notes due at one, two and three years with five percent per annum interest, secured by vendor\u2019s lien and deed of trust on the same property. That on the 'Slst of October, 1905, Adriance &amp; Sons and Tartt executed the contract of sale to carry out their verbal agreement, but by inadvertence of Mr. C. D. Adriance, member of the firm of Adriance &amp; Sons, who wrote the earnest money receipt or contract of sale, the stipulation <em>for all cash </em>or part cash and the balance in vendor\u2019s lien notes, as expressed in the writing, at the vendor\u2019s option, was omitted, and in that form the contract of sale was executed by both parties in ignorance of such omission and by mutual mistake. That Adriance &amp; Sons in transmitting the contract of sale to Bishop, on the same' day it was made advised him if he did not care for the five percent notes they could make the sale all cash. The terms \u201cWe can make the sale all cash\u201d in this letter were also used by mistake, the agreement itself being for all cash, or cash and notes as expressed. The true agreement was as the contract of sale was. reformed by the court and incorporated in the decree. The evidence that the true agreement was as found by the court and that the omission in the writing was by mutual mistake is so clear and explicit as to leave no doubt in the mind of the court. I find that the purchaser has repeatedly offered to comply with the terms of his purchase, paying all cash or part cash and notes, but in consequence of a disagreement between the defendant and his agents about their commission he refused to recognize the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The first assignment of error and the proposition thereunder is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cThe court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s general demurrer. There being no allegation in plaintiff\u2019s petition showing that he was injured, pecuniarily or otherwise, by the alleged refusal of defendant to perform the contract alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition and no allegation in said petition, direct or otherwise, that plaintiff\u2019s remedy at law by a suit for damages for breach of the alleged contract, was not adequate and complete, plaintiff\u2019s petition failed to show any right to the equitable remedy of specific performance, of the alleged contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">This assignment can not be sustained. It was not necessary in order to entitle plaintiff to have specific performance of 'the contract that he allege in his petition that his injury was such that damages would not adequately compensate him therefor. \u2022 The rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>contended for has never been recognized in this State, but in cases of this kind one may sue for specific performance or for damages as he may elect. Younger v. Welch, <em>22 </em>Texas, 423; Kopplin v. Kopplin, 8 Texas Civ. App., 628; Day Land &amp; Cattle Co. v. State, 68 Texas, 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">We think the evidence sustains the finding of the trial court before set out, that by the contract of sale between appellee and the agent of appellant, appellee agreed to pay cash for the property or pay part cash and execute vendor\u2019s lien notes for the balance, as appellant might elect, and that the agreement to pay all cash was omitted from the written contract by mutual mistake of the parties. This conclusion disposes of the several assignments which complain-of the judgment on the ground that the evidence was not sufficient to authorize the reformation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The trial court further found that the appellant ratified the contract after it was sent to him by his agent. We do not think this, finding is sustained by the evidence, but the other facts \u25a0 found entitled plaintiff to the judgment rendered in his favor, and therefore the additional finding was unnecessary and it is immaterial that it is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We think the judgment of the court below.should be affirmed and it has been so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
