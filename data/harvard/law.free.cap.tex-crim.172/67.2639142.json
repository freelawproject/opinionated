G. Walley, Jr., </em>Acting Criminal District Attorney, <em>W. T. Wood, </em>Assistant Criminal District Attorney, Beaumont, and <em>Leon Douglas, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, Austin, for the state.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-12\">WOODLEY, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">The offense is unlawfully attempting to pass as true a forged instrument in writing; the punishment, 5 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">Appellant pleaded guilty before the court, a jury being waived in the manner authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">The evidence shows that appellant went to Gordon Jewelry Company, in Beaumont and presented Harold R. Lang, an employee, the check which was offered in evidence in payment for a watch he selected. He departed without the watch, the change or the check, after he was asked if he had other identification, and replied, \u201cYes, I do, but I have to go to the car and get it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-16\">The check was in the sum of $174.35 and upon its face purported to be drawn by E. E. Biscamp and Company, by E. E. Biscamp, payable to Charles Johnston.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-17\">E. E. Biscamp testified that the signature on the check was not his and that he did not give appellant permission to sign his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-18\">The evidence is deemed sufficient to sustain the conviction upon appellant\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Appellant has filed a brief. It is evident that it was prepared without benefit of counsel familiar with the rules of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Appellant\u2019s complaint relating to the entry of his notice of appeal was answered favorably to him by our order directing that such notice be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In his brief appellant contends, with no evidence or record to support such contentions, that his plea of guilty was entered under duress; that the sentence was vague and uncertain and was invalid and that the trial records have been altered to his detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">There is nothing in the record to support appellant\u2019s contentions. On the contrary, affidavits of the trial judge and of appellant\u2019s trial counsel refute such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction and no reversible error appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
