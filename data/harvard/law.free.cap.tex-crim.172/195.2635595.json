The court sustained the objection and told the jury to disregard the answer and overruled the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">It is the State\u2019s contention that the answer was harmless, that it was not responsive to the question asked. The State also contends that there is no showing that the mere fact that the officer was familiar with appellant\u2019s \u201cmug shot\u201d is indicative that appellant had a prior police record. The State relies upon Sapet v. State, 159 Texas Cr. Rep. 620, 266 S.W. 154; Ramsey v. State, 165 Texas Cr. Rep. 409, 308 S.W. 2d 26; and Bolick v. State, 165 Texas Cr. Rep. 493, 309 S.W. 2d 74. We have carefully examined all of these cases, none of them being in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We might not be confronted with this problem had the jury abided by the trial court\u2019s instruction and disregarded the answer. In viewing the statement of facts in the motion for new trial, we find that juror Balentine referred to Officer Stroud\u2019s testimony about the \u201cmug shot\u201d during the jury\u2019s deliberations, that the foreman warned \u201cWe are not supposed to discuss that,\u201d when \u201cmug shot\u201d was mentioned, but that the discussion was already had prior to the warning being given by the foreman. Juror Bobbie D. White testified that he recalled that the judge had instructed them not to consider any such statement and that the foreman\u2019s remark ended the discussion. Juror J. L. Riddle, called by the State as a witness on the motion for new trial, testified that he heard one of the members of the jury say something about a \u201cmug shot\u201d but that Mr. Houck, the jury foreman, told them not to consider that. Juror Riddle further related that after the statement had already been made the foreman reminded them not to say anything about it. Juror Alton Bass testified that he heard a discussion about a \u201cmug book\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In measuring the prejudicial effect upon the appellant of the inadmissible testimony that was voluntarily placed before the jury by the officer\u2019s inadvertent statement, and the failure of the jury to abide by the court\u2019s instruction to disregard the answer given by Officer Stroud, it is clear to us that when four jurors testified that mention was made in their deliberations of this testimony, the jury gave consideration to said testimony. We have here a case of a jury considering the appellant\u2019s character when it had not been put in issue, giving consideration to a statement implying strongly that the appellant had been in previous trouble, when no evidence was introduced showing any previous acts of misconduct or law violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In Priest v. State, 162 Texas Cr. Rep. 66, 282 S.W. 2d 390, we held that evidence similar to that in the case at bar was so highly prejudicial that it could not be cured by the court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard it. Here, we have a positive showing that the jury did consider such inadmissible and highly prejudicial evidence in disregard of the court\u2019s instruction, plus the uncontroverted evidence that at least two of the jurors (Balentine and Rose) voted to increase the punishment after consideration of such evidence, which clearly shows injury to the appellant. Price v. State, 150 Texas Cr. Rep. 161, 199 S.W. 2d 168, and Jackson v. State, 157 Texas Cr. Rep. 323, 248 S.W. 2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Because the trial court erred in refusing to grant a new trial, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>WOODLEY, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMZv\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Jury misconduct is one of the grounds upon which reversal of this conviction is sought. The court\u2019s refusal to order a mistrial when Officer Stroud gave the unresponsive answer that he was familiar with mug shots of appellant and two others involved in the robbery is another.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The majority opinion does not reverse upon either but couples the two claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">It is my view that the trial court did not err in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial, and did not err in overruling his motion for new trial based upon claimed misconduct of the jury. If this be so, the two claimed errors do not together show reversible error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
