King, George Washington, Jr. (Otis H. King </em>of Counsel) Houston, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-11\"><em>Frank Briscoe, </em>District Attorney, <em>Walter A.

They were not served because there were members of the colored race among them. There was never any loud talking, noise, communication with other patrons in the establishment, or boisterous or unseemly conduct on the part of any of them. They stand convicted of an unlawful assembly denounced by our Article 449, V.A.P.C., as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">\u201cIf the purpose of the unlawful assembly be to prevent any person from pursuing any labor, occupation or employment, to intimidate any person from following his daily avocation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>or to interfere in any manner with the labor or employment of another the punishment shall be by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In the past, this Court has pointed out what acts constitute a violation of this Act. See Ex Parte Bracye, 142 Texas Cr. Rep. 332, 152 S.W. 2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We must now determine if, under the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 92 S.Ct. 248, 7 L. Ed. 2d 207, the facts stated above constitute <em>any </em>evidence to support these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We have concluded that they do not, and a reversal of the conviction is necessarily called for. See also Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 451, 81 S. Ct. 182, 5 L. Ed. 2d 206, and Bailey v. Patterson, 82 S. Ct. 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The judgments are reversed and the causes are remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
