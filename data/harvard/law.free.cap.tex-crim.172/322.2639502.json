State, 346 S.W. 2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The judgment is attacked as void on the ground that the offense was barred by limitation when the indictment was returned on October 11,1960, it alleging that the offense was committed on or about September 27, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The indictment further alleged that the petitioner was absent from the state from the 23rd day of February, 1960, until the 19th day of August, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Art. 178 V.A.C.C.P. provides that an indictment for felony theft may be presented within 5 years and not thereafter.
