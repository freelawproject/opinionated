However, here, the statement of facts was filed 220 days after notice of appeal was given, or 130 days beyond the normal 90-day period in which to file. We further observe that the statement of facts filed in this court <em>was signed by the trial court judge </em>some 8 days after the deliverance of the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">While this court has, on occasion, withdrawn its original per curiam opinion and allowed the statement of facts to be filed and considered by this court, it has only done so in cases where the statement of facts had been filed with the trial court prior to original submission of the case before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">In the recent opinion of Selvidge v. State, 171 Texas Cr. Rep. 140, 345 S.W. 2d 523, on rehearing, this court had an occasion to consider and decide a very similar fact situation. There, after the original submission, a statement of facts was filed and <em>signed by the trial court judge, </em>some 8 days after the deliverance of the original opinion. This court, in refusing to consider the late filed statement of facts, in construing the legislative intent behind Section 4, Article 759a, supra, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-8\">\u201cIt is our conclusion that to hold .otherwise would prohibit us from ever being able to effectively terminate appeals to this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">We think the Selvidge case controls the disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-11\">ON appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b21-12\">WOODLEY, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ar\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b21-13\">A statement of facts, approved by the trial judge since the affirmance of the judgment by per curiam opinion on November 1, 1961, has been filed and forwarded to this court. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>challenges the late filing of such statement of facts, and cites Selvidge v. State, 171 Texas Cr. Rep. 140, 345, S.W. 2d 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">Prior to the amendment of Art. 759a, Sec. 4, V.A.C.C.P. in 1959 (Acts 56th Legislature, 1st C.S. p. 20), said section read: \u201cThe defendant shall file said statement of facts in duplicate, with the clerk of the trial court within ninety (90) days after the date of giving notice of appeal.\u201d There was no authority elsewhere in the Code whereby the trial judge could extend the time for filing the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The 56th Legislature amended Section 4 of Art. 759a by adding thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-6\">\u201cand for good cause shown, the judge trying the cause may further extend the time in which to file the statement of facts, and shall have the power, in term time or vacation, upon application for good cause to extend for as many times as deemed necessary the time for preparation and filing of statement of facts, and <em>the approval of the statement of facts after the expiration of the ninety (90) day period shall be sufficient proof that the time for filing toas properly extended.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">The state\u2019s brief presents strong argument why there should be some limitation upon the time which the trial court may allow by extension. The legislature, however, has fixed no such limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The legislature having provided that the trial judge may extend the time for filing the statement of facts for good cause shown, without reference to whether the transcript has been forwarded or whether the case has been submitted, this court is without authority to do other than comply with the statute. Whether there should be a limitation upon extensions by the trial court is for the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">If Selvidge v. State, supra, supports the state\u2019s position it should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
