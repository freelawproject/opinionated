The contract between the plaintiff and the American Seal Lock Company, which is the foundation of this action,, was manifestly <em>ultra vires </em>as to the former company. It is therefore void, and no cause of action can arise out of it <em>(Chitty on Cont., </em>11 Am. Ed., p. 385, and note ; Brady <em>v. </em>Mayor, 2 <em>Bosw. </em>173; Life and Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Mechanics\u2019 Fire Ins. Co., 7 <em>Wend. </em>31; People <em>v. </em>Utica Fire Ins. Co., 15 <em>Johns. </em>358;, Sewall <em>v. </em>Allen, 6 <em>Wend. </em>335; DeGroff <em>v. </em>American Linen Thread Co., 21 <em>N. Y. </em>124; McMasters <em>v. </em>Reed, 1 <em>Grant </em>(Pa.) 36; N. Y. Firemen Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Sturges, 2 <em>Cow. </em>664; Same <em>v. </em>Ely, <em>Id. </em>678; Catlin <em>v. </em>Eagle Bank 6 <em>Conn. </em>233 ; Ocum Co. <em>v. </em>Sprague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Manuf. Co., 34 <em>Conn. 552; </em>City of New London <em>v. </em>Brainard, <em>22 Conn. 552 </em>; Gray <em>v. </em>Hook, 4 <em>Comst. </em>449 ; <em>Chitty on Cont. </em>11 Am. Ed., 972). There is a class of 'Cases called sometimes exceptions to the rule now under discussion,\u2014cases where the defendant is held to be estopped from raising the question of authority. It is, however, apparent, upon a little reflection, that they are not exceptions to the rule, and have nothing to do with it. They are all cases where the defendant has, by contracting with the corporation, obtained money, goods, or services, and seeks to avoid payment, on the ground that the transaction was on the part of the corporation <em>ultra vires. </em>Or they are cases where the defendant being a corporation seeks to defraud in like cases, on the ground of its own want of authority in the premises. In these cases, courts do not always -consider the question of authority and the doctrine of <em>ultra vires. </em>The transaction may be <em>ultra vires </em>the corporation, but the law considers it to be a fraud to allege it to be so. The law will not permit that to be alleged which, if true, is against honesty and good faith, and puts its seal on the lips of the defendant, condemning him to silence in respect to the question. He is concluded by an estoppel (Moss <em>v. </em>Rossie Lead Manuf. Co., <em>5 Hill, </em>137; DeGroff <em>v. </em>Am. Linen Co., 21 <em>N. Y. </em>126; Steam Nav. Co. <em>v. </em>Weed, 17 <em>Barb. </em>378 ; Sackett\u2019s Harbor Bank <em>v. </em>Lewis Co. Bank, 11 <em>Barb. </em>213). But to bring this rule into operation, there must be privity of contract or estate. Here there is neither. The defendants sustain no relation to the plaintiff. Their liability rests upon the terms of a highly penal statute (Garrison <em>v. </em>Howe, 17 <em>N. Y. </em>458). They are not estopped, therefore, from setting up this defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-5\">II. Assuming this contract to have been in all respects .a valid contract, still the defendants are not liable because there was no existing debt before or in Jan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>nary, 1871, and the. action is predicated solely on the default in filing the report for the year 1871. (1). The plaintiff must have been a creditor of the company at the time of the alleged default\u2014not a creditor <em>in posse, </em>but a creditor <em>in esse. </em>There must have been a \u201c debt \u2019 \u2019 <em>\u2014subsisting\u2014in </em>esse, not <em>in </em>posse, either at the time of the default, or some time during its continuance. In the case at bar, therefore, there must have been a debt subsisting against this company, and in favor of this plaintiff, prior to January 1, 1873. (3). <em>A </em>subsisting debt, according to any, even the largest interpretation, can not mean a subsisting liability, such as an execu tory agreement for the manufacture of commodities. It may mean, in its broadest acceptation, a sum certain, owing presently, but payable in the future. While it is manifest that under any possible construction of the words, \u201c debts then existing,\u201d the defendant can not be liable, the true construction, it is submitted, is, that at the time of the default there must be a subsisting debt, for the recovery of which an action would lie. This is the natural and ordinary meaning. The statute is a penal statute. The plaintiff takes his remedy <em>strietissimi juris </em>(Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Bliss, 1 <em>Robt. </em>391). The point made in this second branch of the defense is sustained by Garrison <em>v. </em>Howe (17 <em>N. Y. </em>458). In this case there was a contract for the delivery of lumber at a future day. It was held that no debt arose within the meaning of the statute till the delivery of the property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-5\"><em>D. M. </em>Porter, attorney and of counsel for respondent,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgG\">urged;\u2014I. The liability of the defendant in this case is in the nature of tort and not of contract (Strong <em>v. </em>Sproul, 4 <em>Daly, </em>326 ; Andrews <em>v. </em>Murray, 33 Barb. 354 ; Miller <em>v. </em>White, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>137). \u201cIt is clear that the liability of the defendant is not imposed as an indemnity, because it has no relation to the actual loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>or injury sustained by the party in whose favor the action was-given. It is sufficient that the party prosecuting the actio,n, should be a creditor when the violation of the law takes place\u201d (Merchants\u2019 Bank v. Bliss, 35 <em>N. Y. </em>412).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-5\">II. \u201cThe trustees of a manufacturing corporation are neither parties nor privies to the original contract, nor to any note or judgment\u2019\u2019\"(Miller v. White, <em>supra). </em>\u201c The defendants are neither principal debtors nor sureties, but are liable for the penalties- prescribed by the statute\u201d (Miller v. White, <em>supra).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHW\">III. The defendants are so far disconnected with the state of the original indebtedness that \u2018a judgment recovered.in the original cause of action, as against the corporation, is no evidence against the trustees.\u201d The liability of the trustees can only be established upon and by proving the original demand (Miller v. White, <em>supra). </em>And the defendants are liable for the indebtedness existing at the time of the default,' any changes in the state of the original indebtedness to the contrary notwithstanding (Vincent v. Sands, 33 N. Y. Sup\u2019r Ct. R. 511; Deming v. Puleston, <em>Id. </em>231; Miller v. White, <em>supra). </em>In each of these cases notes have been taken, and subsequently passed into judgment. And even .if the trustees had been sureties, as they claim, the renewals having been made at their request, they would still remain liable, notwithstanding the extension (Wright v. Storrs, 6 <em>Bosw. </em>600 ; Affirmed, 32 N. <em>Y. </em>691).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-7\">IV. It is submitted that the papers intended for reports do not meet the requirements of the statute. They do not state the amount of capital, nor the proportion actually paid in, but simply state the amount which had not been paid in, in cash, and the amount issued for patent rights, as required by section 6 of the act, add the report required by section 12 has never bepn made, and consequently leaving the items required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>by section 12 wholly nnmentioned. There is a distinction between the amount of capital and the amount paid for patent rights, section 6, and the amount of capital, and the proportion actually paid in, section 12 of the laws of 1848. Again the verification to it is imperfect, being upon knowledge and belief only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-5\">XT\". It is admitted in the answer that no report was filed until January 19, 1872, and that the contract was made when there was a positive default; but it is submitted that there were, in fact, no reports under section 12, the alleged reports being insufficient and of no \u25a0effect, for the reasons above stated. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint was properly overruled, because, to have decided as requested would have been error. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-6\">VI. It is submitted that the charter of the plaintiff authorizes making these locks, which were intended! for the government to protect supplies during war ; but , even if it did not, the Seal Lock Company having dealt, with the company and received the benefit of the contract, and given notes for the balance due, it and the-trustees are estopped from disputing the right to con-, tract (Steam Navigation Co. v. Weed, 17 <em>Barb. </em>87<em>8; </em>Mott v. U. S. Trust Co., 19 <em>Id. </em>568 ; Palmer v. Lawrence, 3 <em>Band. </em>170).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b569-8\">By the Court.\u2014Speir, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avfm\">The American Seal Lock Company was organized in May, 1870, and during that year very little business was transacted. The contract on which the action is based is dated October, 1871, and it is conceded that up to January 19, 1872, no report was made or filed. From the organization of the company, until the action was brought in February, 1873, the defendants were the sole trustees of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">It appears from the evidence that the locks were not delivered at the several times specified in the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>but a few were delivered in December, 1871; how many does not appear. The most definite testimony produced \u00f3n the subject of deliveries was by Mr. Whitney, the president of the plaintiff\u2019s company, who says: \u201cThey were delivered in January, 1872; the majority of the ten thousand was delivered in the month of January, 1872 - pretty much all during the month of January. 1872.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The plaintiff proved as evidence of indebtedness of the American Seal Lock Company, two promissory notes, one for three thousand four hundred and forty-three dollars and nineteen cents, dated June (I, 1872, three months after date; the other for two thousand four hundred and seventy-nine dollars and thirteen cents, dated May 30, 1872, two months after date.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">These were renewals of previous notes dated respectively, January 24, and January 31,1872, given by the Am\u00e9rican Seal Lock Company, in the year 1872, in payment for locks that had been delivered at their respective dates. On the trial the plaintiff offered to return the renewed notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">It is comparatively of little importance, in the view \u00cd take of the case, to ascertain whether any portion of the locks were delivered in December, 1871, or indeed, whether any of the certificates were verified and filed within the time required by the twelfth section of the statute. It is very plain that the certificates which were filed, do not comply with the requirements of the section.' They do not state the amount of capital, nor the proportion actually paid in. They do state the amount of the existing debts, and that is all.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">It has been repeatedly held that the general object of the law was, besides enforcing the duty of making reports for the benefit of all concerned, to enable persons proposing to deal with the corporation to see whether they could safely do so. These certificates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>would afford no useful information to anybody inquiring as to amount of capital, or thq proportion' actually paid in.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The learned counsel for the appellant, I think, must have taken this view of the case, as he has placed his objections substantially on other grounds. First, that the contract between the two companies, which is the foundation of the action, was <em>ultra vires </em>as to the plaintiff; and second, that at the time of the alleged default, the plaintiff must have been a <em>creditor </em>of the company <em>in esse, </em>and not <em>in posse. </em>In other words, there must have been a <em>debt subsisting, </em>and in favor of this plaintiff prior to January, 1872.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The first objection fairly stated is that the plaintiff agrees to \u201c manufacture and deliver to the American Seal Lock Company twenty thousand circular railroad locks,\u201d\u2014that the subject-matter under the contract bears no relation whatever to any of the articles which the company is authorized under its charter to make and sell. It is quite apparent, I think, that a body politic and corporate created and organized for the purpose of manufacturing every variety of fire arms and other implements of war applicable to the use of fire-arms, and all kinds of machinery adapted to the construction thereof, and otherwise, can not be construed into a corporate authority to manufacture and deliver circular railroad locks, any more than they could to make and deliver railroads, or railroad cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">But are the defendants at liberty to discuss with the sovereign power of the State of Connecticut the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s chartered privileges, until they have restored the property, or its value, which they unjustly hold without proper compensation. I)uer, J., says: \u201cA defendant who has contracted with a corporation <em>defacto </em>is never permitted to allege any defect in its organization as affecting its capacity to contract or sue, but all such objections, if valid, are only available on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>behalf of the sovereign power of the State\u201d (Palmer v. Lawrence, 3 <em>Sand. S. C. R. </em>170; The Chester Glass Co. <em>v. </em>Dewey, 16 <em>Mass. </em>102). The defendants should not be permitted in law or equity to rescind a contract the fruits of which they retain, and can never be compelled to restore if this doctrine is carried out. It was decided in Moss <em>v. </em>The Rossie Lead Mining Co. (5 <em>Hill </em>137) that a corporation can never' avoid its obligation on the ground that it was given for property which the corporation was not authorized to purchase. If the company was bound, I see no reason why the trustees should not also be bound by the contract. But defendant\u2019s counsel say there must be privity of contract or <em>estate to </em>apply the rule of estoppel from setting up this defense,\u2014and the argument is, that the liability resting upon the terms of a penal statute, an estoppel can not arise against the defendants. A little consideration only, is required to see that this penal statute, for such it doubtless is, can have no operation whatever, except as applied to a contract express or implied between parties to it, which is the first condition of privity of contract.. It is, I think, this feature in the transaction which gives to the statute its chief value.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Tne second objection is that the trustees are only liable for <em>debts </em>of the company <em>then, </em>existing. It is claimed that inasmuch as the plaintiff took the notes of the company which did not mature until after the reports were filed, the debt was not subsisting against the defendant\u2019s company in favor of the plaintiff prior to the time of tiling the report; that it was not a sain certain owing presenting but payable in the future. In the case at bar we have already seen that the reports do not meet the requirements of the statute. Even if the proposition of the counsel be sound, it cannot avail, for the notes fell due on or prior to September 10, 1872, and remained unpaid at the time'of the trial when they were tendered to defendants, so that there was on Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tember 10, 1872, a subsisting debt then due, and which continued to be due at the time of the commencement of this action, which was on or after January 31, 1873, and still continues to be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Therefore there was a subsisting debt due at the time of the default in filing the report, which should have been filed within twenty days after January 1, 3873.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The case must be disposed of as though there had never been any reports filed. I fully agree that the statute is penal, and is to be strictly construed, and that the rules of law do not permit us to extend it by construction to cases not fairly within the language. As, however, the debt was actually due when the notes were tendered to the plaintiff when the defendant\u2019s liability attached under the statute, it is not necessary to extend the discussion of the question raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Monell, Ch. J. and Sedgwick, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
