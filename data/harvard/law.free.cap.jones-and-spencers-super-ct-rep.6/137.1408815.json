The defendant had the right by such plea, to put in issue for trial in the ordinary way in which issues of fact are tried, all the material allegations of the declaration. \u201c Courts have never set aside the general issue\u201d (Brewster <em>v. </em>Bostwick, 6 <em>Cow. </em>37; Broome County Bank v. Lewis, 18 <em>Wend. </em>566).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Under the Code, the defendants\u2019 answer may contain a general or specific denial of each material allegation of the complaint controverted by hita <em>(Code. </em>\u00a7 149).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">And-when an answer contains such a denial, and is verified in the manner prescribed by law, it can not be stricken out as sham (Winnie <em>v. </em>Sickles, 9 <em>How. Pr. </em>217; Wayland <em>v. </em>Tysen, 45 <em>N. Y. </em>281; Thompson v. Erie R. R. Co., <em>Id. </em>468).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">But as special pleas under the former system might be stricken out as false and sham, so affirmative defenses in an answer, or an answer containing affirmative defenses without a general or specific denial, may be so treated under the Code on similar grounds (Stewart <em>et al. v. </em>Hotchkiss, 2 <em>Cow. </em>634; Brewster v. Bostwick, <em>supra; </em>Code, \u00a7 152).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">But so reluctant was the court to strike out a plea setting up new matter by way of a defense, or a, special plea when properly pleaded, that it would be allowed to stand, upon a very slight suggestion of its truth (Stewart <em>v. </em>Hotchkiss, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Although the language of section 152, states that \u201csham and irrelevant answers and defenses may be stricken out,\u201d a general or specific denial of mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>rial allegations of the complaint may not be so disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The answer of the defendent, which was stricken out by the judge, at special term, as false and sham, concludes by stating,- \u201cthat except as hereinbefore admitted or denied, this defendant has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to whether or not the matters set forth in said complaint are true; and she therefore denies the same, and each and every allegation thereof, and she demands that the complaint may be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In the commencement of the answer, the defendant admits the execution by her of the bond and mortgage sought to be foreclosed. There is no other clear and unqualified admission in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The admission of the execution of the bond and mortgage, concedes that the same, with all its terms and conditions, is properly set forth in the complaint. But every other allegation is denied. While, therefore, the answer admits the allegation in the complaint \u201c that in and by said mortgage, it was provided that in case the party of the second part (the mortgagee) should effect insurance on said premises, the premiuins should be due and secured by said mortgage,\u201d it must be held to deny the allegation in the complaint that \u201c such insurance was effected by said plaintiff,\u201d and paid for by him. This is a material allegation of the complaint, and is accompanied by a claim on the plaintiff\u2019s part that in addition to the principal sum and interest secured by the mortgage, the premium for insurance is due thereon. Under such an issue, the plaintiff on the trial would be obliged to prove the payment by himself of such insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">With such a material issue formed, it is unnecessary to inquire whether or not other issues are not raised by\u00ab the defendants\u2019 denial: such as the assignment of the bond and mortgage to the plaintiff, as alleged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>complaint,- and which is claimed to be indirectly admitted, and whether or not the allegation of the defendants\u2019 default, by which plaintiff claims the whole amount of the mortgage to be due presently, is not also put in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The admission, by a defendant in his answer, of specific portions of a complaint, accompanied by a general denial of each and every other allegation, puts in issue such other allegations (Allis <em>v. </em>Leonard, 46 N. <em>Y. </em>688). We are, however, satisfied that the affirmative defense, set up in the answer, of the payment of the interest on the bond and mortgage, is false, and that this defense could have been stricken out, on the motion, as sham. The answer does not allege that this interest was paid to the plaintiff, nor does it state to whom or when paid. The affidavits used on the motion show conclusively that the interest has not been paid,- but that the money for such payment has been placed by the defendant in the hands of her counsel who argues this appeal, and that he still holds the same unapplied to such purpose, and that the receipt which defendant claims to hold for the payment of such interest is signed by her own counsel, acknowledging the receipt by him of such moneys for such purpose. This defense is clearly sham, and should not be allowed to stand. The affidavits used on the motion, on the defendant\u2019s behalf, clearly Show that these moneys have never been paid to the mortgagee, or plaintiff, or any claimant whomsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The order appealed from, strikes out the entire answer. As it contained a denial of material allegations of the complaint, this, under the authorities above cited, could not be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">But as the notice of motion, on the plaintiff \u2019 s part, asked not only for the relief granted, but also for such other or further order as might be just, and as the defendant appeals from each and every part of the order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>we can, upon this appeal, make such order as should have been granted by the judge below upon the pleadings and affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The order appealed from should be so far modified as to strike out the second defense in the answer, as sham, and that except as so modified the order appealed from be reversed, and that neither party have costs of the appeal as against the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Spetr, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
