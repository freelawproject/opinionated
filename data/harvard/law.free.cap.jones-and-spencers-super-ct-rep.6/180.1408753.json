The teas were in the bonded warehouse. We made an offer for the teas, based on the samples, and wanted to know what we could have them for. That is the custom of the trade. The broker wanted to know what we would give for the teas; we made an offer which was declined, and he named a price that would buy them ; we bought the teas.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-7\">On being asked \u201c What was said about the teas corresponding with the samples ? \u201d the plaintiff answered, \u201call I can say to that, <em>the invariable custom of the </em>trade, which they will admit there is no dispute about, the goods sold were to be equal to the sample, or else we had a right to reject them.\u201d He further testified, substantially, that it was the <em>custom of the </em>trade, to sell such goods by sample ; and that he made the purchase upon an inspection of the sample only. In answer to a question by the defendant\u2019s counsel, he testified that the broker did not say he guaranteed the tea's to be equal to the samples.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-8\">Mr. Watson, the broker, stated, in his testimony, that no representation or warranty was made or agreed to be made. That the plaintiff looked at the samples and then made the purchase.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Mr. Jacob F. </em>Miller, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-5\"><em>Mr. Henry J. </em>Scudder, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b190-6\">Monell, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3T\">The claim for relief in this case proceeds upon the assumption, that the written bill of sale contains the whole of the contract of sale and purchase, but which, through a mutual mistake of the parties, has omitted a representation or warranty, agreed upon,, previous to reducing the agreement to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">If, indeed the written paper is to be regarded as containing the whole contract of sale, then parol evidence would not be admissible, to show a warranty made orally, at the time of the sale. But where a contract is first concluded by parol, and a paper is afterwards drawn up, not as containing the terms of the contract, but as a mere memorandum or bill of parcels, parol evidence, it seems, is admissible to show the actual terms of the sale, and that there was a warranty, though it does not appear in the memorandum or receipt (Schuyler <em>v. </em>Russ, 2 <em>Caines, </em>202; Boorman <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 12 <em>Wend. </em>566 ; Hargous <em>v. </em>Stone, 5 N. <em>Y. </em>73 ; Koop <em>v. </em>Handy, 41 <em>Barb. </em>404; Boorman <em>v. </em>Jenkins, <em>sup. </em>is very much in point).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">It was a sale of cotton. The broker exhibited samples. The purchaser made an offer which was accepted. The broker made an entry of the sale and delivered a copy to the parties. It contained no warranty. Parol evidence was allowed to show the custom of the trade, and that the sale was by sample, although the memorandum of the broker was silent on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">According to the cases cited, it was unnecessary for the plaintifis to seek a reformation of the contract. They are authorized to prove the custom of the trade, and that the sale was by sample, in their action at law for the breach of the implied warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">But the plaintiffs have not brought themselves within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the rules governing courts in awarding the reformation of written contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">They have failed to show any <em>mutual </em>mistake of fact. They doubtless purchased by sample, and in view of the custom of the trade. But there was no express agreement to that effect.; nor was there any <em>express </em>wa rranty. The mere understanding of <em>one </em>of the parties, that he was d\u00e9aling in view of a custom, does not make it a mutual understanding ; nor is a mere implication of a different contract, growing out of a. custom, sufficient to authorize the court to reform the contract, by inserting in it, as an <em>express </em>warranty, what was before a mere warranty by implication, arising from a custom of trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The defendant must have judgment, as to so much of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, as demands a reformation of the contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The defendant to have the costs of this trial, if he ultimately recovers costs in the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
