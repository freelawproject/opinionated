J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">From an examination of the question which presented itself to me on the argument of the motion, I am satisfied that the court has the power to entertain a motion to set aside a sale by a sheriff of personal property under an execution. The power was and is constantly exercised by courts of equity, to avoid sales of real property (1 <em>Barb. Ch. Pr. </em>538; Kellogg <em>v. </em>Howell, 62 <em>Barb. </em>380), and, in some reported cases, it has been exercised by courts of law to avoid sales of personal property (1 <em>Burr. Pr. </em>300 ; Bixby <em>v. </em>Mead, 18 <em>Wend. </em>611). The power is recognized in the following cases (Davis <em>v. </em>Tiffany, 1 <em>Hill, </em>643; Ames <em>v. </em>Lockwood, 13 <em>How. Pr. </em>555 ; Richards <em>v. </em>Varnum, 8 <em>Id. </em>79). Ih all the cases in which the motion has been de nied, it was in the exercise of the discretion of the court and not for the want of power (Meyers <em>v. </em>Kelsey, 19 <em>J. R. </em>197; Adams <em>v. </em>Elliott, 1 <em>How. Pr. </em>239). When there are sufficient grounds, therefore, and it does not appear that any substantial right will be prejudiced by a summary examination, a motion is a proper proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>In this case there has been only a mere technical payment of the bid, and the check given by the purchaser remains in the sheriff\u2019s hands. The sale as conducted by the sheriff, was, I think, a violation of the statute in two particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\"><em>First. </em>A large portion of the property was not present and within view of those attending the sale (3 <em>JR. 8. </em>367, \u00a7 33); and</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\"><em>Second. </em>It was not sold in lots and parcels <em>(lb.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The interest of the defendant was not that of a <em>pledgor </em>/ and, therefore, the sale was not justified by <em>section </em>30 of the same statute under which the case of Tift <em>v. </em>Barton (4 Denio, 171), was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The sale should have been in such lots and parcels as was calculated to bring the highest price, subject to \u2022Jaffray\u2019s right of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">By the sale, the purchaser became the absolute owner of the property subject only to its being used by the tenant for less than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">It is very clear that the manner of selling prevented competition, and grossly sacrificed the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">The purchaser obtained property worth thirty thousand dollars for eight hundred and fifty, and he now claims also to be entitled to the rent of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">A sale, such as this, ought not to be allowed to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">The motion is granted, setting aside the sale. The order must direct the sheriff to restore to the purchaser his bid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
