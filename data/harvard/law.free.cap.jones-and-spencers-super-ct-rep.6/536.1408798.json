As to the effect of execution and sale, where the execution has issued without revival after the death of a party, there is a difference of opinion. In some of the-States they are holden to be absolutely void ; in others-only voidable. The weight of authority is that they are void \u201d <em>(Rorer on Judicial Sales, </em>p. 237, \u00a7 667). <em>(a) </em>In New York such sales are held void (Campbell <em>v. </em>Rawden, 19 <em>Barb. </em>498, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>421 ; Stymets <em>v. </em>Brooks, 10 <em>Wend. </em>207, 212). (b) There is nothing in either Jackson <em>v. </em>Delancy, 13 <em>Johns. </em>537, or Jackson <em>v. </em>Robins, 16 <em>Id. </em>537, in conflict wflth Woodcock v. Bennett. In 13 <em>Johns, </em>the regularity of the <em>scirefacias </em>was not a point in issue. In 16 <em>Johns, </em>the -chancellor makes an adverse dictum on the authority of-Heistner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>v. Fortner, (2 <em>Binncy, </em>40); but foEows it with the remark, \u201cI need not pursue this point <em>(i. e., </em>the necessity ot' a <em>sci.fa.) </em>for a <em>sci.fa. </em>did actually issue in this case.\u201d (c) The case of Heistner v. Fortner, cited by the chancellor, only decided that a judgment after one <em>nihil </em>upon a <em>scire facias post annum </em>etdiem, although irregular, can not be questioned in a collateral proceeding. <em>(d) </em>The United States supreme court held such a sale void (Erwins v. Dundas, 4 <em>How. U. S. </em>58). (e) In Illinois such sales are held void (Brown v. Parker, 15 <em>Ill. </em>307). (f) Such sales are also held void in Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana (Lucas v. Doe, 4 <em>Ala. N. S. </em>679 ; Abercrombie v. Hall, 6 <em>Id. </em>657 ; State v. Pool, 6 <em>Ire. </em>288 ; State v. Michael, 8 <em>Blackf. </em>436; Gwynn v. Latimer, 4 <em>Yerg. </em>22). (g) In New Jersey -and Pennsylvania, such a sale is held not to be void (Den v. Hilman, 2 <em>Halst. </em>180; Speer v. Sample, 4 <em>Watts. </em>374). As to those cases it must be observed: in Den y. Hilman, the execution was tested before the -death of the debtor ; and Speer v. Sample is based on the peculiar practice of the Pennsylvania courts, and on the leaning in those courts to uphold judicial sales. Of both cases, it must be observed, that the reasoning -is not so reconcilable with received legal principles as \u2022is the reasoning in the cases reaching the opposite conclusi\u00f3n. (7\u00bf) In New Hampshire, there is but a dictum that an execution issued after the death of a judgment debtor is an irregularity only and not a nullity (Butler v. Haynes, 3 <em>N. H. </em>21).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-7\">III. The Code (\u00a7 376) prescribes a substitute for a <em>scire facias. </em>Wherever it had theretofore been necessary to issue a <em>scire f ocias, </em>it is now necessary either to resort to that proceeding, or to a proceeding under .section 376 of the Code. The law of 1850, eh. 225, provides an additional preliminary to the issuance of an execution against the estate of a deceased judgment debtor, \u2022but has riot dispensed with the proceedings provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>section 376 of the Code (Marine Bank of Chicago <em>v. </em>Van Brunt, 49 <em>N. Y. </em>160; Wood <em>v. </em>Morehouse, 45 <em>Id. </em>368).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-5\">IY. Under the revised statutes where judgment is. obtained, and the defendant died before execution issued, a <em>scire facias </em>will not lie against the heirs and terre tenants until after a <em>scire facias </em>has been issued against the personal representatives of the deceased, and returned <em>nihil </em>(1 <em>Paine &lt;&amp; Duer Pr. </em>69). This practice is retained by the Code, which provides (\u00a7 376) that the personal representatives may be summoned to. show caus\u00e9 why the judgment should not be enforced within one year, and the heirs and tenants may be summoned after three years from grant of letters testamentary or of administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-6\">Y. The question is not altogether whether or not execution was void or voidable, but whether the rights-of one not a party to the judgment can be bound by an execution issued after the death of the judgment debtor,, without notice to the party sought to be affected. Hakd, J......It is said that an execution without a <em>scire facias </em>is not void, but voidabl\u00e9 only by-writ of error, and can not be questioned in a collateral suit, and till reversed is a good justification. But there is another rule, that where a person not a party to-the record derives a benefit by, or becomes chargeable to the execution of it, there must be a <em>scire facias </em>to. make him a party to the judgment (Penoyer <em>v. </em>Bruce, 1 <em>Salk. </em>319 ; 2 <em>Saund. R. </em>6, <em>n. </em>1; <em>Id. </em>72, <em>n. </em>4 ; Woodcock <em>v. </em>Bennett, 1 <em>Cow. </em>611). And where judgment is. revived against real estate by writ of <em>scire facias </em>by our statute, the right of any person therein not made a. party to the writ, shall not be impaired or affected by such revival (Campbell <em>v. </em>Rawdon, 19 <em>Barb. </em>498).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-8\">Yl. The Revised Statutes provide, that \u201c where-any judgment or recovery shall be revived against any real estate by writ of <em>scire facias, </em>the right of any person therein, not made a party to such suit, shall not be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>impaired or affected by such revival, unless he claim title from the tenant of such real estate, who was duly made a party thereto\u201d <em>(2 Rev. Stat. 577, </em>\u00a7 5). This provision is new. Reviser\u2019s Reports and \u00a1Notes (3 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>2nd edit. 786). Opinion of Allbx J., in Campbell <em>v. </em>Rawdon, printed in the points, volume V., of' the Court of Appeals Cases, <em>(a) </em>The legislature passing this statute intended that execution should not be had upon the lands of a deceased judgment debtor without a <em>scire facias, </em>to which all persons having an interest and intended to be affected thereby must be made parties by a service of the writ upon them. Com-stock, J. (Campbell <em>v. </em>Rawdon, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>421).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-5\">VII. The case of The Bank of Genesee v. Spencer (18 <em>N. Y. </em>150) is not in point. There one of several defendants died after judgment, and the execution was against the survivors. In such a case no <em>scire facias</em>was necessary. For \u201cwhere there are two or more plaintiffs or defendants in a personal action, and one or more of them die after judgment, execution may be had within the two years for or against the survivors, without a <em>scire facias, </em>but the execution in such a ease should be taken out in the joint names of all the plaintiffs or defendants, otherwise it will not be warranted by the judgment\u201d (1 <em>Paine &amp; Duer Pr. </em>66; citing numerous authorities), <em>(a) </em>Bank of Genesee <em>v. </em>Spencer only decides that an execution issued after the time limited for issuing without leave, the parties being alive, is an irregularity merely. This is conceded by the appellant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-6\"><em>James P. Sinnott, </em>in person, and <em>Wm. W. Niles, </em>of counsel for respondent,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYh\">submitted an elaborate .brief, from which the following points are selected ;\u2014I. Section 295 of act of 1850, authorizes a sale of the real estate of a .deceased judgment debtor on which the judgment was a lien at his death, upon an.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u2022execution issued on said judgment, without any further proceedings, provided permission to issue the execution is first obtained from the surrogate. In this case such permission was obtained. The surrogate acquired jurisdiction to grant the leave upon the presentation of the petition. He is presumed to know the <em>status </em>of the estate, and to be able to judge of the sufficiency of the cause to be shown, in any particular case. \u201c The jurisdiction of the surrogate,\u201d says the learned judge, in the Marine Bank of Chicago <em>v. </em>Van Brunt, \u201cwas improperly exercised ;\u201d an expression which admits its existence; for no one can improperly or otherwise exercise a power which he has not already acquired. The petition presented to the surrogate showed, <em>prima </em>facie, sufficient cause for the issue of the execution. It showed the judgment, the previous execution returned unsatisfied, the lien\u2014for it must be borne in mind that the existence of the lien, at the time of the application to the. surrogate is unquestionable, that application having been made within the ten years,\u2014 the inhabitancy of the judgment debtor at the time of his decease, and the fact that the judgment remained unpaid. \u201c When the proof has a legal tendency to make out a proper case, in all its parts, for issuing the process,\u201d says Jewitt, C. J., \u201cthen, although the proof may be slight and inconclusive, the process will be valid until it is set aside by a direct proceeding for that purpose\u201d (Staples <em>v. </em>Fairchild, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>46 ; Skinnion <em>v. </em>Kelley, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>356 ; Van Alstyne <em>v. </em>Erwine, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>340; Rusher <em>v. </em>Sherman, 28 <em>Barb. </em>417; Miller v. Brinkerhoff, 4 <em>Den. </em>119; Den <em>v. </em>Turner, 5 <em>Wheat. </em>541; Buf. and St. Line R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Erie, 48 <em>N. Y. </em>100). Ho order which a court is empowered, under any circumstances, to make, can be treated as a nullity, merely becanse it was made improvidently, or in a manner not warranted by law \u2022or the previous state of the case. The only question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>in such case is,\u2014had the court or tribunal the power, under any circumstances, to make the order or perform the act? (Talmane v. McCarthy, 11 <em>Wis. </em>406 ; Grignon\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Astor, <em>2 How. (U. S.) </em>340; Harvey <em>v. </em>Tyler, <em>2 Wall. </em>343; Voorhies <em>v. </em>Bank of the United States, 10 <em>Pet. </em>449 ; Cooper <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 10 <em>Wall. </em>309). In considering this question, we must bear in mind that the proceedings before the surrogate were not intended to obtain personal judgments against any person. The judgment had been pronounced, and had become <em>a lien </em>on the land. The proceedings were merely to enforce the lien against that land. It was a <em>quasi </em>proceeding <em>in rein. </em>It is true that the legal title to these lands had devolved upon the heirs ; but heirs are not <em>bona fide </em>purchasers. They take lands <em>cum </em>onere\u2014charged with the payment of judgments, and subject to be sold to satisfy the same. How, the method of satisfying a judgment is by execution, and that execution directs the sheriff to satisfy the judgment out of the property, in whose hands soever the same may be. If the judgment debtor had, in his lifetime, given a deed of this property, the legal title to it would have rested completely in the grantee, justas completely as it devolved upon his heirs by his death. Yet the creditor would not be bound to notify or summon that grantee, before subjecting the property by execution to pay a judgment which remained a lien upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-5\">II. Counsel for appellant insists that the heirs must be summoned under section 376 of the Code. To sustain this he cites Wood <em>v. </em>Morehouse (45 <em>N. Y. </em>368), and Marine Bank of Chicago <em>v. </em>Van Brunt (49 <em>N. Y. </em>160). In the case of the Marine Bank of Chicago <em>v. </em>Van Brunt, the order to show cause upon which the execution was set aside was made in the original suit; and it required the plaintiff, and also the assignee of the judgment sought to be enforced, to show cause why the execution therein, and all proceedings subsequent <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the judgment \u201c should not be set aside on the ground of irregularity,\u201d because the execution was issued without any proper order of the surrogate, and without any notice to the representatives of the defendant, &amp;c. The motion was granted, and an order made, that' the execution issued, as stated, to the Sheriff, \u201c be and the same is hereby set aside as irregular.\u201d The assignee of the judgment appealed to the general term, and to the Court of Appeals, in succession, but the order was affirmed by each tribunal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-5\">The learned .judge who delivered the opinion concludes with these words: \u201cWood v. Morehouse (45 <em>N. Y. </em>368), Alden v. Clark (11 <em>How. Pr. </em>209), and Frink v. Morrison (13 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>80), presented the same question as that before us, and were decided in accordance with the views already expressed.\u2019 \u2019 So that the Court off Appeals intended, by this decision, to go no further than the Supreme Court had already done, and it commends, to us the cases of Frink v. Morrison and Alden v. Clark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-6\">The cases so commended and followed are, in our judgment, and, as we submit, irreconcilable with the view contended for by the appellant here. Although the learned Judge also mentions the case of Woody. Morehouse, the reference to the latter is not strictly accurate, because that case arose upon an execution issued in 1848, and before the passage of the act off 1850. Besides, the point decided in that case was, that an execution issued in the life-time of the judgment, debtor might be executed after his death, and a sale under such an execution was upheld. The defendant here has no cause to quarrel with that view of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-7\">Judge Allen, in the Van Brunt case, says : \u201c The act of 1850 is not in conflict with the provisions (using: the plural) of the Code, or inconsistent with the remedy given by it. It is cumulative, and adds another restraint to those already existing\u201d (40 N. <em>Y. </em>163).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-9\">That the learned Judge did not, by this language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>mean that heirs, &amp;c., must in all cases of the death of their ancestor with judgments standing against him, be summoned, is quite obvious on a comparison of section 376, with the act of 1850. Section 376 allows the summons to be issued only after the expiration of three years from the time of granting letters testamentary or of administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-5\">The act of 1850 allows an execution to issue at any time after the expiration of one year from the death, and notwithstanding that no letters testamentary or of administration have been issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-6\">The act of 1850 is only \u201ccumulative\u201d (which in. this connection is a very infelicitous expression), in the sense that it provides for the permission of'the surrogate being given before execution issued, whereas, previously the whole matter rested with the court of law alone. It is in that sense that it is \u201can additional restraint to those already existing,\u201d and in no other sense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-7\">This will be made clearly apparent by referring to-the case of Alden \u00ab. Clark, cited by the Judge with approval, and decided by a court of which he was a. member.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-8\">The two provisions of law are not \u201cin conflict,\u201d for the very simple reason that each has its own sphere of operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-9\">III. Even under the old system, when the formal proceedings by <em>scire facias </em>were especially required by law, the better opinion is, that an execution issued without it, after the death of the judgment debtor, would not be void, but only voidable. For this we have the great authority of Chancellor Kest, and his views upon that point have never been overruled in this State, although in one case (1 <em>Cow. </em>711) a contrary opinion has been expressed (Jackson <em>v. </em>Delancy, 13 <em>John. </em>537; Jackson <em>v. </em>Robins 16 <em>Id. </em>537; 3 Caines, 270; 8 <em>John. </em>365 ; Heister <em>v. </em>Fortner, 2 Binney, 40; Ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>nett v. Hamill, <em>2 Scole &amp; </em>Lefroy, 566). Again it is said that the word voidable implies that there is somebody who can avoid the process. But if real estate descends to an heir, charged by matter of public record with the lien of a judgment, and it is proposed to sell it under a voidable process, is not the heir capable, and is not his plain duty to prevent the execution of that process, or to set aside and avoid it afterwards? \u201cEvery person,\u201d says Mullir, J., \u201cwhose rights are injuriously affected by a judgment, or proceedings under it, has the right to move the court to set aside or amend them, although he is not a party to the action \u201d (Glould <em>v. </em>Mortimer, 16 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>448).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-5\">IY. But whatever may be the rule under the former-practice, I insist that, under the act of 1850, it is impossible to maintain the invalidity of this process on the technical and artificial grounds .urged against executions issued without a <em>scire facias. </em>Some effect must be given to the act above mentioned. The learned judge, in Alden v. Clark, says \u201cit was intended to provide a more simple and expeditious mode than previously existed for the enforcement of judgment liens against the property of deceased judgment debtor. ' The act itself says that, notwithstanding the death, the execution may be issued in the same manner and with the \u25a0same effect as if the judgment debtor were still living,\u201d provided only that the permission of the surrogate be \u2022obtained. The learned judge, above referred to, refused costs because the practice was entirely unsettled. How much so this is, is well illustrated by the fact that twelve years after this opinion was rendered, the Broome county general term, consisting of three very eminent judges, held that an application to the court was not necessary at all, and that the order of the surrogate was sufficient to authorize the execution. And still another year later, Mr. Justice Mullir held the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>thing, and dissented from the case of Alden y, Clark. Logical-minded men found it hard to nullify the plain language of the act of 150 (Vide:\u2014Wilgus v. Bloodgood, 33 <em>How. </em>Pr., 289 ; Flanagan v. Tinin, 37 <em>How. Pr., </em>130). It certainly will be a great hardship if, for an alleged mistake in a matter of practice so unsettled, that the costs of a motion were refused, and which accorded with the views of some of the most eminent jurists of this state\u2014and it will be seen by the case that the proceedings here were conducted by the present Mr. Justice Gilbert\u2014a man\u2019s estate should be confiscated. The courts take judicial notice of an unsettled condition of the law, and resolve all possible doubts in favor of parties acquiring property in reliance upon their decisions for the time being (Robb v. Irwin, 15 <em>Ohio, </em>689; Snevely v. Lowe, 18 <em>Id. </em>368).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-6\">V. But this case is distinguishable from Marine Bank of Chicago v. Van Brunt for another and very important reason, the force of which was recognized by Mr. Justice In graham in the latter case. It is this\u2014 In the Van Brunt case no execution had been issued during the lifetime of the deceased judgment debtor. In this case such execution was issued and returned wholly unsatisfied. In delivering the opinion upon the motion from which the appeal in the Van Brunt case arose, Mr. Justice Ihg-raham expressly states that where an execution has been o,nce issued, within five years after judgment, in the lifetime of the judgment debtor, no application to the court is necessary to sustain the second execution, issued after his death, but in such case the permission of the surrogate is alone sufficient. Although the court of appeals do not make their, decision turn on that point, neither do they expressly repudiate it; and we are desirous to be heard before them on that point without being considered foreclosed by their mere silence. Under the old system there was no doubt of this principle, so far as goods and chattels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>were concerned. An alias and pluries might be issued. The record was considered continued down. There is nothing, founded in sound sense or good reason, which makes real estate, under the Code, any less subject to be sold on execution than personal property.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b556-5\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9Y\">Oliver Johnston is the common source of title of each of the parties to this action. The plaintiff claims as his heir-at-law, and the defendant under a judgment recovered against Johnston in his life-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The judgment absolutely abated by the death of Johnston, and could not be enforced against his property without the institution of certain proceedings provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Until the adoption of the code of procedure, a resort was had to the writ of <em>scire </em>facias, to summon the representatives or heirs of the deceased debtor, to show cause why the judgment should not be executed. The same proceeding, and for the same purpose, is now in the form of a summons prescribed by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The proceeding is substantially the same under either form. The representatives or heirs are to be summoned, and the party summoned may answer, denying the judgment, or setting up any defense which may have arisen subsequent to the judgment (Code, \u00a7 379 ; 2 <em>BurrilV s Pr. </em>167). Upon default of the persons summoned to appear and answer, or upon the determination of the issue made by their answer, a formal judgment that the plaintiff have execution, is entered ; and the execution is issued upon <em>that </em>judgment (2 <em>Burrill's </em>Pr. 171; 3 <em>Id. </em>114), commanding the amount to be made of the real estate of the deceased debtor (2 <em>R. 8. </em>367, \u00a7 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">No proceeding of this nature was instituted to revive the judgment against the heirs of Johnston, and, it is now claimed, none was necessary, inasmuch as the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of 1850 <em>(Sess. Laws, </em>1850, <em>Oh. </em>295, \u00a7 1), which provides a different and more summary mode, must be regarded as in effect repealing the proceeding required by the \u2022Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The act referred to is as follows: Section 1. Notwithstanding the death of a party after judgment, execution thereon against any property, lands, tenements, real estate, or chattels real, upon which such judgment shall be a lien, either at law or in equity, maybe issued and executed in the same manner, and with the same effect, as if he were still living, except that such execution cannot be issued within a year after the death of the defendant, nor in any case, unless upon permission \u25a0granted by the surrogate of the county who has jurisdiction to grant administration, or letters testamentary, on the estate of the deceased judgment debtor, which surrogate may, on sufficient cause shown, make an \u25a0order granting permission to issue such execution as \u2022afoiesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">It is enough to say of this statute, that the decisions are uniform, that it does not repeal, nor in any manner affect, the provision of the Code, except that it reduces the period after the death of the debtor to one year (Alden <em>v. </em>Clark, 11 <em>How. Pr. </em>209 ; Frink <em>v. </em>Morrison 13 <em>Abb. </em>80; Wood v. Morehouse, 45 N. <em>Y. </em>368; Marine Bank v. Van Brunt, 49 <em>Id. </em>160). In the last cited \u2022case, the court say the act is merely cumulative, and adds another restraint to those already existing, but that an execution can not issue without the order and permission of both tribunals. Under these decisions, the issuance of the execution upon the abated judgment was irregular and voidable. And this brings us to the question of real difficulty in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">It is claimed that the omission to summon the heirs and the issuing of the execution without a revival of the judgment, was a mere irregularity, and does not affect the title of the purchaser under the sheriff s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>In none of the cases cited, except one, did the question arise otherwise than upon a motion for leave to-issue, or to set aside the execution already issued. And in deciding those cases it was not necessary to go farther than to hold that an execution could not be issued in such cases without a resort to the substituted proceeding for <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">But in Wood v. Morehouse <em>(supra) </em>the action was by the heirs-at-law to redeem the property from a mortgage which had been a lien upon it before it descended to them, and which had been foreclosed without giving them notice. The defendants claimed in opposition to the heirs, under a judgment against their ancestor. Before his death an execution had been issued upon-, the judgment, under which the sheriff had advertised the saie ; but before the time required had expired, the-judgment debtor died. Nevertheless, the sheriff proceeded with the sale, and gave a deed to the purchaser,, under whom the defendants held. The court say: \u201c Process having been issued for the collection of the judgment by the sale of the real property of the judgment debtor, <em>and its execution </em>commenced, by an advertisement of the mortgaged premises for sale, in pursuance of the statute, the execution of the process-was not arrested by the death of the judgment debtor. But an execution cannot be issued after his death which, will <em>authorize </em>the sale of the real estate which may be-bound by the judgment. An execution cannot be sued out against heirs or terre tenants, without giving them an opportunity to be heard. The judgment must be-revived against them. The rule is, that when a, new person, who was not a party to a judgment, desires a benefit by, or becomes chargeable to, the execution, there must be a <em>scire facias to make him a party to the </em>judgment, before execution can issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In that case the purchasers at the sale had purchased for a valuable consideration, in good faith, and without-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>notice, or knowledge that the notice of sale had not been posted the time required by law. But the decision is not put upon the ground that the character of the purchase afforded a protection, except perhaps so far as he might claim protection under the presumption that an officer required to do an act had done it; but upon the ground that the execution of the process had already commenced <em>before </em>the judgment debtor\u2019s death,, and, therefore, no revival of the judgment was necessary. But the language of the learned court is clear, that to <em>authorize a sale </em>the judgment must be revived, if the death occurs before execution issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The validity of a title derived under a sheriff\u2019s sale depends upon the validity of the judgment, and of the execution upon it, and one claiming title under such a sale must show the judgment, and that it is regular (Townshend v. Wesson, 4 Duer, 342). Without a valid judgment an execution would not authorize a sale, and. the proceeding would be void <em>(Ibid).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We have seen that a proceeding to revive a judgment against the heirs of a deceased debtor, requires a new judgment to be entered, upon which, and as it seems upon which alone, an execution can issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">If, therefore, a party defending his title under a purchase at a sheriff\u2019s sale must show a valid judgment (Townshend <em>v. </em>Wesson, <em>supra) </em>to sustain the execution in an ordinary case, must he not also show, when he claims under a judgment which has abated by the death of the debtor, that the new judgment required by law has been obtained ?</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">To sustain the sale in this case would open it to the constitutional objection, that no person shall be-deprived of property without due process of law. The heirs of Johnston inherited his property. They took an absolute title in fee simple, <em>cum onere </em>of course, and of such title they could not be divested, except through the forms and by the proceedings prescribed by law-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In those proceedings they had the right to be heard. They conld make a variety of defenses. They could show the judgment had been paid ; that it should be satisfied out of the personalty, if there was sufficient (2 <em>R. S. </em>87, \u00a7 27); or that other real property upon which the judgment was a lien should contribute or be subjected to it. And it was in view of these various defenses that, as is said in Marine Bank <em>v. </em>Van Brunt <em>(ubi supra), </em>the act of 1850 was passed so that th'e surrogate could properly adjust the equities, which a court of law is unable to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Even, therefore, if it could be held that the act of 1850 provided the only proceeding required to revive a judgment, the constitutional objection I have stated, would, in my judgment, render the act void. It authorizes an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding to deprive a person of his property. It requires no notice to be given, nor affords any opportunity to the person, who is to be despoiled of his property, to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The inevitable deduction from all this is, that the omission to revive the judgment in the manner provided by law, rendered the execution and the sale under it, not irregular and voidable merely, but absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">And there is authority for the deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In Woodcock <em>v. </em>Bennett (1 <em>Cow. </em>711), the validity -of such a sale was directly involved, and the court held, that without a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the judgment against the heirs, the execution was void. Justice Woodworth says (p. 740): \u201cTo sanction such a proceeding, would be an invasion of one of the great principles upon which our security depends under a government of laws ; that no person shall be put out of his freehold, or lose his goods or chattels, unless he be -duly brought to answer, or be forejudged of the same by due course of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">In Stymets <em>v. </em>Brooks (10 <em>Wend. </em>207) Nelson, J., says (p. 214): \u201cOn the death of the defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>real estate descends to Ms heirs, and to allow execution to be afterwards issued and the lands sold, would he affecting the rights of new parties, without an opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">And in Campbell <em>v. </em>Rawdon (19 <em>Barb. </em>494), approved by the Court of Appeals (18 <em>N. Y. R,. </em>421), one of the heirs had not been served with the <em>scire </em>facias, and the court held, that under the statute (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>577, \u00a7 5) as well as by the authority of decisions, his title and interest was not affected or divested. The Court of Appeals s\u00e1y: \u201cWe think the legislature, in passing this statute, intended that execution should not be had upon the lands of a deceased judgment debtor, without a <em>scire </em>facias, to which all persons having an interest and intended to be affected thereby, must be made parties by service of the writ upon them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The distinction which the respondent\u2019s counsel claim was legitimate, from the fact that an execution had been issued upon the judgment before the death of the \u2022debtor, and returned unsatisfied, is not allowed by any of the cases I have referred to. The right to issue a second execution without leave of the court applies only to cases where no revival of the judgment is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Section 284 of the code does not supersede or defeat section 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The view we have taken of the act of 1850, and of the insufficiency of the surrogate\u2019s order under it, to validate the sale, and as a consequence invalidate the -plaintiff\u2019s title, renders the question whether the plaintiff had notice of the proceeding before the surrogate immaterial. If, however, there was notice, it was with the defendant to show it, and the referee has found that there was no proof of any such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The remaining objection that the suit is not brought in the name of the proper plaintiff, requires no exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>nation, as the referee has decided otherwise and the-defendant has not excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Upon the whole case we are brought to the conclusion that the decision of the referee was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We are aware that the defendant has acted in good \u2022 faith, and has paid a valuable consideration for the land, in the belief that the title was good. To Mm it is a great hardship and loss, but that can not be measured against the vindication of the law and the rights of other parties, who stand equally innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to the appellant to abide the event\u00bb. Order of reference also vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Sedgwick and Speie, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
