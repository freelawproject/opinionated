On appeal, Norrell raises three issues: (1) whether the district court erred as a matter of law when it instructed the jury that knowledge under \u00a7 1470 may be established if Norrell believed that the person to whom he attempted to transfer obscene matter was under 16 years old; (2) whether the district court clearly erred in applying a seven-level enhancement to Norrell\u2019s base offense level for conduct intended to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; and (3) whether Norrell\u2019s 42-month sentence, which was within the advisory Guidelines range, was proeedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal correctness of a jury instruction. <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cGenerally, district courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions provided that the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). And \u201cwe will not reverse a conviction on the basis of a jury charge unless the issues of law were presented inaccurately, or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-17\">Norrell argues that the district court\u2019s jury instruction constructively modified the indictment by changing an essential element of the charged offense under \u00a7 1470. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-18\">Section 1470 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-19\">Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly transfers obscene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>matter to another individual who has not attained the age of 16 years, knowing that such other individual has not attained the age of 16 years, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1470. The district court\u2019s instruction relating the elements needed to convict under \u00a7 1470 tracked the language of the statute. (Doc. 70 at 8). But Nor-rell\u2019s challenge relates to the court\u2019s charge concerning \u201cproof of knowledge,\u201d which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-6\">When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an essential part of an offense, <em>such knowledge may be established if the Defendant believed that the fact existed. </em>If you find that the Defendant did not actually believe the fact existed, you cannot find that the Defendant had the requisite knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">(Doc. 70 at 15) (emphasis added). He argues the court erroneously instructed the jury that proof of a defendant\u2019s belief is sufficient to establish his knowledge. Therefore, the issue before us is whether the district court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cknowing\u201d in \u00a7 1470 was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Importantly, Norrell was charged with attempt under \u00a7 1470, so we consider this issue as it relates to an inchoate offense under the statute. Other circuits have determined that a defendant\u2019s belief that he was transferring obscene material to a person under the age of 16 was sufficient to support an attempt conviction under \u00a7 1470. <em>See United States v. Rudzavice, </em>586 F.3d 310, 313-14 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Spurlock, </em>495 F.3d 1011, 1013 (8th Cir.2007). This reasoning is consistent with our decision in <em>United States v. Root, </em>296 F.3d 1222 (11th Cir.2002), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in United States v. Jerchower, </em>631 F.3d 1181, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2011). In <em>Root, </em>we reviewed a conviction for knowingly attempting to persuade a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), and we concluded that \u201can actual minor victim is not required for an attempt conviction\u201d under that statute. <em>Id. </em>at 1223, 1227. We explained, \u201cRoot\u2019s belief that a minor was involved is sufficient to sustain an attempt conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227; <em>see also United States v. Bauer, </em>626 F.3d 1004, 1007-08 (8th Cir.2010) (considering defendant\u2019s conviction for attempted receipt of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A, and concluding, \u201c[t]he stipulated facts demonstrate that Bauer believed that he was communicating with a fourteen-year-old girl and intended to receive pornographic images of her. Bauer\u2019s undisputed belief that his victim was a minor satisfies the \u2018knowingly\u2019 requirement of the statute\u201d); <em>United States v. Cot\u00e9, </em>504 F.3d 682, 687-88 (7th Cir.2007) (\u201cIn a criminal attempt, a defendant who believes certain requisite facts to be true has the necessary intent for a crime requiring the <em>mens rea </em>of \u2018knowledge.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Norrell was charged with attempt under \u00a7 1470; therefore, the district court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cknowing\u201d as encompassing Norrell\u2019s \u201cbelief\u2019 was consistent with the statutory language and the indictment. Accordingly, the court did not err when it charged the jury regarding proof of Norrell\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">We review a district court\u2019s factual finding as to whether a defendant qualifies for a sentencing enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007). Section 2G3.1(b)(1)(E) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a seven-level enhancement if the offense involved \u201c[distribution to a minor that was intended to persuade, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G3.1(b)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The record evidence supports a finding that Norrell\u2019s communications\u2014 both the statements he made and the images he transmitted \u2014 were intended to entice \u201ckatielil92\u201d to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. For example, Norrell proposed meeting \u201ckatielil92,\u201d suggested how she might deceive her mother to keep them meeting a secret, and explained what he would do to and with \u201ckatielil92\u201d if they were to meet. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Norrell qualified for the seven-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that it was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Our reasonableness review involves a two-step process: first, we evaluate the sentence for procedural error; and second, we evaluate the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">In our procedural analysis, we consider whether the district court correctly calculated the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), chose a sentence based on facts that were not clearly erroneous, and explained the sentence adequately, including any deviation from the Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>To determine substantive reasonableness, we consider whether the district court acted within its discretion in determining the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported the chosen sentence and then justified any substantial deviation from the applicable Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201c \u2018The weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court,\u2019 and \u2018we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted)) (alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Norrell\u2019s 42-month sentence is reasonable. The sentence is procedurally reasonable because the district court appropriately considered the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and thoroughly explained the reasons for imposing the sentence it did. And the sentence was substantively reasonable because the district court acted within its discretion in applying the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
