California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Montoya has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. Counsel\u2019s brief substantially complies in most respects with the standards set forth in <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). However, we note that counsel\u2019s examination of whether the district court properly determined Montoya\u2019s advisory sentencing range in light of the contested findings made relative to her offense level fails to include citations to relevant legal authority. Ordinarily, counsel should cite not only to the applicable Sentencing Guideline and to those portions of the record which support the district court\u2019s findings, but also to pertinent case law in support of the Guideline adjustments. Nevertheless, in light of our review of counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record, we concur with counsel\u2019s ultimate assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
