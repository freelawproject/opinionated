California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no issues of arguable merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the order revoking Toodle\u2019s supervised release, and imposing a two-year term of imprisonment to be followed by a three-year term of additional supervised release, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
