The district court denied Pitchon\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) and dismissed his complaint under the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-21\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), a prisoner may not proceed IFP in a civil action or in an appeal of a judgment in a civil action if the prisoner has, on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated, brought an action or appeal that was dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. The determination whether a prisoner is under \u201cimminent danger\u201d must be made at the time the prisoner seeks to file his suit in district court or to proceed with his appeal, or when he files a motion to proceed IFP. <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 885 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">The record shows that Pitchon has accumulated three qualifying dismissals of civil complaints as frivolous and is unable to make a showing that he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. Pitchon has failed to show that he should be allowed to proceed IFP on appeal under \u00a7 1915(g). Pitchon\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The appeal of the judgment of the district court presents no nonfrivolous issues, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
