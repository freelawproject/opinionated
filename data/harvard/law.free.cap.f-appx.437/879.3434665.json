On appeal, Murni argues that the district court mistakenly applied a sophisticated means sentencing enhancement to his sentence by creating a <em>per se </em>rule that the use of a shell corporation in the commission of a fraud was sophisticated means. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">We review a district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact related to the imposition of sentencing enhancements, including a finding that the defendant used sophisticated means, for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). However, we review \u201cany rulings of law made by the district court in conjunction with the sophisticated means enhancement <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Barakat, 130 F.3d 1448, 1456 </em>(11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">Sophisticated means are defined as \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense ... Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts also ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) &amp; cmt. n. 8(B). A sophisticated means enhancement does not require every action taken in furtherance of the fraud be sophisticated, but rather that the \u201ctotality of the scheme was sophisticated.\u201d <em>Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">Here, the record shows that the district court did not rule based solely on the existence of a shell corporation and instead properly considered the totality of the scheme. The court specifically noted: (1) the registration of the fictitious company, Sea Fuels Trading (\u201cSFT\u201d); (2) the opening of a bank account for SFT; (3) the use of separate addresses in those two transactions; (4) Murni\u2019s application as SFT to be a fuel supplier for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines (\u201cRCCL\u201d); (5) the use of a false address, the creation of company officers, and the use of his son\u2019s social security number for a false officer in that application; (6) the actual conduct that Murni undertook as SFT once the application was granted \u2014 buying cheaper fuel from competitors, sometimes with cashier\u2019s checks and sometimes in the amounts of hundreds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>of thousands of dollars, and then billing RCCL for the fuel as SFT at an inflated price; and (7) the fact that this scheme \u201cwas repeated over 100 times.\u201d The record therefore fails to show a <em>per se </em>rule, as it indicates that a shell corporation was not the sole factor in the district court\u2019s decision and does not hint that a shell corporation alone would be enough to warrant a sentence enhancement in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">Nor does the record reveal that the imposition of the sophisticated means enhancement constituted clear error. The Guidelines note that hiding assets or transactions through the use of a corporate shell \u201cordinarily indicates sophisticated means,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 8(B), and given the number of factors the district court considered in properly applying the totality of the scheme test, we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a mistake in its analysis. Murni has not met his burden to show clear error, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
