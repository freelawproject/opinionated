Poydras contends that he filed his complaint as a \u00a7 1983 proceeding because there was an attempt on his life in prison when he filed a postconviction proceeding. Poydras asserts that hypnosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>should not be allowed as an investigative tool in order to make citizens guilty of crimes. Poydras also makes the allegation that \u201cthe district attorney went into the jury room during deliberations and threatened to kill [the jury] and their families if they did not vote guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">By moving to proceed IFP, Poydras is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Poydras, however, does not challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that his \u00a7 1983 action was frivolous and failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, Poydras\u2019s assertions only confirm the district court\u2019s certification decision that Poydras\u2019s complaint is frivolous on its face. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Poydras has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). His IFP motion is therefore denied, and his appeal is dismissed. See <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; <em>see </em>also 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Poydras\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied as well. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Poydras is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
