In his complaint, Jallali claimed that the Secretary failed to perform his duty by not investigating and resolving Jallali\u2019s allegations that Nova acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to issue him a degree. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion and dismissed Jalla-li\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">On appeal, Jallali argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because his claims were not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. He explains that state court litigation addressed whether Nova had acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in refusing to issue him a medical degree; it did not implicate the Secretary\u2019s duties to enforce the student loan Program Participation Agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d) between Nova and the DOE. Jallali concedes that he has no private right to enforce the PPA. Instead, he argues that he has the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>make a written complaint to the Secretary or the DOE regarding a participating institution\u2019s compliance with the PPA, and that the Secretary has a duty to investigate such a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">We may affirm on any ground supported by the record, regardless of whether the district court relied upon or considered that ground below. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Edwards v. Prime, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir.2010). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings filed by lawyers and, thus, are construed liberally. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Although the district court did not address jurisdictional issues in dismissing Jallali\u2019s complaint, we must examine whether the district court had jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Alabama, </em>791 F.2d 1450, 1454 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Norton, </em>324 F.3d 1229, 1240 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThe subject matter jurisdiction of the district court is a question of law and, therefore, subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>956 F.2d 1098, 1101 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">In his complaint, Jallali cited the APA as authority for granting relief, but the APA does not provide an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). Rather, the federal question statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, confers jurisdiction on federal courts to review agency action. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 97 S.Ct. 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The APA provides that \u201c[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. A valid APA claim must challenge \u201cagency action,\u201d which includes \u201cthe whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(13). The APA provides, in pertinent part, that a reviewing court shall: \u201c(1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and (2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law....\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1), (2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">\u201cIf the claim challenges a failure to act, it falls under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1), which allows courts to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d <em>Fanin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>572 F.3d 868, 877 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). A court may take action pursuant to \u00a7 706(1) only where \u201c \u2018an agency failed to take a <em>discrete </em>agency action that it is <em>required to take.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 877-78 <em>(quoting Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, </em>542 U.S. 55, 64, 124 S.Ct. 2373, 159 L.Ed.2d 137 (2004)). A \u201cfailure to act\u201d does not include a \u201cdenial.\u201d <em>S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, </em>542 U.S. at 63, 124 S.Ct. 2373.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">\u201cIf the claim attacks an agency\u2019s action, instead of its failure to act, and the statute allegedly violated does not provide a private right of action, then the \u2018agency action\u2019 must also be a \u2018final agency action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fanin, </em>572 F.3d at 877 (quoting \u00a7 704). To be considered final, an agency\u2019s action (1) \u201cmust mark the consummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process\u201d; and (2) \u201cmust be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Parks, </em>324 F.3d at 1236 (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>marks omitted). Federal jurisdiction is lacking \u201cwhen the administrative action in question is not \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">In his complaint, Jallali claimed that the Secretary failed to perform his duty by refusing to investigate and resolve Jallali\u2019s allegations regarding Nova\u2019s refusal to award him a degree; thus, Jallali asked the court to enter a declaratory judgment and issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Secretary to act. Because Jallali challenged an agency action, <em>ie., </em>the DOE\u2019s denial of his request to investigate his claims, Jallali\u2019s APA claim falls under \u00a7 706(2). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (providing that a reviewing court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law....\u201d). While this agency action appears to be the end of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking regarding Jallali\u2019s administrative complaint, the action is not one \u201cby which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\u201d <em>See Nat\u2019l Parks, </em>324 F.3d at 1236. The DOE\u2019s letter merely informed Jallali that it did not have authority to give him the relief that he requested; it did not otherwise affect his legal rights or interests. Therefore, the agency action is not \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of the APA. Moreover, Jallali has provided no legal authority for his contention that the DOE was obligated or empowered to order Nova to award him a degree. Therefore, to the extent that he sought to bring a claim under \u00a7 706(1) based on the DOE\u2019s failure to act, his claim fails because there was no legally required agency action. <em>See S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, </em>542 U.S. at 64, 124 S.Ct. 2373.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Because the agency action that Jallali challenged was not \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201crequired\u201d for purposes of the APA, the district court lacked jurisdiction over his complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-5\">. Jallali also challenges the district court\u2019s limitation of discovery prior to its ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. In light of the district court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over Jallali\u2019s complaint, we need not consider his challenge to the court's limitation of discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
