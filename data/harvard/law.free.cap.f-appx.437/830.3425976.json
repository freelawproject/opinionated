Huls, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal of his complaint \u2014 which alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and Florida state law \u2014 for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Huls\u2019s claims arise from state court proceedings following his 2002 divorce. In 2003, the state court held Huls in contempt for willfully failing to abide by the terms of the divorce, including the provision of health insurance benefits for his two minor children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2005, Huls\u2019s ex-wife, through her lawyer Lusan Llabona, filed another motion for contempt and enforcement of the terms of the divorce. The state court held Huls in contempt and ordered him imprisoned for 180 days, or until he paid his past-due child support obligations. Huls ultimately spent 27 days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">Huls then filed the instant complaint against Llabona, individually, and her professional service corporation, Lusan C. Llabona, P.A. In his complaint, he argued that Llabona intentionally misrepresented the content of the state court\u2019s 2003 order, making it appear that he had violated it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He contended that Llabona\u2019s conduct violated his federal civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and various Florida statutes and state bar rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">The district court granted Llabona\u2019s motion to dismiss, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The Court concluded that Huls\u2019s claims\u2014 federal and state \u2014 were barred by Florida\u2019s litigation privilege and that Llabona was not acting under color of law for purposes of section 1983. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Mills v. Foremost Ins. Co., </em>511 F.3d 1300, 1303 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>(11th Cir.2008). In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">On appeal, Huls argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He asserts correctly \u2014 and Llabona concedes \u2014 that the district court erred in applying Florida\u2019s litigation privilege to his section 1983 claim. <em>See Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 U.S. 356, 110 S.Ct. 2430, 2442-43, 110 L.Ed.2d 332 (1990) (providing that \u201c \u2018[c]onduct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 ... cannot be immunized by state law.\u2019 \u201d). Nevertheless, the district court properly dismissed Huls\u2019s section 1983 claim based on its conclusion that Llabona did not act under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">To prevail on a claim under section 1983, Huls had to demonstrate that he was deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or federal law and that such deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. <em>Harvey v. Harvey, </em>949 F.2d 1127, 1130 (11th Cir.1992). For a person to act \u201cunder color of state law,\u201d her acts must be \u201cfairly attributable to the state,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State,\u201d and the person must be a \u201cstate actor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Taking the factual allegations of Huls\u2019s complaint as true, he demonstrated that he was deprived of his federally-protected right to liberty when he was imprisoned following the state court\u2019s contempt proceedings. So, the critical question we must answer is whether Huls\u2019s allegations show that Llabona acted \u201cunder color of state law or, in the context of the fourteenth Amendment, whether [Llabona\u2019s] alleged actions are \u2018fairly attributable to the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. quoting Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc. </em>457 U.S. 922, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2756, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). To be fairly attributable to the state, conduct must: (1) \u201cbe caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State\u201d; and (2) be committed by an individual who, if not personally a state official, has acted with or received significant aid from state officials. <em>Lugar, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2753-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Llabona, a private attorney representing a client in a private civil matter, was not a government employee and not otherwise acting at the behest of the state. Huls\u2019s allegation that Llabona knowingly falsified facts in a contempt motion appears to charge a private misuse of a state contempt procedure. To the extent that Huls argues that Llabona intentionally abused the state\u2019s civil contempt proceedings, her conduct is not attributable to the state. <em>See id., </em>102 S.Ct. at 2756 (\u201cprivate misuse of a state statute does not describe conduct that can be attributed to the State\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The district court also concluded correctly that Huls\u2019s state law claims were barred by Florida\u2019s litigation privilege, which provides litigation participants with absolute immunity for acts occurring during the course of judicial proceedings, and extends to all acts that have some relation to the proceeding. <em>See Levin, Middlebrooks, Mabie, Thomas, Mayes &amp; Mitchell, P.A. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>639 So.2d 606, 608 (Fla.1994). Because Llabo-na\u2019s challenged conduct \u2014 misrepresenting the language of the state court\u2019s order in her contempt motion \u2014 took place during the course of contempt proceedings against Huls, and was related directly to those proceedings, Llabona was absolutely immune under state law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Huls also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint a second time, which he filed after the court dismissed his complaint. His notice of appeal, however, specified only that he was appealing from the district court\u2019s 7 June 2010, 2010 WL 2293187, order dismissing his complaint and from the magistrate judge\u2019s 27 April 2010 order denying him leave to use the court\u2019s electronic filing system.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">\u201cWhere an \u2018appellant notices the appeal of a specified judgment only ... this court has no jurisdiction to review other judgments or issues which are not expressly referred to and which are not impliedly intended for appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whetstone Candy Co. v. Kraft Foods, Inc., </em>351 F.3d 1067, 1079-80 (11th Cir.2003). It is well settled, however, \u201cthat an appeal is not lost if a mistake is made in designating the judgment appealed from where it is clear that the overriding intent was effectively to appeal,\u201d \u201cat least where the order that was not designated was entered prior to or contemporaneously with the order(s) properly designated in the notice of appeal.\u201d <em>KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, </em>465 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">Construed liberally, nothing in Huls\u2019s notice of appeal indicated that he intended to appeal the court\u2019s order denying him leave to amend his complaint. Moreover, that order \u2014 filed on 16 July 2010 \u2014 was not entered prior to or contemporaneously with the orders designated in his notice of appeal. <em>See id. </em>As a result, we lack jurisdiction to review this issue. <em>See Whetstone, </em>351 F.3d at 1079-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-12\">. The court\u2019s order stated that Huls was financially responsible for maintaining health insurance for his children and directed his ex-wife \"to immediately obtain health insurance for the minor children of the parties,\u201d and \"immediately forward the bill for this insurance to [Huls], who will promptly pay this obligation immediately upon its receipt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-13\">. Llabona concedes that she misquoted the state court's 2003 order in her motion for contempt when she explained that the state court ordered Huls to \" '... immediately obtain health insurance for the minor children of the parties.' \"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b853-18\">.Huls alleged violations of Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 772.104 (providing a civil cause of action for violations of Florida\u2019s Criminal Practices Act); 843.0855(3) (making it a felony to knowingly prepare false court documents or orders); and 918.13(l)(b) (prohibiting the use of a document known to be false in a criminal proceeding).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\"><em>. </em>Huls also challenges die magistrate judge's denial of his <em>ex parte </em>motion for leave to use the district court\u2019s electronic filing system. Because Huls did not object to the magistrate's ruling below, as required by Fed. R.Civ.P. 72(a), he waived his right to challenge the order on appeal. <em>See Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1249 n. 21 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\">. Huls also challenges the constitutionality of the state\u2019s civil contempt procedures, asserting that the unlawful procedures facilitated Llabona\u2019s conduct. Because Huls raised this argument for the first time in his response to Llabona's motion to dismiss, instead of seeking leave to file an amended complaint, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), it was not properly raised below. <em>Cf. Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald &amp; Co., </em>382 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.2004) (stating that \u201c[a] plaintiff may not amend [his] complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary judgment.\u201d). Thus, it will not be considered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>appeal. <em>See Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 828 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">. Huls asserts that the district court improperly characterized his complaint as focusing on Llabona\u2019s in-court oral statements, instead of the written statements contained in her motion for contempt. Not only is this claim unsupported by the record, but this distinction is irrelevant to the analysis of Huls's claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
