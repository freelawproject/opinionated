On appeal, Denham argues that the district court committed reversible error when it: (1) denied his motion for a mistrial after the government\u2019s cooperating witness told the jury Denham was in jail, and (2) limited Denham\u2019s cross-examination of that witness as to her bias and motive for testifying. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">A.Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) agents received a complaint from Elizabeth Heffner that her boyfriend used social networking web sites to meet a fifteen-year-old female, S.A., and then traded S.A. prepaid cell phone minutes for nude pictures of S.A. During an investigation, FBI agents found five pictures of S.A. either nude or partially nude and displaying her genitals on Denham\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">In an interview with FBI agents, S.A. explained that Denham befriended her on the Internet. Denham eventually asked S.A. to take the pictures of herself using her cell phone camera and then send them to his cell phone. S.A. said she sent Den-ham about thirty pictures of herself. In exchange, Denham sent her a cell phone card.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">Unbeknownst to S.A., Denham used S.A.\u2019s pictures to create a profile on a social networking site. The web page invited men to send either prepaid phone minutes or checks or money orders in exchange for sexually explicit pictures of S.A. Denham also entered chat rooms pretending to be S.A. and offered to send sexually explicit photographs in exchange for cell phone minutes or money orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Denham with inducing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) and (e) (\u201cCount One\u201d); knowingly receiving child pornography by cellular telephone, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) and (b)(1) (\u201cCount Two\u201d); and knowingly possessing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2) (\u201cCount Three\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">B. Pre-trial Motion in Limine</p>\n<p id=\"b795-15\">Prior to trial, Denham made an oral motion in limine to prohibit any reference to his being detained or jailed during the investigation or criminal proceedings. The government did not oppose Denham\u2019s motion and suggested redacting any mention of Denham\u2019s incarceration in the trial exhibits. The government also noted that it had instructed its cooperating witness, Elizabeth Heffner, not to refer to the fact that Denham was in jail. The district court granted Denham\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">C. Motion for a Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">During trial, at the prosecution\u2019s request, the district court instructed witness Heffner that she could not tell the jury that Denham was in jail. Heffner responded that she understood. On direct examination, Heffner explained that (1) Denham was her boyfriend and the father of her child; (2) Denham obtained porno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>graphic photographs from underage girls whom he met online; and (3) Denham, by pretending to be an underage girl, induced men to send him money orders and cellular telephone cards in exchange for those pornographic photographs. Heffner admitted participating in Denham\u2019s \u201cscam\u201d by helping him obtain money orders and knowing that the scam was illegal and involved underage girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">When the prosecutor asked Heffner why she had reported Denham to the FBI, Heffner\u2019s response mentioned that Den-ham had been in jail, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">Q: Okay. And why did you \u2014 why\u2019d you call the FBI?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">A: I was mad at Anthony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">Q: When you say you were mad at him, can you tell us why you were mad at him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">A: Because we broke up and he went to jail and\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Denham objected and moved for a mistrial. Following a recess, the district court denied Denham\u2019s mistrial motion, explaining that the \u201cfleeting reference\u201d to jail had no detail or further discussion, was not intentionally elicited and was not \u201clikely to influence the outcome of the trial.\u201d The district court gave a curative instruction directing the jury to disregard Heffner\u2019s answer to the prosecutor\u2019s last question. The prosecutor then asked Heffner why she was mad at Denham, and Heffner explained that it was because they broke up.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Heffner also admitted that she did not want to testify against Denham and that she was doing so only because she was subpoenaed. Although Heffner denied being made any promises in exchange for her testimony, she hoped that she would not be prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">D. Cross-Examination of Heffner</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">On cross-examination, Heffner denied that she was trying to help the government in order to avoid prosecution. This exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-13\">Q: Okay. You don\u2019t want them to prosecute you on this, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-14\">A: I would \u2014 no, because of my daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-15\">Q: Okay. Because if they prosecuted you on this, you know that you\u2019re facing a lengthy prison sentence, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-16\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-17\">Q: If they prosecuted you with the charges that they\u2019re prosecuting Mr. Denham with and you got convicted of enticing or coercing a minor in engaging in sexually explicit conduct\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-18\">The government objected. At a side bar conference, defense counsel admitted that she planned to elicit from Heffner the specific penalties Heffner faced if she was prosecuted on the counts charged against Denham and argued that this information was relevant to Heffner\u2019s motive for testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-19\">The district court sustained the government\u2019s objection. The district court ruled that defense counsel could question Heff-ner about whether she could face \u201ca substantial prison term\u201d or even \u201cmany years of imprisonment,\u201d but that it was not appropriate to advise the jury of the specific penalties. The district court explained that the jury was not \u201cequipped to understand, for example, that those type sentences ordinarily don\u2019t run consecutively\u201d and the information would confuse the jury.\" The district court concluded that \u201cany probative value of advising them of the specific terms of imprisonment is outweighed by the confusion and prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-20\">Defense counsel continued cross-examining Heffner, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Q: Ms. Heffner, you understand that you can be prosecuted in this case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">Q: Okay. And so knowing that, you are trying to do your best not to get prosecuted, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">Q: And you have been trying to cooperate with [the prosecutor] and [FBI] Agent Pruitt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">Q: And you\u2019ve had lots of conversations with Agent Pruitt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">Q: Okay. And there have been times that you did not want to cooperate with them, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-14\">Q: And when you didn\u2019t want to cooperate with them, they reminded you that you could be prosecuted for this, right? A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">Q: And that made you start cooperating again, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-16\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-17\">Q: And if you do get prosecuted for this, you\u2019re facing many years in prison, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-18\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-19\">Following the trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict against Denham on all three counts. Count Three subsequently was dismissed based on the government\u2019s motion. The district court sentenced Den-ham to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count One, and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 2, to run concurrently. Denham filed this appeal challenging his convictions, but not his sentences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-21\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Af2\">A. Motion for a Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b797-22\">On appeal, Denham argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial. Denham argues that Heffner\u2019s jail comment denied him a fair trial and a presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-23\">\u201cA mistrial should be granted if the defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudi-cially affected,\u201d which occurs \u201cwhen there is a reasonable probability that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007). This determination is made \u201cin the context of the entire trial and in light of any curative instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the district court \u201cis in the best position to evaluate the prejudicial effect of a statement or evidence on the jury,\u201d we review the denial of a mistrial motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d 1324, 1334 (11th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1032, 175 L.Ed.2d 632 (2009) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen a district court gives a curative instruction, the reviewing court will reverse only if the evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition.\u201d <em>Newsome, </em>475 F.3d at 1227 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-26\">\u201cThe mere utterance of the word jail, prison or arrest does not, without regard to context or circumstances, constitute reversible error <em>per se.\u201d Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d at 1334 (affirming denial of mistrial motion where police officer witness mentioned he would see defendant when the defendant would sign in \u201cas a condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>bail\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Veteto, </em>701 F.2d 136, 139-40 (11th Cir.1983) (affirming denial of mistrial motion where witness stated that defendant had been in prison before). The denial of a mistrial is proper \u201cwhere the comment is brief, unelicited, and unresponsive, adding nothing to the government\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Here, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in denying Denham\u2019s motion for a mistrial. As the district court noted, witness Heffner uttered a single, brief comment about Denham\u2019s being in jail without any further elaboration. Heff-ner\u2019s comment was not responsive to the prosecutor\u2019s question and did not add to the government\u2019s case. The government took steps prior to Heffner\u2019s testimony to avoid any mention of Denham\u2019s being in jail and did not elicit the comment intentionally. Nor should the prosecutor have anticipated the comment given that Heff-ner did not mention Denham\u2019s incarceration when previously answering a similar question before the grand jury. Finally, the district court gave the jury a curative instruction, and Denham has not shown that the brief, unelicited reference to jail was so highly prejudicial that the jury could not follow that curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">B. Cross-Examination of Heffner</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Denham argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation and to present a defense when it limited his ability to cross-examine Heffner effectively about her bias and motive to lie.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">\u201cThe Confrontation Clause guarantees criminal defendants an opportunity to impeach through cross-examination the testimony of witnesses for the prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d 1354, 1370 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cA limitation on cross-examination can violate the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation if it prevents the defendant from showing that a witness is biased.\u201d <em>De Lisi v. Crosby, </em>402 F.3d 1294, 1300 (11th Cir.2005). The need for full cross-examination is particularly important \u201cwhere the witness is the star government witness or pai\u2019ticipat-ed in the crimes for which the defendant is being prosecuted.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir.2008). Also, \u201cwhere a prosecution witness has been threatened with a criminal charge or actually charged with a criminal offense, the defendant is entitled to explore those circumstances on cross-examination in order to bring to the jury\u2019s attention the witness\u2019 possible motive or self-interest with respect to the testimony given.\u201d <em>United States v. Garrett, </em>727 F.2d 1003, 1011 (11th Cir.1984), superseded by statute on other grounds, <em>United States v. Elgersma, </em>929 F.2d 1538, 1544-45 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">However, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment does not require unlimited inquiry into the potential bias of a witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>13 F.3d 1464, 1469 (11th Cir.1994) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201c[T]rial judges retain wide latitude ... to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). \u201cThe test for the Confrontation Clause is whether a reasonable jury would have received a significantly different impression of the witness\u2019 credibility had counsel pursued the proposed line of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>13 F.3d at 1469. \u201cOnce there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>sufficient cross-examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, further questioning is within the district court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1468.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Denham\u2019s cross-examination of Heffner or deny Denham his constitutional rights to confront her and present a defense. Denham had a full and fair opportunity to impeach Heffner as to her bias and motive for testifying. The district court permitted Denham to cross-examine Heffner about the fact that she could be prosecuted for the offenses for which Denham was being tried. During cross-examination, Heffner admitted that: (1) when she refused to cooperate, the government reminded her that she could be prosecuted; (2) she was \u201ctrying to do [her] best not to get prosecuted\u201d; and (3) she was cooperating with the government in the hope that she would avoid prosecution. More importantly, the district court permitted Denham to elicit from Heffner that, if prosecuted, she faced \u201cmany years in prison.\u201d The cross-examination presented the jury with facts sufficient to evaluate Heffner\u2019s possible bias and incentive to testify untruthfully against Den-ham. The precise length of the possible sentence would not have given a reasonable jury a significantly different impression of Heffner\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Moreover, the district court restricted cross-examination only to the extent Den-ham wanted to inquire about the precise sentences Heffner would face if she were prosecuted for Denham\u2019s charged offenses. Information as to the severity of the sentence the defendant faces is \u201cextrinsic and prejudicial,\u201d and the trial court is within its discretion to restrict cross-examination that would reveal such information to the jury. <em>See Garrett, </em>727 F.2d at 1011-12 (affirming district court\u2019s limitation on cross-examination of cooperating witness as to specific, mandatory minimum prison term he faced if charged with the defendant\u2019s crime). The district court also noted that information about the sentencing ranges for each count could confuse the jury if it is unaware that sentences often are imposed concurrently. We cannot say the district court abused its discretion in precluding this specific line of questioning.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Finally, and contrary to Denham\u2019s assertion on appeal, Heffner\u2019s testimony was not essential to establish his knowledge that the victim was underage because (1) the victim herself testified that she told Denham she was 15 years old, and (2) Denham\u2019s sister testified that Denham admitted to her that the victim was underage.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-20\">. In part because Denham had a criminal history of Category IV, his advisory guidelines range was 324 to 405 months' imprisonment. The district court imposed a sentence below that range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">. We review the district court's decision limiting cross-examination for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1178 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">. Because there was no error in the district court\u2019s denial of a mistrial or limitation of Denham\u2019s cross-examination of Heffner, Den-ham cannot show cumulative error. <em>See United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that where there is no error, there can be no cumulative error).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
