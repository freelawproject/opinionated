On appeal, Rowe claims that the district court erred in failing to grant his challenge to the government\u2019s peremptory strikes of two black venire members pursuant to <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\"><em>Batson </em>established a three-step, burden-shifting inquiry to assess whether the government unconstitutionally exercised its peremptory challenges to exclude venire members from the jury on the basis of their race, <em>United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1335, n. 5 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that <em>Batson </em>applies equally to the federal government):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-11\">First, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties\u2019 submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-14\"><em>Snyder v. Louisiana, </em>552 U.S. 472, 476-77, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 1207, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008) (alterations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">Here, the district court found on Rowe\u2019s first objection to the prosecution\u2019s strike of a black venire member that Rowe had failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to Rowe\u2019s objection to the strike of the second black juror, the prosecutor volunteered a race-neutral reason before the court ruled on the first <em>Batson </em>step. The court gave no clear ruling on the second step either, responding simply, \u201cAll right. That\u2019s noted,\u201d and moving to the next juror. After selection concluded with the seating of one minority juror as an alternate, Rowe reiterated his objection to the jury selection on <em>Batson </em>grounds. He did so again before the trial began, and the court simply noted his objections for the record, effectively overruling them.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">The district court never ruled on whether Rowe established a prima facie case with his second objection and instead considered the reasons the prosecutor volunteered. Thus, we consider whether Rowe has shown that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were pretext. <em>See United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1866, 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (plurality opinion)) (finding that \u201cwhether [defendant] made out the prima facie case is moot\u201d because \u201cthe district court considered the prosecution\u2019s non-discriminatory reasons for exercising the strikes\u201d and overruled the objections).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">As Rowe argues on appeal, a defendant can demonstrate pretext by showing that the government\u2019s reasons for the strike applies with equal force to \u201cotherwise-similar\u201d venire members of another race who were not challenged. <em>Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 241, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 2325, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But here, Rowe has not carried his burden because he has not shown for either peremptory strike that the proffered reasons for the strike applied equally to the excluded and accepted venire members. Rowe neither argued at trial nor argues on appeal that the prosecution\u2019s main proffered reason for the first strike \u2014 that she \u201cappeared completely disinterested\u201d \u2014 was false or applied to any of the white venire members. <em>See United States v. Cordoba-Mosquera, </em>212 F.3d 1194, 1197 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that \u201cinattentiveness is a proper race-neutral reason for using a peremptory strike\u201d). Meanwhile, Rowe\u2019s comparison of the second challenged black venire member with a white juror fails because their responses to the pertinent question \u2014 about criminal charges against the venire member\u2019s family members\u2014 were substantially different. The questionnaire of the venire member who was challenged indicated only that her son had been charged with a crime and that charges had been dismissed. The white comparison juror, by contrast, stated that his sister had been charged with an offense, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know the details. We aren\u2019t close.\u201d Furthermore, the government did strike a white venire member who had noted that her sister had faced criminal charges but, unlike the comparison white juror and like the challenged black venire member, did not indicate that she was not \u201cclose\u201d with the relevant family member. Rowe\u2019s comparison thus fails to show that the prosecutor\u2019s facially neutral reasons were pretext, and so we cannot say the court reversibly erred in overruling the <em>Batson </em>objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we AFFIRM Rowe\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-12\">. We review <em>de novo </em>challenges to jury selection pursuant to <em>Batson, </em>but review underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Campa, 529 </em>F.3d 980, 992 (11th Cir.2008). The district court's finding as to why a juror is excused is a factual finding, and the court's credibility determinations are entitled to \"great deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Gamory, </em>635 F.3d 480, 495 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-18\">. Rowe\u2019s appeal is based on his later objections, and he does not challenge the court's ruling on this first objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b824-5\">. In the district court, Rowe never specifically raised the argument he raises here, and we have previously found such failure to raise \"comparability analysis\u2019\u2019 \u2014 comparing the excluded prospective minority jurors and included white jurors to show the government\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual \u2014 is fatal to a <em>Batson </em>claim on appeal. <em>See Houston, </em>456 F.3d at 1338-39 (refusing to find error when defendant \"never alerted the court to the existence of white venire members whom he now contends were similarly situated\u201d as to the proffered reasons for the strikes of minority venire members). However, the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent analysis in <em>Snyder </em>casts doubt on our reasoning in <em>Houston. </em>The <em>Snyder </em>Court \"recognize[d] that a retrospective comparison of jurors based on a cold appellate record may be very misleading when alleged similarities were not raised at trial\u201d because \"an exploration of the alleged similarities at the time of trial might have shown that the jurors in question were not really comparable.\u201d 552 U.S. at 483, 128 S.Ct. at 1211. Nonetheless, the Court found that the record was sufficient to evaluate the claimed similarities and went on to find a <em>Batson </em>violation on that basis. <em>Id. </em>We need not decide whether or how <em>Snyder </em>alters circuit law because, even considering his comparability analysis, Rowe\u2019s claim fails on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
