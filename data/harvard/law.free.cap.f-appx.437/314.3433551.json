Johnson, </em>No. 5:01-CV-00165 (E.D.Tex. July 31, 2003) (unpublished); <em>Perry v. Holmes, </em>152 Fed.Appx. 404 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished). Furthermore, Perry has not alleged that he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g). Thus, the district court improvidently granted Perry leave to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-19\">Accordingly, Perry\u2019s IFP status is de-certified, and the appeal is dismissed. Perry has 15 days from the date of this opinion to pay the full appellate filing fee to the clerk of the district court, should he wish to reinstate his appeal. Perry\u2019s request for the production of transcripts at government expense is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">IFP DECERTIFIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR TRANSCRIPTS AT GOVERNMENT EXPENSE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
