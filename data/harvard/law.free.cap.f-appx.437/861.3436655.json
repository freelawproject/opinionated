Hernandez argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Hernandez at the low end of the guideline range. In 2003, Hernandez was convicted of trafficking in cocaine and deported from the United States, and in 2010, agents apprehended Hernandez in Georgia, where he had been residing for approximately four years ostensibly to escape death threats that he had received in Mexico. The district court \u201c[took] into account the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d and reasonably determined that a sentence of 41 months of imprisonment, which is well below the statutory maximum of 20 years, \u201c[took] into account [Hernandez\u2019s personal] circumstances and offense and history and characteristics\u201d yet would \u201cprovide[] adequate punishment\u201d and \u201cdeter[]\u201d him from reentering the United States illegally yet again. Hernandez argues that the 16-level enhancement of his base offense level based on his conviction in 1998 for trafficking in cocaine base, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), \u201cis inappropriate and unreasonable because there is no empirical or national evidence supporting such an enhancement,\u201d but the lack of such evidence does not require that the district court disregard the advisory guideline. <em>See United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 870 (11th Cir.2010). Hernandez\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">We AFFIRM Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"ALU\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
