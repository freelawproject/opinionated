On initial appeal, this court determined that the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations constituted procedural error, vacating the judgment and remanding for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Stephens, </em>373 Fed.Appx. 457 (5th Cir.2010). On remand, the district court imposed a non-guidelines sentence of 240 months on each count of conviction, to be served concurrently, determining that such a variance was necessary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to reflect the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need for the sentence to provide punishment, deterrence, and protection to the public. Stephens now appeals the sentence imposed on remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Relying on Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinions in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 368-84, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 60, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), Stephens argues that his sentence violates his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial because, but for the district court judge\u2019s finding that he possessed firearms during several robberies, a fact which he has never admitted, it would not pass muster under reasonableness review as set forth in the remedial opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, as the Government contends, and Stephens apparently concedes, his as-applied Sixth Amendment challenge is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 374 (5th Cir.2011) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 3006,\u201d 180 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011) (holding that \u201c[i]rre-spective of whether Supreme Court precedent has foreclosed as-applied Sixth Amendment challenges to sentences within the statutory maximum that are reasonable only if based on judge-found facts, such challenges are foreclosed under [this court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">Stephens next argues, for the first time, that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Citing statistics which purport to show that defendants convicted of robbery in the Northern District of Texas are more likely to receive sentences that vary or depart upward from the guidelines range than defendants convicted of robbery elsewhere, Stephens contends that the district court\u2019s non-guidelines sentence subverts the purpose of the Guidelines and of \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">Because Stephens provides no information about the particular aggravating or mitigating facts concerning any other robbery defendant, he has failed to show that any sentencing disparity is unwarranted. <em>See United States v. Willingham, </em>497 F.3d 541, 544 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cNational averages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of sentences that provide no details underlying the sentences are unreliable to determine unwarranted disparity because they do not reflect the enhancements or adjustments for the aggravating or mitigating factors that distinguish individual cases.\u201d). Moreover, the district court specifically determined that the instant case fell outside of the heartland of bank robbery cases, relying on significant factors not accounted for in Stephens\u2019s guidelines range. Consequently, any disparity between the sentence he received and those received by other defendants with his guidelines range was not unwarranted and does not give rise to reversible plain error. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Stephens additionally contends that the extent of the variance in his case was unreasonable because the court failed to adequately consider his youth and lack of a criminal record. As he did below, he asserts that he is not \u201c\u2018the worst of the worst\u2019\u201d bank robbers, and he complains that varying upwardly to the statutory maximum was excessive in his case given that he was a 19-year-old first-time offender who engaged in a two-month robbery spree during which no one was actually harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The district court tied the reasons for its sentence to specific facts and particular \u00a7 3553(a) factors which were sufficient to justify the extent of the variance. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The court made an individualized assessment and was free to conclude, as it did, that the guidelines range in Stephens\u2019s case gave insufficient weight to some of the sentencing factors, including the seriousness of the offense, specifically his use of guns, the need to protect the public from further crimes committed by Stephens in light of his repeated bank robberies, and the need for deterrence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). Stephens\u2019s argument is, in essence, a disagreement with the weight that the district court gave to the relevant sentencing factors, particularly his criminal history, but this disagreement does not amount to a showing that the court abused its discretion in imposing his sentence. <em>Cf. Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. To the extent that Stephens seeks to have this court reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, his request is unavailing. This court will not reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as that would contravene the deferential review mandated by <em>Gall. See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (directing appellate courts to \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance\u201d and stating that the fact this court might reasonably conclude that a different sentence might be appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Although the variance in this case was significant, this court has upheld as reasonable similarly significant variances. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 441-42 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 &amp; n. 40 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 312-13 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 174-75 (5th Cir.1995). Stephens has not shown that the sentence he received is substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
