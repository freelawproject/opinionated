The district court sentenced him to 180 months in prison in accordance with the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) because Bush had been convicted of three violent felonies. On appeal, Bush argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence because (i) his prior conviction for burglary of an unoccupied structure was not a violent felony and (ii) his prior convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>were not charged in the indictment or found by a jury. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Bush entered an unconditional plea to possession of a firearm and ammunition and at the change-of-plea hearing admitted that he had previously been convicted of burglary of a structure, aggravated assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon and fleeing police, and burglary of an occupied dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Based on these facts, the probation officer determined that Bush qualified as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. The presentence investigation report (PSI) quoted the indictment and judgment in connection with the prior conviction for burglary of a structure as follows: Bush \u201cdid knowingly enter or remain in a structure, the property of USA GROCERS, INC., with intent to commit an offense therein.\u201d According to the PSI, Bush smashed the glass of the convenience store, entered the building, and took $183 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Bush\u2019s status as an armed career criminal subjected him to a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Although he did not object to the facts set forth in the PSI, Bush disputed that his prior conviction for burglary of a structure was a qualifying offense under the ACCA. He also objected on the ground that his prior convictions had not been charged in the indictment. The district court overruled the objections, finding that the prior burglary conviction qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA, and that the government was not required to charge prior convictions in the indictment under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The court then sentenced Bush to the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions constitute violent felonies under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>466 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). The ACCA defines a violent felony as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-13\">any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that an offense constituted \u201cburglary\u201d under the ACCA when \u201ceither its statutory definition substantially corresponds to \u2018generic\u2019 burglary, or the charging paper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements of generic burglary in order to convict the defendant.\u201d 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). The Supreme Court held that a \u201cgeneric\u201d burglary for purposes of \u00a7 924(e) was one \u201chaving the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">Here, we conclude that the district court properly found that Bush\u2019s prior conviction for burglary of an unoccupied structure was a violent felony under the ACCA. At sentencing, Bush conceded that his prior conviction was for a generic burglary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But even if Bush\u2019s prior con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>viction is not generic burglary, it still qualifies as a crime of violence because the state indictment confirms that Bush was charged with entering a structure with the intent to commit a crime therein, which fits the definition of a generic burglary under <em>Taylor. </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143; see <em>also United States v. Rainer, </em>616 F.3d 1212, 1215 (11th Cir.2010), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 968, 178 L.Ed.2d 796 (2011) (explaining that this court uses the modified categorical approach to determine if a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute was nonetheless for generic burglary). Therefore, the district court properly sentenced Bush as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Al-mendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction used to enhance a sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was not an element of the offense, and, thus, need not be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Because we are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is expressly overruled, Bush\u2019s prior convictions did not have to be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006). Therefore, the district court properly enhanced Bush\u2019s sentence pursuant to the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. Although this was likely an error, and the offense is actually a non-generic burglary, it is an invited one and we need not address it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number><em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
