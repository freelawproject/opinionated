The district court imposed a sentence of 120 months of imprisonment pursuant to recent amendments to the penalties applicable to cocaine base offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The website of the Bureau of Prisons shows that McKinley was released from prison on November 13, 2009. Where a defendant has begun serving a term of supervised release, the appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is moot. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>645 F.3d 328 (5th Cir. 2011). Here, as with the defendant in <em>Booker, </em>McKinley makes no mention of his term of supervised release and does not argue that it should be terminated; his arguments pertain only to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any termination of supervised release must be sought by a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1). <em>See Booker </em>645 F.3d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">IT IS ORDERED that the motions to proceed IFP and for appointment of counsel are DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
