Spivey argues that the district court erroneously assigned him a base offense level of 24 based on the determination that his prior conviction for aggravated stalking qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), 4B 1.2(a)(2) (2010). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.2011). To qualify as a crime of violence, the offense must \u201cinvolve! ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). In Georgia, a defendant commits aggravated stalking when, in violation of a court order, he \u201cfollows, places under surveillance, or contacts [his victim] at or about a place or places without [her] consent ... for the purpose of harassing and intimidating\u201d her. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-91 (a). The defendant \u201charasses and intimidates\u201d by engaging in a \u201cknowing and willful course of conduct\u201d that causes the victim \u201cemotional distress by placing [her] in reasonable fear for [her] safety.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-90(a)(l); <em>see State v. Burke, </em>287 Ga. 377, 378, 695 S.E.2d 649, 650 (2010) (applying definition of harassing and intimidating from stalking statute to conviction for aggravated stalking). Because \u201c \u2018ambiguities in the [statute] make the crime of violence determination impossible from the face of the judgment itself,\u2019 \u201d <em>Lockley, </em>632 F.3d at 1240 (quoting <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009)), Spi-vey acknowledges that we may examine the facts of his conviction, <em>see United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842-43 (11th Cir.2009), which establish that he \u25a0violated a protective order by traveling to his victim\u2019s house and threatening to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Spivey\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated stalking is a crime of violence. Spivey argues that aggravated stalking \u201cdoes not necessarily create any sort of <em>actual risk </em>of physical injury,\u201d but section 4B1.2 requires only that the offense \u201cpresent[ ] a serious <em>potential risk </em>of physical injury,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (emphasis added). The likelihood that Spivey\u2019s victim would suffer a physical injury is comparable in degree and kind to the risk created during a burglary. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1594, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (examining whether \u201cthe risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses\u201d). A person bent on harassing and intimidating his victim notwithstanding a court order prohibiting contact with the victim creates \u201ca heightened danger of violent confrontation.\u201d <em>Lockley, </em>632 F.3d at 1245. Spivey acknowledges that the victim of a death threat may have a \u201cvery strong and reasonable fear of an impending use of force against [her],\u201d but Spivey ignores that the circumstances of his offense escalated the risk of a melee. When approached at her home, a beleaguered victim of harassment and intimidation might feel compelled to repel the harasser, which in turn could provoke the harasser to respond with force to any defiance or resistance. <em>See James, </em>550 U.S. at 203, 127 S.Ct. at 1594 (\u201cThe main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another\u2019s property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party\u201d such as \u201can occupant.\u201d). The district court did not err when it ruled that Spivey\u2019s prior conviction of aggravated stalking is a crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>violence under the residual clause of section 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">We AFFIRM Spivey\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
