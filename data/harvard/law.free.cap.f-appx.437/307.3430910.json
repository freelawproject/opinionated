The district court sentenced Torres to 77 months in prison. In this appeal, Torres argues that the district court erred when it assessed one criminal history point under former U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e) in light of the amendment deleting this provision and that his 77-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">Because Torres did not raise in the district court his argument regarding \u00a7 4Al.l(e), our review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Torres was sentenced prior to the effective date of Amendment 742, which eliminated criminal history points based on recency by deleting former \u00a7 4Al.l(e). United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 742, pp. 354-56 (Nov. 1, 2010). Therefore, the district court correctly applied former \u00a7 4Al.l(e). <em>See United States v. Windham, </em>991 F.2d 181, 182-83 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-23\">Torres also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Because Torres objected in the district court to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for the same reasons he raises here, we review the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines is de novo and its findings of fact is for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Torres\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s consideration of various sentencing factors amount to nothing more than his disagreement with the court\u2019s weighing of those factors and the appropriateness of his within-guidelines sentence. Torres\u2019s disagreement does not suffice to show error in connection with his sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Torres has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>taches to his within-guidelines sentence, nor has he shown that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
