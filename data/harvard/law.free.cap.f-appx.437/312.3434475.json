The 24-month sentence was a non-Guidelines variance above the advisory sentencing range of six to 12 months. Mosqueda contends that it was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">A district court\u2019s decision whether and by how much to deviate from the advisory Guidelines range is entitled to deference in light of its superior position to find facts, make credibility determinations, and gain \u201cinsights not conveyed by the record.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">Mosqueda asserts that the court improperly weighed the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and his criminal history. By doing so, he implicitly argues for <em>de novo </em>review and asks this court to reweigh the sentencing factors in his favor. This is precisely contrary to the prescribed review for abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>(mandating \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance\u201d). The district court cited fact-specific reasons for the sentence, and its reasons adequately reflected consideration of the Section 3553(a) factors. Moreover, this court has affirmed similar or greater degrees of variance. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008) (upholding an upward variance to 180 months from an advisory maximum of 51 months). Accordingly, the sentence was reasonable and should not be disturbed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
