He challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to account for his lifelong mental illness and its contribution to his criminal history and gave little or no weight to the facts of his cultural assimilation. Although Osorio challenges the application of the appellate presumption of reasonableness to sentences imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, he correctly acknowledges that the issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-20\">Before imposing a sentence within the advisory guideline range, the district court heard the arguments of Osorio and his counsel concerning his request for a sentence at the low end or below the guideline range based on his mental illness and cultural assimilation. Osorio has not shown that the district court\u2019s balancing of these factors \u201crepresents a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). Accordingly, he has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>203 (2007). Osorio has shown no error with respect to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
