Garland contends that his sentence was unreasonable and that the district court erred by not explaining why it rejected his request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>below-guidelines sentence and instead selected the sentence it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Appellate courts are to review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Ordinarily, an appellate court reviewing for reasonableness \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cReasonableness review is bifurcated\u201d. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The appellate court must first decide whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range [or] failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is procedurally sound, the appellate court next considers \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Although Garland moved for a sentence below the guidelines range, he did not object that the district court had failed to explain the sentence, nor did he otherwise alert the district court to any objections to the sentence. Therefore, the usual abuse of discretion standard does not apply, and Garland\u2019s claims of error must instead be reviewed using the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To succeed, Garland must at least satisfy the first three of the plain error standard\u2019s four prongs \u2014 i.e., he must demonstrate that the district court committed (1) an error (2) that was clear or obvious and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Garland cannot prevail on his claim that the district court failed to explain his sentence. \u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456. In the instant case, the district court adopted the presentence investigation report and accepted the guidelines sentencing range calculation set forth therein, thus implicitly accepting the probation officer\u2019s assessment that no mitigating factors existed to support a downward departure. Additionally, because Garland\u2019s sentence is \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guideline range,\u201d an inference arises that the district court considered \u201call the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). But we need not decide whether the district court \u201cset forth enough to satisfy [us] that [it] considered the parties\u2019 arguments and [had] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even assuming that Garland has shown that the district court committed an error that was clear or obvious, he has failed to show that the purported error affected his substantial rights, i.e., that it affected the outcome of the case; he makes no attempt to show that further explanation would have resulted in a lesser sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429; <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 364. Therefore, Garland is not entitled to relief on this claim on plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Nor does he succeed on his claim of substantive unreasonableness. Being within the properly calculated guidelines range, Garland\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Garland advances no persuasive reason to disturb the sentence selected by the district court. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Even if we were to conclude that a different sentence were a reasonable sentence for Garland, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>would be \u201cinsufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>also <em>United States v. York, </em>600 F.3d 347, 361-62 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 185, 178 L.Ed.2d 111 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
