He argues for the first time on appeal that the factual basis was insufficient to support his guilty plea to the firearms offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-22\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) requires the district court to ensure that there is a factual basis for the plea before it enters judgment. Because Ley-va-Orozco did not object to the sufficiency of the factual basis, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc). When reviewing a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 error for plain error, this \u201ccourt may consult the whole record when considering the effect on substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">Section 924(c)(1) criminalizes mere possession of a firearm as long as the possession is \u201cin furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime.\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). \u201c[A] possession is \u2018in furtherance\u2019 of [a] drug trafficking offense when it furthers, advances, or helps forward that offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 410-11 (5th Cir.), <em>amended on other grounds, </em>226 F.3d 651 (5th Cir.2000). Some of the factors this court considers in determining whether a possession is \u201cin furtherance\u201d of a drug trafficking offense include the following: (1) the type of drug activity that is being conducted, (2) the accessibility of the firearm, (3) the type of the weapon, (4) whether the weapon is stolen, (5) the status of the possession (legitimate or illegal), (6) whether the gun is loaded, (7) proximity of the weapon to drugs or drug profits, and (8) the time and circumstances under which the gun is found. <em>Id. </em>at 414-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The record as a whole establishes on plain error review a sufficient factual basis for Leyva-Orozco\u2019s plea. <em>See id. </em>at 410-11; <em>see also United States v. Dyer, </em>136 F.3d 417, 425 n. 13 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, Leyva-Orozco has not established that the district court plainly erred by accepting his guilty plea to the firearms offense. <em>See Marek, </em>238 F.3d at 315. The factual basis as recited by the Government and the questioning of the district court refute any notion that the weapon was merely present. <em>See Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d at 415. Specifically, given the proximity of the loaded weapon to the drugs and money and Leyva-Orozco\u2019s admission that the weapon could be used for protection, it was reasonable to conclude that Leyva-Orozco\u2019s possession of the weapon was in furtherance of the drug trafficking offense. <em>See id. </em>at 412-15. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
