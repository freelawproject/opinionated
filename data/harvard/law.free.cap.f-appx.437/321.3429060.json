By his motion, Wilson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-22\">The district court dismissed the instant action because Wilson is barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to the three-strikes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>bar of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and because he had failed to demonstrate that he was under imminent danger of serious physical injury, as is required to avoid application of the bar. Wilson concedes that he has three strikes within the meaning of \u00a7 1915(g) but argues that the bar should not apply to him because it violates his equal protection rights and his right of access to the courts, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. The argument is without merit. See <em>Carson v. Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 821 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Wilson fails to brief any argument that he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury or otherwise challenging the district court\u2019s determination that he had failed to make such a showing. See <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). He has thus abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Wilson is CAUTIONED that any future frivolous filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
