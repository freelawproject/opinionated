His term of supervised release began on October 23, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">On August 4, 2010, the probation office filed a petition to revoke his term of supervised release. The petition alleged that Barraza-Guzman violated three conditions of his supervised release. At the revocation hearing, Barraza-Guzman pleaded true to violating the terms of his supervised release \u201cby returning to the United States illegally.\u201d The district court revoked Barraza-Guzman\u2019s term of supervised release and sentenced him to 12 months of imprisonment, to run consecutively to the 16-month term of imprisonment that was imposed following his illegal reentry conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">Barraza-Guzman appeals the district court\u2019s judgment revoking his supervised release. However, the sole issue raised on appeal is whether we should remand the matter to allow the district court to correct the written judgment \u2014 which reflects that Barraza-Guzman pleaded true to all three allegations in the petition to revoke \u2014 because it is does not correctly reflect the conduct admitted to by Barraza-Guzman at the revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states that after giving proper notice, the court may correct a clerical error at any time. Accordingly, the judgment is REMANDED for the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>purpose of correcting the error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">As Barraza-Guzman does not otherwise challenge the revocation of his supervised release, the district court\u2019s judgment is otherwise AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
