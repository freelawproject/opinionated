Specifically, he claims that the U.S. Attorney General violated his procedural due process rights by waiting until 2008 to commence removal proceedings based on an aggravated felony conviction \u2014 sexual battery \u2014 in 1991,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-21\">\u201cThe procedural component of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause protects against the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without the \u2018due process of law.\u2019 The necessary first step in evaluating any procedural due-process claim is determining whether a constitutionally protected interest has been implicated.\u201d <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1299 (11th Cir.1999) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-22\">Here, Daria does not articulate the constitutionally protected interest at stake. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>He does not demonstrate that either \u201cproperty\u201d or \u201cliberty\u201d are implicated by the Attorney General\u2019s decision to commence removal proceedings in 2008. Instead, he argues that the Attorney General\u2019s decision violated general precepts of fairness. But that claim does not warrant relief under the Due Process Clause in this case. <em>See, e.g., Dandan v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 567, 575 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201c[T]he decision when to commence deportation proceedings is within the discretion of the Attorney General and does not, therefore, involve a protected property or liberty interest.\u201d). Accordingly, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AGX\">. The notice to appear issued by the Department of Homeland security also stated Daria was removable because (1) he committed two crimes of moral turpitude \u2014 the 1991 conviction for sexual battery and a 2007 conviction for unemployment compensation fraud; and (2) he committed aggravated-felony burglary in 2000. The Florida courts vacated the burglary conviction in 2008, and Daria entered into a new guilty plea, which resulted in a sentence of less than one year of imprisonment. Accordingly, it was no longer an independent ground for removal. Ultimately, the Immigration Judge and Board of Immigration Appeals denied relief based on the sexual battery conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
