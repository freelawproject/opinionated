The Attorney General moves to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. We previously granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion in part as to petitioner Gloria Alejandra Gutierrez Quintero (\u201cAlejandra\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we now deny the motion as to the remaining petitioners, and we deny Quintero\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">Quintero, her husband, Eduardo Alfonso Gutierrez Osorio (\u201cGutierrez\u201d), their older daughter, Alejandra, and their younger daughter, Laura Jazm\u00edn Gutierrez Quinte-ro, arrived in the United States in January 2004 on visitor-for-pleasure visas. They were authorized to remain through July 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">In May 2004, Quintero applied for asylum on the basis of membership in a particular social group. She asserted that she and her family were involved with political parties and that members of the FARC had harassed her and made death threats against her and her family. She stated that she was working at the Hospital de la Misc.icordia in 2000 as a radiologist technician. One night, a 16-year-old girl came to the hospital. The girl was the girlfriend of a guerilla leader. Some guerillas had attacked a farm in the department of Toli-ma and the girl was the only survivor. She arrived at the hospital in critical condition and died on the radiology table. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Her companions blamed Quintero and threatened that Quintero\u2019s family would pay for her \u201cnegligence.\u201d They also indicated that they recognized Quintero from her and her husband\u2019s political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Quintero further stated that, after the incident at the hospital, she began to receive threatening phone calls at work. She was burglarized twice, and people identifying themselves with the Frente de Tolima claimed responsibility. The pressure and stress led the family to relocate three months later to a village about 1.5 hours from Bogota. Quintero and Gutierrez ceased their political activities, but Quintero continued to commute to the hospital. A few months later, the guerillas found the family and the threats resumed. The family returned to Bogota in the hope of \u201chav[ing] a normal life again,\u201d but ultimately, they were forced to move twice more. The family had become increasingly worried and scared, the girls were emotionally unstable, and they \u201cdidn\u2019t have a life anymore.\u201d Finally, the family came to the United States. Among the documentation supporting her asylum application was a note that read, \u201cWe have you and your daughters located. You will pay for the consequences, so call the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">' Quintero and her family were served with Notices to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) in August 2004, charging them with having overstayed their visas in violation of Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). They admitted the allegations and conceded removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">At the asylum hearing, Quintero testified to the death of the patient in September 2000. Upon the patient\u2019s death, guerillas threatened Quintero, \u201csaying that they had recognized [her] through [her] political interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Quintero testified that she worked with the Community Action Board, which served the needy, particularly in Tolima and Bogota. The Community Action Board was affiliated with the Liberal Party. She had been a member of the Board for approximately 15 years. Her work with the Board involved holding \u201ctalks\u201d and \u201cshops,\u201d administering vaccinations, teaching people to read, and educating people about their civic duties and responsibilities. She said that the guerillas did not indicate how they recognized her, but she speculated that they might have seen her performing her work for the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Several days after the patient\u2019s death, individuals identifying themselves with the 21st Front called her at the hospital. They \u201clet [her] know ... not to forget what had happened to [the patient\u2019s] body and ... that [she] had done it on purpose and that [she] worked for an imperialist government.\u201d They also said that the talks she gave in her work with the Board were \u201cbothering them.\u201d From the time she began her work with the Board in 1988 until the patient\u2019s death in 2000, she had never had any problems with the FARC, but in this phone call, they expressed anger about both her work with the Board and the death of the patient. They went on to threaten her several more times over the course of three years. In those calls, they reminded Quintero of what had happened to the patient and told her that she or her family would pay for what she had done. The callers said that \u201cthey knew that [Quintero] had let [the patient] down on purpose\u201d because Quintero disagreed with them politically, and that they would kill Quintero and her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Quintero and her family moved to Jovito in December 2000, though Quintero continued to commute to work. After several months, the guerillas began to call her at her new home. The family then moved back to Bogota, in a house on the opposite side of the city from their previous home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>During this period, Quintero discontinued her work for the Board. The family-stopped answering the telephone and talking to strangers, and for a time, they \u201clived in peace.\u201d She resumed her work with the Board in October 2003. On January 6, 2004, while her daughters were staying with a friend in the coastal town of Barranquilla, Quintero received a phone call. The caller said that her daughters were doing well and having a good time at the coast, but that \u201cthey w[ould] return one of [the girls] back to [Quintero] the same way that [she] had [returned] that colleague of theirs.\u201d The caller also said that Quintero was considered a military objective due to her work with the Board, and \u201cit was time that [she] paid.\u201d Quinte-ro left Colombia on January 22, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Quintero testified that she was never kidnapped, detained, kicked, punched, or beaten. The first threatening phone call happened immediately after the girl\u2019s death, and the following calls always related to the girl\u2019s death. Quintero\u2019s counsel explained that being declared a \u201cmilitary objective\u201d is a death threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The IJ denied asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), and he ordered Quintero and her family removed to Colombia. He found that Quintero\u2019s application and testimony were largely consistent with each other, except with respect to the reason for the FARC\u2019s interest in her. He concluded that the FARC had targeted Quintero on the basis of her perceived \u201cnegligence\u201d in the patient\u2019s death, not on the basis of her political activities. Consequently, she had not established a nexus to a protected ground. The IJ further found that, even if Quintero\u2019s testimony in that respect had been credible, the threats had not been so significant or severe as to rise to the level of past persecution. Finally, there was little evidence of an objective basis for fearing future harm, as the FARC had little interest in Quintero for the first 12 years of her involvement with the Board, and the patient\u2019s death had occurred several years before the instant proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Quintero appealed to the BIA. In September 2009, while the appeal remained pending, Alejandra applied for adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen. On October 1, 2009, Alejandra filed with the BIA a \u201cMotion to Remand\u201d her individual proceedings in light of her pending application and 1-130 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">On March 18, 2010, the BIA dismissed the appeal as to all four family members. The BIA declined to address the question of Quintero\u2019s credibility, holding instead that, even if credible, her testimony did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Quintero had received numerous telephonic threats, but she was never threatened face-to-face or harmed, and the letter referencing her daughters did not declare her a military objective. Under the circumstances, whatever the FARC\u2019s motivation, the cumulative threats did not rise to the level of harm required to establish past persecution. Additionally, Quintero had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution, as there was no evidence that the FARC had continued to seek her out or that it would remain interested in her more than six years after the most recent threat and almost ten years after the incident at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Quintero timely petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s decision. On August 27, 2010, the BIA entered the following \u201cAmended Decision\u201d <em>sua sponte:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-11\">To correct an error in our original decision, the Board\u2019s order of March 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>2010, in this matter is hereby vacated and the proceedings are reinstated upon the Board\u2019s own motion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Through administrative error, we failed to examine the motion to remand pertaining only to respondent Gloria Alejandra Gutierrez Quintero ... to allow her to seek adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen. The motion to remand for respondent Gloria Alejandra Gutierrez Quintero ... was not considered in the Board\u2019s March 18, 2010, decision. Subsequent to ... March 18, 2010, the Board has also received evidence from respondent Gloria Alejandra Gutierrez Quintero ... confirming that the 1-130 application filed on her behalf has been approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\">A final order in the matter is hereby issued as of this date for respondents Gloria Janeth Quintero Quintero, ... Eduardo Alfonso Gutierrez Osorio, ... and Laura Jazmin Gutierrez Quintero, ... incorporating by reference the text of the attached vacated order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">With respect to respondent Gloria Alejandra Gutierrez Quintero, ... the motion to remand is granted and the record will be remanded to allow her to apply for adjustment of status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand pertaining to respondent Gloria Alejandra Gutierrez Quintero is granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">In December 2010, the Attorney General moved to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">We review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Alvarado v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>610 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2010). Our jurisdiction is limited to review of final orders of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 12512(a)(1); <em>Jaggernauth v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). If events occur subsequent to the filing of the petition for review that deprive us of the ability to give the petitioner meaningful relief, the case is moot and must be dismissed. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>273 F.3d 1330, 1336 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">In <em>Jaggemauth, </em>the BIA dismissed the alien\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s removal order, upon which she simultaneously petitioned for review of the decision and moved the BIA to reconsider it. <em>Jaggernauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1349-50. The BIA granted the motion to reconsider, but upheld and affirmed both the IJ\u2019s order and its original dismissal of the appeal, without changing the legal basis for its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1350. On review, we rejected the argument that a grant of a motion to reconsider, coupled with an affirmance of the original removal order, rendered the original removal order non-final. <em>Id. </em>at 1351. The BIA\u2019s order on reconsideration explicitly upheld the original order without changing its substance. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he BIA\u2019s intent was to leave the [original removal] order, as well as the reasoning underlying the order, intact and unmodified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further held, \u201c \u2018Once an issue is properly raised by a petition for review of the original decision, no purpose would be served by requiring the petitioner to raise the identical issue again in a petition to review the BIA\u2019s decision on the motion to reconsider.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352 (quoting <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 1179, 1184 (10th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">Here, the BIA\u2019s Amended Opinion was triggered by a <em>sua sponte </em>reconsideration of the March 18th order in light of the BIA\u2019s recognition that it had overlooked the material fact of Alejandra\u2019s Motion to Remand. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (b)(1). The BIA then granted Alejandra\u2019s Motion to Remand, without changing its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>or reasoning as to the other three petitioners. Thus, as to Quintero, Gutierrez, and Laura, the BIA\u2019s action closely resembled the \u201cgrant and affirmance\u201d at issue in <em>Jag-gemauth. </em>Although the BIA suggested that the entire March 18th order was vacated, it immediately reincorporated by reference the full text of that order as against Quintero, Gutierrez, and Laura, and its Amended Decision clearly shows its intent to reconsider the March 18th order only for the limited purpose of addressing Alejandra\u2019s overlooked Motion to Remand and vacating her removal order. The BIA did not intend to alter its decision or reasoning in any way as to the other three petitioners. Under the circumstances, the substance and effect of the Amended Decision were to remand Alejandra\u2019s proceedings while leaving her family\u2019s removal orders and the reasoning underlying the affirmance of those orders \u201cintact and unmodified.\u201d <em>See Jaggernauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">As Quintero properly raised her asylum-eligibility claim in the petition for review of the March 18th order, \u201cno purpose would be served by requiring [her] to raise the identical issue again in a petition to review the BIA\u2019s decision on the <em>[sua sponte </em>] motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1352 (quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we deny the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition as to Quintero, Gutierrez, and Laura.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Where, as here, the BIA writes a separate opinion that does not adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion or rely upon its reasoning, we review only the BIA\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWe will not reverse unless the record compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1006 (11th Cir.2008). Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cWe must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">\u201c[P]ersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.... \u201d <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1008 (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[M]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). In some situations, death threats in combination with assaults, kidnappings, or attempted attacks constitute persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1008-10 (collecting cases and ruling similarly on petitioner\u2019s claim). Threatening phone calls that occur in isolation or are not clearly related to an attack, though, do not rise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s contrary decision. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Although we do not rigidly require physical injury, <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1008, \u201cminor physical abuse and brief detentions do not amount to persecution,\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Here, Quintero\u2019s written statement indicated that she began to receive threatening telephone calls at work following her patient\u2019s death. She was burglarized twice, and individuals identifying themselves with the Frente de Tolima claimed responsibility. Her family relocated, but the threats resumed. The family then relocated several more times. The statement did not describe the content or frequency of the threatening phone calls, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>it did not suggest that she or anyone else was at home during the burglaries. Quintero also submitted a letter that said, \u201cWe have you and your daughters located. You will pay for the consequences, so call the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">At the hearing, she testified that the first phone call she received at the hospital merely told her \u201cnot to forget what had happened\u201d to her patient and accused her of letting the patient die on purpose. At some point, the callers began to threaten to kill Quintero and her family. She said that she received \u201cseveral\u201d of these calls over the course of three years. The callers began to contact her at home, upon which the family moved more than once, but they \u201clived in peace\u201d after they stopped answering the phone or talking to strangers. She was never kidnapped, detained, or physically harmed, she did not indicate that she ever was confronted in person, and she eventually resumed her work with the Community Action Board. A few months after she had resumed her activities, a caller told her that she was a military objective, indicated that he or she knew the location of Quintero\u2019s daughters, and threatened to kill one of the girls. Taken as a whole, the threats and the early burglaries, without more, do not compel the conclusion that Quintero\u2019s experiences rose to the level of past persecution. <em>Cf. Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1353; <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1008-10; <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED. PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-12\">. Quintero argues only that she established persecution and, thus, was eligible for asylum. She does not challenge the denials of withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act or relief under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, those issues are abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that an issue is abandoned if the initial brief fails to offer argument on it or makes only passing references to it).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
