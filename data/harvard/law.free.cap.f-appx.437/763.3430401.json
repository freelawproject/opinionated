Stearman contends that his sentence is grossly disproportionate to the offense he committed, thus constituting cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-21\">Stearman did not, however, object to his sentence on that ground in the district court, so we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights ...; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cAn error is not plain unless it is contrary to explicit statutory provisions or to on-point precedent in this Court or the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Schultz, </em>565 F.3d 1353, 1357 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-22\">\u201cIn general, a sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243-44 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted) (holding that a 140-month sentence for producing and distributing child pornography was not cruel and unusual, because the sentence was less than the statutory maximum). In fact we have \u201cnever found a term of imprisonment to violate the Eighth Amendment, and outside the special category of juvenile offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ers the Supreme Court has found only one to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1343 (11th Cir.2010). And the one \u201cextraordinary case\u201d in which the Supreme Court found a violation \u201cwas for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed on a petty criminal who wrote a bad check for $100, the latest in a string of his relatively minor, nonviolent offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1343-44 (citing <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 280-81, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 3005, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Even if we assume that Stearman\u2019s sentence was error, the error was not plain or obvious. Stearman\u2019s sentence was within the statutory range, which in general means that the sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment. Stearman\u2019s case \u201cis not one of those extraordinary cases, one of those exceedingly rare situations, in which the specified term of imprisonment violates the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1344. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in imposing Stear-man\u2019s 210-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
