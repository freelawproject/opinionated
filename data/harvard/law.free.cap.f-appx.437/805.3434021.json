Elsie Mae Miller, Pineda-Ortuno\u2019s appointed counsel for both cases, in this direct criminal appeal, has <em>filed </em>a motion to withdraw from further representation of the appellant, because counsel believes that the appeal is without merit. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Our independent review of the record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguably meritorious issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Pineda-Ortu-no\u2019s conviction, revocation of supervised release, and total sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
