The judgment of the Florida Third Circuit Court of Appeal was adverse to Dana and Patricia Brigham and they now attempt to challenge elements of the Florida proceedings in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">On appeal, the Brighams present two arguments for why the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply: (1) they argue that the Defendants defrauded the state appellate court; and (2) they argue that they did not have a reasonable opportunity to raise certain federal issues in state court. They raise the fraud argument for the first time on appeal. We have \u201crepeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d <em>Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). Thus, the sole remaining issue on appeal is whether the Brighams had a reasonable opportunity to raise their federal claims in the Florida courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">Because this appeal is of a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, our review is <em>de novo. See Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine provides that \u201clower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply to cases in which the plaintiff did not have a reasonable opportunity to raise federal claims in the state court proceedings. <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-18\">We hold that the district court did not err in concluding that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>barred the Brighams\u2019 complaint in this case. In this appeal, the Brigham\u2019s have simply offered no explanation for precisely which federal claims they were not able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>argue at the state level and what the reasons for that inability were. The only vague mention in this regard is to fraud, which, as we stated above, was an argument not made before the district court and which will not be considered by this Court. As the Brighams were state-court losers complaining of injuries from a state-court judgment and seeking district court review and rejection of that judgment, their claim is barred under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the district court. <em>See Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-13\">. The doctrine is named after two cases: <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 476, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1311, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AkJ\">. Appellees\u2019 motion for sanctions is denied.
