(\u201cNidek\u201d) on Nihon Rufuto\u2019s breach of contract claim under Alabama law. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">A. Unity Project Business Proposal</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Plaintiff Nihon Rufuto, a Japanese company, imports medical equipment from the United States and Europe. In early 2002, Nihon Rufuto approached Defendant Ni-dek, an Alabama corporation, about designing and developing an oxygen concentrator. Nihon Rufuto wanted an oxygen concentrator similar to the Mark 6 oxygen concentrator that Nidek had developed for Koike Medical for the Japanese market. However, Nihon Rufuto wanted its oxygen concentrator to be smaller and quieter, with less power consumption. The parties referred to the project as the \u201cUnity Project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">On April 19, 2002, Nidek sent Nihon Rufuto a business proposal that outlined the Unity Project, but noted that each company\u2019s contributions were still \u201cto be discussed.\u201d Nihon Rufuto\u2019s contributions would include, <em>inter alia, </em>funding the development costs, defining product specifications and coordinating third party testing and regulatory approvals (with Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health). Nidek\u2019s contributions would include, <em>inter alia, </em>agreeing with Nihon Rufuto\u2019s product specifications and project goals, preparing quality measures with Nihon Rufuto\u2019s agreement, contracting with a noise consultant and an industrial design firm and working with Nihon Rufuto\u2019s engineers to improve system performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">The business proposal contained a list of specifications and other product requirements. The specifications included an oxygen flow of three liters per minute; an oxygen concentration of greater than ninety percent;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a weight of less than 32 kilograms; a noise level of 37 A-weighted decibels in an ordinary room and 32 A-weighted decibels in an anechoic chamber; power of less than 260 watts \u201cat lOOv 50Hz\u201d and less than 300 watts \u201cat lOOv 60Hz\u201d; and meeting standard \u201cIEC 601-1 or applicable JQA standard.\u201d The concentrator would have four casters for mobility and an outlet pressure of 5 Psig. The molecular sieve would be \u201cOxy Sieve 7 or MDX.\u201d The compressor would be a \u201cThomas 32 stroke.\u201d The cabinet construction and system alarm, however, were still \u201c[t]o be discussed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">B. Condensed Project Plan and Budget</p>\n<p id=\"b805-18\">On May 8, 2002, Nidek\u2019s president, Anand Chitlangia, sent a letter to Nihon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Rufuto\u2019s president, Tadao Iehida, containing a \u201ccondensed project plan and budget\u201d prepared by Nidek for the \u201cOEM Concentrator\u201d project, i.e., the Unity Project. Chitlangia\u2019s letter stated, \u201cAlthough, as a result of our meeting, we have [a] basic understanding of your requirements, we are sure that as we progress towards this project, we will have some questions, which may change the scope of our proposal.\u201d Nidek\u2019s Chitlangia expressed \u201chope that these questions will be resolved in the next few meetings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\">Nidek\u2019s Chitlangia\u2019s letter explained that \u201c[i]n the meantime, [Nidek] ha[d] made certain assumptions\u201d in developing its project plan. Nidek\u2019s project plan divided the Unity Project into phases with Nidek coordinating \u201cthe engineering and design effort\u201d with support from Nihon Rufuto\u2019s business and technical staff. Chitlangia\u2019s letter outlined ten \u201cbroad categories\u201d of items left open for either future agreement between the parties or for future contracting with third party consultants, including an industrial design firm, a sound control consultant, electronic design consultant and a tooling supplier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">1. Specific agreement with Nihon Ru-futo for product specifications and project goals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">2. Preparation of quality measures for product and agreement with Nihon Rufuto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">3. Contracting with an industrial design firm for the purpose of preparing [sic] that meets the project goals. This will include ergonomic, appearance and packing requirement and other elements associated with the product and support as required for preparing test models <em>&amp; </em>prototypes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">4. Contracting the services of a sound Control consultant at the early stages of the product design.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-8\">5. Contracting with an electronic design consultant for the purpose of verifying electronic functions and preparation of a printed circuit board that would consolidate all electronic functions including the Oxygen Monitoring System &amp; system alarms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">6. Contracting with a tooling supplier for the preparation of necessary tooling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-10\">7. Preparation of manufacturing processes and procedures in agreement with Nihon Rufuto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-11\">8. Preparation of quality procedures and documents with agreement with Nihon Rufuto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-12\">9. Preparation of suitable manufacturing &amp; assembly area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-13\">10.Support to Nihon Rufuto engineers for the purpose of securing regulatory approvals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">Although Chitlangia\u2019s letter states that the project is divided into five phases, the attached budget listed only four phases, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">PHASE I COMPONENT REVIEW &amp; SELECTION COST: $22,500 PLUS EXPENSES*</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">PHASE II INDUSTRIAL DESIGN COST: $43,500 PLUS EXPENSES*</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">PHASE III TOOLING DESIGN COST: $31,000 PLUS EXPENSES*</p>\n<p id=\"b806-21\">PHASE IV PRE-PRODUCTION PILOT COST: $16,000 PLUS EXPENSES*</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-22\">\u2022EXPENSES: ALL OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES RELATED TO THIS PROJECT INCLUDING TRAVEL EXPENSES, COST OF 10 ALPHA PROTOTYPES, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN CHARGES, FEES FOR NOISE &amp; ELECTRONIC DESIGN CONSUL<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>TANT, TOOLING COST AND COST OF 100 PROTOTYPES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL OF ALL EXPENSES TO BE $220,000 THIS CAN BE REDUCED IF NIHON RUFUTO CO., LTD., WILL REQUIRE ONLY FEW PRE-PRODUCTION UNITS INSTEAD OF ESTIMATED 100 UNITS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The sums in the four phases total $113,000, but Nidek also would be reimbursed for out of pocket expenses, including any sums paid to the numerous consultants. Both Chitlangia and Ichida signed the May 8, 2002 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">C. Email With Target Completion Dates</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">On May 25, 2002, Chitlangia sent Ichida an email regarding the \u201cOEM Proposal\u201d that listed seven general tasks with ballpark dates for their completion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">1. We would need a written acceptance of our proposal by you. It can be done either by you signing our proposal sent to you and returning it to us or by you sending us a letter stating your acceptance. \u2014 End of May</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">2. Upon receipt of the above, we will contract with the design firm for the purpose of creating few (between 3 and 6) designs. We will forward these to you for your review. \u2014 Mid June</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">3. With your input, we will select one of the above as a final design. \u2014 3rd week of June</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">4. The next step will be to create a schematic of the entire machine, detailing the position of the components inside the machine. \u2014 1st week of July</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-13\">5. Upon approval of that from you, we will then proceed to make prototype parts and then two(2) prototypes. One will be retained at our factory to run tests and collect data and the second will be shipped to you for your engineers to run tests and collect data. \u2014 End of July</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-16\">6. This way we can compare the results and make changes as required. \u2014 1st week of August</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-17\">7. After all the changes are made then we will build one more prototype and collect data which then can be submitted to MOH of [sic] approval. \u2014 End of August</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-18\">Chitlangia\u2019s email stated, \u201cAssuming that everything proceeds without any major glitches, we will then be ready to order tooling in September.\u201d With regard to payment, Chitlangia\u2019s email added that to proceed, Nidek would need some upfront payment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-19\">1. A retainer fee of $20,000 which will be adjusted at the completion of the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-20\">2. A payment of $33,000, which represents 50% of the amount stated in our proposal for Phases I and II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-21\">3. A payment of $33,000 which will represent the balance of the amount stated in our proposal for Phases I and II. NOTE: ALL OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES WILL BE BILLED TO YOU AT THE END OF EACH MONTH. YOU WILL BE ADVICED [SIC] AND YOUR PERMISSION WILL BE REQUESTED PRIOR TO MAKING ANY MAJOR EXPENSES-IN SOME CASES THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WILL BE GIVEN WITH A DEFINITE \u2018NOT TO EXCEED\u2019 LIMITS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-22\">Ichida signed the email. From May 2002 to September 2002, Nihon Rufuto paid Ni-dek $129,350 for Nidek\u2019s work on the oxygen concentrator.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>D. Changes to First and Second Prototypes</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">In October 2002, at a trade show in Atlanta, Nidek presented Nihon Rufuto with a prototype of the oxygen concentrator. Nihon Rufuto was pleased with the prototype, but asked for some changes, including, <em>inter alia, </em>changes to the control panel, the positioning of a \u201ccannula hook suction cup\u201d and a \u201cpatient humidifier bottle.\u201d According to the notes of Paul Holman, Nidek\u2019s project manager on the Unity Project, Nidek was to \u201ccontinue to work on reducing component/unit vibration and noise\u201d and, to that end, would \u201cinvestigate the possibilities of reducing the tank boot intake size.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Between the end of 2002 and the Spring of 2003, Nidek revised the prototype based on Nihon Rufuto\u2019s comments. In March 2003, Nidek sent a second prototype to Nihon Rufuto in Japan. In an email acknowledging receipt of the revised prototype, a Nihon Rufuto employee stated that the revised prototype was impressive and that President Ichida was \u201cvery happy about this workmanship.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Nihon Rufuto email: (1) discussed changes to the location of the oxygen outlet and to the cannula check light, and (2) advised that Nihon Rufuto would \u201cfinish revising\u201d and return the prototype to Nidek.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">E. 2003 Change to Five Liter Compressor</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Throughout the rest of 2003, Nihon Ru-futo asked Nidek for even more changes. One significant change was from a three liter compressor to a five liter compressor. The five liter compressor increased the size of the motor, generated more noise, used more wattage and required some different parts. At Nihon Rufuto\u2019s request, Nidek worked on designing models with a three liter compressor and with a five liter compressor. Nihon Rufuto also asked for a redesign of the oxygen monitoring system board and tweaks to the cabinet design. At a July 2003 meeting in Birmingham, Nihon Rufuto inspected the three liter and five liter compressors. By January 2004, Nihon Rufuto planned to submit first the three liter model to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health and follow with the five liter model.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">In March 2004, Nidek shipped another three liter prototype with a 32 stroke compressor to Nihon Rufuto. After testing that prototype, Nidek determined that it met the oxygen purity, noise and wattage requirements. Nihon Rufuto\u2019s own test results confirmed a 90+ percent oxygen purity and its electrical test was positive. Nihon Rufuto advised Nidek that Nihon Rufuto would proceed with the approval application with the Ministry of Health. Over the next several months Nidek worked to prepare the prototype and the documentation Nihon Rufuto needed for the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">F.2004 Change to 2505 BLDC Compressor</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The original April 19, 2002 business proposal listed a \u201cThomas 32 stroke compressor.\u201d However, at an October 2004 meeting, Nihon Rufuto asked Nidek to incorporate a 2505 BLDC compressor into the Unity Project. The 2505 BLDC compressor was not yet sold on the market and a sample unit was unavailable for testing. Further, the 2505 BLDC compressor ran on DC power, while the Thomas compressor in the prototypes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>used AC power.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And, the 2505 BLDC compressor was more expensive. Nihon Rufuto also asked Nidek, among other things, to reduce the cabinet size. Nidek spent many hours making the requested changes and researching the 2505 BLDC compressor and the adjustments needed to incorporate it into the oxygen concentrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">At meetings in March and August 2005, Nihon Rufuto asked for even more design changes and other modifications, including reducing the weight of the concentrator by ten kilograms. Nihon Rufuto insisted on incorporating the 2505 BLDC compressor even though it was still not available on the market and also asked for drastic changes to the oxygen monitoring system board and a total cabinet redesign. According to Nidek\u2019s Holman, Nihon Rufu-to\u2019s requested changes transformed the Unity Project into \u201canother project altogether,\u201d and placed \u201cunreasonable demands\u201d on Nidek. Although Nidek spent hundreds of hours making Nihon Rufuto\u2019s changes, Nihon Rufuto did not want to pay any additional money to Nidek.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">G. 2005 Termination of Unity Project</p>\n<p id=\"AH\">On August 8, 2005, Nihon Rufuto\u2019s president Ichida sent a letter to Nidek stating that three years after the agreement to commence the Unity Project, \u201cthis project and the specification as well as the exterior design is still so far away to be accepted in [the] Japanese market.\u201d Nidek continued to make changes to the CAD database and oxygen monitory system board specification charges into 2006. Once this work was completed, Nidek submitted its drawings and documents to Nihon Rufuto. Ni-hon Rufuto turned these documents over to companies outside Nidek\u2019s control. Ni-hon Rufuto terminated the Unity Project and, in June 2006, sent a demand letter for $1,7020,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">H. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">On January 9, 2009, Nihon Rufuto filed this diversity action against Nidek alleging claims of breach of contract and fraud under Alabama law. The district court concluded that Nihon Rufuto\u2019s fraud claim was time-barred. Nihon Rufuto\u2019s appellate brief expressly abandons the fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">With respect to the contract claim, Ni-hon Rufuto alleged that Nidek\u2019s oxygen concentrator prototypes never met the agreed-upon specifications and that Nidek abandoned further efforts to fulfill its part of the contract in May 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">Following discovery, Nidek moved for summary judgment, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the terms of the alleged contract between the parties were too indefinite to be enforceable under Alabama law. The district court agreed and entered summary judgment in favor of Nidek on Nihon Ru-futo\u2019s breach of contract claim. Nihon Ru-futo filed this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Under Alabama law, to establish a breach of contract claim the plaintiff must prove: \u201c(1) the existence of a valid contract binding the parties in the action, (2) his own performance under the contract; (3) the defendant\u2019s nonperformance, and (4) damages.\u201d <em>S. Med. Health Sys., Inc. v. Vaughn, </em>669 So.2d 98, 99 (Ala.1995). Thus, Nihon Rufuto bore the burden to prove that it entered into a valid contract with Nidek. We agree with the district court that Nihon Rufuto did not present evidence of a valid contract under Alabama law.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">\u201cA contract cannot be formed without an offer, an acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent to those terms essential to the contract.\u201d <em>Drummond Co., Inc. v. Walter Indus., Inc., </em>962 So.2d 753, 754 (Ala.2006). \u201cTo be enforceable, the essential terms of a contract must be sufficiently definite and certain, and a contract that leaves material portions open for future agreement is nugatory and void for indefiniteness.\u201d <em>White Sands, </em>998 So.2d 1042 (citations, quotation marks and brackets omitted). A contract can lack definiteness as to \u201ctime of performance, the price to be paid, <em>work to be done, </em>property to be transferred, or miscellaneous stipulations in the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">\u201cThe terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and emphasis omitted); <em>see also Smith v. Chickamauga Cedar Co., </em>263 Ala. 245, 82 So.2d 200, 203 (1955) (\u201c[I]f the offer is in any case so indefinite as to make it impossible for a court to decide just what it means, and to fix exactly the legal liability of the parties, its acceptance cannot result in an enforceable agreement.\u201d). \u201cAdditionally, in order for an alleged contract to be considered void based on the indefiniteness of its terms, the indefiniteness must reach the point where construction becomes futile.\u201d <em>Poole v. Prince, </em>61 So.3d 258, 275 (Ala.2010) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201cA court will, if possible, interpret doubtful agreements by attaching a sufficiently definite meaning to a bargain if the parties evidently intended to enter into a binding contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, \u201c[w]here it is clear that a written instrument was not intended to reflect the full agreement of the parties\u201d and there is evidence that the parties reached an agreement as to omitted terms rather than left them \u201copen for future agreement,\u201d the parties may use parol evidence \u201cto clarify the omitted terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279-80 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">As evidence of an alleged contract with Nidek, Nihon Rufuto points to: (1) the May 8, 2002 letter by Nidek\u2019s Chitlangia that listed the ten broad catagories of work associated with the project; and (2) the May 25, 2002 email by Nidek\u2019s Chitlan-gia outlining seven general tasks and ballpark completion dates in 2002. In addition, Nihon Rufuto contends that Nidek\u2019s April 19, 2002 business proposal contains the product specifications and goals and is admissible parol evidence to fill in omitted terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">These three documents, even taken together, are too indefinite as to the work Nidek was to perform be enforceable. The documents reflect that many of the engineering and design details for the ox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>ygen concentrator were to be settled by future agreement or were contingent upon Nihon Rufuto\u2019s later approval. For example, according to the April 19, 2002 business proposal, both Nihon Rufuto\u2019s and Nidek\u2019s contributions were still \u201cto be discussed,\u201d and Nihon Rufuto would still need to \u201c[d]efin[e] the product specifications\u201d (although some specifications were attached), \u201c[p]rovid[e] guidance for cabinet design,\u201d and agree with the quality measures Nidek had yet to prepare. The attached list of specifications and other project requirements notes that both the system alarm and the cabinet construction are \u201c[t]o be discussed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The May 8, 2002 letter states that, after meeting with Nihon Rufuto, Nidek had \u201c[a] basic understanding of [Nihon Rufu-to\u2019s] requirements\u201d for the Unity Project, but that \u201cas [they] progress toward this project, [Nidek] will have some questions, which may change the scope of [Nidek\u2019s] proposal.\u201d After making \u201ccertain assumptions,\u201d (that are unspecified) the letter states that Nidek proposes dividing the project into four phases: component review and selection, industrial design, tooling design and pre-production pilot. The letter outlines ten \u201cbroad categories\u201d to be included in the proposed engineering and design effort, some of which will require Nihon Rufuto\u2019s approval. The first category is \u201c[s]pecific agreement with Nihon Rufuto for product specifications and project goals,\u201d clearly indicating that the parties had not yet had a meeting of the mind on those terms. The second category reiterates that Nidek will need Nihon Rufuto\u2019s agreement as to quality measures. Similarly, as to the seventh and eighth categories, Nidek will need Nihon Rufuto\u2019s agreement as to the manufacturing process and procedures and the quality procedures and documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The final document, Nidek\u2019s Chitlangia\u2019s May 25, 2002 email, outlines a series of steps Nidek proposed to take, many of which would require Nihon Rufuto\u2019s approval or \u201cinput\u201d before Nidek could proceed to the next step. For instance, Nidek agreed to select a design with Nihon Rufu-to\u2019s input and await Nihon Rufuto\u2019s approval of the machine\u2019s schematic before making prototype parts and two prototypes. Then, depending of the results of both parties\u2019 testing of the prototypes, the email contemplates changes to the design, only after which would Nidek build another prototype to be submitted for regulatory approval with the Ministry of Health. The number of contingencies and Nihon Rufuto\u2019s ability to vary the plans at different phases suggests the parties did not have mutual assent as to the work Nidek was to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Nihon Rufuto argues that any uncertainties were removed by Nidek\u2019s development of the prototypes, for which Nihon Rufuto paid Nidek $129,350. See <em>Chickamauga Cedar Co., </em>82 So.2d at 203 (stating that \u201c[o]ffers which are originally too indefinite may later acquire precision and become valid offers, by the subsequent words or acts of the offeror or his assent to words or acts of the offeree\u201d). The problem for Nihon Rufuto is that the parties\u2019 subsequent words and actions in developing the prototypes do not add precision. Instead, subsequent events only further highlight that there was no firm understanding between the parties as to what exactly Nidek was required to design.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Nihon Rufuto began asking for changes as soon as Nidek delivered the first prototype and continued asking for changes over the entire three-year period Nidek worked on the Unity Project. In addition to requests to reposition various component parts, to redesign the oxygen monitoring system board and to repeatedly tweak the cabinet design, Nihon Rufuto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>asked for three different compressors to be incorporated into the machine-first a three liter compressor, then a five liter compressor and finally a 2505 BLDC compressor. These compressor changes required Nidek to redesign other aspects of the machine and the cabinet, such that Nidek\u2019s project manager said it became \u201canother project altogether.\u201d In sum, the Unity Project was a constantly moving target, and the parties actions during the development of the prototypes did not remove the uncertainty as to what work Nidek was to perform under the alleged contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Because the three documents Nihon Ru-futo relies upon to show a contract are too indefinite as to the essential term of what work Nidek was to perform, they do not provide a basis for determining whether Nidek breached the alleged contract. Thus, under Alabama law, the alleged contract is unenforceable, and the district court properly granted summary judgment to Nidek.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-13\">. The parties later agreed on an oxygen concentration of ninety percent, plus or minus three percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-14\">.
