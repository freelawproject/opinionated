On August 23, 2010, Galvez, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>moved the district court, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to reduce his sentence on the \u00a7 846 conspiracy conviction based on Amendment 599 of the Sentencing Guidelines. At his sentencing, the court had enhanced the base offense level for the \u00a7 846 offense by two-levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); he argues now that Amendment 599 invalidated the enhancement thereby reducing the Guidelines sentencing range for his \u00a7 846 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s interpretation of Amendment 599 is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment was based on a Guidelines sentencing range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d a district court has the discretion to reduce the sentence \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements\u201d of the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, lists those Guidelines amendments that may apply retroactively to reduce a sentence, and Amendment 599 is included in the list. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). However, a sentence reduction is not authorized if the listed amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Amendment 599, which took effect on November 1, 2000, was intended \u201cto clarify under what circumstances a weapons enhancement may properly be applied to an underlying offense when the defendant has also been convicted for the use or possession of a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).\u201d <em>Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1179; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 599. Specifically, Amendment 599 revised the application note to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, the guideline for \u00a7 924(c) offenses, and provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axq\">If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under 1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A) a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a firearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); or (B) in an ongoing drug trafficking offense, the defendant possessed a firearm other than the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). However, if a defendant is convicted of two armed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>bank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in connection with only one of the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 599; <em>Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In <em>Pringle, </em>the defendant committed multiple robberies and was convicted on several counts, including a conspiracy count and a \u00a7 924(c) count. <em>Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1174-75. The \u00a7 924(c) count was predicated on a bank robbery that also formed part of the defendant\u2019s conspiracy conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1175. The defendant received weapon enhancements for several criminal acts underlying the conspiracy, but not for the bank robbery. <em>Id. </em>On appeal from the denial of the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we reasoned that \u201cAmendment 599 was promulgated in order to prevent \u2018double counting\u2019 for firearms use in any <em>one criminal event.\u201d Id. </em>at 1180. Therefore, the amendment allowed the \u201cweapon enhancements for all robberies except for the one robbery that served as the basis for [defendant\u2019s] \u00a7 924(c) conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we held that the defendant\u2019s weapon enhancements comported with Amendment 599, and a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on that amendment was not warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In this case, it is not clear what specific criminal event formed the basis for Gal-vez\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction and what criminal event underlay the two-level weapon enhancement. However, the indictment and the presentence investigation report indicate that Galvez and his co-conspirators participated in multiple criminal events that involved the use of firearms, even though Galvez personally participated in only some of these events. Therefore, several criminal acts independent of the \u00a7 924(c) offense could have properly formed the basis for Galvez\u2019s two-level enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (stating that, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, sentencing enhancements may be applied on the basis of \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions\u201d of co-conspirators). Furthermore, even if Galvez\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction was predicated on a criminal event that also formed part of his conspiracy conviction, nothing suggests that the weapon enhancement was predicated on that same criminal event within the conspiracy. Accordingly, Amendment 599 did not invalidate Galvez\u2019s two-level weapon enhancement and had no effect on his Guidelines sentencing range, thereby precluding a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1179-81; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
