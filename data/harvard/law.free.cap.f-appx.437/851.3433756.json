Dickey, through counsel, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion attacking his 135 year sentence for child pornography convictions. Dickey now claims he \u201cdid not receive constitutionally adequate counsel prior to entering his guilty plea.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Dickey\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">To establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must show (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We \u201cneed not address the performance prong if the defendant cannot meet the prejudice prong.\u201d <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000). To show prejudice in the context of a guilty plea, a petitioner must show \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">Dickey\u2019s primary contention is that his counsel erroneously advised him that his guidelines sentencing range could be anywhere from 10 to 135 years, when in fact his guidelines range was life. Even assuming counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, Dickey cannot show prejudice. At Dickey\u2019s plea hearing, the district court advised him of the minimum and maximum penalty for each count, and explained that the sentences could run consecutively. Dickey stated that he understood and was thus fully apprised of his potential sentence. Moreover, the evidence against Dickey was both overwhelming and inflammatory, such that there was no realistic chance of acquittal at a trial. Dickey has failed to establish that but for any errors by counsel, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Hill, </em>106 S.Ct. at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-10\">. Dickey received an evidentiary hearing on this claim before the magistrate judge. In his brief on appeal, Dickey contends the magistrate judge erred by not allowing expert testimony as to whether counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient and prejudicial. <em>See Freund v. Butterworth, </em>165 F.3d 839, 863 n. 34 (11th Cir.1999) (\"Permitting \u2018expert\u2019 testimony to establish ineffective assistance is inconsistent with our recognition that the issue involved is a mixed question of law and fact that the court decides.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-16\">. In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). We review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim <em>de novo. Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
