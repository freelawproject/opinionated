Charles A. Frick.</parties><headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b405-6\" pgmap=\"405\">1. Bonds issued by the Town of Keithsburg to Warsaw and Rockford Railroad Company \u2014 were issued under special charter. The bonds issued by the town of Keithsburg, on the 1st of June, 1857, to the Warsaw and Rockford. Railroad Company, for the subscription to the stock of that company by the town, were issued under the special act of 1857 to incorporate the town, and not under the general law of 1849, under which the town had previously been organized.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b405-7\" pgmap=\"405\">2. Authority of the town to take stock and issue bonds therefor. The special charter authorized the president and trustees to subscribe for and take stock, to an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, and to issue the bonds of the corporation in payment therefor, to run for a term not exceeding twenty years, to draw interest not exceeding ten per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, and to do all things in relation thereto as natural persons.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b405-8\" pgmap=\"405\">3. Subscription to stock by towns \u2014 Election not necessary. It is competent for the legislature to bestow the power directly upon a town, to subscribe for and take stock in a railroad, without requiring the subject to be submitted to a vote of the people.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b405-9\" pgmap=\"405\">4. Arid such power was bestowed upon the corporate authorities of the town of Keithsburg by the second section of the act of 1857, incorporating the town. So the question whether the stock should be subscribed for was not required to be submitted to the legal voters.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b405-10\" pgmap=\"405\">5. Subscription to stock, and issuing bonds therefor by towns \u2014 if illegal, may be legalized by the legislature. It seems, that even if a town subscribes to the stock of a railroad, and issues its bonds therefor, without authority so to do, still it is competent for the legislature to legalize and declare valid what the town may-have done in that regard.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b405-11\" pgmap=\"405\">6. So the subscription in this case by the town of Keithsburg, is good, either under the special charter of 1857, as an original subscription under the second section, or as a subscription made under the general law of 1849, confirmed, as it is, by the seventeenth section of the act of 1857.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b405-12\" pgmap=\"405\">7. Estoppel \u2014 when municipal bodies are estopped from denying the validity of their bonds. And whether the bonds were issued by virtue of the second section of the special charter of 1857, which expressly authorizes them, or under the seventeenth section, which legalizes and confirms what had previously been done, the corporation is estopped from setting up any irregularity in their issue, after having repeatedly recognized their validity by paying them out, and levying taxes and paying the interest on them for a series of years.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-4\" pgmap=\"406\">Weft of Error to the Circuit Court of Mercer county; the Hon.

Harris and Spaulding, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abq\" pgmap=\"415\">presented the following points and authorities:</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-12\" pgmap=\"415\">The first question for the court to consider, in this cause, is this:</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-13\" pgmap=\"415\">Had the said town of Keithsburg, in November, 1855, or at any time before the granting of said special charter, any legal authority to subscribe in any sum to the capital stock of said railroad company, and to issue the bonds of said town in payment of a subscription to such company %</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-14\" pgmap=\"415\">2. If said town had such authority, was it legally and properly exercised in making such subscription ?</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-15\" pgmap=\"415\">The plaintiff in error insists that said town of Keithsburg, being organized under the general law of this State incorporating towns and cities, and having no special charter, had no authority to subscribe to the capital stock of said railroad company. The statute passed at the second session of the general assembly in 1849, authorizing and empowering \u201c counties and cities \u201d to take stock in railroad companies, under the terms and conditions therein provided, was not intended by the legislature to apply to towns, and does not apply to any municipal corporations, but counties and cities. Purp. Stat. vol. 2,1072, 1073.</p><p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-16\" pgmap=\"415(18) 416(27)\">Subscriptions to the capital stock of any railroad company authorized by the above mentioned statute were placed under the control of the county court of the county or the common council of the city making such subscription, in all respects as stock owned by individuals.</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-5\" pgmap=\"416\">Towns organized under the above named general law have no common council, but are governed and controlled by a board of trustees, one of the number being president of such board, and such board of trustees has no power given it to manage and control any stock in a railroad company, such power being given only to the \u201c county court of a county \u201d and the \u201c common council of a city; \u201d much less would such board of trustees have power to subscribe for or purchase stock in any railroad company, and issue the bonds of the town in payment thereof.

It does appear that a notice of the election was given, but nothing of its contents is known, and it could not have been posted up for thirty days as required by the statute, because the said town of Keithsburg was not organized under the aforesaid general law until the 27tli day of October, 1855, and the ordinance of said town, authorizing such election, was not passed till the 30th day of October, 1855, and such election was held on the 10th day of November, 1855.</p><p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-7\" pgmap=\"416(89) 417(102)\">There is another objection to said election which is fatal to its legality \u2014 only th % freehold voters residing within the limits of said town were allowed to vote or participate in said election, all the legal voters residing in said town and not owning real estate therein were not allowed to vote at such election, thereby disfranchising a large number of the legal voters of said town, and preventing them from expressing their opinion by their votes upon the question of taking stock, or entering a subscription, for a sum not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, to the capital stock of said railroad company, although such persons, so precluded from voting, might own very large amounts of personal property which would he liable to taxation to pay the interest on such subscription. The election was held without warrant or authority of law, and was therefore null and void. Supervisors of Fulton County v. Mississippi &amp; Wabash R. R. Co. 21 Ill. 373; Clarke v.

Johnson v. The County of Stark, 24 Ill. 85; Perkins et al. v. Lewis et al., 24 id. 208. Although these cases were decided under laws of the legislature, authorizing the submission to |he legal voters of the corporation, yet the same principle applies in this case. The doctrine is recognized, that the legislature may authorize such corporations to subscribe stock to aid in constructing railroads ; and there is no.provision in the constitution requiring asubmission of such questions to the qualified voters; and the special charter of the town of Keithsburg would dispense with a compliance with the general incorporation of 1849. Perkins et al. v. Lewis et al., 24 Ill. 209; Supervisors of Schuyler co. v. People ex rel. R. I. &amp; Alton R. R. Co., 25 id. 183. It is not necessary to inquire whether the general incorporation law of 1849 authorized towns, incorporated under the general law for the incorporation of towns and cities, to subscribe stock to aid in the construction of railroads ; nor is it necessary to ascertain whether the provisions of that act were complied with in holding the election in 1855, in relation to the plaintiffs talcing stock in the Warsaw &amp; Rockford Railroad Company, as the bonds offered in evidence were not issued by the old corporation, nor under said law, but the same were issued after the incorporation under the special charter of 1851, and by and under the authority conferred and expressly given.</p><p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-5\" pgmap=\"419\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argues that these bonds were issued by virtue of the 17th section of the special charter, which refers to the subscription made by said corporation before the passage of the act of 1851, which subscription, the counsel argues,was illegal and void; and that no subsequent act of the legislature could, legalize the subscription.</p><p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-6\" pgmap=\"419\">But we submit this question: If the legislature had the power to pass a law authorizing the corporate authorities to make subscription, and issue bonds for the payment thereof,, without submitting the same to the legal voters, could they not pass a law authorizing the corporation to fulfill, ratify or confirm a contract or subscription not legally entered into ?</p><p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-7\" pgmap=\"419\">The special act of 1851, authorizing the corporate authorities to issue these bonds, is not retrospective, and does not attempt to make or cure an illegal or void, obligation. No bonds had then been issued..</p><p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-8\" pgmap=\"419(49) 420(20)\">If the corporate authorities; after accepting the charter of 1851, and organizing under it had never done anything under that charter, ratifying or confirming the subscription made by the old incorporation, and the railroad company were now trying to compel the corporate authorities to issue the bonds, the principle would be different and they might, with some reason, insist that they were not bound to issue the bonds.</p><p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-4\" pgmap=\"420\">But they have, under this charter, authorized the bonds to be issued, and have also authorized a subscription to be entered of twenty-thousand dollars to the railroad company; have issued these bonds and paid them out, and levied taxes and paid the interest on said bonds for four years thereafter, and continued to vote and represent the stock of said corporation, in the election of directors of said Warsaw &amp; Rockford Railroad Company until 1862, five years thereafter.</p><p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-5\" pgmap=\"420\">They are now estopped from setting up any irregularity in issuing these bonds, and the president and trustees were authorized by the 2d and 17th sections of the charter to issue the bonds, or at least by one of those sections, and having the authority it is now too late to inquire into the regularity of their acts in issuing them. Johnson v. The County of Stark, 24 Ill. 90.</p> <opinion data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b420-6\" pgmap=\"420\">Mr. Justice Breese</author> <p id=\"AGe\" pgmap=\"420\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b420-7\" pgmap=\"420\">The plaintiff in error contends that the town of Keithsburg, \u25a0while acting under the general incorporation law, had no authority either to take stock in a railroad company or to hold an election to vote on that question; that any subscription made by the town through its board of trustees, and the bonds issued for the same are void; that if the town had authority to hold an election for such purpose, the election, in this case, was fraudulent and void, because only \u00e1 part of the legal voters -of the town were allowed to vote; that the bonds being void, \u2022no act of recognition by the town, such as the payment of interest on them, would render them valid, nor could they be made -valid or legalized by any act of the legislature.</p> <p id=\"b420-8\" pgmap=\"420(75) 421(41)\">However it may be as to the powers of the corporation of Keithsburg, under the act of 1849, it is perhaps, not important to inquire, as these bonds were issued under the act of 1857, to incorporate the town. It is under a special charter which authorized the president and trustees to subscribe for and take stock to an -amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, -and to issue'the bonds of the corporation in payment therefor, to run for a term not exceeding twenty years, to draw interest not exceeding ten per cent, per annum, payable semi-annually, and to do all things in relation thereto as natural persons. Sess. Laws, private acts, 1857, sec. 2, p. 868.</p> <p id=\"b421-4\" pgmap=\"421\">There was no necessity to submit the question to the legal voters, as the act grants the power expressly to the president and trustees, the act having been accepted by the corporation as their charter.</p> <p id=\"b421-5\" pgmap=\"421\">But if the subscription was made under the organization allowed by the general incorporation law of 1849, the seventeenth section of the act of 1857 legalizes and confirms it, p. 874. The subscription, therefore, was good if made under the act of 1857, as an original subscription under the second section, or as a subscription made under the act of 1849 confirmed, as it is, by the seventeenth section of the act of 1857. The bonds may be regarded as issued by the old corporation confirmed by the new act, or as a new issue under the second section of the act of 1857.</p> <p id=\"b421-6\" pgmap=\"421\">That the legislature may authorize the municipal bodies to subscribe stock in railroads has been often recognized by this court. Johnson v. Stark County, 24 Ill. 75; Perkins et al. v. The President and Trustees, &amp;c., id. 208.</p> <p id=\"b421-7\" pgmap=\"421\">It is by no means a necessary element in these subscriptions that there should be a vote of the inhabitants of the town or city authorizing them. It is competent for the legislature to bestow the power directly on the corporation without any intermediary, as they did in this case.</p> <p id=\"b421-8\" pgmap=\"421\">These bonds were not issued by the corporation organized under the act of 1849, but under the authority of the special charter of 1857, consequently, all question about the election, or the fairness of it, is foreign to the case. And so is the question raised as to the power of the legislature to confirm the subscription, if made under the act of 1849. ifo bonds were, in fact, issued until after the passage of the act of 1857.</p> <p id=\"b421-9\" pgmap=\"421(35) 422(50)\">Whether, then, the bonds were issued in and by virtue of the second section of the act of 1857 or of the 17th section, we think the corporation is estopped from now setting up any irregularity in their issue, inasmuch as they have repeatedly recognized their validity by paying them out, levying taxes and paying the interest on them for a series of years. It is now too late to raise a question as to the regularity of their issue. The judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b422-5\" pgmap=\"422\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
