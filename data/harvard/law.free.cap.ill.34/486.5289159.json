The substance of a letter was as follows: \u201cIt appears that a knife is your favorite mode of settling fusses, and if that is the case, you can consider it will suit me; you are a coward, and dare not accept the offer. I want the same chance of sharpening my knife; you can set the day, and I will be on hand. Come up like a man ; choose your man, and I will choose mine. This thing must be settled. I am not a coward.\u201d This was not a challenge, but seems rather to invite one.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\" pgmap=\"486\">Writ of Error to the Circuit Court of Tazewell county; the Hon.

The defendant then called Doctor J. P. Terrel, who testified that he was a physician, and as such attended on Aulger after he had been stabbed by Asa S. Smith; that the wounds received were very severe, but not mortal; that Aulger was confined to his bed for several weeks; that at the time the letter was written Aulger was still suffering from the effects of the wound received from Smith; that Aulger was then getting better, and was able to sit up occasionally; that Aulger appeared to be very much irritated upon the subject of the difficulty with Smith.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\" pgmap=\"487\">Upon cross-examination of the prosecution, Dr. Terrel stated that he did not consider Aulger insane.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-10\" pgmap=\"487\">This was all the evidence offered in said cause.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-11\" pgmap=\"487\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; a motion for a new trial was overruled, and judgment was entered upon the verdict, imposing a fine of twenty-five dollars upon the defendant, and costs of suit.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-3\" pgmap=\"488\">The defendant brings the case here upon writ of error, and alleges the verdict is not supported by the evidence.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-4\" pgmap=\"488\">Messrs.

He admitted he wrote it, but not that he had sent it. As it was received by the hands of Andrew McGee, he should have been called to prove by what authority he bore it. If by defendant\u2019s authority or at his request, one part of the charge would have been established.</p> <p id=\"b488-9\" pgmap=\"488\">But the foolish and nonsensical letter of the wounded and infuriated German is not a challenge. It is absurd so to regard i,t. It is not an intelligible piece of composition, and instead of giving a challenge, seems rather to invite one from the witness, Smith.</p> <p id=\"b488-10\" pgmap=\"488\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b488-11\" pgmap=\"488\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
