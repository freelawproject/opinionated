They were instrumental in perpetrating the acts constituting the fraud. This is admitted by the demurrer. If indeed a person is the unconscious instrument of others in committing an injury, he is not personally liable for the consequences; but, where he knowingly engages in an unlawful course, whether for his own immediate benefit or not, he cannot escape liability by showing that he acted as an agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The amount of damages is never the subject of demurrer. This is to be determined at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Demurrer overruled, with liberty to answer in twenty days, on payment of costs of term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
