It was stated, that \u201c the indebtedness arose on a judgment in the supreme court of the state of Hew-York, in favor of Edward Bain, Lucas Hoes and William Bain, against William Kirk and \u2022 Joseph J. Bull\u00eds, and assigned to said plaintiff, and also on a bond, executed by William Kirk and Joseph J. Bull\u00eds to the said William Barthrop, in his lifetime, dated the 22d day of May, 1838, for the sum-of <em>$2,000; </em>both of which securities were given for money borrowed by the defendant; and that the sum confessed was justly due to the plaintiff without any fraud whatever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-11\">Upon this statement, judgment was entered in the office of the clerk of Columbia, on the 25th of April, for the amount confessed, with five dollars costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-12\">On the 4th day of May, 1857, the defendant executed and delivered to Jonathan.

Bull\u00eds were indebted to the estate of Bast\u00edan Bain, deceased, in the sum of $1,765.06, for money loaned to them by the executors of that estate, for which sum a judgment was confessed and entered in the supreme court; that on the 17th of May, 1844, the executors duly assigned the judgment to Edward Bain ; and that he, on the 2d day of September, in the same year, assigned the judgment to the plaintiff; and that at the time this judgment was confessed, there remained due upon the former judgment the sum of $1,817.64, with interest from the first of May, 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">It further appears, that on the 22d of May, 1838, William Barthrop loaned to the defendant and Bull\u00eds, the sum of $2,000, for which they executed a bond with a warrant of attorney to confess judgment, upon which judgment was entered in the supreme court. On the 21st of March, 1849, another judgment by confession was entered up in favor of John P. Beekman, administrator, &amp;c., against the defendant, for the same amount, upon which last-mentioned judgment there remained due the sum' of $2,262.94.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Had these facts, however briefly stated, appeared in the statement upon which the judgment in question was founded, the case would have been relieved of all difficulty. But instead of this, the only information we can derive from the statement as to the origin of the debt, is, that Edward Bain and others once recovered a judgment in the supreme court against the defendant and Bull\u00eds, for money borrowed by the defendant. What was the amount of the loan or for what sum, or when the judgment was recovered, or whether anything remained due upon it, does not app\u2019ear. The statement in respect to the other ground <em>of </em>indebtedness is less defective, but even this is insufficient. It is stated, that on a specified day the defendant and Bull\u00eds executed their bond to William Barthrop, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>lifetime, for $2,000 borrowed money, bnt it is not stated what amount remained due upon this bond. The whole statement is defective, and were this the only question in the case, I should feel constrained to grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">But it is insisted that the <em>assignee </em>of the defendant has not such a standing in court as entitles him to question the validity of the judgment. I think this position must be sustained. The court, undoubtedly, has a general jurisdiction over its own judgments and process. As between conflicting judgment creditors, it may set aside one judgment or postpone its lien to that of another. Indeed, I suppose that it is competent for the court to secure to a purchaser under its process, the right he has acquired. But it is only a judgment creditor, or one claiming under him, that is authorized to invoke the summary exercise of the equitable jurisdiction of the court to set aside an illegal or fraudulent judgment. A creditor at large cannot be heard. <em>(See Wintringham </em>agt. Wintringham, 20 <em>John. </em>296.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">As against the debtor, the judgment is valid. It does not lie with him to take advantage of the defect in his own statement. The object of the statute, as all know, was to guard against fraud and to aid creditors in its detection. The debtor himself needs no such protection or aid. When he makes a voluntary assignment, he substitutes the <em>assignee </em>for himself. As assignee, he represents the debtor, and as <em>trustee, </em>he represents the creditors at large. We have seen that neither debtor nor the creditors at large occupy a position which enables them to question the validity of the judgment. It follows that the voluntary assignee cannot be heard on that question. <em>(See Searing </em>agt. <em>Brinkerhoff, </em>5 <em>John. Ch. </em>329 ; <em>Griffin </em>agt. <em>Mitchell, </em>2 <em>Cowen, </em>548.) Upon this ground, the motion must be denied, but as the question is new, it should be without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
