That he received on such sale the sum of $10.57, over and above the amount of.judgment and fees, for collection. On this evidence, the justice rendered judgment in favor of defendant for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">On appeal, the county court affirmed the judgment, on the ground, <em>\u201c </em>that there was no evidence of an intention on the part of the constable to withhold the overplus from the judgment debtor.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-7\">J.

The manner in which a constable shall sell goods, and chattels, is directed by statute; and in the same section it is provided, that the constable shall return the execution and-pay the debt or damages and costs levied, to the justice who issued the same, returning the overplus, if any, to the person against whom the execution issued.

The plaintiff expressly sanctions the proceedings, by bringing this action for the overplus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-9\">II. In order to maintain an action for overplus moneys in the hands of a constable, arising from a sale of property by virtue of an execution, it is necessary to make a demand upon the officer for its payment, before suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-10\">1. A person to be eligible to the office of constable, must be <em>an elector </em>of the town for which he is chosen. (1 <em>R.

On the 21st of December, 1855, the constable under said execution made a levy on two cows; on the 29th of December, 1855, he sold one cow, for a sum which exceeded the execution and his fees, by $10.57. At some time prior to the day of trial of this suit, the constable paid to the plaintiff in that execution, the amount due to him. On the 4th day of January, 1856, this present plaintiff commenced against the constable this suit, for the $10.57 surplus moneys, on the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>of the cow. The justice gave judgment for the defendant ; which judgment the county court affirmed, (on appeal, by plaintiff,) on the ground that the action was prematurely brought, as the return day of the execution had not arrived, nor had the plaintiff made any demand of the surplus moneys. From that judgment of the county court the plaintiff appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The cases cited \"by plaintiff, are all instances where sheriffs having executions of courts of record, had allowed the <em>return </em>day to pass, and had neither paid the moneys into court, (as in such courts they may,) nor paid them to the party whose they were. There indeed, there can he no doubt that a <em>demand </em>was not necessary before suit, as the officer by <em>doing his duty and paying the money into </em>court, could have discharged himself from all liability. But here the case is entirely different. The justice could not receive this money: nor could any one but the plaintiff. <em>When </em>was the constable, (where no <em>demand </em>was made on him,) bound to pay it ? By 2 Revised Statutes, (4th ed.,) p. 448, \u00a7 131, he must return the execution, pay debt, &amp;c., to justice, \u201c <em>returning </em>the overplus,\u201d to the defendant in the'execution. This \u201creturning,\u201d does not precede the return of the execution, but follows it; and for the return of the execution he has till the return day; until which day, even though he has collected the money, he is not obliged to make his return. To be sure, in this case, he actually was very prompt in doing his duty, and did have the execution satisfied before this <em>trial. </em>Though it does <em>not </em>appear anywhere in the case, that the execution was <em>actually returned </em>before the. trial of this cause. I can see no possible ground of accusing the officer of any actual neglect of duty; and I fully concur with both county court and justice, in saying that, where the return day was not past, and no demand of the surplus moneys had been made, the plaintiff\u2019s action was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">County court judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Rote.\u2014In the case of <em>Vence </em>agt. <em>Vence, </em>ante, <em>page </em>491, the order was appealed from, and the appeal argued at the'May general term, 1858, at Elmira, before <em>Justices </em>Gray, Mason, Balcom <em>and </em>Campbell, and the order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
