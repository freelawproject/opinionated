John L. Whiton, Ex\u2019r, &amp;c.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-6\">Where a creditor holds a claim against executors or administrators, and desires a <em>reference </em>under the statute, he must first move on the subject of the reference. Neither party is bound to refer, and if either desires a reference, he must offer to refer. The executor or administrator cannot be said to <em>refuse </em>until the claimant in some way manifests his willingness to refer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-7\">An unqualified rejection of the claim, unaccompanied with an offer to refer, is not equivalent to a refusal to refer. <em>(The contrary of this was held in Fort </em>agt. <em>Good</em>ing, 9 <em>Barrb. </em>394.) A neglect to answer an offer or proposition to refer, may be deemed a refusal.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-8\">\n<em>At Chambers, by consent of counsel, Penn Yam,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aq0\"><em>May </em>30, 1856.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Atv\">Motion on report of referee, pleadings and affidavits, by plaintiff, on a claim against executors, that judgment be entered on the report <em>with costs, </em>and by defendant that referee make a further report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-9\">A. V. Harpending, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-10\">H. A. Dowe, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b310-11\"><em>\u25a0</em>Welles, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AcWQ\">Both motions must be denied. It does not appear that the plaintiff ever requested a reference under the statute before action brought, nor that the defendant ever refused such reference. The defendant positively denies in his affidavit, that any one ever proposed a reference, or that he ever refused to consent to one.'</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">There must be a <em>refusal or </em>something equivalent. \u00a1Neither appears in this case. A neglect to answer an offer or proposition to refer, may be deemed a refusal, but the creditor must first move on the subject of the reference. In <em>Fort </em>agt. <em>Gooding, </em>(9 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>394,) Willard, Justice, says: \u201c An unqualified rejection of the claim, unaccompanied with -an offer o refer, is equivalent to a refusal to refer.\u201d I cannot agree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>this proposition. A rejection of the claim is no evidence one way or the other on the subject of a reference, or of the willingness of either party to refer. Neither party is bound to refer; and if either desires a reference, he must offer to refer. The executor or administrator cannot be said to refuse until the claimant in some way manifests his willingness to refer. (2 <em>R. S. </em>90, \u00a7 41; <em>Stephenson </em>agt. <em>Clark, </em>12 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Nor was payment unreasonably resisted or neglected. After the defendant had paid $100 on the claim, he was advised by counsel that the whole demand was illegal; and as he understood the facts of the case, he was justified in making a defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">There is not sufficient shown on the part of the defendant to justify an order calling upon the referee to make a further report. It was competent for the defendant to have made a case and moved for a new trial, if he thought there was any error committed by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">No costs are allowed to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Note.\u2014The foregoing decision affirmed on appeal, Monroe general term, September, 1851, before Johnson, T. R. Strong- &amp; Smith, Justices.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
