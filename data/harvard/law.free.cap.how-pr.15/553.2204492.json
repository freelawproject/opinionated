And no other warrant shall be necessary for such purpose.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b560-5\">In this case, which was a bill of the-relator, for furnishing stationery to the tax' -commissioners in April and May, 1851, <em>held, </em>that an audit and allowance by the board of supervisors, was not sufficient to authorize its payment; it must be examined and allowed by the auditor and approved by the comptroller.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b560-6\"><em>New </em>- <em>York General Term,</em></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A4D\"><em>March, </em>1858.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-7\">The relator, in the months of April and May, 1857, furnished stationery amounting to $167.13, to the tax commissioners of the city of bTew-York, which was used by them in the performance of their official duties.

Willard, <em>for relator,</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-9\">A. R. Lawrence, Jr., <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b560-10\">By the court\u2014Davies, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A5j\">If this were a legal county charge, after its audit and allowance by the board of supervisors, a mandamus would- lie to the county treasurer, to compel its payment. <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Stout, </em>13 <em>How. </em>314; <em>Same </em>agt. <em>Same, in Downing's case, </em>4 <em>Abb. </em>25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">But the act of April 15th, 1857, <em>(Laws of </em>1857, <em>ch. </em>590,) has introduced ah entire change as to the powers of the supervisors of the county of New-York, and the mode of keeping their accounts, and the payment of county charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">By section 6-of this act, the comptroller of the corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>of New-York, is made the fiscal officer of the hoard of supervisors, and has the same powers in reference to the fiscal concerns of said hoard, that he possesses in regard to the concerns of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">And this section further declares: \u201c That all moneys drawn from the treasury, by authority of the board of supervisors, shall be upon vouchers for the expenditure thereof, examined <em>and aMovued </em>by the auditor and approved by the comptroller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">It is therefore too clear to admit of controversy, that since the act of 1857, an audit and allowance by the board of supervisors is not sufficient to authorize the payment of any money out of the treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">To comply with the mandate of this law, in addition to such audit and allowance by the board, the same must be examined and allowed by the auditor, and as a further check and safeguard, be approved of by the comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">As in this case, there has been no examination and allowance by the auditor, nor any approval by the comptroller, which can only be after the auditor has examined and allowed the account, and which approval is made as essential as the auditor\u2019s examination and allowance\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The judgment of the special term denying the motion for a mandamus, must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
