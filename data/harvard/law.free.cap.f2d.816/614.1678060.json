He subsequently filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that a government witness, Timothy Peglar, was induced through police harassment to give perjured testimony, and that Gay\u2019s counsel was ineffective. Gay claimed his counsel was inadequate because, among other things, he did not investigate Peglar\u2019s reason for testifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>or the extent of Peglar\u2019s criminal record. This \u00a7 2255 motion was denied on the merits, and the denial was affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Gay, </em>767 F.2d 936 (11th Cir.1985) (unpublished opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Gay then filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion, alleging that the prosecution failed to disclose to his counsel that Peglar had a state criminal charge pending against him at the time of Gay\u2019s arrest, that this charge was dismissed in exchange for Peglar\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The government moved to dismiss Gay\u2019s second motion as successive under Rule 9(b), rules foil. \u00a7 2255 or, alternatively, because Gay\u2019s allegations were conclusory and without factual basis. Gay responded, explaining that he failed to allege these grounds in his prior \u00a7 2255 motion because of his \u201clack of legal knowledge\u201d and \u201climited legal perceptions.\u201d He also argued he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The district court found that Gay\u2019s failure to raise these grounds in his prior motion constituted an abuse, and denied the motion. In doing so, the court pointed out that Gay\u2019s most recent allegations were \u201cremarkably similar to those supporting his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his first petition,\u201d and found that Gay failed to account adequately for his reasons for omitting these grounds in his first motion. The court ruled that Gay\u2019s stated excuse, his lack of legal knowledge, was not a legitimate reason for the omission. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">[T]he pleadings, briefs and motions filed with this petition, the first section 2255 motion, as well as his numerous motions for appeal and mandamus from the Eleventh Circuit demonstrate that while Mr. Gay is proceeding pro se, he has the ability to understand the legal significance of the facts and circumstances of his case and some appreciation of the legal concept of abuse of the motion remedy. The court notes that Mr. Gay is no stranger to the courthouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">Petitioner has advanced no legitimate reasons for his failure to assert arguably successive grounds in his first motion. <em>See e.g., Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. [1] at 15-17, [83 S.Ct. 1068, 1077-78, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963)]; <em>Funchess v. Wainwright, </em>788 F.2d 1443 (11th Cir.1986); <em>Humphrey v. United States, </em>766 F.2d 1522 (11th Cir.1985). Nor has Mr. Gay shown that his petition is based on grounds of which he could not have had knowledge by the exercise of reasonable diligence. On the contrary, petitioner\u2019s statement of facts indicates that he possessed all the relevant facts about Timothy Peglar before his trial and well in advance of his first section 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKU\">Gay then filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging for the first time that he had not brought the present claims regarding Peglar in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion because he did not discover the information until that action was on appeal to this court. He alleged that he raised the issue in that appeal, but this court refused to address it as it was improperly raised for the first time on appeal. The district court denied Gay\u2019s motion for reconsideration without further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">Gay argues on appeal that he did not learn of the new facts until after his first \u00a7 2255 motion was on appeal to this court and that his lack of legal knowledge should constitute \u201ccause and excusable omission\u201d because he never intentionally withheld a \u201cperceived issue based upon known facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Azkm\">The government argues that Gay did not meet his burden of showing that his current motion was not an abuse of the rules governing \u00a7 2255. Gay\u2019s proffered excuse to the district court was that he was not a trained attorney and, the government asserts, the district court was not told that Gay was factually ignorant of the new ground until after its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">When a defendant presents new grounds for relief in a later \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court muse address those grounds \u201cunless the movant\u2019s failure to prosecute these grounds earlier constitutes an abuse of the motion remedy.\u201d <em>Humphrey v. United States, </em>766 F.2d 1522, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>1524 (11th Cir.1985) <em>citing Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963). The government must plead abuse, and then \u201cthe burden shifts to the movant to show that his failure to assert the new grounds in an earlier motion does not comprise an abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The movant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was ignorant of facts necessary to support the new ground when the prior motion was filed, or that he had not realized that those facts provided the basis for \u00a7 2255 relief. <em>See Booker v. Wainwright, </em>764 F.2d 1371, 1376-77 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 339, 88 L.Ed.2d 324 (1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If, however, the movant intentionally withheld a claim from the previous petition, or was inexcusably neglectful, the motion may be dismissed. <em>Haley v. Estelle, </em>632 F.2d 1273, 1375 (5th Cir.1980) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Here, we hold that the government properly pled abuse of the \u00a7 2255 process, and that Gay failed to show that he was not abusing the writ. First, we agree with the district court that Gay\u2019s first argument, that his lack of legal knowledge prevented him from asserting these claims earlier, is untenable. By his own admission, Gay knew that these facts stated a claim for \u00a7 2255 relief. Additionally, assuming that the claims in Gay\u2019s motion for rehearing were properly before the district court, his contention that his successive claims are based on newly discovered facts is also suspect. Gay failed to allege that his claims were premised on \u201cnew\u201d facts until his motion for reconsideration, and provided no support for his assertion that he was unaware of these facts when filing the first motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, as the district court found, these \u201cnew\u201d facts bear a striking resemblance to the facts he asserted in his previous petition. All of the \u201cnew\u201d allegations relate to Peglar\u2019s credibility, an issue explored at length in Gay\u2019s first petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court did not err in finding that Gay failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was ignorant of the facts necessary to support the new grounds when he filed his previous motion. <em>See Sanders v. United States, </em>83 S.Ct. at 1078-79. The judgment of the district court dismissing his petition is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">. Although <em>Booker </em>analyzes abuse of a writ of habeas corpus, the principles developed in habeas cases also apply to \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>See Sanders v. United States, </em>83 S.Ct. at 1078.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">. For example, in the statement of facts to the district court supporting his second motion, Gay maintained that, in 1980, his Aunt (who he claims was also Peglar\u2019s grandmother) called Gay\u2019s sister and told her that Peglar had been arrested by the City of Griffin, Georgia\u2019s police department for attempting to sell a car without proof of legal title. In his petition for rehearing, Gay claimed that <em>this </em>is the charge that was dismissed pursuant to an alleged agreement to have Peglar testify against him. Gay never explained why it took four years for his sister to convey this information to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b706-9\">. We note in passing that the district court could have made short shrift of Gay\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims on the merits, had they been reached. In Gay\u2019s prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court made a specific finding that \u201cPeglar\u2019s testimony simply was not crucial to the prosecution.\u201d Although <em>res judicata </em>does not operate in the \u00a7 2255 arena, <em>see Sanders v. United States, </em>83 S.Ct. at 1075-77, Gay has alleged no new facts which affect the district court\u2019s finding that Peglar\u2019s testimony was not crucial to Gay\u2019s conviction. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3381-84, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose exculpatory evidence in response to a defense request amounts to constitutional error only if there is a reasonable probability that such evidence would have affected the outcome of trial). Moreover, this finding was buttressed by our conclusion, in evaluating Gay\u2019s original \u00a7 2255 motion, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-13\">Even in the absence of all evidence that could be affected by counsel's alleged errors, there is more than sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Gay v. United States, </em>No. 83-194-2 MAC at 7-8 (M.D.Ga. July 19, 1984); <em>see Strickland v. Washington </em>[466 U.S. 668], 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-69 [80 L.Ed.2d 674] (1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZP\">These alleged errors included counsel\u2019s failure to investigate Peglar\u2019s police record, and failure to adequately cross-examine him. Thus, on the merits, this second attack on Peglar\u2019s credibility serves no purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
