Tenney, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1377-15\">KEARSE, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1377-16\">Plaintiff is an organization established by collective bargaining between the United Federation of Teachers and the City of New York. It maintains an employee welfare benefit plan that is subject to federal regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). Plaintiff is also subject to New York\u2019s Human Rights Law, N.Y.Exec. Law \u00a7 296 (McKinney 1972 &amp; Supp.1980-1981) (\u201cHRL\u201d). HRL requires that disability benefit plans such as plaintiff\u2019s provide benefits for disabilities related to pregnancy on the same basis as for other disabilities. Plaintiff\u2019s plan excludes pregnancy-related disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-17\">Plaintiff commenced the present action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the HRL on the grounds that the HRL was preempted by ERISA, by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(1976), and by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court, Milton Pollack, Judge, 451 F.Supp. 333, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that prior judgments in state court collaterally estopped plaintiff from litigating its claim of ERISA preemption, and that the pendency of forty-odd actions in state court against plaintiff for enforcement of the HRL mandated abstention pursuant to <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 45, 91 S.Ct. 746, 751, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), as to plaintiff\u2019s other claims. We affirm, largely on the basis of our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>filed today in <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Kramarsky, </em>650 F.2d 1287 <em>(\u201cDelta\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s principal contention is that \u00a7 514(a) of ERISA, which provides that ERISA \u201csupersede[s] any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan,\u201d preempts the HRL and forbids its enforcement with regard to plaintiff\u2019s employee benefit plan. As we have discussed at greater length in <em>Delta, </em>this contention is made untenable by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent action in <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Minnesota, </em>444 U.S. 1041, 100 S.Ct. 725, 62 L.Ed.2d 726 (1980), dismissing an appeal based on an identical contention for want of a substantial federal question. For the reasons stated in <em>Delta, </em>plaintiff\u2019s claim that ERISA preempts the HRL lacks merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">We also reject plaintiff\u2019s other federal claims<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for reasons discussed in <em>Delta. </em>The contention that New York\u2019s interpretation of the requirements of HRL violated the Supremacy Clause because it differed from the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the requirements of Title VII in <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976), is plainly without merit. New York may interpret the HRL in any fashion it chooses, consistent with federal law; and, as we held in <em>Delta, </em>its present interpretation is not inconsistent with Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">Finally, plaintiff\u2019s equal protection claim is untenable. Plaintiff contended that the enforcement of the HRL against it lacked any \u201creasonable basis\u201d in view of the provisions of New York\u2019s Disability Benefits Law (\u201cDBL\u201d), N.Y.Work.Comp.Law \u00a7 205(3) (McKinney 1965), that formerly relieved private employers of any obligation to provide benefits for pregnancy-related disability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This contention is groundless. New York did not discriminate in its application of the HRL, but enforced it against all employers. And in any event New York\u2019s method of harmonizing the HRL with the apparently inconsistent DBL, <em>see Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v. New York State Human Rights Appeal Board, </em>41 N.Y.2d 84, 390 N.Y.S.2d 884, 359 N.E.2d 393 (1976), is perfectly rational and scarcely offends the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">. The district court\u2019s decision in the present case was handed down in 1978 and a notice of appeal was timely filed. Thereafter, the parties agreed to withdraw the appeal, without prejudice to its reinstatement, pending the district court\u2019s decision in the <em>Delta </em>case. The appeal was reinstated after that decision was rendered in January 1980, and was argued in tandem with the appeal in <em>Delta.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1378-8\"><em>. </em>We would affirm the judgment on this point in any event on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned collateral estoppel holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AV8U\">. The Fund also alleged, as a matter of state law, that it was not subject to the jurisdiction of New York\u2019s Division of Human Rights and that the Commissioner had exercised his authority in an arbitrary and capricious manner. No independent basis for federal jurisdiction over these claims is asserted in the complaint, and they are dismissable for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AOC\">. As we noted in the <em>Delta </em>case, New York has amended the DBL so that it now mandates minimum benefits for pregnancy-related disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
