We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Aldendifer, Bickford and Powers (the \u201cPilots\u201d) worked for Continental Air Lines for approximately 35 years. They served for many years as Captain, or pilot-in-command. Continental's aircraft carry a three-person cockpit crew: a Captain; a First Officer (second-in-command or co-pilot); and a. Second Officer (third-in-command). FAA regulations, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.-383(c), prohibit certified commercial passenger airlines from using Captains or First Officers over age 60. This rule does not apply to Second Officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">All Continental pilots \u201cbid\u201d for their choice of seat assignment (Captain, First Officer, or Second Officer), flight route, and aircraft model for every flight; the senior bidder prevails. In April 1976, just before their 60th birthdays, the Pilots each attempted to \u201cdownbid\u201d for the position of Second Officer. Continental rejected their bids. The Pilots all reached age 60 in May 1976, and all were involuntarily retired on June 1, 1976, under pension plans designating age 60 as the \u201cnormal\u201d retirement age.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">The Pilots brought this action in April 1978, alleging that Continental denied their bids to Second Officer and forced them to retire in violation of ADEA Section 4(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). At trial, Continental responded that it rejected the bids for safety reasons. Continental's only witness, the Vice President for Pilot Operations for Continental Air Lines, testified that the presence in the cockpit of Second Officers with considerably more command experience than the Captain could dilute the junior Captain\u2019s command authority during a crisis and weaken cockpit discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">The district court entered judgment for Continental. The court concluded that Continental\u2019s actions fell within the Section 4(f)(1) and (2) exceptions to the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(1) and (2), holding that (1) the retirement plan required mandatory retirement at age 60, or alternatively permitted involuntary age 60 retirement at Continental\u2019s option; and (2) safety reasons justified rejecting the Pilots\u2019 bid to Second Officer, either as a reasonable factor other than age, or because safety considerations made age a bona fide occupational qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">ADEA Section 4(a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-17\">\u201c[T]o discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age;\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">The ADEA covers individuals between ages 40 and 65, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631, but does not prohibit all forced retirements prior to age 65. The version of Section 4(f)(2) in effect at the time the Pilots retired in 1976 provided in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARM\">\u201c(f) It shall not be unlawful for an employer ... or labor organization\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(2) to observe the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter, .29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. McMann, </em>434 U.S. 192, 98 S.Ct. 444, 54 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977), the Supreme Court held that Section 4(f)(2) applies to retirement plans that require the mandatory retirement of plan members at a designated age. The United plan set age 60 as its \u201cnormal retirement age.\u201d However, United uniformly required the retirement of all covered personnel at age 60. The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap6\">\u201cThe employee has no discretion whether to continue beyond the \u2018normal\u2019 retirement age. United legally may retain employees such as McMann past age 60, but it has never done so: its policy has been to retire all employees at the \u2018normal\u2019 age. Given these facts, we concluded that <em>for the purposes of this decision, the plan should be regarded as one requiring retirement at age 60 rather than as one permitting it at the option of the employer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in the original.) 434 U.S. at 196, 98 S.Ct. at 447 (quoting from the. Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>McMann v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 217, 219 (4th Cir. 1976).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Pilots\u2019 contention that their pension plan does not require mandatory retirement for cockpit personnel at age 60 is not persuasive in light of <em>McMann. </em>The plan does not expressly provide for mandatory retirement at age 60, but it does designate age 60 as the \u201cnormal retirement age.\u201d The Pilots observe that the original version of an explanatory booklet distributed to all plan members describes retirement at age 60 as \u201cvoluntary\u201d. The booklet, however, was updated in 1966 and no longer contains this information. Moreover, Continental has rejected the bids of ten pilots who previously attempted to downbid to Second Officer at age 60. Twenty-one of twenty-three pilots covered by the plan retired at age 60. Those that continued working served exclusively in management positions pursuant to plan provisions for post-60 retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">On the basis of the specific terms of the pension plan and Continental\u2019s uniform retirement practices, we conclude that the district court\u2019s ruling that the Pilots\u2019 retirement plan provided for mandatory retirement of cockpit personnel at age 60 was not clearly erroneous. We need not, therefore, determine whether Continental rejected the Pilots\u2019 downbids because of reasonable factors other than age, or age as a bona fide occupational qualification under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(1), and we express no opinion concerning the district court\u2019s analysis of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The Pilots contend in the alternative that Continental\u2019s actions violated the 1978 amendment to ADEA Section 4(f)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which prohibit mandatory retirement pursuant to a bona fide pension plan solely on the basis of age. This argument lacks merit. The 1978 amendment does not apply retroactively. <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Com\u2019n v. Shell Oil Co., </em>637 F.2d 683 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Jensen v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>623 F.2d 406 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Smart v. Porter Paint Co., </em>630 F.2d 490 (7th Cir. 1980); <em>Sikora v. American Can Co., </em>622 F.2d 1116 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>Marshall v. Delaware River &amp; Bay Authority, </em>471 F.Supp. 886 (D.Del. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">In a petition for rehearing the appellants argue that <em>Benzel v. Valley National Bank </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>of Arizona, </em>633 F.2d 1325 (9th Cir. 1980), compels a different result. The two cases, however, have nothing in common except the age discrimination statute. <em>Benzel </em>reversed a summary judgment because material questions of fact remained to be decided. Therefore the <em>Benzel </em>court could not hear evidence as to uniform retirement practices, whether the plan had a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement date, or whether plaintiffs were forced to retire at one of several retiremenet ages designated in the plan. The decision in this case affirmed a judgment after a trial in which it was established that the retirement plan for all practical purposes was involuntary as applied to cockpit crews and that the differences between the facts in this case and those in <em>United Airlines, Inc. v. McMann, </em>434 U.S. 192, 98 S.Ct. 444, 54 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977), were so insubstantial \u25a0 as to be meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The petition for rehearing is denied and the suggestion for rehearing en banc is rejected.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\">.
