RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1418-21\">A Louisiana resident who was a minority shareholder in a corporation voted against its proposed merger into another corporation. The merger was approved on the strength of the voting power of the majority shareholders. Once the merger was consummated, the minority shareholder sought relief in federal district court on a variety of federal securities law claims and on pendent claims for violation of state-imposed duties. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of the plaintiff shareholder against the corporate officers and directors based on the pendent claims, and, therefore, reach the federal claims only in regard to the remaining defendants, the corporate attorney and the surviving corporation. As to these defendants, we also affirm the judgment in favor of the minority shareholder. We reverse that part of the judgment awarding a derivative recovery to the merged corporation. Because the trial court\u2019s award of damages failed to consider the value of the stock received by the minority shareholder in the merger, we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>mand for calculation of a reduction in the damages to reflect that value. Finally, we modify the judgment to eliminate the award of attorney\u2019s fees because we perceive no legal basis for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">Road Equipment Company, Inc., a Louisiana corporation engaged in selling construction equipment, was organized in 1959 by Walter Crory, his wife, Chesley Crory and James G. Junker. Walter Crory owned all the voting stock in that corporation. Junker joined Road as a salesman and was elected vice-president and general sales manager at the time of Road\u2019s incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">Another Louisiana corporation, Reco Investment Corporation, was organized in 1962 by Walter Crory, Chesley Crory, James Carmen, Jack Walter and Junker to acquire, improve, and lease industrial property. Junker paid $162 for 162 shares of the 1,000 shares of Reco common stock outstanding. Reco subsequently purchased from the Illinois Central Railroad three adjacent tracts of land in 1963,1965, and 1967 respectively. Reco improved the properties by constructing a brick office building on one tract in 1963 and a steel office building on another in 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">Although it is not clear from the record whether he quit or was fired, Junker\u2019s employment with Road terminated in late 1965 and he started another business that competed directly with Road. Crory claimed that a settlement agreement entered into with Junker when he left Road\u2019s employ required the surrender of Junker\u2019s 162 shares of Reco stock. However, the trial court found that Junker retained ownership of his Reco shares after he ended his relationship with Road. That finding, which is not directly attacked by the defendants on appeal, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-10\">Thus, Junker owned 16.2% of Reco, <em>i. </em>e., 162 of 1000 outstanding shares of stock. The other 83.8% of Reco was owned by Walter Crory (28.4%), Chesley Crory (21.2%), Joseph Mongogna (9%), James Carmen (16.2%) and Jack Walter (9%), all of whom were joined as defendants in this action. These five defendants constituted the board of directors and officers of both Reco and Road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">In 1963, Reco leased to Road one of its industrial properties including the office building located on it for a monthly rental of $1,200. The lease had a term of ten years with an option to renew for an additional ten years at a monthly rental of $1,320. In 1972, subsequent to Junker\u2019s departure from Road and without notifying him, Reco entered into a new twenty-five year lease with Road at a monthly rental of $1,200, which was increased to $1,320 in 1973. The new lease expanded the size of the leased premises and included a renewal option for another twenty-five years at a $1,500 monthly rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-12\">From Reeo\u2019s inception it had paid Road a management fee of $1,200 annually. After Junker\u2019s departure from Road, the boards of directors, of the two corporations agreed to increase the management fee to $3,600 a year. Subsequently, the fee was again increased to $4,800 per annum. Junker received no notice of these increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-13\">Junker did receive notice of a Reco shareholders\u2019 meeting held in April 1973, to discuss Reco\u2019s indebtedness to Road in the amount of $71,735. This debt represented the management fees and monies advanced by Road for Reco\u2019s other expenses. Thus, the rental being paid by Road was apparently inadequate to cover the expenses incurred by Reco in connection with the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>erty it leased to Road. The shareholders\u2019 meeting notice indicated that, if the capital needed to satisfy the debt could not be raised, dissolution of Reco might be necessary. At that meeting, Frederick Heisler, an attorney who represented Walter Crory, as well as Reco and Road, and who attended the meeting as proxy for Walter and Chesley Crory, was appointed chairman. He explained that Reco would either have to borrow the funds needed to pay the Road debt or liquidate. Junker\u2019s proxy attended the meeting and made a motion that Reco retain an appraiser to determine the fair market value and fair rental value of its property. He also moved that, in the event Reco was unable to locate a tenant willing to pay that fair rental value, the property be sold at its fair market value. He also proposed that, if the appraisal established that the rentals paid by Road were inadequate, the lease between Reco and Road be terminated and Reco seek damages from its officers and directors. The motion was not seconded and thus never came to a vote. The liquidation was approved over Junker\u2019s opposition and Heisler was appointed as liquidator. Shortly thereafter, Junker, through his attorney-proxy, wrote a letter to Reco\u2019s board of directors stating his belief that Reco\u2019s property had greatly increased in value and that the rentals paid by Road to Reco were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Junker received notice in July, 1973, of another Reco shareholders\u2019 meeting to discuss rescission of the liquidation order and a merger of Reco and Road on a book value basis. Heisler was once again present, this time as proxy for Chesley Crory and James Carmen. He stated that, in the opinion of the real estate experts to whom he had spoken, liquidation was not feasible because of the then existing credit crunch and high interest rates. Heisler suggested that, because Reco was unable to satisfy its indebtedness to Road, the only alternative was to merge Reco into some other company, such as Road, and that by merging Reco into Road, the debt owed to Road would be extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-7\">Junker voted to terminate the liquidation of Reco, but he voted his 162 shares against the proposed merger with Road. However, the defendants voted the remaining 838 shares of Reco in favor of the merger. The 83.8% of the voting power controlled by the defendants was sufficient to approve the merger. Because the merger was approved by at least 80% of the total voting power, Junker was not entitled to demand that Reco pay him fair cash value for his shares pursuant to La.Rev.Stat. 12.-131.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-8\">The defendants, constituting and acting as Reco\u2019s board of directors, approved the merger. They also approved the merger in their capacity as officers and directors of Road. The merger formula required the exchange of one share of Reco stock, which had a per share book value of $17.55, for one and a half shares of Road stock, which had a book value of $12.73 per share. Thus, Junker received 265.52 shares of Road for his 162 shares of Reco stock. Book values of Reco\u2019s land and buildings were used in determining the merger formula despite the fact that the Reco property was located in an area where real estate values had ballooned since the time the property was acquired and despite the fact that the cost of constructing buildings had also risen substantially.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">The court credited the expert testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s appraiser as to the fair value of Reco\u2019s property. The defendants offered no expert testimony but relied on sales of what they contended were comparable properties to argue that the expert testimony was incorrect. The trial judge did not consider this sufficient to impugn the expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>The following table sums up the testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">COST (PURCHASE PRICE) DEFENDANTS\u2019 VALUATION FOR MERGER FORMULA IN 1973 PLAINTIFF\u2019S EXPERT\u2019S VALUATION <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxI\">1973 1975</p>\n<p id=\"AsY\">3 parcels of land $ 89,122.52 $100,286.48 $338,700.00 $463,500.00</p>\n<p id=\"Al-2\">2 buildings 154,049.36 95,000.00 234,946.00 251,409.00</p>\n<p id=\"AfY\">TOTALS $243,171.88 $195,286.48 $573,646.00 $714,909.00</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-25\">Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s real estate expert valued the Reco land and buildings in 1973 at $573,000, and in 1975, at $715,000. Their book value, /. e., the cost of the land added to the cost of the buildings reduced by depreciation of those structures, was only $195,000 in 1973, and of course, even less in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-26\">An accountant, called by the plaintiff as an expert on the valuation of closely held corporate stock, testified to his opinion concerning the fair market value of the stock of both Reco and Road at the time of the 1973 merger. He followed Internal Revenue Service and accounting guidelines in arriving at his valuations of the stock. It was his opinion, credited by the trial judge, that, in placing a value on such stock, underlying corporate assets are most important in an investment company such as Reco, while net earning capacity is most significant in relation to a company like Road that is engaged in sales. Thus, in valuing the Road stock, the expert gave greater weight to factors such as gross profits, debt-equity ratios and net income, while in relation to the value of Reco stock he gave more consideration to the assets, <em>i. e., </em>the land and improvements, and liabilities such as bank loans and the debt owed to Road. In contrast to the merger basis, he valued the stock of the two corporations at the time of the merger as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-28\">DEFENDANTS\u2019 MERGER FORMULA (Book Value) PLAINTIFF\u2019S EXPERT\u2019S VALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"ACgM\">Reco Stock $17.55 $392.01</p>\n<p id=\"AIO\">Road Stock 12.73 10.44</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-36\">Regarding the amount of the management fees paid by Reco to Road, the real estate expert testified that the normal management fee in 1973 was six to ten per cent of the gross rental. The plaintiff\u2019s expert accountant testified that the management fees paid by Reco ranged from twenty to twenty-two percent of gross rental. Thus, the management fees that Road charged Reco were substantially greater than the industry average.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-37\">The merger was effective in October, 1973. Two months later, Walter Crory wrote all the Road shareholders, including Junker, who was then a Road shareholder as a result of the merger, informing them that the 1973 annual report would show that Road experienced a $34,539 loss in 1973 as compared with a $53,419 profit in 1972. That loss was attributed to large purchases of inventory that had not been sold to customers. Neither the purchases nor their potential effect on Road\u2019s net income had been disclosed at the shareholders\u2019 meeting when the merger was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>At the time of trial, Junker had died and the Road stock he had received in the merger was owned by his widow. Her attorney attempted to establish, in portmanteau fashion, that Junker was entitled to relief for violation of several sections of the federal securities laws including: Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [the 1934 Act], 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5; Section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 [the 1933 Act], 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 771(2); and Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In pendent claims, Junker also contended that the defendant officers and directors of Reco were liable for violations of their state law fiduciary duties under La.Rev.Stat. 12:91 and that the actions of all the defendants constituted fraud in violation of La.Civ. Code art. 1847. Finally, Junker contended that he brought this action as an individual shareholder of Reco seeking to enforce the rights of that corporation against its officers and directors for violations of their fiduciary duties. Thus, nominally his complaint sought a derivative recovery for that corporation pursuant to Rule 23.1, Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">The trial judge found that the defendant officers and directors, as well as Heisler, the attorney who represented both corporations, were familiar with the financial conditions and the operations of the two closely held corporations. He found that they intentionally or recklessly misrepresented or failed to disclose to Junker each corporation\u2019s true financial condition, the true values of Reco\u2019s property and improvements, and the real value of each corporation\u2019s stock. He further found that the management fees that Road charged Reco were excessive and the rentals paid to Reco by Road inadequate. Based on these findings, he held the officers and directors of Reco liable for violations of fiduciary duties owed to Reco and to Junker under state law. He further held that the defendant officers and directors together with attorney Heisler violated several sections of the federal securities laws, <em>i. </em>e., Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5, as well as Sections 12(2) and 17(a) of the 1933 Act. The court awarded Reco a derivative recovery, casting the officers and directors in judgment together with Road for the value of that corporation\u2019s stock as of the merger date, $392.01 per share, the figure provided by plaintiff\u2019s expert as the true value of Reco\u2019s shares at the time of the merger, times 1,000 shares, or $392,010. According to the court\u2019s judgment, each Reco shareholder was entitled to recover his proportionate interest in that amount. The court further cast the Reco officers and directors, as well as Heisler and Road, in judgment in favor of Junker\u2019s widow for her proportionate interest in the amount awarded to Reco. The judgment did not mention Mrs. Junker\u2019s continuing ownership of the 265.52 shares in Ro\u00e1d, which Junker received in the merger, and no reduction in the damages awarded to Mrs. Junker was made for their value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-8\">Pursuant to Louisiana law, corporate officers and directors owe a fiduciary duty to the shareholders.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because they have the benefit of superior knowledge regarding the affairs of the corporation, they are obliged by Louisiana law to disclose facts within their knowledge to shareholders and to deal with them in an atmosphere of trust and confidence. <em>Mansfield Hard</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number><em>wood Lumber Co. v. Johnson, </em>268 F.2d 317 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 885, 80 S.Ct. 156, 4 L.Ed.2d 120 (1959). That fiduciary obligation takes on heightened importance in a situation, such as that in this case, in which the officers and directors control the voting power of the corporation and the minority shareholder represents an opposing faction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">The trial court\u2019s findings, which are not clearly erroneous, support its conclusion that the five defendants who held positions as Reco\u2019s officers and directors violated the fiduciary obligation owed to Junker under state law. The evidence established that they failed properly to value the Reco stock for purposes of the merger, resulting in a merger formula that was detrimental to Reco shareholders. Ignoring Junker\u2019s protestations, they caused Reco to lease property to Road for inadequate rentals and Road to charge Reco excessive management fees. They failed to disclose to Junker at the shareholders\u2019 meeting in which the merger was discussed the true financial position of the two corporations, including Road\u2019s large inventory purchases. Thus, the evidence supports the trial judge\u2019s finding that the defendants violated the fiduciary obligation they owed Junker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">The defendants assert one plausible defense<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to their liability for breach of this state law duty. Relying on principles of estoppel, they contend that Junker\u2019s earlier objection to the liquidation of Reco bars his claims arising out of the merger because the relief he is afforded by a claim for damages, /. e., recovery of the fair value of his Reco stock measured by the fair value of the corporation\u2019s assets, is the same recovery he would have enjoyed in a liquidation of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">While Louisiana law recognizes that, under certain circumstances, equitable estoppel may bar a claim, that defense is not favored and a defendant asserting it bears the burden of proving all its essential elements by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The essence of estoppel in Louisiana, as in most states, is an action or representation by one party that is justifiably relied on by the other party to the other\u2019s detriment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the three elements of the estoppel defense are: (1) <em>a </em>representation by action or word of the plaintiff, (2) the defendant\u2019s reliance on that representation and (3) a detrimental change in position by the defendant because of that reliance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">The defendants completely failed to establish that their decision to rescind the liquidation order and approve the merger resulted from their reliance on Junker\u2019s earlier objection to the liquidation of Reco. According to the minutes of the shareholders\u2019 meeting at which the merger was approved, Heisler stated, \u201cliquidation was not possible at [that] time because of the credit crunch and high interest rates.\u201d Nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>in the trial court\u2019s findings supports the view that the defendants detrimentally relied on Junker\u2019s opposition to liquidation in making their decision to opt for a merger of Reco into Road as a substitute for liquidation. Indeed, the only indication of any reliance by the defendants is Heisler\u2019s testimony that, in addition to the tight credit conditions, another reason he suggested the merger as the solution for Reco\u2019s financial woes was Junker\u2019s objection to the liquidation procedure. In light of the other actions of the defendants, we find this evidence insufficient to support the conclusion that their decision to merge resulted from their justifiable reliance on Junker\u2019s opposition to the liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">Moreover, there is no evidence that, had the liquidation taken place despite Junker\u2019s opposition, he would have received the fair value of his interest in Reco. Although Junker requested an appraisal of the Reco property prior to liquidation, his motion at the shareholders\u2019 meeting triggered no response by the defendants. What would have ensued had liquidation occurred and had Junker thereafter sought a partition of the property, we can only conjecture. Given the values the defendants assigned Reco\u2019s assets to arrive at the merger formula, we cannot assume that they would have assisted Junker in obtaining the fair value of his shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">Therefore, Junker\u2019s opposition to the liquidation does not estop him to complain of the subsequent misconduct of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">Having concurred in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the officers and directors of Reco are liable to Junker for breach of state law duties, we affirm the judgment in Mrs. Junker\u2019s favor against these defendants. Our disposition of the claims under state law makes it unnecessary for us to reach the issues raised by the federal securities law claims in regard to the defendant officers and directors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-11\">Heisler, the remaining individual defendant, was not an officer, director or shareholder in either Reco or Road. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>to the trial court\u2019s findings, he acted as attorney or agent for both corporations as well as for Walter Crory. Finding no state law cause of action on which to ground Heisler\u2019s liability to Junker,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we turn to the federal securities law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">The trial court held Heisler liable for violation of Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77/(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That section creates a cause of action for a purchaser of securities against one who sold him the securities by means of a prospectus or oral communication that includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made not misleading.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">To recover under that provision, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant, as a seller of a security under Section 12(2); misrepresented or failed to state material facts to the plaintiff in connection with the sale. <em>Hill York Corp. v. American International Franchises, Inc., </em>448 F.2d 680, 695 (5th Cir. 1971). In addition the plaintiff must show that he had no knowledge of the untruth or omission. <em>Id. </em>However, the plaintiff need not establish that the defendant acted with scienter or that he relied in any way on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations or omissions. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">A merger may amount to a purchase or sale of a security for purposes of the federal securities laws.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the exchange of Junker\u2019s Reco shares for stock in Road pursuant to the merger qualifies Junker as a purchaser of Road stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>Because a purchaser may recover pursuant to section 12(2) only from his immediate seller, our inquiry focuses on whether Heisler\u2019s role in the merger transaction constituted him a seller for purposes of that section. Mere participation in the events leading up to the transaction is insufficient to constitute one a seller of a security. <em>Pharo v. Smith, </em>621 F.2d 656, 667 (5th Cir. 1980). Only those in privity with the purchaser or those \u201cwhose participation in the buy-sell transaction is a substantial factor in causing the transaction to take place\u201d are classified as sellers under Section 12. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Hill York Corp. v. American International Franchises, Inc., </em>448 F.2d at 693, we explained the scope of the Section 12(2) seller definition in terms of proximate causation: a defendant is a Section 12 seller if the injury to the plaintiff flowed directly and proximately from his actions or if he was a motivating force behind the sale. <em>See Lewis v. Walston &amp; Co., Inc., </em>487 F.2d 617, 621-22 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Applying the tests articulated in <em>Pharo </em>and <em>Hill York Corp., we </em>held in <em>Croy v. Campbell, </em>624 F.2d 709 (5th Cir. 1980), that an attorney whose connection with the sale was limited to advising the purchaser on its tax consequences was not a Section 12(2) seller. The attorney in <em>Croy </em>did not attempt to persuade the plaintiffs to make the purchase; he made no representations to them concerning the operational aspects of the project in which the plaintiffs ultimately invested. <em>Id. </em>at 714. In determining that his involvement was insufficient to constitute a proximate cause of the sale, we noted, \u201c[t]his conclusion should not be interpreted to mean that a lawyer who participates in the transaction can never be a seller for purposes of section 12.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">. Heisler\u2019s role in bringing about the merger in this case differed significantly from the relatively inactive part played by the lawyer in <em>Croy. </em>According to Heisler\u2019s testimony, he initially suggested the possibility of a merger to Walter Crory. The minutes of the Reco shareholders\u2019 meeting at which the merger was discussed reflect that Heisler attended as Chesley Crory\u2019s proxy and advanced the merger as the solution to Reco\u2019s financial problems. He also prepared the merger documents. Thus, unlike the attorney in <em>Croy, </em>Heisler did attempt to persuade the Reco shareholders to make the purchase of Road stock pursuant to the merger. He also made representations at the Reco shareholders\u2019 meeting regarding his investigation into possible sales of Reco property and the feasibility of a liquidation of Reco as compared with the merger. The evidence of Heisler\u2019s involvement in the effort to bring about the merger supports the trial court\u2019s finding that he was a key participant in the transaction. His role was not that of a passive advisor as was that of the attorney in Croy, rather, he was an active negotiator in the transaction, acting as agent-in-fact as well as attorney-at-law, implementor not counsellor. Therefore, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Heisler\u2019s actions brought him within the scope of the seller definition under Section 12(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-9\">Having determined that Heisler\u2019s actions constituted him a seller under Section 12(2), we also conclude that his representations made to the Reco shareholders at the shareholders\u2019 meeting amounted to an oral communication containing misstatements or omissions of material facts relevant to the merger transaction. In recommending to the Reco shareholders the merger formula based on book values, he failed to inform Junker of material facts concerning the financial conditions of the two corporations. According to Walter Crory\u2019s testimony, he delegated to Heisler responsibility for determining the fair value of Reco\u2019s property. The trial court found that Heisler\u2019s statements regarding real estate market conditions created the false impression that the Reco property was undesirable and not of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>substantial value on the open market. Heisler also made statements regarding the financial position of Road. Referring to the growth that corporation had sustained, Heisler neglected to mention the large inventory purchases made by Road and the potential effect on Road\u2019s net income. Thus, Heisler\u2019s statements were misleading in regard to the respective financial conditions of the two corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-4\">Although Junker was aware of the possibility that the Reco properties were undervalued, he had no knowledge of the material facts regarding the finances of Road. Walter Crory testified that, because Junker\u2019s business competed with Road, he would not have permitted Junker access to Road\u2019s records even had Junker requested to see them. The trial court found that Junker was unable to obtain information from the defendants as to the true value of the stock of the two corporations. Thus, there were undoubtedly material facts omitted from Heisler\u2019s statements of which Junker had no knowledge. Therefore, we conclude that Junker satisfied the require.ment that he establish his lack of awareness of at least some of the various untruths or omissions contained in Heisler\u2019s statements. <em>See Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., Inc., </em>619 F.2d 1222, 1229 (7th Cir. 1980), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1719, 68 L.Ed.2d 210 (1981) (a plaintiff under Section 12(2) need not prove due diligence; all that is required is ignorance of the untruth or omission).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">While Junker need not establish that Heisler acted with scienter in regard to the misstatements or omissions, Section 12(2) provides the seller a defense if he sustains \u201cthe burden or proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of [the] untruth or omission.... \u201d Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77/(2). Thus, the defendant escapes liability by proof of a lack of scienter. <em>Hill York Corp. v. American International Franchises, Inc., </em>448 F.2d at 696. <em>See Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., Inc., </em>619 F.2d at 1227-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">The trial court found that Heisler failed to discharge the burden of proof necessary to establish this defense. That factual conclusion was not attacked before us. The evidence indicates that Heisler was familiar with the financial operations of both Reco and Road. In any event, reasonable diligence on his part would have required such familiarity before he recommended the merger to the Reco shareholders. Moreover, the exercise of reasonable care would have required him to seek an appraisal or at least some knowledgeable estimate of the Reco property in assessing its true value. Therefore, we conclude that Heisler did not satisfy the burden of proof required to establish that, exercising reasonable care, he could not have been aware of the material misstatements and omissions in his presentation at the Reco shareholders\u2019 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">In addition to the individual defendants, the trial court also cast Road, the corporate defendant, in judgment to Junker. As with Heisler, we affirm the judgment against Road based on the federal claim under Section 12(2) without addressing the issues raised by the other claims on which the trial court based liability. <em>See </em>note 10 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-11\">As the issuer of the shares of stock Junker received in the merger, Road was a seller in that transaction in the ordinary sense of the word. One who parts with securities in exchange for consideration is automatically constituted a seller under Section 12 of the 1933 Act. As to such a person, the proximate cause analysis articulated in <em>Hill York Corp. </em>is inapplicable. <em>See Swenson v. Engelstad, </em>626 F.2d 421 (5th Cir. 1980) [case involving Section 12(1)].</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-12\">Through its officers and directors, Road failed to disclose to Junker material facts regarding its financial condition and the true value of its stock. Perhaps the most obvious omission involved Road\u2019s purchases of inventory to which Walter Crory subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>quently attributed the relatively large loss suffered by the corporation in 1973 as compared with the prior year\u2019s profits. Thus, Road, acting through its officers and directors, failed to provide Junker with relevant information necessary to make the statements made by Road\u2019s officers and directors in regard to the merger not misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Moreover, as we have previously discussed, Junker was unaware of Road\u2019s financial situation and thus had no knowledge of the material facts regarding that corporation not disclosed by its officers and directors. Because reliance is not an element of the Section 12(2) cause of action, Junker\u2019s opposition to the merger does not defeat his claim. Patently, Road\u2019s officers and directors knew or should have known that Junker was not provided with a complete picture of the relative financial conditions of the two entities. Thus, Road cannot establish its lack of scienter and is, therefore, unable to avail itself of the due diligence defense applicable to Section 12(2) claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">Heisler and Road have failed to establish a valid defense<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to bar Junker\u2019s recovery against them on the Section 12(2) claims. Therefore, we affirm the judgment in Mrs. Junker\u2019s favor against these defendants based on that claim, thus obviating any discussion of the other federal securities claims on which the trial court held these defendants liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">We now consider the issues of damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court awarded Junker\u2019s widow damages in an amount equal to the value of her husband\u2019s Reco stock at the time of the merger as calculated by the plaintiff\u2019s expert. The judgment failed to mention the 265.52 shares of Road stock that, according to the response to questions put to counsel at oral argument, Mrs. Junker continues to hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">If the purchaser continues to hold the securities, Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act provides for rescission as the appropriate remedy. However, because Reco, the corporation acquired by or merged into Road, is no longer in existence, a complete return to the status quo ante is no longer possible. Therefore, damages was the proper remedy under the Section 12(2) claims, as well as the pendent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">The defendants contend that Junker failed to prove the amount of his loss by \u201creasonably relevant evidence as opposed to speculation, conjecture and irrelevant data.\u201d This contention amounts to an attack upon the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s expert testimony, a charge that was made to the trial judge but rejected by him. The trial judge chose to credit the testimony of the experts advanced by Mrs. Junker and we see no reason to overturn his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">However, it is necessary to remand to the \u25a0 trial court for a reduction in the amount of Mrs. Junker\u2019s damage award to reflect her continuing ownership of the Road shares that her husband received in the merger. The trial court\u2019s award of damages measures only the value of what Junker gave up in the merger without an offset for the value of the stock he received. In order to obtain a proper measurement of the loss suffered as a result of the merger, the value of the Road shares as of the date of that transaction must be deducted from the value of the Reco shares as of that same date. Absent such a deduction, the damage award is inflated and fails to represent the true loss attributable to the merger. Therefore, upon remand, the trial court must calculate the value of the Road shares as of the date of the merger and reduce the judgment by that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>Aside from the award of damages in Mrs. Junker\u2019s favor, the trial court cast all the defendants except Heisler in judgment to Reco, denominating that award as a derivative recovery. Based on that derivative award to Reco, the trial court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Mrs. Junker, payable out of the corporation\u2019s judgment, on the theory that a shareholder who brings a successful derivative action is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees to be paid out of the monies recovered by him for the corporation. Because we consider Junker\u2019s suit to have constituted a derivative action in name only, we reverse the judgment in Reco\u2019s favor. Finding no other valid legal basis for the award of attorney\u2019s fees to Mrs. Junker, we order the district court, upon remand, to eliminate the attorney\u2019s fees award from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">Prior to the merger, Junker owned 16.2% of the Reco stock; the other 83.8% was owned by the defendants. As the result of the merger, Reco is no longer in existence. There is no corporate entity to claim the derivative recovery awarded by the trial court. Thus, the award is, for all practical purposes, recoverable only by the Reco shareholders according to their prior proportionate ownership in the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Because Mrs. Junker has been fully compensated for the value of her husband\u2019s Reco shares by the trial court\u2019s judgment, the derivative recovery is significant only for purposes of the award of attorney\u2019s fees in her favor. However, attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable in a derivative action if the effect of such an award is to shift the liability for those fees to the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The rationale justifying the award of attorney\u2019s fees in the successful derivative action is that the plaintiff has accorded the corporation and its shareholders a substantial benefit because the successful derivative action usually creates a fund available to the corporation and its shareholders. <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 395-96, 90 S.Ct. 616, 627, 24 L.Ed.2d 593, 608-09 (1970); <em>Shlensky v. Dorsey, </em>574 F.2d 131, 149 (3d Cir. 1978). The attorney\u2019s fees are recouped by the plaintiff out of the common fund created by his suit. <em>Id. See generally 7A </em>C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1841 (1972); 3B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 23.91 (2d ed. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">The trial court\u2019s judgment on the derivative claim in this case creates no common fund benefiting the remaining former Reco shareholders other than Junker. Rather, the other shareholders are cast in judgment in the corporation\u2019s favor. Therefore, the effect of the award of attorney\u2019s fees out of the so-called derivative recovery is to increase the defendants\u2019 liability to include the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff who successfully litigates the corporation\u2019s claim is not designed \u201cto saddle the unsuccessful party with the expenses but to impose them on the class that has benefited from them and that would have had to pay them had it brought the suit.\u201d <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. at 396-97, 90 S.Ct. at 628, 24 L.Ed.2d at 608-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">Thus, Mrs. Junker is not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the common fund theory that normally applies in derivative actions. Moreover, Reco is no longer a legal entity. The derivative recovery in its favor is unnecessary to make Mrs. Junker whole because the remaining Reco shareholders were all held liable to Mrs. Junker as well as to the corporation. We, therefore, reverse the derivative award in Reco\u2019s favor without engaging in a primarily academic discussion of the rights of the defendants as Reco shareholders vis-a-vis the derivative recovery as compared with their respective liability for the award in Reco\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>Having determined that the trial court\u2019s theory did not support the award of attorney\u2019s fees, we consider whether any of Junker\u2019s remaining claims might justify granting his widow attorney\u2019s fees in this case. The pendent claims under Louisiana law do not entitle Mrs. Junker to attorney\u2019s fees. In response to questions posed to counsel in writing by the court before oral argument, Mrs. Junker could suggest no Louisiana statutory or jurisprudential authority to support such an award. Louisiana allows the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees only when authorized by statute or contract.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We find no Louisiana statute providing for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this type of case. Therefore, the pendent claims cannot provide a basis to affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">Nor are attorney\u2019s fees recoverable under the federal securities law claims advanced by Junker. There is no express provision in Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act permitting recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. However, Section 11(e) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(e), provides for a discretionary award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing plaintiff in any suit brought under the Act, if the court determines that the defense advanced is frivolous, without merit, or brought in bad faith.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Absent such a finding, attorneys fees may not be awarded under Section 11(e).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Johnson v. Yerger, </em>612 F.2d 953, 959 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-9\">Even assuming the existence of an implied cause of action under Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), see note 10, <em>supra, </em>such a cause of action would not necessarily permit an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We have held that attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable in an implied cause of action under Rule 10b-5, <em>Huddleston v. Herman &amp; MacLean, </em>640 F.2d 534, 559-60 (5th Cir. 1981), a provision that tracks the language of Section 17(a). <em>See </em>Hazen, A Look Beyond the Pruning of Rule 10b-5: Implied Remedies and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 64 Va.L.Rev. 641, 646 (1978). Assuming a private cause of action may be implied in Section 17(a) and assuming that the Section 11(e) provision for attorney\u2019s fees may be applicable to such an action, <em>see </em>L. Loss, Securities Regulation 1837-38 n.506 (2d ed. 1961), just as in a suit under Section 12(2), a claim under Section 17(a) would not result in the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees via Section 11(e) absent a finding by the trial court to the effect that the defense was meritless or advanced in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>The trial court made no finding that the defense advanced was without merit or that defendants acted in bad faith. In any event, the record does not support such a conclusion. Therefore, even assuming that Mrs. Junker might prevail on the merits of any or all of the federal securities law claims asserted against the defendants, she was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under any of them.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because we perceive no legal basis for the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Mrs. Junker, we reverse that part of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-4\">For these reasons the judgment in Mrs. Junker\u2019s favor is AFFIRMED in part, as to the principal amount of damages allowed, REVERSED as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, and the case is REMANDED for the determination of the net amount of damages due in proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs are taxed to the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1419-9\">. James Davidson was also a Road director and officer but held no position in Reco.

Then Kuebel applied the cost approach to arrive at the value of the land and buildings by adding the land values obtained using the market data approach to the depreciated sound value of buildings.

The federal securities law claims on which the district court granted relief present complex and troublesome issues, some of which received inadequate treatment by the parties. As is evident from our discussion of the liability of attorney Heisler under Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act, <em>infra, </em>the question whether the Reco officers and directors, who patently were not conventional sellers of securities, are sellers for purposes of Section 12(2) liability requires more analysis than that afforded the issue in the parties\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">Moreover, perhaps because of a similar failure by the parties adequately to raise the issue, in awarding Junker relief under Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, the district court did not consider whether that section, which does not expressly provide a private cause of action for damages, may be held to imply such a remedy. The implication of a private cause of action in Section 17(a) is an issue not yet resolved by the Supreme Court, <em>see International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 557 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. 790; 795 n. 9, 58 L.Ed.2d 808, 815 n. 9 (1979); <em>Blue Chip Stamps v.
