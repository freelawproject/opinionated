Upon landing, Mr. Meza was presented by Aero-Mexico to an officer of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service for inspection. The Immigration officer determined preliminarily that Mr. Meza should be excluded from entry into the. United States. Aero-Mexico was directed to present Mr. Meza at the Los Angeles office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (I.N.S.) for an exclusion hearing on April 22, 1974. Aero-Mexico hired Lawrence Security to provide detention custody for Mr. Meza. The armed guard from Lawrence Security held Mr. Meza in custody at the Hacienda Hotel in Room 124. The following morning when the security agent opened the door for a hotel employee, Mr. Meza grabbed the guard\u2019s gun, held the guard and hotel employee at gun point, and thereby effected his escape. Apparently Meza has never been recaptured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-18\">On May 20, 1974, the I.N.S. served notice upon Aero-Mexico of its intent to impose a $1,000.00 fine upon Aero-Mexico by reason of its failure to prevent the \u201clanding\u201d of Mr. Meza. Aero-Mexico\u2019s petition for remission of the $1,000 fine was denied by the I.N.S. District Director. After Aero-Mexico unsuccessfully pursued all of its administrative remedies, the I.N.S. reduced the fine to $700.00. Aero-Mexico did not appeal the administrative determination. On April 19, 1979, the government filed the instant action to collect the $700.00 fine and was awarded summary judgment on its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">Aero-Mexico admits that it failed to present the alien at the place designated by the I.N.S. This failure establishes a prima facie case that the alien had illegally \u201clanded\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321(b). Aero-Mexico argues that the alien had already \u201clanded\u201d when he was presented by it to the I.N.S. at Los Angeles International Airport for preliminary inspection. A \u201clanding\u201d does not mean the landing of the aircraft and presentation of an alien to immigration officials for preliminary examination. <em>Shaughnessy v. Mezei, </em>345 U.S. 206, 215, 73 S.Ct. 625, 631, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953). Aero-Mexico\u2019s position is contrary to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1223(a) which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdD\">\u201c(a) Upon the arrival at a port of the United States of any vessel or aircraft bringing aliens (including alien crewmen) immigration officers may order a temporary removal of such aliens for examination and inspection at a designated time and place, but such <em>temporary removal </em>shall not be considered a <em>landing, </em>...\u201d (Emphasis Supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Aero-Mexico\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">Aero-Mexico next argues that it is a signatory to a contract with the United States Attorney General pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228 which thereby exempts it from the enforcement provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321. Aero-Mexico\u2019s contract with the Attorney General was pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(d) which only covers the transportation \u201cthrough the United States in immediate and continuous transit of aliens destined to foreign countries.\u201d Aero-Mexico was not a signatory to a contract with the Attorney General pursuant to 8. U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(c) which covers the landing of aliens bound directly to the United States, the circumstances existing in this case and therefore was not entitled to the statutory exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">Finally, Aero-Mexico contends the I.N.S. impermissibly made it a law enforcement agent in requiring it to produce Mr. Meza at the exclusion hearing. Aero-Mexico\u2019s argument is without merit. The duty to detain the alien was imposed by Congress, not the I.N.S. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">While this court might question the necessity for the imposition by the I.N.S. of the maximum fine as remitted under the circumstances of the alien\u2019s escape, such, a fine was within the discretion of the Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
