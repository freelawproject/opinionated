In this federal habeas corpus proceeding, he claims that he has been deprived of liberty without due process of law because the state trial court did not <em>sua spon te </em>hold a hearing on his competency to understand the proceedings against him, and because his court-appointed counsel, a public defender, was ineffective in not requesting a competency hearing. The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> examined the state-court transcript and held an evidentiary hearing of its own. It then, in a thorough but concise opinion, rejected petitioner\u2019s claims and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">We affirm, substantially for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s opinion. See 8th Cir. R. 14. Flye\u2019s mental competency had been questioned in an earlier case before the same state court, but he had been found competent to stand trial after a two-month stay at the Lincoln Regional Center. The same trial judge and the same court-appointed lawyer had been involved in the earlier case, which ended about a year before the proceeding out of which the present petition arises. In these circumstances, we agree with the District Court that the state court had no sufficient reason to doubt Flye\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings against him and assist in his own defense. See <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-12\">. The Hon. Robert V. Denney, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\">. It is unnecessary to discuss the legal effect of a letter written by Flye to the District Court, disclaiming any interest in further challenging his conviction. Nor do we address the contention that Flye\u2019s counsel was ineffective in failing to conduct an adequate investigation. This argument, rejected below for what seem to us entirely sufficient reasons, was not raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
