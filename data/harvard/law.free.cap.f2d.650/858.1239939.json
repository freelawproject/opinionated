Rather than showing that he was acting on behalf of or as a representative of the other employees, the evidence shows at best that his complaints were shared by others but that his individual conduct was entirely spontaneous. This case, therefore, falls squarely within the holding of our circuit in <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Guernsey-Muskingum Electric Co-op, Inc., </em>285 F.2d 8 (6th Cir. 1960). <em>See ARO, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>596 F.2d 713 (6th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
