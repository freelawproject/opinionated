The district court held that tax penalties and post-petition interest may not be recovered. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-19\">On December 6,1977, Petite Auberge Village, Inc. filed a petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee John Stodd was appointed receiver. On October 13,1978, the corporation was adjudicated a bankrupt and John Stodd was then appointed trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-20\">Among the debtor\u2019s assets was a liquor license issued by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. On July 21, 1978, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the liquor license to Timberline, Inc. Thereafter, pursuant to Cal.Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 24074, appellee Stodd opened an escrow to handle the sale of the license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Cal.Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 24049, the escrow holder paid appellant Employment Development Department $8,066.82 in satisfaction of delinquent tax claims \u2014 including $1,760.56 for tax penalties and post-bankruptcy petition interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The escrow holder also paid appellant Board of Equalization $24,026.28 in satisfaction of delinquent tax claims \u2014 including $4,454.91 for tax penalties and post-bankruptcy petition interest. The tax penalties and post-petition interest were paid despite appellee\u2019s objections. Appellee then filed a complaint in the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>ruptcy, court to recover the post-petition interest and tax penalties paid to appellants. In holding for appellee, the bankruptcy court concluded that under <em>State Board of Equalization v. Stodd, </em>500 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir. 1974), the only amounts payable under Cal.Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 24049, as a condition to the transfer of a liquor license by a trustee in bankruptcy, are taxes due and interest accrued to date of filing the bankruptcy petition. The district court affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Generally, a state may not recover tax penalties from the estate of a bankrupt. Section 57(j) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 93(j);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Simonson v. Granquist, </em>369 U.S. 38, 82 S.Ct. 537, 7 L.Ed.2d 557 (1962). Moreover, interest on a debt stops when the ' bankruptcy petition is filed. <em>Sexton v. Dreyfus, </em>219 U.S. 339, 31 S.Ct. 256, 55 L.Ed. 244 (1911). This case involves the question whether California can contravene these bankruptcy rules by requiring payment of tax penalties and post-petition interest out of the proceeds of sale of a liquor license as a condition of transfer of . the license under Cal.Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 24049.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Under section 24049, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has the power to refuse to transfer a liquor license until certain delinquent taxes are paid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court has previously held, that a state may, as a condition of transfer of a liquor license, recover certain delinquent taxes before other creditors of the bankrupt estate are permitted to share in the proceeds of sale of the license. <em>In re Professional Bar Co., </em>537 F.2d 339 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. California, </em>281 F.2d 726 (9th Cir. 1960). The right, during bankruptcy proceedings, to recover delinquent taxes as a condition of transfer of a liquor license stems from the state\u2019s power to define the nature of state-created property rights. <em>Board of Trade </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>264 U.S. 1, 10, 44 S.Ct. 232, 234, 68 L.Ed. 533 (1924). The liquor license here is such a state-created property right. <em>In re Professional Bar Co., </em>537 F.2d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The district court disallowed appellants\u2019 claims for tax penalties and post-petition interest on the ground that <em>State Board of Equalization v. Stodd, </em>500 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir. 1974), governs. In <em>Stodd </em>we addressed the question whether tax penalties and post-bankruptcy petition interest are recoverable under section 24049. There the bankrupt\u2019s assets included a California liquor license. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control informed the trustee that the sale of the license through escrow would not be approved until delinquent tax claims of the Board of Equalization and the Department of Human Resources had been satisfied up to the value of the license. The agencies claimed principal and pre-petition interest on delinquent taxes, but did not ask for tax penalties or post-petition interest. Since the state\u2019s claims for taxes and prepetition interest far exceeded the value of the license, the trustee paid the state the entire proceeds from the sale. The state, however, applied the amounts received first to tax penalties and post-petition interest and then to the principal and pre-petition interest. Later the state filed amended claims in the bankruptcy proceedings to recover from the debtor\u2019s other assets the unpaid portion of principal and pre-petition interest. The trustee paid the amended claims less the sums the state had applied to penalties and post-petition interest. The bankruptcy court and the district court approved the trustee\u2019s action, and we affirmed. After stating the general rule that tax penalties and post-petition interest are not recoverable in bankruptcy proceedings, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In the instant case the liquor license and proceeds from its sale were a part of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, to which title passes to the Trustee under \u00a7 70a(5) of the Bankruptcy Act. The $6,000 proceeds passed through the Trustee\u2019s possession by court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">Once funds are part of the bankrupt estate, they may not be used to pay tax penalties and post-petition interest under \u00a7 57j----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">The state has attempted to accomplish indirectly what it could not do directly by applying the $6,000 to the penalty and post-petition interest and filing an amended claim for the remainder of the delinquent taxes and pre-petition interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\"><em>Stodd </em>appears to govern the disposition of this case. Appellants, nevertheless, advance two arguments to distinguish <em>Stodd. </em>The first is that <em>Stodd </em>held only that the state may not file amended claims to recover tax penalties and post-petition interest from the bankrupt\u2019s assets except from the proceeds of sale of a liquor license. Appellants\u2019 second and related argument is that the escrow proceeds from the sale of the liquor license are part of the bankrupt\u2019s estate only after the claims of California tax agencies against such proceeds are satisfied. Therefore, section 57(j) of the Bankruptcy Act forbidding the payment of tax penalties and federal case law forbidding payment of post-petition interest from the bankrupt estate do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Appellants are incorrect on both counts. We held in <em>Stodd </em>that the liquor license and its proceeds were assets of the bankrupt estate even before the sale of the license. 500 F.2d at 1210. Because the proceeds of sale were part of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, they could not be used to pay tax penalties and post-petition interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Moreover, in <em>Stodd </em>the question was not whether the state could file amended claims against the bankrupt\u2019s assets to recover unpaid taxes not satisfied by the proceeds of sale of the liquor license. The question was whether \u201cthe funds received [by the state] as a condition of transfer were received wholly outside the bankruptcy proceedings and the application of the funds by the agencies was therefore not within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1209-10. We answered that question in the negative. The state\u2019s filing of amended claims against the bankrupt estate was irrelevant to the resolution of that key question. In fact, we remarked that the manner in which the state in <em>Stodd </em>attempted to recover the tax penalties and post-petition interest did not mask the illegal effect of its act, namely, to violate section 57j\u2019s mandate by recovering penalties and post-petition interest from liquor license proceeds that were part of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. <em>Id. </em>at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">Finally, appellants argue that, under California law, tax penalties and post-petition interest are considered part of a delinquent \u201ctax\u201d and that therefore they are recoverable under section 24049 as part of the state\u2019s right to define the nature of state-created property rights. We do not agree. Assuming appellants\u2019 interpretation of California law is correct, California\u2019s definition of \u201ctax\u201d would not necessarily be applied in federal bankruptcy proceedings. As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Board of Trade v. Johnson, </em>264 U.S. 1, 10, 44 S.Ct. 232, 234, 68 L.Ed. 533 (1924):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-14\">Congress derives its power to enact a bankrupt law from the Federal Constitution and the construction of it is a federal question. Of course, where the bankrupt law deals with property rights which are regulated by the state law, the federal courts in bankruptcy will follow the state courts; but when the language of Congress indicates a policy requiring a broader construction of the statute than the state decisions would give it, federal courts cannot be concluded by them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Thus, a state law contrary to federal bankruptcy law must yield. <em>National Collection Agency, Inc. v. Trahan, </em>624 F.2d 906, 907 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>(9th Cir. 1980); <em>In re Professional Bar Co., </em>537 F.2d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Allowing the state to recover tax penalties conflicts with the language of the act, which is \u201cbroad enough to bar all penalties,\u201d and with the \u201cbroad aim of the Act to provide for the conservation of the estates of insolvents to the end that there may be as equitable a distribution of assets as is consistent with the type of claims involved.\u201d <em>Simonson v. Granquist, </em>369 U.S. 38, 40, 82 S.Ct. 537, 538, 7 L.Ed.2d 557 (1962).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Moreover, the prohibition of all tax penalties in bankruptcy is wholly consistent with the policy of the penalty provisions themselves. Tax penalties are imposed at least in part as punitive measures against persons who have been guilty of some default or wrong. Enforcement of penalties against the estates of bankrupts, however, would serve not to punish the delinquent taxpayers, but rather their entirely innocent creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\"><em>Id. </em>369 U.S. at 40-41, 82 S.Ct. at 538-539 (footnote omitted). Just as the Supreme Court in <em>Simonson </em>did not permit the federal government to recover tax penalties by characterizing them as \u201csecured liens,\u201d we will not permit the state to recover tax penalties and post-petition interest by characterizing them as \u201cdelinquent taxes.\u201d The policies mandating nonrecovery of tax penalties and post-petition interest are too important to be frustrated here by the state\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Accordingly, the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-14\">.
