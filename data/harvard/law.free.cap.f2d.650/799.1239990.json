The Secretary\u2019s complaint, which was triggered by a timely complaint to him (after the Union failed to respond to appropriate protest) by a member of the Union in good standing, alleged that the Union had violated section 401(c) of LMRDA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(c)) by failing to provide adequate safeguards to insure a fair election; and had violated section 401(e) thereof<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(e)) by denying members in good standing the right to vote for the candidate or candidates of their choice, failing to preserve for one year the ballots and other records relating to the election, and failing to conduct the election in accordance with its bylaws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The case was decided on stipulated facts and the testimony of two witnesses. The district court found in favor of the Union and dismissed the Secretary\u2019s complaint. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">The initial balloting of the protested election to fill eight offices took place from October 30 to November 17, 1978, and a runoff election for five of the eight offices was held from November 20 to December 7, 1978. Balloting was by mail. During the period of September through December of 1978, the Union had approximately 3,638 members in good standing who were eligible to vote. Although it was receiving the monthly H-166A list (a computer printout of all dues paying members and their addresses) from its parent body, and although the Union\u2019s bylaws require the use of this list to determine eligibility in elections, the Union did not use it in the 1978 fall election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>mail balloting and, instead, used its own address-plate file.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">During the year preceding the election, the Union had made several mailings to its members using the address-plate file, and, in each instance, approximately 500 of the mailed items had been returned by the Postal Service as undeliverable. It was not until after the election that the Union updated its records, so that subsequent mailings resulted in only about 100 undeliverable returns. There has been no allegation by the Secretary that any fraud or bad faith was involved in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">On October 30, 1978, the Union mailed 3,641 ballots to its members in the initial phase of the fall election. Of these, 529 were returned as undeliverable; 981 voted ballots were returned, of which 955 were counted (26 were voided). Subsequent comparison of the envelopes from the counted ballots with the H-166A list established that at least 6 and possibly as many as 95 ballots were cast by ineligible persons. A further comparison showed that 52 of the 529 undeliverable ballots had been mailed to ineligible persons, so that 477 eligible members did not receive ballots. The three officers declared elected on the basis of the initial phase of the fall election won by margins of 84, 102, and 139 votes; the margins between candidates placing second and third for the five offices for which a runoff (between first and second place) was held ranged from 3 to 227 votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">In the runoff phase of the fall election, 895 ballots were voted and 537 were returned as undeliverable. Of the 895 ballots voted, 80 were voided on the basis of a check against the H-166A list. The runoffs were decided by margins ranging from 19 to 89 votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">The district court found \u201cno basis for the faintest inference of fraud or bad faith\u201d and \u201cno whisper of a union policy to suppress dissent or of any contrivance to disfranchise any eligible voter by mailing his ballot to an improper address.\u201d Although support for the relevance of such findings can be found in dicta in <em>Schonfeld v. Penza, </em>477 F.2d 899, 904 (2d Cir. 1973), the Supreme Court indicated a contrary view in <em>Wirtz v. Hotel Employees Local 6, </em>391 U.S. 492, 503, 88 S.Ct. 1743, 1750, 20 L.Ed.2d 763 (1968), saying: \u201cCongress designed Title IV to curb the possibility of abuse by benevolent as well as malevolent entrenched leaderships.\u201d The policy underlying this statement was explained as follows <em>(id. </em>at 496-97, 88 S.Ct. at 1746-47):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-13\">Earlier this Term, we observed that \u201cTitle IV\u2019s special function in furthering the overall goals of the LMRDA is to insure \u2018free and democratic\u2019 elections. The legislative history shows that Congress weighed how best to legislate against revealed abuses in union elections without departing needlessly from its long-standing policy against unnecessary governmental intrusion into internal union affairs.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Assn., </em>389 U.S. 463, 470-471 [88 S.Ct. 643, 647-648, 19 L.Ed.2d 705.] . .. [T]he congressional concern to avoid unnecessary intervention was balanced against the policy expressed in the Act to protect the public interest by assuring that union elections would be conducted in accordance with democratic principles. ... In a companion case, <em>Wirtz v. Local 125, Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union, </em>389 U.S. 477, 483 [88 S.Ct. 639, 642, 19 L.Ed.2d 716], we said that the provisions of \u00a7 401 are \u201cnecessary protections of the public interest as well as of the rights and interests of union members.\u201d In sum, in \u00a7 401 \u201c. .. Congress emphatically asserted a vital public interest in assuring free and democratic union elections that transcends the narrower interest of the complaining union members.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers, supra, </em>[389 U.S.] at 475, [88 S.Ct. at 650.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">The district court also found that \u201creference to the stipulated numbers is conclusive that they could not have affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>the outcome of the elections.\u201d And the Union argues that \u201c[t]he violations complained of by the Secretary cannot be said to have affected the results of the election, as required by the Act.\u201d However, these statements overlook the plain meaning of section 402(c) of the LMRDA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(c)) and the Supreme Court\u2019s careful analysis of the legislative history thereof (including, particularly, the conference report at 105 Cong.Rec. 19765):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\">The provision that the finding should be made \u201cupon a preponderance of the evidence\u201d was left undisturbed [by the Conference Committee] when the change was made. That provision is readily satisfied, however, as is the congressional purpose in changing \u201caffected\u201d to \u201cmay have affected\u201d in order to avoid rendering the proposed \u201cremedy practically worthless,\u201d by ascribing to a proved violation of \u00a7 401 the effect of establishing a prima facie case that the violation \u201cmay have affected\u201d the outcome. The effect may of course be met by evidence which supports a finding that the violation did not affect the result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 506-07, 88 S.Ct. at 1751-52. We are satisfied that a preponderance of the evidence, <em>viz., </em>the stipulated numbers in both the initial and runoff phases of the fall election, clearly shows that the Union\u2019s violation of section 401 of the LMRDA may have affected the outcome of the election<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the prima facie case thus established has not been rebutted by the evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">We note that under the Union\u2019s bylaws providing for the triennial nomination and election of officers, nominations are to take place at the September 1981 regular membership meeting, with the elections scheduled for later this year. Because there has been no allegation that any fraud or bad faith was involved in the 1978 elections, we do not believe it essential that said elections immediately be declared void, placing upon the Union the burden of conducting new nomination and election of officers prior to the regular triennial nomination and election of officers. Rather, we believe that the purposes of the LMRDA will be adequately served by providing that the status quo of present officers will be maintained until installation of newly elected officers at the Union's regular December 1981 meeting;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, further, that the new election required by section 402(c) of the LMRDA will be satisfied by the regular triennial nomination and election of officers under the supervision of the Secretary. <em>See Hodgson v. Local 1299, United Steelworkers of America, 453 F.2d 565, </em>577-78 (6th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-11\">. 73 Stat. 519 et seq.

Section 401(c) provides in pertinent part: Every bona fide candidate shall have the right, once within 30 days prior to ari election of a labor organization in which he is a candidate, to inspect a list containing the names and last known addresses of all members of the labor organization who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement requiring membership therein as a condition of employment, which list shall be maintained and kept at the principal office of such labor organization by a designated official thereof.

We note that, in each instance, the combined total of all eligible members who were denied their right to vote plus ineligible voters who voted or may have voted was well in excess of the margin deciding the election: 84, 102, and 139 votes in the three contests decided in the initial balloting; 3 to 227 votes between second and third place in the initial balloting for the other five contests and 19-89 votes in the runoff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A0LH\">.
