WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b257-23\">Appellants seek attorney\u2019s fees for challenging a Washington statute which was amended, mooting their action, before the case was heard. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>I. <em>FACTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Four Washington minor political parties<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the minor parties) challenged the constitutionality of a Washington statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which effectively prohibited members of minor political parties from voting in state primary elections. Their 1976 suit was preceded by meetings in 1971 with the Secretary of State and the introduction of corrective bills in the Washington legislature. In 1977 the statute was amended to eliminate the objectionable provision. House and Senate Journals for the months during which the legislation was considered make no mention of the minor parties\u2019 suit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">A legislator said in an affidavit made one year after the statute was amended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">I was aware of the American Constitutional Party lawsuit during [the legislative] process . .. the lawsuit was discussed in meetings of the House elections committee and it was an important factor in leading the House to repeal the challenged former law ... the ... lawsuit was also discussed and considered by the . .. House-Senate Conference [Committee].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Affidavit of State Representative Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">After the Secretary sought dismissal of the suit for lack of a case or controversy, the minor parties moved for an award of fees pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act (Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Without hearing oral argument, the district court found the subject action moot, granted the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss, and denied the motion for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">A motion for reconsideration was denied<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the order denying fees is appealed. Although the minor parties were willing to waive oral argument, we heard counsel at the Secretary\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">il. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-17\">The question on review is whether the district court erred in finding that the minor parties were not \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-18\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AvB\">At oral argument, appellants urged us to treat Judge Tanner\u2019s denial of the motion for fees as a summary judgment. They contend that he erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-19\">We disagree. A full evidentiary hearing was unnecessary. Appellants requested neither a hearing nor oral argument on their motion. The affidavits and record before the court allowed it to consider all factors requisite to an award of fees. The district court did not abuse its discretion in relying on the affidavits and record to determine the case. <em>See Williams v. Alioto, </em>625 F.2d 845, 849 (9th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>2. <em>Legislative Interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The history of the Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> makes clear Congress\u2019 intent that a plaintiff need not obtain formal relief in order to recover fees.

Moreover, when a plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit \u201cacted as a catalyst which prompted the appellee to take action ... \u201d,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Senate Report directs that he be awarded fees. The <em>Par-ham </em>\u201ccatalyst\u201d language was expanded by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Bonnes v. Long, </em>599 F.2d 1316 (4th Cir. 1979). It focused on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ati\">whether as a quite practical matter the outcome, in whatever form it is realized, is one to which the plaintiff[\u2019s] ... efforts contributed in a significant way, and which does involve an actual conferral of benefit or relief from burden when measured against the benchmark condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1319, [1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5910-11.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">The Senate Report\u2019s broad and strident language prescribes a generous attitude towards the award of fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">In the civil rights area, Congress has instructed the courts to use the broadest and most effective remedies available to achieve the goals of our civil rights laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arm\">S.Rep., <em>supra </em>at 3, [1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 5910.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">This circuit has interpreted Congress\u2019 mandate to require that the Act \u201cmust be liberally construed to achieve Congress\u2019 purpose \u2018to encourage compliance with and enforcement of the civil rights laws\u2019\u201d. C<em>ollins v. Chandler Unified School Dist., </em>644 F.2d 759, 764 (9th Cir. 1981) (citations omitted); <em>Dennis v.

Sawyer, </em>639 F.2d 1160 (5th Cir. 1981), the district court awarded fees for appellee\u2019s challenge of a ban on campus demonstrations and marches even though \u201cremedial action by the defendant effectively moot[ed] the controversy subsequent to the filing of the lawsuit.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1163. On appeal, however, the cause was remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine \u201cwhether the appellee\u2019s suit was a significant catalyst to the recission of the ban .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1164. The court of appeals explained that the causal relation between the lawsuit and the relief received \u201cmust be more than simple knowledge that litigation may occur,\u201d and that the chronology of events, while a \u201cfactor to consider\u201d was \u201cclearly not definitive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1163.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">It is clear, then, that the courts have required consistently that plaintiffs seeking to qualify as \u201cprevailing parties\u201d establish some sort of clear, <em>causal relationship </em>between the litigation brought and the practical outcome realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">C. <em>Appellant\u2019s Showing</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOt\">In this case the minor parties argue that, although they did not prevail formally, their suit was successful because it \u201ccontributed in a significant way to the legislative action ... [which] vindicated the rights that the suit sought to protect .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In support, they rely on the affidavit of a single legislator. As a member of the Conference Committee which drafted the legislation, Representative Nelson\u2019s statement might be entitled to some weight if it had been made contemporaneously with the passage of the legislation. Coming one year later, it is entitled to no weight and cannot be relied on as indicative of legislative motivation or intent. <em>See Gunther v. County of Washington, </em>623 F.2d 1303, 1317-18 (9th Cir. 1979). But assuming, arguendo, that his affidavit represents a statement on behalf of other legislators, it still does not persuade us that appellant\u2019s suit was at least a \u201cmaterial factor\u201d in the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The affidavit states only that the suit was \u201cdiscussed\u201d, not that it played a causal role in passage of the amendment. No other evidence of the minor parties\u2019 catalytic role has been produced and the appellants have never suggested that any exists. Indeed, there is uncontroverted evidence that proposed changes in the statute had been tossed around for years, often initiated by the Secretary\u2019s own office. The minor parties have failed to show that theirs was a sufficiently influential role in this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The district court correctly denied the motion for attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEc\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">.

Proceedings in the case were suspended from January 1977 to June 1978, during which no non-emergency motions were heard, pending the appointment of Judge Tanner to fill the vacant district court judgeship in Tacoma. Thus, while the motion to dismiss was filed January 16, 1977, the statute was amended during the 1977 legislative session, and Judge Tanner was appointed in May 1978. He found the action moot and denied the motion for fees on July 18, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b258-22\">. But in response to the minor parties\u2019 motion for clarification, Judge Tanner cited 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which provides that a court: in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorneys fee as part of the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-23\">He further explained that the memoranda and affidavits submitted by both parties did not warrant a finding that the minor parties\u2019 litigation \u201cserved as a \u2018catalyst for change\u2019, forcing the Washington Legislature to amend unconstitutional laws, and thereby achieving a \u2018valuable public service.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the minor parties did not qualify for attorneys fees as the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d District Court\u2019s Order of September 26, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">.

Judge Wright\u2019s discussion of \u201cLegislative Interpretation\u201d plainly demonstrates that by court decision construing the perceived legislative will, the area of discretion has been narrowly circumscribed. I think it important to observe that the trial court exercises a normal discretion concerning the issue at hand. If appellants were \u201cprevailing parties\u201d it is because the lawsuit was a \u201csignificant catalyst\u201d in effectuating the legislative change.

The respondents\u2019 affidavits showed, without contradiction, that as early as August 1971 the Washington Secretary of State met with representatives of several minor political parties to discuss amendments to the Washington statutes; that during the summer of 1974 the staff of the Secretary of State prepared a comprehensive legislative proposal to cure deficiencies in the law; that during the 1976 legislative session the House and Senate Committees on Elections conducted public hearings concerning numerous problems noted under existing election laws; that among the problems was the constitutionality of existing laws; that the committees had before them, among other information, a \u201cSummary of Proposal on Minor Party Nominating Procedures\u201d which stated, inter alia \u201cIn light of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions extending the equal protection provisions of the Federal constitution to any state regulation of political participation, the continued validity of this state\u2019s statutory procedures for the nomination of partisan candidates by minor political parties may be questionable.\u201d- After all this spade work had been done, the 1977 legislature enacted the legislation which mooted the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In the light of this record it cannot be said that the district court acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in exercising discretion to deny attorney fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
