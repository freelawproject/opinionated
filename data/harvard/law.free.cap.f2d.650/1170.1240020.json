Yoder with self-employment income for the years 1962 through 1971 for social security purposes. The issue on appeal is the correctness of the trial court\u2019s determination that information on certain United States Information Returns, Forms 1099, filed by various farm cooperatives showing payments to Yoder, qualify as tax returns filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for Social Security Act purposes under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(5)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">By agreement the case was submitted on the pleadings, briefs, and certified transcript of the record before the Social Security Administration. Yoder sought to establish his eligibility for medicare benefits. Review disclosed that Yoder\u2019s social security earnings record contained no entries from 1961 through 1973 and that he had not filed United States income tax returns for the years 1962 through 1974. At the time of his application, Yoder was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which ultimately required him to file delinquent tax returns for all of those years. Both parties apparently agree that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) prohibits use of the delinquent income tax returns to credit Yoder\u2019s account with self-employment income for the years 1962 through 1971 since such returns were not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">Yoder claims to have been a self-employed dairy farmer between 1964 and 1971, and various farm cooperatives filed with the IRS timely United States Information Returns, Forms 1099 for those years showing patronage dividends paid to Yoder. The Social Security Administration held the Forms 1099 do not constitute tax returns of self-employment income under section 205(c)(5)(F) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(5)(F), since they show only gross amounts paid to Yoder and do not establish that such amounts constituted net self-employment income. Upon review, the district court concluded the language in section 405(c)(5)(F), permitting the Secretary to amend his records to conform with \u201ctax returns or portions thereof <em>(including information returns </em>and other written statements) filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,\u201d is sufficiently broad to include the Forms 1099 filed by the farm cooperatives. (Emphasis added.) It reversed the final decision of the Social Security Administration and ordered that Yoder\u2019s earning records for the years 1964 through 1971 be credited with self-employment income in the amounts shown on the Forms 1099. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">The Secretary is required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(2)(A) to \u201cestablish and maintain records of the amounts of . . . self-employment income derived by, each individual and of the periods in which .. . such income was derived.\u201d An individual\u2019s records are available to him and may be corrected if application is made within three years, three months, and fifteen days after the year in question. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(c)(1)(B), 405(c)(4). However, once that time limitation has expired \u2014 as it has in this case \u2014 section 405(c)(5)(F) provides that the Secretary</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJT\">\u201cmay change or delete any entry with respect to wages or self-employment income in his records of such year for such . individual or include in his records of such year for such individual any omitted item of wages or self-employment income but only\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-13\">\u201c(F) to conform his records to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-14\">(i) tax returns or portions thereof (including information returns and other written statements) filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>\u201cexcept that no amount of self-employment income of an individual for any taxable year (if such return or statement was filed after the expiration of the time limitation following the taxable year) shall be included in the Secretary\u2019s records pursuant to this subparagraph.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">If there has been no timely correction of the Secretary\u2019s records and no filing of tax returns, the Act creates a conclusive presumption that claimant had no self-employment income. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">The trial court relied on <em>Grigg v. Finch, </em>418 F.2d 661 (6th Cir. 1969), to hold the parenthetical \u201cincluding information returns and other written statements\u201d contained in section 405(c)(5)(F) entitles Yoder to have his social security records corrected to reflect information returned on Forms 1099 filed by the farm cooperatives. In <em>Grigg, </em>the Secretary denied disability benefits claimed by Harold Grigg, a part-time accordion instructor at the Detroit Conservatory of Music because Grigg\u2019s social security records showed quarters of coverage insufficient under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(i)(3). The district court held that notwithstanding Grigg\u2019s failure to file income tax returns for the years in question, information returns, Forms 1099, filed by the conservatory, which included Grigg\u2019s name and social security number and indicated that Grigg had self-employment income from his services at the conservatory, were sufficient to give the Secretary actual or constructive knowledge under section 405(c)(5)(F) that Grigg had self-employment income during those years. The Sixth Circuit agreed stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-6\">\u201cthe \u2018absence of an entry in the Secretary\u2019s records\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 405(c)(4)(C) means an \u2018absence\u2019 which persists even after inclusions in the Secretary\u2019s records allowed by \u00a7 405(c)(5)(F), and that the Detroit Conservatory\u2019s information returns satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 405(c)(5)(F) (\u2018tax returns or portions thereof (including information returns and other written statements) filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue * * *.\u2019), thereby giving the Secretary actual or constructive notice of Grigg\u2019s self-employment income for the years 1956 and 1957.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">This view is also supported by <em>Maloney v. Celebrezze, </em>236 F.Supp. 222 (N.D.Ohio 1964), which held that a claimant\u2019s tax return erroneously filed on a wage-earner\u2019s card form \u2014 the claimant should have filed a self-employment return \u2014 followed by an amended return filed five years later constituted a timely filed self-employment tax return for purposes of section 405(c)(4)(C). <em>Maloney </em>stressed that the phrase \u201ca tax return of his self-employment income\u201d found in section 405(c)(4)(C) must be read in light of the \u201cmuch more flexible language of section 405(c)(5)(F) which permits the inclusion of omitted items of self-employment income to conform to a tax return, a <em>portion thereof, </em>or a <em>written statement </em>filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See White v. Celebrezze, </em>226 F.Supp. 584, 588 (E.D.Va.1963), (\u201cthe language of \u00a7 405(c)(5)(F) is broader than that of \u00a7 405(c)(4)(C) because it specifically mentions \u2018portions\u2019 of a tax return and \u2018other written statements\u2019 as bases for changing the Secretary\u2019s records rather than referring to the tax return as a whole as \u00a7 405(c)(4)(C) does.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">With respect, we disagree with the interpretations of the language of section 405(c)(5)(F) by those courts. Congress did not insert the modifying parenthetical \u201cincluding information returns and other written statements\u201d after \u201cportion thereof\u201d unwittingly; rather it purposively drafted section 405(c)(5)(F) to be consistent with the language of section 405(c)(4)(C). Under section 405(c)(5)(F) the Secretary is only permitted to update his records based on information contained in a timely filed tax return or portions thereof, the parenthetical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>following \u201cportions thereof\u201d simply explains that portions of timely filed tax returns that may reveal self-employment income include information returns and other written statements. So construed, the language in section 405(c)(5)(F) is equivalent to the language in section 405(c)(4)(C) which requires proof that the claimant \u201cfiled a tax return of his self-employment income\u201d in order to rebut the conclusive presumption created by an absence of information in the Secretary\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">This construction of section 405(c)(5)(F) is consistent v/ith the legislative history of the Act. That history indicates the principal factor in Congress\u2019 decision to include self-employed persons in the Social Security system was the development of a workable mechanism for determining earnings. Self-employed persons were not covered by social security prior to 1950 since \u201cthere was no agreement on a feasible method of obtaining .. . reports of their income.\u201d <em>Proposed Amendments to the Social Security Act: Hearings on H.R.2892 Before the House Committee on </em>Ways <em>and Means, </em>81st Cong. 1st Sess. 1084 (1949) (statement of Dr. Arthur Altmeyer). The Senate Report explained the reasons for extending coverage to the self-employed: \u201cPracticable administrative procedures for coverage of the self-employed have been developed. An individual would report his self-employment income by transferring certain information from the trade or business schedule of his income-tax return to a social-security schedule on the same return.\u201d S.Rep.No.1669, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. <em>reprinted in </em>[1950] U.S. Code Cong.Serv. 3287, 3299. The Commissioner for the Social Security Administration, testifying before the House Committee on Ways and Means, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-9\">\u201cThe self-employed were excluded from the original program largely because, at that time, there was no agreement on a feasible method of obtaining such reports of their income. Subsequent developments have indicated that most self-employed persons can report their income, for purposes of coverage, as a part of their income-tax returns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-10\"><em>Hearings on H.R.2893 before the House Committee on Ways and Means, </em>81st Cong. 1st Sess. 1081, 1084 (1949) (statement of Dr. Arthur Altmeyer).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">It is clear from the legislative history that the federal income tax reporting system enabled Congress to extend social security benefits to the self-employed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Third Circuit correctly summarized in <em>Shore v. Califano, </em>589 F.2d 1232, 1238 (1978), \u201cthe creation of an administratively feasible mode for determining the eligibility of self-employed claimants was a paramount legislative concern in 1950. Reliance on income tax returns was regarded as the only workable plan.\u201d Congress accordingly adopted language in section 405(c)(4)(C) providing that the Secretary\u2019s records of self-employment income are conclusive after expiration of the statutory time limitation unless it is shown that the claimant filed an income tax return. Consistent language was adopted in section 405(c)(5)(F) which permits the Secretary to conform his records to \u201ctax returns or portions thereof (including [as portions thereof] information returns and other written statements) filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">Forms 1099 filed by the farm cooperatives showing patronage dividends and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>interest paid to Yoder do not constitute tax returns or portions thereof under section 405(c)(5)(F). The patronage dividends apparently reflect gross income derived by Yoder from selling milk through the cooperatives and, by definition, reflect amounts paid to Yoder by cooperatives on the basis of quantity or value of business done with the cooperatives, I.R.C. \u00a7 1388(a); <em>see </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1388-1(a)(3). Patronage figures do not reflect expenses or losses, thus they fail to establish that Yoder realized <em>net </em>self-employment income during each relevant year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Only timely filed income tax returns reporting net self-employment income would provide information relevant to the Social Security Administration in determining whether Yoder has satisfied the requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(i)(3)(B) that he have \u201cnot less than twenty quarters of coverage during the forty-quarter period\u201d preceding his claim of benefits, a \u201cquarter of coverage\u201d being defined by the Act as \u201ca quarter in which an individual . . . has been credited . . . with $100 or more of [net] self-employment income.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 413(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">To give effect to the congressional mandate that federal income tax reporting is the only manageable method for accurately ascertaining the income of self-employed claimants in determining eligibility for social security benefits, we hold that Yoder may prove that he had self-employment income during quarters for which the Secretary\u2019s records show none only from information filed with timely filed income tax returns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Accord, Shore v. Califano, </em>589 F.2d 1232, 1239 (3d Cir. 1978); <em>Singer v. Weinberger, </em>513 F.2d 176, 177 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Martlew v.
