Second, was the regional administrator\u2019s decision, on application of the EPA\u2019s regulations and interpretation of those regulations to the facts of this case, arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion? Answering both questions in the negative, we affirm the decision of the regional administrator that PEPCO\u2019s Chalk Point Unit # 4 must comply with the NSPS promulgated for fossil fuel-fired steam generators.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">Because the decision of the EPA concerning the applicability of an NSPS to a partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ular facility turns largely upon the facts of each case, a brief review-of the facts underlying PEPCO\u2019s present petition for review is essential for an understanding of our disposition of this appeal. Chalk Point Units # 3 and # 4 are two of the four electric generating facilities that collectively comprise PEPCO\u2019s Chalk Point Generating Station south of Aquasco, Maryland. At the core of each unit is an oil-fired boiler designed to generate steam to power a turbine that produces electricity. The two units share several ancillary facilities, including a common water treatment system, fuel oil tank farm and control room, and a single building houses the boilers and turbines for both units. Units # 3 and # 4 were planned in the late 1960s as a single procurement and were to be placed in service \u201cback to back\u201d in 1974 and 1975. A sudden and unprecedented decline in electricity use following the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, however, caused construction of both units to be slowed after their commencement. Unit # 3 was placed in service in 1975; Unit # 4 is scheduled to go into operation in the fall of 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The information that PEPCO later submitted to the EPA indicates that negotiations for the construction of Unit #4 were commenced in 1970 and that PEPCO was dealing primarily with General Electric (GE), United Engineers &amp; Constructors (UE&amp;C) and Combustion Engineering (CE). PEPCO\u2019s negotiations with GE were for the main turbine-generator and boiler feed pump turbines. On March 12,1971, PEPCO awarded the order to GE subject to the final approval of PEPCO\u2019s board of directors and mutually agreeable contract terms. On March 25, 1971, GE confirmed the order but stipulated that PEPCO could cancel the order without charge up to the earlier of the 30-month period prior to shipment or the release of the units for engineering and manufacturing. On June 30, 1971, PEPCO notified GE of approval of the order by its board of directors. On August 2, 1971, the units were released by GE for design and manufacture. A formal contract for the units, however, was not signed until April 23, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">PEPCO\u2019s negotiations with UE&amp;C were for engineering and construction services at the Chalk Point site. The contract for these services was signed on November 12, 1974 but had an \u201ceffective date\u201d of April 12,1971. This contract covered services for both Units # 3 and # 4. Prior to August 17, 1971, UE&amp;C had developed drawings that indicated the planned construction of Unit # 4. Site preparation for Unit # 4, however, did not begin until late 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">PEPCO\u2019s negotiations with CE were for fabrication of the boiler to be used in Unit # 4. On August 17,1970, PEPCO received a price quotation from CE on a boiler unit for an undetermined facility; that boiler was eventually used in Unit #4. A CE \u201cParts Shipment Forecast\u201d dated February 18, 1971 listed this unit for initial parts shipment during the first quarter of 1973. The unit was listed as a \u201cForecast Unit\u201d that was identified by an internal control number as contrasted to listing as a \u201cBooked Unit\u201d identified by a domestic contract number.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">On March 11, 1971, CE stated in a letter to PEPCO that it had committed space in its production schedule for the Unit #4 boiler pending a final decision by PEPCO. Also included in the letter were a price quotation and a projected delivery date. On July 12, 1971, PEPCO sent a letter to CE stating that \u201cwe are now considering a design for proposed Chalk Point No. 4.\u201d This letter concluded with the statement that, \u201c[sjubject to a mutually satisfactory contract, it is our intent to award the No. 4 boiler unit to you.\u201d This letter also referred to a meeting between PEPCO and CE to be held on August 3,1971 to review a design proposal for Unit # 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Although a CE engineering and production team began to design the Unit # 4 boiler after CE\u2019s August 3 meeting with PEPCO, no subcontracts were let or materials acquired prior to August 17, 1971. On October 26, 1971, CE prepared a \u201cContract Abstract\u201d for Unit # 4 that included descriptions of the major boiler components, the total price, shipping and payment conditions, and an \u201caward date\u201d of July 12,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>A formal contract for the Unit # 4 boiler was not executed until April 18, 1973, at which time fabrication of the boiler was 75% complete. Affidavits later sworn to by PEPCO\u2019s Vice President for Nuclear Engineering and Environmental Affairs and CE\u2019s principal representative in the boiler negotiations, however, indicate that the parties felt that they had a binding agreement based on PEPCO\u2019s letter of July 12, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Construction of Chalk Point Unit # 4, although slowed or \u201cdeferred\u201d as a result of the 1973 oil embargo, has continued substantially uninterrupted to the present day. It was not until May 20,1977, however, that PEPCO, pursuant to 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.5(a), requested a ruling from the EPA on whether Unit # 4 would be subject to the NSPS for fossil fuel-fired steam generating units published by the EPA on August 17, 1971. Appended to this request were 156 pages of pertinent documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Fifteen months after receiving PEPCO\u2019s request, EPA communicated its first response to PEPCO \u2014 a request for further information. This request, dated August 17,1978, stated that the EPA had \u201cpreliminarily determined\u201d that Unit # 4 was subject to the 1971 NSPS for steam electric plants but requested additional information to determine the \u201cexact status\u201d of the unit. The reasons given for the EPA\u2019s preliminary determination were that construction of Unit # 4 had been neither continuous nor of reasonable length, as required by 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(i). PEPCO supplied the requested information and urged that the EPA make its decision \u201cjust as quickly as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">At a meeting requested by PEPCO that took place on July 3, 1979, the EPA informed PEPCO for the first time that its ruling would turn on the question whether a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d to construct the Unit # 4 boiler existed before August 17, 1971. Following PEPCO\u2019s compliance with two more EPA requests for information, the EPA staff briefed the regional administrator in October 1979 and again in March 1980. His final ruling on PEPCO\u2019s Chalk Point Unit #4 request was published on March 27, 1980. 45 Fed.Reg. 20,155 (1980). In this ruling the regional administrator determined that, because PEPCO had not entered into a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d on the Unit # 4 boiler \u2014 the \u201caffected facility\u201d in the present case \u2014 PEPCO had not \u201ccommenced construction\u201d at its Chalk Point Unit #4 prior to the EPA\u2019s publication of the NSPS for steam electric plants on August 17, 1971. He therefore concluded that the NSPS for steam electric plants was applicable to Unit # 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Before addressing the specific issues raised by this appeal, a brief discussion of the regulatory scheme out of which they arise is essential. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411, requires that the EPA promulgate new source performance standards (NSPS), reflecting the best demonstrated pollution control technology, for application to any new stationary source, \u201cthe construction or modification of which is commenced after the publication of [the NSPS] applicable to such source.\u201d The only statutory guidance that the EPA is given in promulgating the NSPS, however, is the definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d in \u00a7 111(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(3), as \u201cany building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Based on this loosely defined statutory authorization, the EPA has promulgated a detailed regulatory scheme establishing and implementing the NSPS. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. Part 60. Included in this regulatory scheme is a subpart dealing with the procedural applications of the NSPS that are established in other subparts, <em>see id. </em>Sub-part A, which is applicable \u201cto the owner or operator of any stationary source which contains an <em>affected facility, </em>the <em>construction </em>or modification of which is <em>commenced </em>after the date of publication in this part of any standard applicable to that facility,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 60.1 (emphasis added). The term \u201caffected facility\u201d is defined as \u201cany apparatus to which a standard is applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>2(e). The word \u201cconstruction\u201d is defined as the \u201cfabrication, erection, or installation of an affected facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60.2(g). The word \u201ccommenced\u201d is defined to require a showing \u201cthat an owner or operator has entered into a <em>contractual obligation </em>to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or modification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60.2(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Based on its interpretation of the regulations it has promulgated pursuant to the authorization of \u00a7 111 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411, the EPA has contended that PEPCO\u2019s Chalk Point Unit # 4 is subject to the NSPS for steam electric plants because PEPCO was unable to establish that, prior to the EPA\u2019s publication of the applicable NSPS on August 17, 1971, it had entered into a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for \u201cconstruction\u201d of its Unit # 4 boiler\u2014 which the EPA contends is the \u201caffected facility\u201d \u2014 so that PEPCO could not cancel that obligation without incurring \u201csignificant liability,\u201d either because an agreed upon cancellation fee had come into operation or because the manufacturer of the facility had made expenditures in reliance upon an agreement for construction of the facility. PEPCO, on the other hand, has contended that, under well-settled principles of contract law, it had entered into a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for the construction of Chalk Point Unit #4 generating station, based either on its contract with UE&amp;C to construct the entire Unit #4 generating station \u2014 which PEPCO contends is the \u201caffected facility\u201d \u2014 or on its contract with CE to construct the boiler that is to be used in that generating station.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We note at the outset that some of PEPCO\u2019s contentions may be read as challenging not only the EPA\u2019s interpretation of its regulations but also the regulations themselves. To the extent that the regulations themselves are challenged, the challenge is untimely and in the wrong court; section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b), requires that challenges to EPA regulations of nationwide applicability be brought within 60 days of promulgation in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Since the procedural regulations governing application of the NSPS that are now under consideration were promulgated by the EPA on December 23, 1971, <em>see </em>36 Fed.Reg. 24,876 (1971), any challenge to those regulations could only have been brought in the District of Columbia Circuit on or before February 23, 1972. This court therefore has jurisdiction to review only the EPA\u2019s interpretation of those regulations, and the scope of that review is limited to whether the EPA\u2019s interpretation is plainly erroneous. <em>See Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Talley v. Mathews, </em>550 F.2d 911, 919 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">With respect to whether a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d was entered into for Unit # 4 prior to publication of the applicable NSPS, PEPCO has argued persuasively that it had entered binding contracts with UE&amp;C and CE prior to August 17, 1971 or, at the very least, it was liable to those companies on a theory of promissory estoppel. However, while principles of contract law undoubtedly would have been reasonable standards by which to determine the existence of a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for purposes of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(i), the fact remains that contract law principles are not the standards that were chosen by the EPA for that purpose. Therefore, we must restrict our analysis in the present case to whether the \u201csignificant liability\u201d test contended for by EPA is a plainly erroneous interpretation of \u201ccontractual obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The EPA has presented two cogent policy reasons for the use of its \u201csignificant liability\u201d standard. The first policy argument is based on the congressional goal in \u00a7 101 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401, of ensuring the best demonstrated system of pollution control in new sources of air pollution without requiring costly retrofitting of existing sources of pollution. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep.No. 95-294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 184-86 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1977, p. 1077. The EPA interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u201ccontractual obligation\u201d effectuates this goal by requiring a commitment to construction of a polluting facility that cannot be entered into simply for purposes of avoiding the NSPS requirements while leaving the polluting company the option of cancelling or postponing the commitment with the incursion of little or no liability. Stated another way, the EPA\u2019s interpretation effectively requires the incorporation of new pollution control technology by all those who can do so without incurring \u201csignificant liability\u201d as a result of the cancellation of a previous commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">, The second policy reason asserted by EPA is essentially one of administrative 'convenience. The requirement of significant liability, based on either a cancellation fee or expenditures made in reliance on a construction contract by the contractor for a polluting facility, provides bright-line documentation by which the EPA may quickly and easily determine whether an applicant for exemption from NSPS has incurred a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d meriting that exemption. This interpretation thus avoids the often convoluted application of contract principles to masses of business correspondence that would be the result under PEP-CO\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Support for this argument is amply supplied by PEPCO\u2019s contention in the present case that it is \u201ccommon practice\u201d in the utility industry for a utility to use a \u201cletter of intent\u201d to signify the award of a \u201cbinding contract\u201d to a contractor for the construction of an electric generating facility and that PEPCO\u2019s \u201caward letter\u201d of July 12, 1971 to CE was such a letter of intent. For the EPA to find a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d on the basis of this contention, however, would require the EPA to gather evidence of the purported usage of trade in the utility industry and to then determine whether the \u201caward letter\u201d of July 12,1971, or possibly some other piece of documentation submitted by PEPCO, comported with this \u201ccommon practice.\u201d When this type of inquiry is multiplied by the number of different industries in which the NSPS regulations must be applied, the EPA\u2019s argument of administrative convenience is transformed into one bordering on administrative necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">PEPCO has argued that these policy considerations should be rejected as <em>post hoc </em>reasoning. This argument, however, is undercut by the EPA\u2019s consistent determination in three earlier decisions that utilities that fail to meet the requirements of the \u201csignificant liability\u201d test will not be exempted from NSPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">For example, upon the request of the United Illuminating Company for a determination whether its New Haven, Connecticut steam electric generating unit was subject to the NSPS for fossil fuel-fired steam generating units, <em>see </em>Letter from William J. Cooper, Chairman of the Board, United Illuminating Company to the Office of General Enforcement, Environmental Protection Agency (Feb. 29, 1972), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 222, the EPA originally ruled that the utility\u2019s conditional letter of intent to a manufacturer for fabrication of the facility\u2019s boiler did not constitute a \u201ccontractual obligation,\u201d <em>see </em>Letter from William H. Megonnell, Director, Division of Stationary Source \u2022 Enforcement, Environmental Protection Agency to William J. Cooper (May 9, 1972), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 227. It reversed this ruling, however, when the utility was able to produce a purchase order from the boiler manufacturer to a supplier of parts to be used in manufacturing the boiler. <em>See </em>Letter from William H. Megonnell to William J. Cooper (Nov. 2, 1972), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Similarly, in ruling on a request for a determination of NSPS applicability from Tampa Electric Company, the EPA concluded that the utility\u2019s Big Bend Unit #3 was not subject to the relevant NSPS because the utility had incurred a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d based on an apparent liability to the boiler manufacturer of $950,000 as a result of certain purchase orders the manufacturer had entered with suppliers prior to August 17, 1971. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Charles A. Perry, Assistant Regional Counsel to Ron Hausmann, Office of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Counsel, Environmental Protection Agency (July 18,1977), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 235-37; Memorandum from Edward B. Reich, Director, Division of Stationary Source Enforcement to Fran Phillips, Regional Counsel, Region IV, Environmental Protection Agency (Sept. 30, 1977), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 238-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Finally, in the request for determination of the Hawaiian Electric Company, the EPA was asked to rule on the applicability of the relevant NSPS to the utility\u2019s Kahe Power Plants # 5 and # 6. <em>See </em>Letter from Richard E. Bell, Manager, Environmental Department, Hawaiian Electric Company to Office of General Enforcement, Environmental Protection Agency (July 5, 1972), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 231-32. The cancellation date with respect to the Kahe Unit # 5 boiler was listed as \u201cnone,\u201d and with respect to the Unit # 6 boiler it was July 1, 1972. <em>Id. </em>Based on the assumption that Hawaiian Electric could withdraw without cost from its letters of intent to construct the two boilers prior to the expiration of the stated cancellation dates, the EPA held that the utility had incurred a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for the first boiler prior to August 17, 1971 but that no such obligation arose for the second boiler until July 1, 1972. <em>See </em>Letter from Edward B. Reich, Chief, Enforcement Proceedings Branch, Environmental Protection Agency to Richard E. Bell (July 18, 1972), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 233-34. Although the \u201csignificant liability\u201d standard was never expressly stated in any of these previous rulings, the reasoning applied in each of the decisions is consistent with the test now articulated by the EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Judicial support for the EPA\u2019s present interpretation can be found in <em>United States v. City of Painesville, </em>431 F.Supp. 496 (N.D.Ohio 1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>644 F.2d 1186 (6th Cir. 1981), in which the court upheld an NSPS applicability ruling by the EPA that is consistent with the \u201csignificant liability\u201d standard. In <em>Painesville </em>a municipal utility had executed a letter of intent with one boiler manufacturer in 1970, but it changed the design of the boiler to be fabricated and, on July 28, 1972, executed a contract with a second boiler manufacturer for construction of the redesigned boiler. <em>Id. </em>at 498. The EPA argued that the commencement of construction of the \u201caffected facility\u201d dated from either the execution of a formal contract with the boiler manufacturer or the progression of construction at the building site to the point that a change in design would have required the facility already erected to be modified in order to comply with the relevant NSPS. <em>Id. </em>at 500. Adopting EPA\u2019s definition of \u201ccommencement\u201d as a reasonable interpretation of the NSPS applicability regulations that was in keeping with the intent of Congress in enacting \u00a7 111 of the Clean Air Act, the district court found that \u201cconstruction\u201d of the new power plant had not \u201ccommenced\u201d prior to August 17, 1971 because neither of the specified events had occurred prior to that time. <em>,Id. </em>at 500-01. While the <em>Painesville </em>court admittedly did not construe the phrase \u201ccontractual obligation,\u201d it must be remembered that that phrase is found in the definition of \u201ccommenced\u201d in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(i) and that a finding of a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d must therefore be thought of as nothing more than a means of making the ultimate determination of whether \u201cconstruction\u201d has \u201ccommenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Based on the persuasive policy justifications presented by the EPA and that agency\u2019s consistent application of the \u201csignificant liability\u201d standard, which has been upheld by other courts, we conclude that the EPA\u2019s requirement of \u201csignificant liability\u201d to demonstrate a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d sufficient to exempt a pollution source from compliance with the relevant NSPS is not a plainly erroneous interpretation of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">A similar analysis can be applied to the EPA\u2019s conclusion that a power plant\u2019s boiler is the \u201caffected facility\u201d for which a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d had to exist for exemption in the present case. PEPCO contends that this interpretation is unreasonable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>that the only reasonable interpretation is that \u201caffected facility\u201d refers to an entire electric generating facility and not just its boiler. The EPA\u2019s interpretation, however, is supported by a number of considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">First, EPA\u2019s interpretation comports with a tracing of the relevant regulations. \u201cAffected facility\u201d is equated in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(e) with \u201cany apparatus to which a standard is applicable.\u201d With respect to a steam electric plant, the \u201caffected facility\u201d to which the NSPS is applicable is \u201ceach fossil fuel-fired steam electric generating unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60.40(a)(1). \u201cFossil fuel-fired steam generating unit\u201d is in turn defined as a \u201cfurnace or boiler.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 60.41(a). Thus, the definition of \u201caffected facility\u201d as a \u201cboiler\u201d seems compelled by a reading of the pertinent regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Second, the EPA\u2019s present ruling that PEPCO must demonstrate that it had incurred a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d concerning its Unit # 4 \u201cboiler\u201d is consistent with the EPA\u2019s earlier NSPS exemption rulings. For example, in ruling on the request for exemption of United Illuminating Company, the EPA stated that the \u201cpertinent issue is whether a binding agreement was entered into for the boiler, the \u2018affected facility\u2019 under 40 C.F.R. 60.40 and 60.41(a).\u201d Letter from William H. Megonnell, Director, Division of Stationary Source Enforcement, Environmental Protection Agency to William H. Cooper, Chairman of the Board, United Illuminating Company (May 9, 1972), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 227-28. Similarly, in responding to a request for exemption by the Hawaiian Electric Company, the EPA stated that \u201cthe key question is whether construction of the K-5 and K-6 boilers commenced after August 17, 1971.\u201d Letter from Edward B. Reich, Chief, Enforcement Proceedings Branch, Environmental Protection Agency to Richard E. Bell, Manager, Environmental Department, Hawaiian Electric Company (July 18,1972), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 233-34. Likewise, in reviewing its 1975 decision that Tampa Electric Company\u2019s \u201cBig Bend No. 3 fossil fuel-fired boiler unit was an existing source for NSPS requirements,\u201d Memorandum from Charles A. Perry, Assistant Regional Counsel to Ron Hausmann, Office of General Counsel (July 18, 1977), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 235-37, the EPA focused its attention on the utility\u2019s \u201cletter of intent to purchase a boiler from Riley-Stoker Company,\u201d coupled with the utility\u2019s \u201capparent liability to Riley-Stoker for $950,000,\u201d Memorandum from Edward B. Reich, Director, Division of Stationary Source Enforcement to Fran Phillips, Regional Counsel, Region IV (Sept. 30, 1977), <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 238-39. Finally, in <em>Painesviile </em>the EPA based its exemption determination on an examination of the time at which \u201cconstruction of the \u2018affected facility,\u2019 the boiler, commenced,\u201d <em>United States v. City of Painesville, </em>431 F.Supp. at 500, and the court found that examination to be \u201cfully supported by the language of the regulation,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Third, the EPA\u2019s interpretation that the \u201cboiler\u201d is the \u201caffected facility\u201d in the instant case is consonant with the statutory definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d found in \u00a7 111 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411. In <em>ASARCO, Inc. v. EPA, </em>578 F.2d 319 (D.C. Cir. 1978), the District of Columbia Circuit held that the definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d limits the application of NSPS to individual polluting facilities rather than entire plants. At issue in <em>ASARCO </em>was a challenge to the EPA\u2019s use of the \u201cbubble concept,\u201d under which an NSPS was applied as a result of a modification in a polluting facility only if the modification produced a net increase in the total emissions from the entire industrial plant in which a number of polluting facilities were grouped under an imaginary bubble. <em>Id. </em>at 321-25. The court rejected the \u201cbubble concept\u201d and held that under the \u00a7 111 definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d the EPA could not change the unit to which the NSPS applied \u201cfrom a <em>single </em>building, structure, facility or installation \u2014 the unit prescribed in the statute \u2014 to a <em>combination </em>of such units.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">PEPCO contends, on the other hand, that the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, </em>606 F.2d 1068 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>(D.C. Cir. 1979) (per curiam), prohibits the EPA from premising its exemption decision on an examination of the time at which construction is commenced on a \u201cpiece of equipment\u201d such as a \u201cboiler\u201d rather than a \u201ccommon sense industrial grouping\u201d that is a \u201cfunctional entity.\u201d Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that <em>Alabama Power, </em>a decision dealing with a construction of the PSD provisions of the Clean Air Act has validity with respect to construction of similar provisions under the NSPS portion of that Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we simply do not believe that <em>Alabama Power </em>stands for the proposition for which PEPCO has cited it.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In <em>Alabama Power </em>the court was asked to pass on the validity of the EPA\u2019s regulatory definition of \u201csource\u201d to include \u201cany structure, building, facility, equipment, installation or operation (or combination thereof) which is located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties and which is owned or operated by the same person (or by persons under common control).\u201d <em>Id- </em>at 1077. The court found that the EPA had \u201cexceeded its statutory authority by including within its definition of \u2018stationary source\u2019 the terms \u2018equipment and operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The District of Columbia Circuit went on, however, to \u201crule that EPA has considerable latitude in defining the four remaining terms \u2014 \u2018structure,\u2019 \u2018building,\u2019 \u2018facility\u2019 and \u2018installation\u2019 \u2014 to include a wide range of pollution-emitting sources within the reach of the PSD provisions,\u201d and that \u201c[t]o the extent EPA intended its definition of the term \u2018stationary source\u2019 to constitute an interpretation of the four statutory terms for purposes of the PSD part, it may recast its definition in appropriate fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We believe that, with its emphasis on recasting the regulatory definition, the <em>Alabama Power </em>court intended to require only a procedural modification that would bring the EPA\u2019s regulation clearly within the discretion given that agency by the statute rather than a substantive restriction that prohibited the EPA from focusing . on \u201cequipment\u201d or \u201coperation\u201d in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The <em>Alabama Power </em>court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ccommon sense industrial grouping\u201d must similarly be reviewed in context. The EPA\u2019s previously quoted definition of \u201csource\u201d had been challenged as too broad by environmentalists, who relied oh the District of Columbia\u2019s earlier holding in <em>ASARCO </em>that a \u201cstationary source\u201d could be comprised of only a single facility as opposed to a combination of facilities. <em>Id. </em>In attempting to distinguish <em>ASARCO </em>in such a way that the EPA could continue to use a definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d that included a combination of \u201csources,\u201d the <em>Alabama Power </em>court held that, while a \u201cstationary source\u201d could be comprised of only one \u201cfacility,\u201d the \u201cEPA has latitude to define the term \u2018facility,\u2019 to encompass an entire plant or other \u2018common sense industrial grouping\u2019 appropriate to the PSD review and permit process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court noted that the EPA had the discretion to broaden, in an appropriate fashion, its definition of \u201cfacility,\u201d which at that time was defined as \u201c \u2018an identifiable piece of process equipment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1977 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>n.14 (quoting 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.24(b)(5), 52.-21(b)(6)). Thus, although the <em>Alabama Power </em>court recognized the \u201clatitude\u201d or \u201cdiscretion\u201d of the EPA to define \u201cfacility\u201d as an \u201centire plant or other \u2018common sense industrial grouping,\u2019 \u201d by negative implication it found nothing wrong with the existing definition of that term as \u201can identifiable piece of process equipment\u201d \u2014 a definition that is at least as narrow as the EPA\u2019s definition of \u201caffected facility\u201d in the present case as the \u201cfurnace or boiler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The salient feature of the <em>Alabama Power </em>decision that PEPCO seems to overlook is the emphasis of the District of Columbia Circuit on a definition of \u201cfacility\u201d that is \u201cappropriate to the PSD review and permit process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077. Indeed, the <em>Alabama Power </em>court stated in a footnote following its discussion of the EPA\u2019s \u201clatitude\u201d in defining terms that \u201cthe definitions applicable to each set of provisions [PSD or NSPS] must be reasonably appropriate for the purpose of those sections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The EPA has, we believe, pointed out a significant difference between the PSD and NSPS programs that justifies a different construction of the definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d that is to be applied to the two programs. It argues that, because the purpose of the PSD program is to preserve existing air quality in those portions of the country where the air is now cleaner than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards require, the emphasis in that program should be upon the <em>net </em>emissions from an entire plant resulting from construction or modification of one or more emitting sources within the plant. The NSPS regulations, on the other hand, require the use of the best demonstrated pollution control technology in the construction or modification of a pollutant-emitting facility without regard to the effect the emissions from that facility will have on overall air quality. It is therefore appropriate in the NSPS program for the EPA to focus on the \u201caffected facility\u201d to which the NSPS will be applied and in which the best demonstrated technology must be incorporated. Thus, we conclude that the EPA\u2019s emphasis in its exemption decision on the \u201cboiler\u201d as the \u201caffected facility\u201d constitutes neither too broad a definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d under <em>ASARCO </em>nor too narrow a definition of that term under <em>Alabama Power.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Finally, and perhaps most persuasively, the EPA\u2019s requirement for exemption of a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for construction of the \u201cboiler\u201d as the \u201caffected facility\u201d is supported by common sense. PEPCO contends that the EPA can base its exemption determination only on construction of a \u201cfunctional entity\u201d and that, therefore, the EPA should find an exemption if there was a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for any portion of PEPCO\u2019s Chalk Point Unit # 4, including its turbine generator and the equipment and buildings it shares with Unit # 3, that is essential to its ultimate operation as a power plant. Such a construction, however, would create a means of avoidance of the NSPS that we do not believe Congress possibly could have intended. Through the simple expedient of planning generating units in tandem and providing for their use of some common equipment or facilities \u2014 a practice that utility companies seem to follow often \u2014 a utility could obtain exemption of both units from the NSPS even though it actually \u201ccommenced construction\u201d of only one unit prior to publication of the relevant NSPS and the best demonstrated technology could be incorporated into the second unit at little or no retrofitting cost. Such a two-for-one exemption is obviously absurd, but it is the logical result of PEPCO\u2019s interpretation of the unit for which a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d must be incurred in order to qualify for an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">We therefore conclude that it is not plainly erroneous for the EPA, in making its exemption determination, to focus on a power plant\u2019s boiler as the \u201caffected facility\u201d for which a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d had to exist prior to publication of the relevant NSPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">While we conclude that it was reasonable for the EPA to focus on the \u201cboil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>er\u201d of Unit # 4 as the \u201caffected facility,\u201d we do not believe that construction of the equipment required to support that \u201cboiler\u201d is totally irrelevant to an NSPS exemption determination. The EPA contends that its regulatory definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d as \u201cfabrication, erection, or installation of an affected facility,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(g), refers only to \u201cerection\u201d or \u201cinstallation\u201d of an \u201caffected facility\u201d <em>following </em>its \u201cfabrication.\u201d Although PEPCO has not expressly challenged this EPA interpretation, we believe such a challenge is implicit in PEP-CO\u2019s contention that its contract with UE&amp;C, which was responsible for preparation of the facilities that would accept the boiler, was a contract for construction of the boiler. Moreover, in response to this challenge, we find that the EPA\u2019s interpretation of its regulatory definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d is plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">We find that the only reasonable interpretation of the regulatory definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d is one that covers construction of those structures and facilities that are essential to the <em>eventual </em>\u201cerection\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d of an \u201caffected facility.\u201d This finding is compelled by three considerations. First, limiting the scope of the words \u201cerection\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d to the actual erection and installation at the building site of an \u201caffected facility\u201d following its fabrication would render the words superfluous in the context of an NSPS exemption determination. The EPA\u2019s exemption decision would always turn on the existence of a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for the \u201cfabrication\u201d of an \u201caffected facility\u201d that must necessarily precede its actual \u201cerection\u201d and \u201cinstallation.\u201d Our interpretation, on the other hand, gives effect to all the words used to define \u201cconstruction\u201d in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Second, the EPA\u2019s present interpretation of \u201cconstruction\u201d is inconsistent with the position taken by that agency in <em>Painesville. </em>Before the <em>Painesville </em>court the EPA argued that the construction of the \u201caffected facility\u201d in that case \u2014 also a power plant boiler \u2014 commenced \u201cwhen actual construction at the building site was started for a particular type of boiler, so that modification of existing physical construction would be required if the boiler specifications were changed to accommodate anti-pollution control devices.\u201d <em>United States v. City of Painesville, </em>431 F.Supp. at 500. While decision in <em>Painesville </em>turned on the reasonableness of the EPA\u2019s interpretation of its definition of \u201ccommenced\u201d under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(i), the EPA\u2019s present interpretation of \u201cconstruction\u201d conflicts with the position it took in <em>Painesville </em>because it has the effect of limiting examination for evidence of a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d to expenditures for \u201cfabrication\u201d of the \u201caffected facility\u201d and places \u201cactual construction at the building site\u201d outside the scope of review. Our interpretation, however, brings the EPA\u2019s definition of \u201cconstruction\u201d into consonance with its definition of \u201ccommenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Finally, the EPA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cconstruction\u201d is simply at odds with the congressional desire that industry not be required to institute costly retrofitting of existing facilities to accommodate the best demonstrated pollution-control technology mandated by the NSPS provisions. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 95-294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 184-86 (1977). As PEPCO has persuasively pointed out, the major expenditures incurred in incorporating new emission control technology into an electric generating unit are for expansion of buildings and modification of equipment that support an \u201caffected facility\u201d rather than for modification of the \u201caffected facility\u201d itself. Therefore, it would clearly thwart the legislative intent to look only at the \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for \u201cfabrication\u201d of the boiler in determining whether a utility\u2019s \u201cconstruction\u201d of a new generating facility had \u201ccommenced\u201d to such an extent that it would be unreasonable to require the utility to modify that facility to accommodate new emission control technology. Our own interpretation, to the contrary, effectuates the congressional purpose in enacting the NSPS provisions by broadening the scope of examination of \u201cconstruction\u201d of an \u201caffected facility\u201d to include \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d for the construction of facilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>essential to the <em>eventual </em>\u201cerection\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d of an \u201caffected facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Having passed on the validity of the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the regulations essential to decision in the present case, we now turn to the question whether the regional administrator\u2019s ultimate decision denying an exemption to PEPCO was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). Although we note two flaws in the reasoning on which the regional administrator based his decision, we do not think that decision was an abuse of discretion inasmuch as our correction of the flaws does not change the ultimate result.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The regional administrator erred first in stating that it has been the \u201cEPA\u2019s consistent interpretation of the term \u2018contractual obligation\u2019 in previous NSPS determinations\u201d that it be demonstrated by an agreement that, if terminated, would result in a \u201csubstantial loss.\u201d 45 Fed.Reg. at 20,156. As we have already found, the requirement to be discerned from prior EPA decisions is one of \u201csignificant liability\u201d rather than \u201csubstantial loss.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, while we think that it is important to note the distinction between the two standards, we find that it has no effect on the validity of the regional administrator\u2019s ultimate decision in the present case because PEPCO has failed to demonstrate liability for construction of any sort, much less liability lying between \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201csubstantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The regional administrator\u2019s other error was in restricting his examination for a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for \u201cconstruction\u201d of the \u201caffected facility\u201d to PEPCO\u2019s possible liability for fabrication of the boiler itself. Under what we have determined to be the appropriate interpretation of \u201cconstruction,\u201d as defined in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(g), the regional administrator should have broadened the scope of his inquiry to include \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for the construction of structures and equipment essential to the eventual \u201cerection\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d of the \u201caffected facility.\u201d Again, however, correction of this flaw in the regional administrator\u2019s decision has no effect on the ultimate exemption determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">PEPCO has contended that, even if it had not incurred a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for \u201cfabrication\u201d of the boiler by CE prior to the August 17, 1971 publication of the relevant NSPS, it had, prior to that date, entered into \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d with GE for construction of the turbine-generator and with UE&amp;C for the on-site construction of the entire Chalk Point Unit # 4 facility. Because construction of the turbine-generator is not essential to the eventual \u201cerection\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d of the boiler, P\u00c9PCO\u2019s negotiations with GE are irrelevant under even our interpretation of \u201cconstruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>PEPCO\u2019s possible \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d to UE&amp;C, on the other hand, is clearly relevant to the exemption determination in the instant case. PEPCO has failed, however, to produce any evidence of liability to UE&amp;C for \u201cconstruction\u201d of the on-site structure essential to the eventual support of the boiler prior to August 17, 1971. At best, PEPCO can only point to \u201cengineering work, project design and construction management\u201d that UE&amp;C had performed prior to publication of the relevant NSPS. As the <em>Painesville </em>court noted, however, \u201cif the only work made fruitless by the need to meet antipollution standards is in the design or planning of a new source, then operators are required to modify those designs or operating plans to meet new stationary source emission standards,\u201d and such an interpretation \u201cis given credence by Congress\u2019 use of the word \u2018construction\u2019 in [\u00a7 lll(aX3)] rather than the words \u2018planning\u2019 or \u2018designing.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. City of Painesville, </em>431 F.Supp. at 501 n.8. Because PEPCO has been unable to produce any evidence of \u201csignificant liability\u201d to UE&amp;C for actual construction at the Unit # 4 site prior to August 17, 1971, we believe that the regional administrator\u2019s failure to consider that possibility is inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">With the modifications indicated, we affirm the decision of the EPA\u2019s regional administrator denying exemption of PEP-CO\u2019s Chalk Point Unit # 4 from compliance with the relevant NSPS published by the EPA on August 17, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\">. PEPCO has also contended that it is entitled to relief from the ruling in any event because of the regional administrator\u2019s delay in making his determination. We find this contention to be without merit for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">First, although PEPCO cites a number of cases in which federal courts have compelled by injunction agency action wrongfully withheld in violation of a statutory duty, see, e. <em>g., Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Johnston, </em>295 F.2d 856, 861-64 (4th Cir. 1961) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1) provides the authority to \u201ccompel agency action ... unreasonably delayed,\u201d as the court found in <em>EEOC v. Raymond Metal Products Co., </em>385 F.Supp. 907, 914 (D.Md. 1974), <em>aff'd, </em>530 F.2d 590 (4th Cir. 1976), \u00a7 706(1) \u201cwas clearly intended for situations where an agency has <em>failed to take </em>appropriate action and not for situations ... where the agency action <em>has been taken </em>in an allegedly unreasonable time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"AgNf\">Second, even if this court were to recognize PEPCO\u2019s potential right to relief, we believe PEPCO would be estopped from asserting any prejudice resulting from the EPA\u2019s delay in acting on its request for an NSPS exemption by its own lengthy delay in requesting that exemption. Although PEPCO began construction on its Chalk Point Unit # 4 facility in late 1971, it did not ask for a ruling on the applicability of the NSPS to that facility, which PEPCO admittedly had the burden of requesting, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.5(a), until 1977. PEPCO suggests that it only discovered the possibility of the NSPS\u2019 applicability to this facility two months prior to its request for a ruling. In view of the fact that several other utilities had long before requested rulings in this precise matter, we think that this major utility must be charged with at least constructive notice at a much earlier time, saving any question of actual notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-5\">. The EPA\u2019s NSPS regulations are promulgated under the authority of \u00a7 111 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411. The PSD regulations, however, find their statutory mandate in \u00a7\u00a7 160-169 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7470-7479. The unit to which the NSPS regulations are to apply is a \u201cstationary source,\u201d which is defined as \u201cany building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant,\u201d \u00a7 111(a)(3), Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7411(a)(3). Although the unit to which the PSD regulations are to apply is the facially different one of a \u201cmajor emitting facility,\u201d that term is defined in \u00a7 169(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1), as any of a number of \u201cstationary sources of air pollutants\u201d that emit specified amounts of prohibited pollutants, and the <em>Alabama Power </em>court held that the definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d in \u00a7 111(a)(3) controlled the meaning of that term when used in the PSD part, <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, </em>606 F.2d at 1077. The court went on to point out, however, that the individual terms \u201cfacility,\u201d \u201cbuilding,\u201d \u201cstructure\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d used to define \u201cstationary source\u201d in \u00a7 111(a)(3) are not defined by statute and that the EPA could define the terms differently to effectuate the different purpose of the NSPS and PSD provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 1077 n.13. Thus, the <em>Alabama Power </em>court\u2019s decision on the EPA\u2019s construction of those terms for purposes of the PSD part should be considered of little, if any, precedential value in construing the same terms for purposes of the NSPS regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">. The regional administrator\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csubstantial loss\u201d is understandable because that was the term used in an internal agency memorandum directed to the regional administrator in March 1980. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix at 199-200. We do not believe, however, that the term was used in that memorandum or in the regional administrator\u2019s decision as a shorthand reference to the \u201csubstantial loss\u201d standard that the EPA has applied in exempting sources from the PSD requirements. <em>See, e. g., Montana Power Co. v. EPA, </em>608 F.2d 334, 340 (9th Cir. 1979). To the contrary, the discussion of EPA policy in which the term is used in the March 1980 memorandum, <em>see </em>Joint Appendix at 199, as well as the more detailed discussion in another memorandum directed to the regional administrator, <em>see </em>Memorandum from R. Sarah Compton, Director, Enforcement Division to Jack J. Schramm, Regional Administrator (March 7, 1980) <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix at 174-98, clearly articulate a standard for establishing a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d that the EPA now refers to as one of \u201csignificant liability.\u201d Therefore, we regard the regional administrator\u2019s reference to \u201csubstantial loss\u201d as a loose use of technical language rather than the application of a new and higher requirement for establishing a \u201ccontractual obligation.\u201d Moreover, even were the phrase used in the latter sense, as our subsequent discussion in text demonstrates, this error did not affect the ultimate outcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
