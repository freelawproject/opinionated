Appellants allege a widespread scheme to misrepresent the financial condition of NSMC and thereby to stimulate investor interest in NSMC\u2019s securities. They seek damages to remedy losses suffered when the value of NSMC stock dropped suddenly and dramatically more than a decade ago, and they appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claims as time-barred. On cross-appeal defendants argue that the court below erred in finding that appellants have a private right of action under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), 15 U.S.C \u00a7 78j(b) (1976), and under section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-18\">We reverse the district court\u2019s holding, 461 F.Supp. 999, that appellants\u2019 claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and we affirm appellants\u2019 right to pursue a remedy under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In December of 1979, appellants (Wachovia) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> bought approximately five million dollars\u2019 worth of NSMC stock from the corporation and two of its directors. The purchase was a private placement transaction governed by detailed purchase agreements. Two months later, the market price of NSMC stock declined more than sixty percent, and NSMC announced that it expected to report a loss for the previous fiscal quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) then began a two-year investigation of NSMC, which ended in February, 1972, with the filing of an enforcement and injunction action against NSMC and the other major participants in NSMC\u2019s merger with Interstate National Corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission charged that the price of NSMC stock had been artificially inflated in violation of the securities laws. In addition, various civil actions were filed in 1970 and 1972 by purchasers of NSMC stock.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The original complaint in this case, filed January 29, 1973, sought damages from NSMC and several of its officers and employees and from Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. (PMM), NSMC\u2019s independent auditor; Anthony Natelli, the PMM partner in charge of the NSMC account; and Joseph Scansaroii, the PMM audit supervisor. These defendants were charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud investors by artificially inflating the price of NSMC stock and thereby violating various sections of 1933 and 1934 Acts. Specifically, appellants contended that misrepresentations about NSMC\u2019s financial condition had been included in oral statements, in press releases, in reports filed with the SEC, and in other published reports not filed with the Commission. The fraudulent scheme was allegedly furthered by NSMC\u2019s acquisition of a number of corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">The original complaint did not name as defendants White &amp; Case, NSMC\u2019s outside counsel, or Jay Epley, the White &amp; Case partner principally in charge of the NSMC account. As NSMC\u2019s counsel, they had drafted a purchase agreement between appellants and NSMC and had issued a legal opinion to appellants, in which the buyers were assured that the contemplated transaction would not violate any statute. Two days before the complaint was filed, appellants had entered into a letter agreement with White &amp; Case and Epley, which provided that the statute of limitations would be tolled as to them for two years from the date of the letter. Appellants then amended their complaint on May 28, 1975, to include White &amp; Case and Epley as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The defendants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> moved to dismiss the complaint on two grounds: that the action was time-barred under the two-year statute of limitations of the District of Columbia\u2019s blue sky law, and that the sections of the securities acts on which the claims were based did not provide for or allow a private right of action. The district court held that a private remedy was implied under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, but the court dismissed the action as untimely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both issues are now before this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>II. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Two statute of limitations questions must be resolved: (1) whether the district court committed error in applying retrospectively <em>Forrestal Village, Inc. v. Graham, </em>551 F.2d 411 (D.C. Cir. 1977), which calls for a two-year statute of limitations in Rule 10b-5 actions; and (2) whether the district court properly declined application of the equitable tolling principle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">A. <em>The Applicable Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">For causes of action implied under the securities laws, the forum state\u2019s statute of limitations rules. <em>See Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 210 n.29, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1389 n.29, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). At issue here is which limitations period to apply: the three-year general fraud provision, D.C. Code \u00a7 12-301(8) (1973), or the two-year blue sky law provision, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2-2413(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Resolution of this issue determines whether this suit should be dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.. Appellants bought NSMC stock on December 17, 1969. The statute of limitations began to run at the end of February, 1970,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the suit was filed in January, 1973 \u2014 more than two years, but less than three years, after the limitations period had begun to run. The district court found the two-year period applicable and accordingly dismissed the case for untimely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">The question of the appropriate statute of limitations is an equivocal one because the trend in the federal case law has shifted. Federal courts once favored invocation of the general fraud limitations period for Rule 10b-5 actions. But during the last decade, the law has moved toward application of the blue sky law limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">The case law in this circuit reflects that general trend. Before 1977, this court favored application of the three-year general fraud limitations period. But in <em>Forrestal Village, Inc. v. Graham, </em>551 F.2d 411 (D.C. Cir. 1977), we decided that the two-year blue sky law provision, rather than the three-year general fraud limitations guideline, \u201c \u2018best effectuates the federal policy involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In so ruling, this circuit joined the majority of circuits, which at that time \u2014 in 1977 \u2014 applied local blue sky law limitations periods to section 10(b) and section 17(a) securities actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">Whether the instant case should be governed by a three-year or two-year statute of limitations thus turns on whether the <em>Forrestal Village </em>decision is applied prospectively or retrospectively. The critical precedent on this question is <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971). We therefore look to that opinion for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>In <em>Chevron, </em>the plaintiff, who was injured while working on a drilling rig located on the Outer Continental Shelf, filed suit more than two years after the date the injury occurred. The defendant originally declined to raise the issue of the limitations period. The parties correctly assumed, based on federal court precedent, that admiralty law \u2014 including the doctrine of laches \u2014 applied to the case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> During discovery, however, the Supreme Court released its decision in <em>Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>395 U.S. 352, 89 S.Ct. 1835, 23 L.Ed.2d 360 (1969), which removed the applicability of admiralty law to cases like <em>Chevron. </em>Based on <em>Rodrigue, </em>the district court in <em>Chevron </em>applied the local one-year limitations period for personal injury suits and, accordingly, dismissed the case. <em>See </em>404 U.S. at 98-99, 92 S.Ct. at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Articulating three criteria, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Chevron </em>that its <em>Rodrigue </em>decision should be given prospective effect. The first, and most fundamental, factor is that \u201cthe decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 92 S.Ct. at 355 (citation omitted). Second, the court must consider whether retrospective application will further or hinder the purpose of the decision in question. Finally, prospectivity is required if retroactive application will create substantial injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In applying the first criterion and deciding whether a current decision overrules precedent, does the court look to the law as it appears at the time of the new decision, or to the time when a claim arose and a plaintiff relied on the law? The state of the law may fluctuate between these two dates, thereby changing the outcome of the first inquiry required by <em>Chevron. </em>The distinction is critical here.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The court below applied <em>Forrestal Village </em>retroactively. It ruled that that case failed to overrule precedent, as it existed when the decision was released in 1977. It is correct that, in 1977, the circuits favored application of the blue sky law limitations period. <em>Chevron, </em>however, does not seek to compare a new decision to the extant law when that decision was published. Rather, <em>Chevron </em>favors comparing the decision to the law at the time the plaintiff relied upon it, that is, the law after the claim arose and during the running of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">This choice is clear in the opinion itself. The very language of the first criterion set out in <em>Chevron </em>requires nonretroactive application of a decision that overrules law \u201con which litigants may have relied.\u201d Moreover, the court repeatedly noted that its <em>Rodrigue </em>decision reversed the law that the plaintiff relied upon when he contemplated filing suit. For example, the court observed that, from the time the plaintiff was injured until he commenced suit, the federal cases supported application of admiralty law to cases such as plaintiff\u2019s: \u201c[i]t cannot be assumed that he [plaintiff] did or could foresee that this consistent interpretation of the Lands Act would be overturned. The most he could do was rely on the law as it then was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 92 S.Ct. at 355. In reciting the facts, the court remarked, \u201c[w]hen this law suit was initiated, there was a line of federal court decisions\u201d favoring application of admiralty law, and the doctrine of laches, to the case. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 92 S.Ct. at 351. The court further noted that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries occurred three years before <em>Rodrigue </em>was released, and that the plaintiff filed his lawsuit more than one year before that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The lesson is clear. <em>Chevron </em>mandates nonretroactive application of a statute of limitations decision that overrules the weight of past precedent. In deciding whether this criterion is met, a court must compare the new limitations ruling with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>law the plaintiff relied upon when he contemplated filing suit. The court below thus erred in looking at the state of the law in 1977 when <em>Forrestal Village </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Appellants relied on the law from December, 1969, when they bought NSMC stock, until January, 1973, when they filed suit. During that period, this circuit favored application of the general fraud limitations period. In fact, courts in this circuit reaffirmed the three-year fraud period as late as 1975. <em>See, e. g., Vance v. National Realty Trust, </em>[1974-1975 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 95,004 (D.C. Cir. 1975); <em>National Realty Trust v. Neelon Management Co., </em>[1973 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 94,049 (D.D.C.1973); <em>Conlon v. University Computing Co., </em>[1972-1973 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 93,796 (D.D.C.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Moreover, as of December, 1971 \u2014 when the two-year limitations deadline applied by the district court expired \u2014 only one circuit court and one federal district court had applied the blue sky law limitations period to federal securities actions. <em>See Vanderboom v. Sexton, </em>422 F.2d 1233 (8th Cir. 1970); <em>Batchelor v. Legg &amp; Co., </em>52 F.R.D. 553 (D.Md.1971). On the other hand, forty-six federal court decisions had applied the' forum state\u2019s general fraud statute of limitations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These cases included opinions from eight United States Circuit Courts of Appeals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Thus, prior to, and during, the running of the limitations period, federal courts, including this circuit, overwhelmingly adopted the general fraud limitations period. It was the law at this point in time on which appellants relied. Accordingly, consideration of the first factor of <em>Chevron </em>points toward prospective application of <em>Forrestal Village.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">For the same reason, the third criterion also favors prospectivity. As in <em>Chevron, </em>\u201c[i]t would also produce the most \u2018substantial inequitable results\u2019 to hold that [appellants] \u2018slept on [their] rights\u2019 at a time when [they] could not have known the time limitation that the law imposed upon [them].\u201d 404 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. at 356 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">The second factor is more equivocal. The court did base its decision in <em>Forrestal Village </em>on which statute of limitations period best furthered federal policy. But the choice was ultimately dictated by the \u201ccommonality of purpose\u201d between the blue sky law and sections 10(b) and 17(a), 551 F.2d at 414, not by any substantive difference between a two- and three-year limitation. Even if this second factor suggests retroactive application of <em>Forrestal Village, </em>we think it outweighed by the first and third criteria, which overwhelmingly dictate that the decision be applied prospectively here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This action is therefore guided by the three-year statute of limitations for general fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>B. <em>Equitable Tolling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The doctrine of equitable tolling permits, with respect to fraud, the tolling of the limitations period until the plaintiff discovers, or should have discovered through the exercise of due diligence, the fraudulent activity. This court recently articulated the equitable tolling standard in <em>Fitzgerald v. Seamans, </em>553 F.2d 220, 228 (D.C. Cir. 1977): \u201ctime does not begin to run until plaintiff discovers, or by reasonable diligence could have discovered, the basis of the lawsuit.\u201d The <em>Fitzgerald </em>formulation of the equitable tolling doctrine reiterated a standard long applied in federal courts. <em>See, e. g., Cook v. Avien, Inc., </em>573 F.2d 685, 695 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>Berry Petroleum Co. v. Adams &amp; Peck, </em>518 F.2d 402, 410 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Klein v. Bower, </em>421 F.2d 338, 343 (D.C. Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The district court decided against invocation of the equitable tolling principle. It ruled that appellants \u201cshould have known of the fraud within the two-year statute of limitations, running immediately after the sale.\u201d 461 F.Supp. at 1010. The court based its ruling on certain \u201c \u2018code blue\u2019 notices of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009. These included the precipitous decline of the price of NSMC stock between December 17, 1969, and February 17, 1970; NSMC\u2019s reported loss on February 16, 1970, of 1.2 to 1.7 million dollars; and articles in <em>Barron\u2019s </em>(December 22, 1969)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>(February 17, 1970),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> questioning NSMC\u2019s auditing procedures and reporting the company\u2019s financial problems. The court below thus concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">[T]hese facts, coupled with the several lawsuits filed in 1970, provided a clearly marked trail, which, if pursued with diligence, would have led the plaintiffs to the fraud of the NSMC officials and to the attorney-defendants and their involvement in the stock sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">There can be little doubt that these code blue factors implicated the accountant-defendants \u2014 but only in February, 1970, when most of the events occurred. The only hint of fraud available to appellants before February, 1970, was the publication of the <em>Barron\u2019s </em>article, which appeared on December 22, 1969. This article criticized NSMC\u2019s practices of deferring costs, and of including as part of its 1969 income the earnings of companies acquired after expiration of the 1969 fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">This article, taken alone, was insufficient to alert appellants to fraudulent activity committed by the accountant-defendants. Although the article questions the nature of certain accounting procedures, it in no way intimates that such procedures were fraudulent. As a matter of law, we believe that one article challenging the accounting procedures of a reputable firm is insufficient to impute knowledge of fraud to appellants. <em>See Robertson v. Seidman &amp; Seidman, </em>609 F.2d 583 (2d Cir. 1979) (publicly disseminated information doubting propriety of accounting practices inconclusive regarding time that plaintiff possessed knowledge of fraud). Hence, although we agree with the court below that the code blue factors, taken cumulatively, were sufficient to warn appellants of the possibility of fraud on the part of the accountant-defendants, we nonetheless find that the court committed error in declining to toll the limitations period until February, 1970. The statute of limitations cannot run until the events that implicated the accountants occurred, and all but one of them occurred, or became discernible, in February, 1970. The statute of limitations against the accountants should thus be tolled until that time. Given our holding above that the three-year statute of limitations applies to this case, appellants filed this suit against the auditor-defendants within the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">We are unsure whether the code blue factors were sufficient to place appellants on notice in February, 1970, of the possibility of fraud committed by the attorney-defendants. But a more precise determination on the running of the limitations period against these defendants is unnecessary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Insofar as the three-year statute of limitations applies, and February, 1970, is the earliest possible time the attorney-defendants could have been implicated, appellants\u2019 claims against these defendants clearly fall within the limitations deadline. We therefore reverse the ruling of the court below and find that appellants\u2019 claims are not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">III. AVAILABILITY OF IMPLIED REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The second issue in this case resurrects a decade-old and multi-faceted controversy and requires application of a doctrine that was examined by the Supreme Court no less than five times during the last Term. The question before the court on the cross-appeal, and necessary to our decision in light of our holding on the statute of limitations question, is whether an implied right of action is available to Wachovia under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the corresponding SEC Rule 10b-5,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as well as under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or whether plaintiffs are limited to the express remedies set forth in those statutes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>A. <em>Implying a Cause of Action Under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5</em></p>\n<p id=\"A75\">It has been almost thirty-five years since a private cause of action was first implied under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and \u201ca substantial body of case law and commentary has developed as to its elements.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 197, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1382, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). Although the initial formulation of the implied remedy and the molding of its contours occurred in the courts of appeals,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has recognized an implied cause of action under 10(b) many times.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Moreover, despite many efforts, successful and unsuccessful, to amend related sections of the national securities laws, Congress never saw reason to limit or constrict the application of implied remedies under section 10(b). Longstanding judicial application of a court\u2019s statutory interpretation, the Supreme Court has said, when added to the failure of Congress to reject its reasoning, \u201cargues significantly in favor of [its] acceptance.\u201d <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 733, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The starting point for any inquiry regarding implied remedies is the intent of Congress in passing the statute in the first place. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinions, emphasizing that congressional intent must be the touchstone, have reaffirmed use of the test first articulated in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), for ascertaining that intent.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There the Court outlined the following four-step analysis to guide efforts to determine legislative intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">First, is the plaintiff \u201cone of the class for whose <em>especial </em>benefit the statute was enacted\u201d \u2014 that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2087 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Applying the <em>Cort </em>criteria, it is clear firstly that Wachovia is within the specific class to be protected by the statute. Section 10(b) proclaims as its purpose \u201cthe protection of investors.\u201d Secondly, as in other cases in which private remedies have been implied, a search of the legislative history yields little specific. Congress did not spend much time discussing 10(b), notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>standing its clear place as a \u201ccatch-all clause to prevent manipulative devices.\u201d <em>Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. at 202, 96 S.Ct. at 1385 (quoting Thomas Corcoran, spokesperson for the drafters of the statute); <em>see Chiarella v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 222, 226, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 1113, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Such silence, however, is neither surprising nor determinative. <em>See Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 18, 100 S.Ct. 242, 246, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979); <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 694, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1956, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Blue </em>Chip <em>Stamps, </em>421 U.S. at 737, 95 S.Ct. at 1926. If Congress had spoken plainly enough, the task would be simple. The quest, therefore, is not necessarily for evidence that Congress specifically intended to imply a private right of action, but rather for indications whether Congress meant to deny such a remedy. This was the thrust of <em>Transamerica. </em>There, the Court found legislative maneuverings that so reshaped earlier drafts of the statute at issue as to offer persuasive evidence that Congress wanted no implied remedies added to what the statute specifically provided.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> No such legislative history disposes of the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Because the relevant legislative chronicles do not negative the existence of implied remedies, the third factor of <em>Cort </em>must be examined: whether a private remedy \u201cis necessary or at least helpful to the accomplishment of the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>441 U.S. at 703, 99 S.Ct. at 1960. We find more than the requisite link between the existence of an implied cause of action and the broad purposes of the 1934 Act. A private right of action not only compensates the investors who are the beneficiaries of section 10(b) in general, but also affords a broad deterrent force against the fraud that the statute condemns. <em>See, e. g., Fratt v. Robinson, </em>203 F.2d 627, 631 (9th Cir. 1953). And, as the SEC argues forcefully in its amicus position, a private remedy is a necessary supplement to administrative enforcement because the Commission cannot do the job alone. <em>See Blue Chip Stamps, </em>421 U.S. at 730, 95 S.Ct. at 1922; <em>J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, </em>377 U.S. 426, 432-33, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 1559-1560 (1964); <em>cf. Cannon, </em>441 U.S. at 708 n.42, 99 S.Ct. at 1963 n.42.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Application of the <em>Cort </em>criteria thus points in favor of appellants\u2019 right to pursue a cause of action here. Cross-appellants urge, however, that recent opinions of the Supreme Court have limited preexisting law in this area. We cannot read those cases to support a conclusion that a private remedy under section 10(b) no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">In <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>441 U.S. 677, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), the Court held that there was a private right of action under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq. (1976), even though the statute itself specified no such cause of action. Among the two opinions recognizing an implied remedy and the two opinions in dissent, there was indeed reconciliation and reconsideration of earlier precedents. But the Court reiterated its adherence to earlier guidelines, in particular, the four-part test of <em>Cort v. Ash. </em>In fact, that was the core of the complaint vqiced by Justice Powell in dissent, who advocated abandonment of the <em>Cort </em>approach. <em>See </em>441 U.S. at 749, 99 S.Ct. at 1985.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The second case cited as proof of this radical shift away, from implied remedies is <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979). There the Court did reject urgings for an implied remedy for violations of section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q(a) (1976). The Court pointed out how frequently it was called upon to \u201cdecide whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 99 S.Ct. at 2482. But the Court did not announce that it was going out of the business.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Most recently, in <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 100 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979), the Court refused to imply a cause of action under section 206 of the Investors Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-6 (1976), a statutory provision worded very similarly to Rule 10b-5. The Court relied there on two pieces of evidence weighing against implication of a private remedy. First, the Act nowhere provided for damage remedies, from which the Court inferred that Congress had been unwilling to impose any monetary liability in private suits under the Act. The 1933 and 1934 Acts do, of course, provide express damage remedies, and the Court in <em>Transamerica </em>specifically distinguished them. <em>See </em>444 U.S. at 20-21, 100 S.Ct. at 247-248. Second, although early drafts of the Investors Advisers Act had given federal courts jurisdiction over \u201call suits in equity <em>and actions at law </em>brought to enforce any <em>liability or </em>duty\u201d created by the statute, the final version appeared without the italicized phrases. The Court interpreted this omission as corroborating Congress\u2019 rejection of any civil liability. <em>See id. </em>at 21-22, 100 S.Ct. at 247-248. In contrast, the 1934 Act\u2019s jurisdictional provision, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (1976), is identical to the early version of the Investors Advisers act quoted above.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">It may be reasonable to infer from these recent pronouncements that the Court is not favorably inclined toward expanding the doctrine of implied remedies; it is unreasonable to imply, as cross-appellants seem to in their briefs, that all the implied remedies that have previously been established have now been swept away. In sum, we find that under the <em>Cort </em>analysis, section 10(b) continues to lend itself to private remedies, and that neither the spirit nor the letter of any Supreme Court opinion suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>B. <em>Application of Section 10(b) to Newly Issued Securities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Cross-appellants argue that the entire 1934 Act, of which section 10(b) is a part, is inapplicable to this case because the Act was intended to regulate securities only after distribution. It is the 1933 Act, say cross-appellants, which was meant to cover newly issued securities. Such a rigidly compartmentalized analysis misses the clear intention of Congress and the overall purposes of the statutory scheme. Section 10(b) by its very terms applies to \u201cany security,\u201d whether or not registered on a national exchange. The language was intended to be sweeping, and it has been so held. <em>See Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 128, 151, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 1471, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972). In <em>SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, </em>375 U.S. 180, 195, 84 S.Ct. 275, 284, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963), the Court declared that Congress wanted securities legislation aimed at protecting against fraud to be construed \u201cnot technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Cross-appellants advance the legislative history of the 1934 Act as supportive of their interpretation. Even if the-language of section 10(b) were not so plain, its legislative history would offer cross-appellants little solace. That history corroborates Congress\u2019 intent, as noted above, that 10(b) act as a \u201ccatch-all clause to prevent manipulative devices.\u201d In fact, earlier drafts of the section limited its applicability to securities listed on a national exchange, but that restriction was removed in conference. See 1 A. Bromberg, Securities Law: Fraud \u00a7 2.2(320) (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The broad scope of section 10(b) has been widely recognized, and the section has been applied to newly issued securities and to those sold in private placements. <em>See, e. g., Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>404 U.S. 6, 12, 92 S.Ct. 165, 169, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971) (\u201c[W]e read \u00a7 10(b) to mean that Congress meant to bar deceptive devices and contrivances in the purchase or sale of securities whether conducted in the original markets or face to face.\u201d); <em>Woolf v. S. D. Cohn &amp; Co., </em>515 F.2d 591, 606-07 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>426 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 3161, 49 L.Ed.2d 1181 (1976), <em>on remand, </em>546 F.2d 1252 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 831, 98 S.Ct. 115, 54 L.Ed.2d 91 (1977); <em>Leasco Data Processing Equipment Corp. v. Maxwell, </em>468 F.2d 1326, 1336 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>Lawrence v. SEC, </em>398 F.2d 276, 280 (1st Cir. 1968); <em>Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., </em>282 F.2d 195, 201 (5th Cir. 1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>365 U.S. 814, 81 S.Ct. 695, 5 L.Ed.2d 693 (1961); <em>Fratt v. Robinson, </em>203 F.2d 627, 629-31 (9th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Moreover, overlap between the two statutes is neither \u201cunusual nor unfortunate.\u201d <em>SEC v. National Securities, Inc., </em>393 U.S. 453, 468, 89 S.Ct. 564, 572, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969), <em>quoted in United States v. Naftalin, </em>441 U.S. 768, 778, 99 S.Ct. 2077, 2084, 60 L.Ed.2d 624 (1979). It is nowhere written that each pronouncement of Congress must be mutually exclusive of every other pronouncement. In the securities field, Congress has dealt with the problems of regulation many times \u2014 on both the cosmic and the specific levels. The 1933 and 1934 Acts are meant to be interrelated and interdependent' components of a general scheme, and the two should be read together. <em>See Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 206, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1387, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). There is no conflict between them, and their overlap in no way diminishes the plain meaning of section 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">C. <em>The Relevance of Express Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Cross-appellants\u2019 final contention is that section 10(b) may not give rise to an implied remedy because other specific sections of the 1933 and 1934 Acts provide pertinent express remedies. The argument smacks somewhat of a \u201cCatch 22\u201d arrangement because in each instance cross-appellants are at the ready to show that the express remedies are not really available to Wachovia. And the argument has been unavailing in previous cases for reasons that are applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The ancient maxim <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius\u201d is a dangerous road map <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>with which to explore legislative intent. As we have pointed out above, the nature of the legislative process militates against each enactment\u2019s being self-contained and mutually exclusive of every other enactment. Even in the context of a single piece of legislation, the existence of an express remedy arising under one section does not preclude the need for an implied remedy in other situations under other sections of the act. Such rigid analysis, noted the Supreme Court, would be an \u201cexcursion into extrapolation of legislative intent [that is] entirely unilluminating.\u201d <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 83 n.14, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2090 n.14, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">It is true that the Supreme Court has expressed concern about implying private rights of action when express remedies have been created by statute, but that concern has been limited to cases in which the express remedies would be nullified if additional remedies were implied. <em>See Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 574, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2488, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979); <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 208-11, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1388-1389, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 736, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1925, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Such circumvention can hardly be an issue here, where the express remedies are totally different from the remedy implied under section 10(b), and where the express remedies are meant to treat different problems and to be applied in different situations.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Section 11 of the 1933 Act,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> for example, imposes civil liability for filing a false regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tration statement. Under that provision, a defendant may be held liable even for negligent misstatements. Because of its broader liability, section ll\u2019s reach is limited by restrictions on the class of plaintiffs to whom its remedy is available and by a short and strict statute of limitations. To no one\u2019s surprise, the remedy is unavailable to Wachovia on both counts: no registration statement was filed, and the suit was brought well beyond the time allowed under section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Nothing in the remedy expressly provided by section 11 is inconsistent with an implied right of action under section 10(b). Under 10(b), negligence is not enough \u2014 one is liable only for fraud. The higher burden of proof under section 10(b) is clearly a tradeoff for the limitations on section 11 claims, and it accounts in part for the fact that there are two separate sections dealing with related problems. <em>See Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., </em>188 F.2d 783, 786-87 (2d Cir. 1951); <em>Beecher v. Able, </em>435 F.Supp. 397, 412 (S.D.N.Y.1977). <em>See also Globus v. Law Research Service, Inc., </em>418 F.2d 1276, 1284 (2d Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 913, 90 S.Ct. 913, 25 L.Ed.2d 93 (1970) (same argument applied when implying remedy under section 17(a) of the 1933 Act). Moreover, according to the view urged by cross-appellants, section 10(b) would serve no useful function because fraud is included within the broad proscription of section 11. Indeed, if no remedies may be implied under 10(b), investors defrauded in a purchase of unregistered securities are left less protected than investors suffering losses as the result of typographical errors in a registration statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">For the same reasons, implying a remedy under section 10(b) creates no danger of circumvention of section 12(2) of the 1933 Act,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> which deals with false prospectuses and oral communications. The cause of action expressly provided by that section is available in the event of negligent misstatements, and again the more stringent fraud requirement of section 10(b) serves as a trade-off for section 12(2)\u2019s short statute of limitations and apparent restriction of defendants to sellers of securities. <em>See Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. National Student Marketing Corp., </em>461 F.Supp. 999, 1006 (D.D.C.1978). <em>See also In re New York City Municipal Securities Litigation, </em>507 F.Supp. 169, at 179 &amp; n.20 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (using similar analysis to approve section 10(b) suit by purchasers of municipal securities foreclosed from using express remedy of section 12(2), which exempts government securities).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Finally, cross-appellants point to section 18 of the 1934 Act<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> as providing an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>press remedy that precludes implication of a cause of action under section 10(b). Section 18 makes any person filing a \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d statement with the SEC liable for damages caused by reliance on that statement. Cross-appellants\u2019 contention was recently considered and rejected by the Second Circuit in <em>Ross v. A. H. Robins Co., </em>607 F.2d 545 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 946, 100 S.Ct. 2175, 64 L.Ed.2d 802 (1980). The court there discussed various differences between the two sections which militate against regarding them as mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">First, section 10(b) by its very terms has a much broader reach than does section 18. The latter, noted the Second Circuit, has \u201cthe narrow and particularized objective of encouraging use of and reliance upon records filed with the S.E.C.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>607 F.2d at 556. Section 18 therefore requires that plaintiffs prove actual reliance on particular filed statements, whereas section 10(b) presumes reliance if the omission is material or if the misstatement affects the price of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Second, section 10(b) imposes a more stringent burden of proof on plaintiffs\u2014 proof of actual fraud. Under section 18, a plaintiff need only show that a filed document contains a material omission or misstatement and that he relied on that document. The defendant then has the onus of establishing his good faith and lack of knowledge of the falsity. This distinction is noteworthy because, as the court noted in <em>Ross, </em>\u201cthe ultimate outcome of the litigation may hinge upon who bears the burden of establishing the defendant\u2019s state of mind.\u201d 607 F.2d at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">In addition to pointing out the differences between the express remedy of section 18 and an implied remedy under section 10(b), the Second Circuit also reasoned that a holding that the section 18 remedy is exclusive would be incongruous. Whether a misstatement occurs in a filed or unfiled document has no bearing on the damage resulting from an investor\u2019s reliance on that document and therefore should not be considered significant. Moreover, if section 18\u2019s remedy is deemed exclusive, corporate managers will have an incentive to file misleading documents with the SEC in order to limit their liability to those few who can prove actual reliance on the documents. The very purpose of section 18 \u2014 encouraging reliance on filed records \u2014 would be substantially frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">We find <em>Ross </em>persuasive support for our holding that a cause of action may be implied under section 10(b), irrespective of the availability of the express remedies provided by other sections of the securities laws. By approving an implied remedy under section 10(b), we do not pave the way for circumvention of the limitations on the express remedies. The absence of similar restrictions in section 10(b) suits is counterbalanced by that section\u2019s stricter burden of proof. The various remedies are aimed at righting different wrongs, and no one of them should therefore be considered exclusive.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Even if we were inclined to hold that the express remedies were intended to be exclusive, they should only preclude implied causes of action in those cases in which they truly constitute \u201cremedies.\u201d Where, as here, those express remedies are not available to a plaintiff or do not adequately dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>pose of his claim, an implied remedy is appropriate.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In this case, relief was not available to Wachovia under any of the aforementioned provisions. The scope of section 11 of the 1933 Act is restricted to false registration statements, and the transaction here, because it did not involve a public offering, was not subject to the registration requirement. <em>See </em>section 4(2) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77d(2) (1976). Cross-appellants may not be sued under section 12(2) of the 1933 Act, which limits potential defendants to sellers. <em>See Wachovia, </em>461 F.Supp. at 1006; <em>Collins v. Signetics Corp., </em>605 F.2d 110, 113 (3d Cir. 1979); <em>DeMarco v. Edens, </em>390 F.2d 836, 841 n.3 (2d Cir. 1968). Finally, plaintiffs have not claimed reliance on any documents filed with the SEC and thus may not bring suit under section 18 of the 1934 Act. Moreover, they have alleged materially false statements which were never contained in a filed document and which are thus exempt from section 18 liability. <em>See Wachovia, </em>461 F.Supp. at 1006.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In contrast to the inapplicability of the express remedies provided by the 1933 and 1934 Acts, an action under section 10(b) is particularly appropriate here. That provision is concerned with the type of fraud alleged by plaintiffs \u2014 \u201ca complex market manipulation rather than individual misstatements or omissions.\u201d <em>Wachovia, </em>461 F.Supp. at 1007; <em>see Blackie v. Barrack, </em>524 F.2d 891, 903 n.19, 907 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 816, 97 S.Ct. 57, 50 L.Ed.2d 75 (1976). Appellants should, therefore, be able to maintain a cause of action under section 10(b), the only true relief available to them. We hold that appellants may pursue their claims under that section, regardless of whether an alternative remedy is available to them under some other section of the 1933 or 1934 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">It has become fashionable to challenge the existence of any implied remedies, as evidenced by the ever-increasing frequency with which the question has been presented to the Supreme Court and to other courts. <em>See Redington, </em>442 U.S. at 562, 99 S.Ct. at 2482. We find nothing in the opinions of either the Supreme Court or of the other courts of appeals to warrant the suggestion that implied remedies no longer exist. Most recently, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found a private remedy implied by the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-24 (1976). <em>See Leist v. Simplot, </em>49 U.S.L.W. 2056 (July 22, 1980). That case arose out of the notorious Maine potato futures default. The defendants urged the court to deny a private remedy because Congress had amended the Commodity Exchange Act in 1974 and had failed to include an express private remedy in the sections pertinent to the case. The court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">The existence of an implied right of action under the Act as it stood in 1974 was repeatedly called to the attention of, and implicitly approved by, Congress. When a principle has become settled through court decisions, there is no occasion for Congress to speak unless it wishes a change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">As we noted above, the securities laws have been addressed by Congress on numerous occasions since 1934, most recently in 1975. Obviously, if Congress bad wished to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>disapprove the judicial implication of a private remedy under section 10(b), it had an opportunity to do so. The silence is significant. <em>Cf. Power Reactor Development Co. v. International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers, </em>367 U.S. 396, 409, 81 S.Ct. 1529, 1535, 6 L.Ed.2d 924 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The court in <em>Leist </em>also addressed the argument that the Supreme Court has changed the law of implied remedies. After reviewing the Court\u2019s recent opinions, which we have discussed above, the Second Circuit rejected the argument, saying</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ7\">[t]he effect of these decisions is simply to emphasize that the ultimate touchstone is congressional intent and not judicial notions of what would constitute wise policy-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">49 U.S.L.W. at 2057. We read those eases alike. Just as it would be lawmaking for the courts to decide what good policy is in the first instance, so too the courts ought not retract for policy reasons a longstanding doctrine of legislative interpretation, especially one impliedly approved by Congress. It is the prerogative of Congress, presumed to be aware of how its enactments have been treated, to sound the call for a new direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">It is more than a decade since the collapse of NSMC stock, and long past time that appellants be given an opportunity to pursue the substance of their claims and, if appropriate, to recover for losses incurred as NSMC shareholders and alleged victims of securities fraud. We reverse the holding of the court below that it is the two-year statute of limitations for the District of Columbia\u2019s blue sky law that applies here and the holding that the doctrine of equitable tolling is unavailable to appellants. Accordingly, we find that this action is not time-barred under the District\u2019s three-year limitations period for general fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">We hold further that appellants may rely on a remedy implicit under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, irrespective of the possibility of overlap between that implied cause of action and express remedies provided by other sections of the securities laws. Section 10(b) is peculiarly appropriate to the allegations of fraud made by appellants, and we find nothing in the legislative history of the securities laws or in recent Supreme Court opinions inconsistent with an implied right of action under section 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\">.

Hence, a member of the purported class, after denial of certification, may intervene in an individual suit without penalty for the time period during which the class certification issue is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayf\">The district court correctly ruled that appellants fail to qualify for the <em>American Pipe </em>tolling rule.

Because we decide that appellants may pursue a private remedy under \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act, and because their claims can be fully satisfied by such an action, we do not decide whether a private right of action may be implied \u25a0 under \u00a7 17(a) of the 1933 Act.
