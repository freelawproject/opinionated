(C &amp; NW) for $12,750. A deposit of $2,500 accompanied the offer, which provided that the deposit would \u201cbe refunded if this offer is not accepted by seller within ninety (90). days.\u201d On August 31,1978, C &amp; NW mailed a check for $2,500 back to Verry, thus indicating that it had not accepted his offer to buy the land. Verry sued C &amp; NW for breach of contract. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that \u201cno contract was ever entered into by the Defendant.\u201d Judgment was entered accordingly, and plaintiff Verry appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-20\">We agree with the District Court. The offer was never accepted. Nor were the circumstances, including defendant\u2019s silence until August 31, such as to estop C &amp; NW to deny acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-21\">No useful purpose would be served by a more extended discussion.
