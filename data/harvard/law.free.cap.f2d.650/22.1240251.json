Weaver, appeals from a final judgment of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissing his claim for failure to exhaust state administrative and judicial remedies. Appellant, a temporary inmate at Tioga County jail, filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint alleging numerous constitutional violations at the facility. The district judge, acting upon the recommendation of a magistrate, construed appellant\u2019s complaint as alleging a cause of action under the federal Declaratory Relief and Mandamus Acts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he therefore held that appellant was barred by exhaustion principles from bringing his claims. We hold that appellant\u2019s complaint may state, if proper standing is demonstrated, a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976). Such an action would not be subject to the exhaustion doctrine. Therefore, we will reverse the lower court\u2019s judgment and remand for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">On June 10, 1980, appellant filed a complaint in district court alleging numerous constitutional violations at the Tioga County Prison. Appellant was temporarily confined to the Tioga prison during April, 1980, while he testified at a trial in Tioga County, Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He asserted in his form complaint that during his brief incarceration he witnessed and was subject to unconstitutional conditions at the prison, including the denial of an adequate law library for prisoner use, prohibitions on prisoners\u2019 collaboration in legal research and writing tasks, denial of out-of-doors exercise periods, deprivation of sanitary facilities for bathing and washing clothes, and denial of a written request or grievance procedures. <em>Appellant's Appendix </em>at 6-7. Appellant sought a preliminary injunction and declaratory judgment against the defendants to remedy these conditions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">Upon receiving the complaint, the trial judge referred appellant\u2019s case to a federal magistrate. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (1976) (federal Magistrate\u2019s Act). The magistrate, in a brief report, recommended that appellant\u2019s complaint be dismissed for failure to exhaust his state judicial and administrative remedies. The report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">While Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is written on a form designating his action as one raised under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, in actuality the jurisdictional bases for Plaintiff\u2019s action are 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 and 2202, since the sole remedies sought by Plaintiff are mandamus, declaratory and injunctive in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>In cases of this nature it is clear that a state inmate, just as a federal inmate, must exhaust all of his available state judicial and administrative remedies before he presents his case on the merits to a federal district court. <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 490-492 [93 S.Ct. 1827, 1836-37, 36 L.Ed.2d 439] (1973); <em>Pitchess v. Davis, </em>421 U.S. 482 [95 S.Ct. 1748, 44 L.Ed.2d 317] (1975); <em>Waddell v. Alldredge, </em>480 F.2d 1078 (3d Cir. 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">Magistrates Report at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>Appellant\u2019s Appendix at 15. The district court, in a separate order on June 30, 1980, adopted the Magistrate\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The district court erred in construing appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint as one brought under the federal Declaratory Relief and Mandamus Acts. While a litigant might seek a declaration that the conditions at a prison facility are in violation of constitutional standards, the Declaratory Relief Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202 (1976),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not provide the jurisdictional basis for such actions. <em>Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 671, 70 S.Ct. 876, 878-79, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1949). Rather, the Act empowers a federal court to grant the remedy only when there is already an actual controversy, based upon independent jurisdictional grounds, before the court. See <em>Wells v. United States, </em>280 F.2d 275, 277 (9th Cir. 1960) (\u201cIt is well settled . .. that said Act does not of itself create jurisdiction; it merely adds an additional remedy where the district court already has jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d). In the instant case, it appears to us that appellant intended to bring his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See </em>text accompanying notes 7-11 <em>infra. </em>The jurisdictional basis for his action would therefore be 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and (4) (1976), not the Declaratory Relief Act. The district court erred in assuming that a plaintiff who seeks as one of his remedies a declaratory judgment brings his action under sections 2201 and 2202. Many litigants, including appellant, touch upon these provisions only to secure a specific remedy, not to provide the vehicle for their cause of action or jurisdiction. <em>See, e. g., Educational Equality League, </em>333 F.Supp. 1202 (E.D.Pa.1971). We hold that appellant in this case did not bring his cause of action under the Declaratory Relief Act and therefore was not subject to the exhaustion principles that may be attendant to that Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Similarly, we hold that the district court erred in interpreting appellant\u2019s section 1983 action as one brought under the federal Mandamus Act. Even if appellant had wanted to state a cause of action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1976),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he could not have done so. Section 1361, by its terms, applies only to writs issued against an \u201cofficer or employee of the United States.\u201d Appellant brought his action against state officials at the Tioga County prison only, not against federal officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">As this court reads it, and as appellees\u2019 counsel candidly admitted at oral argument, appellant\u2019s complaint, both on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>face and in content, alleges a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976). Section 1983 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by \u25a0 the constitution and laws, shall be \u25a0 liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Section 1983 is often used, in conjunction with its jurisdictional provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and (4), to redress constitutional deprivations at prison facilities. <em>See, e. g., Sweet v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, </em>529 F.2d 854 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Wojtczak v. Cuyler, </em>480 F.Supp. 1288 (E.D.Pa.1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In his complaint, conspicuously entitled \u201cFORM TO BE USED BY A PRISONER FILING A COMPLAINT UNDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,\u201d appellant alleges a series of constitutional violations by the defendants. He claimed violations of the first amendment right to access to the courts, <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and eighth amendment violations caused by the oppressive conditions at the prison, <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If appellant proves these allegations, and has standing to assert them, he will be entitled to relief under the federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Therefore, given this court\u2019s policy of interpreting <em>pro se </em>complaints liberally,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we must view appellant\u2019s complaint as one alleging a cause of action under section 1983.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Unlike actions under the federal Mandamus Act, actions under section 1983 do not carry with them the added requirement that the plaintiff exhaust his state remedies before bringing his federal action. It is the clear rule of this circuit that \u201cprisoners need not exhaust administrative remedies before bringing an action, under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Ricketts v. Lightcap, </em>567 F.2d 1226, 1230 (3d Cir. 1977). <em>See Wilwording v. Swenson, </em>404 U.S. 249, 251, 92 S.Ct. 407, 409, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (1971) (per curiam). Similarly, it has been held that plaintiffs need not exhaust state judicial remedies prior to filing their section 1983 action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Board of Regents v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Tomanio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 491, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980); <em>McNeese v. Board of Education, </em>373 U.S. 668, 672, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 1435, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1962); <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 482, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). We must therefore find that the district court erred when it dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Although it appears that appellant\u2019s complaint may state a proper cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, he may not have standing to bring this suit. Courts have held consistently that an inmate does not have standing to sue on behalf of his fellow prisoners. <em>See Fowler v. Graham, </em>478 F.Supp. 90 (D.C.S.C.1979); <em>United States ex rel. Ratchford v. Mazurkiewicz, </em>451 F.Supp. 671 (E.D.Pa.1978); <em>Tyler v. Ryan, </em>419 F.Supp. 905 (E.D.Mo.1976). Rather, the prisoner must allege a personal loss and seek to vindicate a deprivation of his own constitutional rights. <em>See generally Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) <em>(Jus tertii </em>rule); <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Appellant in this case was no longer imprisoned at the Tioga County jail at the time he brought his suit. He had been returned to the Dallas Penitentiary where he had been serving a term of imprisonment prior to his temporary transfer to the Tioga County jail. Moreover, he does not seek damages for deprivation of his rights while he was at the Tioga facility. <em>Compare Culp v. Martin, </em>471 F.2d 814 (5th Cir. 1973). Rather, he prays only for injunctive and declaratory relief to improve the conditions for those inmates still imprisoned at Tioga. While helping one\u2019s fellow citizen is an admirable goal, the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to review of \u201cactual cases or controversies\u201d in which the plaintiff has a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the litigation. U.S.Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; <em>United States Parole Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, </em>445 U.S. 388, 396-97, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 1208-09, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980); <em>O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 493-94, 94 S.Ct. 669, 674, 675, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). The case or controversy must be a continuing one and must be \u201clive\u201d at all stages of the proceedings. <em>Preiser v. Newkirk, </em>422 U.S. 395, 401, 95 S.Ct. 2330, 2334, 45 L.Ed.2d 272 (1975); <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 125, 93 S.Ct. 705, 713, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). Accordingly, the courts have held that a prisoner lacks standing to seek injunctive relief if he is no longer subject to the alleged conditions he attempts to challenge. <em>See Mawhinney v. Henderson, </em>542 F.2d 1, 2 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Culp, </em>471 F.2d at 815.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">Nonetheless, we will not dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint at this stage for lack of standing. While, as it stands, appell\u00e1nt\u2019s complaint may fall short of showing an actual case or controversy, he may be able to present facts to the district court which demonstrate appellant\u2019s requisite \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the suit. <em>Pro se </em>plaintiffs should be given an opportunity to amend their complaints unless it clearly appears that the deficiency cannot be overcome by amendment. <em>Gillespie v. Civiletti, </em>629 F.2d 637, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>640 (9th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On the record before us, we cannot say that appellant\u2019s efforts to amend his complaint would be futile. Therefore, we will reverse the lower court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions that appellant be permitted to amend his complaint to attempt to allege a proper basis for standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">We reverse and remand for proceedings in accordance with this judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 &amp; 2202 (1976); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\">. Appellant is currently serving a term of imprisonment at the State Correctional Institution Dallas in Dallas, Pennsylvania. There is no indication in the record that appellant has been confined to the Tioga County Prison more than once or will be reincarcerated in that facility in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-17\">. Although appellant was no longer subject to the unconstitutional conditions at the time he filed his complaint, he sought as his relief only a preliminary injunction and declaratory relief to remedy the conditions at the prison. He did not seek damages. He explicitly reserved however, his right to amend the complaint as needed. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint, <em>reprinted in </em>Appellant\u2019s Appendix at 6, 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. \u00a7 2201.

It should also be noted that the trial judge dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint as \u201cfrivolous, lacking in probable cause, and not taken in good faith.\u201d While we recognize that appellant\u2019s complaint contains many standard objections to the prison system, we agree with the fifth circuit that \u201ca judge cannot allow the personal view that the allegations of a pro se complaint are implausible to temper his duty to appraise suit pleadings liberally.\u201d <em>Slavin v. Curry, </em>574 F.2d 1256, 1260 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b98-14\">. The only exception to this rule is when a prisoner\u2019s section 1983 action challenges the \u201cfact or duration of his confinement.\u201d In such cases, the plaintiffs complaint is construed as one for petition for writ of habeas corpus; the petitioner is then required to exhaust his state remedies in accordance with the statute governing the writ. <em>See Preiser v.
