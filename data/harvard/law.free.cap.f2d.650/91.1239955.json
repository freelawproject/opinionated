For this conclusion the Court had unquestioned, unassailable, incontrovertible authority in <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Then came along <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), which overruled this holding of <em>Monroe. </em>With this development the unsuccessful plaintiffs seek under F.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) and (6) to revive, or more accurately, pursue a new or expanded claim against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that 60(b)(5) and (6) would afford this relief,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that this belated reversal of the prior judgment would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The fact is that up to the jury verdict, <em>Monroe </em>cut no significant figure in the <em>trial </em>of the case in the Trial Court. Neither by pleadings, evidence introduced or offered, theories of liability<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> advanced, or the Judge\u2019s submission to the jury, did the spectre of <em>Monroe </em>affect anything done or not done. Indeed, on a submission to the jury the jury returned a verdict in favor of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">Considering that, despite stringent findings by our opinion that \u201c[t]he barrage of gunfire far exceeded the response that was appropriate...,\u201d <em>Waller, </em>502 F.2d at 1271, that seven officers \u201cwere guilty of tortious conduct as a matter of law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1286, the firing was \u201cbeyond the physical limits of justifiable response,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1272, and the shootings were the result of \u201can excessive cumulated use of deadly force,\u201d <em>id., </em>we nevertheless held that the liability of each of the actors was a question for the jury whose verdict was in favor of all defendants and against the plaintiffs. Although not formally treated within that opinion, the opinion is convincing that the result<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would have been the same as to the verdict in favor of the City had not <em>Monroe </em>foreclosed the whole issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The denial of Rule 60(b)(5) and (6) was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>502 F.2d 1261 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 964, 95 S.Ct. 1356, 43 L.Ed.2d 442, <em>reh. denied, </em>421 U.S. 939, 95 S.Ct. 1668, 44 L.Ed.2d 95 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-12\">.

The theory in the Trial Court was essentially on Respondeat <em>Superior. </em>Now the appellants assert an extension of this approach on the theory, differently phrased, that by Lt. Magee, being in full operational command of the armed force the excessive or improvident firing of weapons by anyone, whether a member MHP, National Guard, or City Police, may be attributable to his employer, the City of Jackson. If this constitutes a new theory, the opportunity to assert it was fully open on the original trial and the change from <em>Monroe </em>to <em>Monell, </em>neither affected opportunity or gives any right because of this change to now assert'it,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b164-18\">. The theory now advanced is that with an overall institutional responsibility for all members of the armed group concentrating liability in the City, the problems of causation as to individual officers would be eliminated. Certainly, <em>Monroe </em>did not keep plaintiffs from asserting or trying to prove the facts to sustain this theory. Release by <em>Monell </em>from <em>Monroe </em>should not afford a basis for affording a second chance to expand either theory or opportunity for proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
