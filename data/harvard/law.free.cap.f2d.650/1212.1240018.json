id=\"b1280-8\">Confusion is generated when related but distinct statutory provisions are treated as interchangeable. Section 132 prohibits the introduction of new matter into the disclosure of an application. Section 112, first paragraph, requires that claim language be supported in the specification. This court, having said th\u00e1t a rejection of an amended claim under \u00a7 132 is equivalent to a rejection under \u00a7 112, first paragraph, for lack of support, appears to have contributed to the treatment of those separate statutory sections as interchangeable. <em>See In re Hogan, </em>559 F.2d 595, 608, 194 USPQ 527, 539 (CCPA 1977), <em>In re Wertheim, </em>541 F.2d 257, 265, 191 USPQ 90, 99 (CCPA 1976), <em>In re Bowen, </em>492 F.2d 859, 864, 181 USPQ 48, 52 (CCPA 1974), <em>In re Smythe, </em>480 F.2d 1376, 1385, 178 USPQ 279, 286 (CCPA 1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">Apparently reluctant to reverse on the sole ground that an improper statutory provision had been employed, and recognizing the burden on the parties inherent in a return of the case for application of \u00a7 112, this court has reviewed \u00a7 132 claim rejections on the basis of whether the rejected claim found support in the original disclosure. <em>See In re Eickmeyer, </em>602 F.2d 974, 981, 202 USPQ 655, 662 (CCPA 1979); <em>In re Barker, </em>559 F.2d 588, 593-94, 194 USPQ 470, 474 (CCPA 1977); <em>In re Winkhous, </em>527 F.2d 637, 640, 188 USPQ 129, 131 (CCPA 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-17\">Similarly, new matter rejections of claims under \u00a7 251 have been reviewed on the basis of a \u00a7 112 analysis, that is, on whether a claim found support in an original patent. <em>See In re East, </em>495 F.2d 1361, 1366, 181 USPQ 716, 719 (CCPA 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-18\">As is illustrated in the present case, employment of \u00a7\u00a7 132 and 112 as interchangeable leads to confusion of two distinct concepts: (1) the adding of new matter to the disclosure; and (2) the broadening of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-19\">Broadening a claim does not add new matter to the disclosure. Disclosure is that which is taught, not that which is claimed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An applicant is entitled to claims as broad as the prior art and his disclosure will allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-20\">The proper basis for rejection of a claim amended to recite elements thought to be without support in the original disclosure, therefore, is \u00a7 112, first paragraph, not \u00a7 132. The latter section prohibits addition of new matter to the original disclosure. It is properly employed as a basis for objection to amendments to the abstract, specifications, or drawings attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>add new disclosure to that originally presented. Past opinions of this court, in cases in which a \u00a7 132 claim rejection was reviewed on a \u00a7 112 analysis, should not in future be viewed as having approved the employment of \u00a7 132 as a basis for claim rejection. The amended claims involved in those cases should have been rejected under \u00a7 112, first paragraph. The claim rejections in those cases could then have been explicitly affirmed or reversed on direct applications of \u00a7 112, rather than on \u00a7 112 analyses applied to \u00a7 132 rejections.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, such cases are overruled insofar as they approved rejection of claims under \u00a7 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">Turning to the merits of this appeal, we will again treat a \u00a7 132 claim rejection before us as though it had been made under \u00a7 112, first paragraph. We proceed to decide the case on that basis in the interest of judicial economy. Were we to merely reverse the rejection as having been made under an inappropriate statutory provision, and say no more, the PTO would presumably enter a rejection under \u00a7 112 and that decision would then be appealable to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">Amended claim 6 recites the adhering step as \u201cadheringly applying\u201d one layer of tube to an adjacent earlier layer. Rasmussen\u2019s specification describes that step as follows: \u201c[AJdhesive is applied to the tubular foil 4 in a narrow or broader strip, possibly in two narrow strips. Accordingly, the face of the tubular foil successively sticks to the winding lying on the drums.\u201d The language of the specification thus describes one method of \u201cadheringly applying\u201d one layer to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">As above indicated, that a claim may be broader than the specific embodiment disclosed in a specification is in itself of no moment. Indeed, the statutory provision for broadened claims in reissue applications is intended to meet precisely the situation in which a patentee has claimed \u201cless\u201d than he had a right to claim. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">In <em>In re Smythe, </em>480 F.2d 1376, 1384, 178 USPQ 279, 285 (CCPA 1973), this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-12\">A hypothetical situation may make our point clear. If the original specification of a patent application on the scales of justice disclosed only a 1-pound <em>\u201clead </em>weight\u201d as a counterbalance to determine the weight of a pound of flesh, we do not believe the applicant should be prevented, by the so-called \u201cdescription requirement\u201d of the first paragraph of \u00a7 112, or the prohibition against new matter of \u00a7 132, from later claiming the counterbalance as a \u201cmetal weight\u201d or simply as a 1-pound \u201cweight,\u201d although both \u201cmetal weight\u201d and \u201cweight\u201d would indeed be progressively broader than \u201clead weight,\u201d including even such an undisclosed, but obviously art-recognized equivalent, \u201cweight\u201d as a pound of feathers. The broader claim language would be permitted because the <em>description of the use and function </em>of the lead weight as a scale counterbalance in the <em>whole disclosure </em>would immediately convey to any person skilled in the scale art the knowledge that the applicant invented a scale with a 1-pound counterbalance weight, regardless of its composition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-13\">Similarly, one skilled in the art who read Rasmussen\u2019s specification would understand that it is unimportant <em>how </em>the layers are adhered, so long as they are adhered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus the phrase \u201cadheringly applying\u201d is supported by the example found in the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-14\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-15\">The phrase \u201cadheringly applying\u201d being supported in the specification, rejection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>that claim under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132, first paragraph, is <em>reversed. </em>Rejection under the appropriate statutory provision, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, would have been inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">\n<em>REVERSED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">NIES, Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1279-14\">.
