He is 5'8\" tall and weighs 190 pounds. After holding jobs as a farm laborer, an employee of a steel foundry and an assembler in a factory, he secured a job in the construction industry, first as a common laborer and then a cement finisher for his last employer, which job he held for 19 years. In 1971, as a result of an injury on the job, he was operated on for two herniated discs resulting in the removal of a \u201cherniated nucleus pulposus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-21\">Plaintiff thereafter returned to work, continuing in his prior employment up to November 1974 when, according to him, back pain forced him to quit work. He now complains of pain in the lower back and legs, of tension, irritability and inability to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-22\">Under questioning by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who heard this case for the Secretary, plaintiff testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-23\">Q Do you have pain in your legs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-24\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-25\">Well, it stays numb and then the pain shoots up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-27\">Q Both legs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>A The right one is the main one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">Q You are using a cane today. How long have you used a cane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">A Well, I have been using a cane for around two years. I just got me a new one. I had an old thing but it didn\u2019t have no rubber or nothing on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">Q You have surgery on your back, haven\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">Q When did you have surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">A Well, about roughly a month after I was hurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">Q Have you had it just one time, back surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">A That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">Q It didn\u2019t help any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-14\">A Yes, it helped some. I was completely paralyzed at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\">Q Before the surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-17\">Q You couldn\u2019t walk at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-18\">A I could hardly walk at all. I did walk, you know, but I was in misery which it helped some at the time but I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just gotten worse and worse afterwards. It got better for a while and then it got worse. It started easing up and then it got worse and worse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-19\">Q So your condition now is about like you described it here for me, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-20\">A Right. I am just about in the same shape I was in when to be operated on the first time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-21\">Q You have been operated on only once, haven\u2019t you? Have many times have you had surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-22\">A Once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-23\">Q What do you mean the first time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-24\">A The first time I was operated on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-25\">Q What problem do you have in walking and standing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-26\">A I draw and ache. My leg gives away. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to stand up on it or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-27\">Q You say you have fallen twice. When was that, do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-28\">A Here about three or four months ago, I got out of the car and my picket fence is next to me my leg, I started to make a step and over I went. I fell in the fence. I got up out of bed and fell over against the wall when I started making a step.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-30\">Q How much walking can you do or standing before this happens; your legs start to aching and drawing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-31\">A Oh, I\u2019m just in pain all the time. Pain all the time, drawing, aching. I ain\u2019t had no relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-32\">Q Do you have any problems with bending and kneeling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-33\">A Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-34\">Q What happens to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-35\">A Every bone in me cracks, aches and I feel like I am tearing in two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-36\">Q Does it bother you to sit for a long time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-37\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-38\">Q What does it do to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-39\">A I feel like, I don\u2019t know, you punched with a knife around my back and pain comes around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-40\">Q Back pain then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-41\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-42\">Q Any problems with your hands or griping?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-43\">A I ain\u2019t got nearly the grip I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-44\">Q Is it strength or something else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-45\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-46\">Q You don\u2019t have any pain in your arms do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-47\">A Once in a while this one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-48\">Q Occasional pain in the right arm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-49\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-50\">Q What kind of medication do you take?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-51\">A I have some prescriptions here. I don\u2019t know I can\u2019t read one from another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-52\">Q This was prescribed, oh, this is not a prescription. It\u2019s a list of things you are taking, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-53\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-54\">Q You see Dr. Swanski (PHONETIC) and Dr. Kackly (PHONETIC) both do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-55\">A Well, I, no Dr. Kackly is the one I started going to Kackly. I changed to go to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Q Well, on this it says Dr. Swanski and then it says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">A That\u2019s when I was taking that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">Q Oh, you were taking that prescribed by him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">Q What you are taking now is these three from Dr. Kackly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">A Yes, he wanted to change me on my medications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">Q Dr. Swanski was giving you Soma and Perkidin (PHONETIC) for pain, Dalmane 30 for sleep and Albunthe (PHONETIC) for nerves. You are now taking from Dr. Kackly Fiorinal caps, Soma and Nembutal. Is that right, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">Q Do you have any side effects from that medication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">A Pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-13\">Q Do you know what a side effect is? Does the medication make you sick in any way or affect you, make you sleepy or drowsy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-14\">A It makes you sleepy and drowsy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-15\">Q Is Dr. Kackly your only treating physician now? '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">We recognize, of course, that the claimant\u2019s testimony about pain is not conclusive evidence of disability, but it is certainly admissible in relation to this claim. Further, plaintiff\u2019s complaints of pain are not contradicted and the examining physicians\u2019 reports of record show \u201can underlying medical basis\u201d for this pain. <em>See Hephner v. Mathews, </em>574 F.2d 359, 361 (6th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">The report of Dr. D. D. Kackly, plaintiff\u2019s treating orthopedic physician, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-19\">I examined Mr. Stamper in the office on December 15,1977. He continues to complain of disabling low back and lower extremity symptoms and has not been able to carry out any significant or regular work activity since shortly after his injury in 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-20\">Patient is markedly restricted in all activity at home. He is required to spend a considerable amount of time in bed because of persistent back and right lower extremity symptoms. He does experience intermittent loss of control of the right leg and has fallen on numerous occasions because of this. He also has considerable difficulty resting more than a few hours at a time and has marked pain and stiffness when arising in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-22\">On examination there is generalized tightness and loss of flexibility of the lumbar spine. I can demonstrate no marked neurological deficit other than some generalized sensory impairment over the right thigh and lower leg area and some suggestive weakness of the great toe extensor on the right side. His x-rays show rather marked degenerative involvement of the entire lumbar area as well as laminectomy at the L5 level on the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-23\">I feel this patient represents a fairly typical picture of chronic low back decompensation secondary to progressive spinal stenosis. Some of these changes are the result of progressive degenerative involvement throughout the lumbar area with aggravation as the result of injury and some of these changes may be a part of the postoperative changes frequently seen in this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-24\">At the present time <em>this patient is not capable of any significant sustained activity </em>that would permit him to be considered for any type of work. On this basis I would feel <em>he must be considered as permanently and totally disabled at this time.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-25\">(Emphasis added.) In addition, Dr. Robert R. Kessler, who examined plaintiff on January 30, 1975 at the request of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-26\">The prognosis for the future is poor.... Because of the findings, it is evident that [plaintiff] would be unable to engage in any type of sustained remunerative industrial activity. Because of this, I feel that <em>he is permanently and totally disabled.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-27\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-28\">Dr. R. J. Hansell (who examined plaintiff in 1973, apparently at the request of Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation authorities) concluded that plaintiff suffered \u201cpermanent partial disability of 30%.\u201d Dr. Edward Butler, who examined plaintiff on July 8, 1976-at the request of the Ohio Bureau of Disability Determination, opined that plaintiff \u201cshould be capable of light work\u201d despite his back problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The ALJ and the District Judge appear to agree that plaintiff is disabled from performing his previous occupation as a cement finisher. Both found no psychiatric disability and each relied primarily upon the testimony of a vocational expert in denying benefits. In response to a long hypothetical question stated by the ALJ, the vocational expert gave his opinion that plaintiff could not do any of his former work but gave examples of sedentary types of work that he could perform: \u201ccam press operator, a bellow molder, a fuse tipper, bellow cutter, bellow repair person.... In the glove industry, there would be sedentary work primarily as a sorter, a packager, a pair label-er.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In <em>Allen v. Califano, </em>613 F.2d 139, 145 (6th Cir. 1980), this court pointed out four legal propositions to be applied in social security disability benefits cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">1. The burden of proof in a claim for Social Security benefits is upon the claimant to show disability which prevents her from performing any substantial gainful employment for the statutory period. Once, however, a prima facie case that claimant cannot perform her usual work is made, the burden shifts to the Secretary to show that there is work in the national economy which she can perform. <em>Hephner v. Mathews, </em>574 F.2d 359, 361 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Garrett v. Finch, </em>436 F.2d 15, 18 (6th Cir. 1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">2. Convincing proof, consisting of lay testimony supported by clinical studies and medical evidence, that pain occasions a claimant\u2019s inability to perform his or her usual work is sufficient to make a prima facie case. <em>Beavers v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>577 F.2d 383 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Noe v. Weinberger, </em>512 F.2d 588 (6th Cir. 1975).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">3. In determining the question of substantiality of evidence, the reports of physicians who have treated a patient over a period of time or who are consulted for purposes of treatment are given greater weight than are reports of physicians employed and paid by the government for the purpose of defending against a disability claim. <em>Whitson v. Finch, </em>437 F.2d 728, 732 (6th Cir. 1971); <em>see also Giddings v. Richardson, </em>480 F.2d 652 (6th Cir. 1973).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">4. Substantiality of the evidence must be based upon the record taken as a whole. <em>Futernick v. Richardson, </em>484 F.2d 647 (6th Cir. 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Employing these same standards in reviewing the record before us, we agree that plaintiff Stamper is clearly disabled from his previous employment as a cement finisher as a result of the back injury and its sequelae. In this posture of the case, the burden falls upon the Secretary to show that there is work in the national economy which plaintiff can perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">We observe that plaintiff\u2019s treating physician (and one other) found him totally and permanently disabled,, while a physician who examined plaintiff solely at the request of state governmental authorities reported that he \u201cshould be capable of light work.\u201d We also note that a treating physician\u2019s opinion \u201cis entitled to weight substantially greater than that of a doctor who has seen the claimant only once.\u201d <em>Hephner v. Mathews, supra, </em>at 362, <em>citing Allen v. Weinberger, </em>552 F.2d 781, 786 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>Oppenheim </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>495 F.2d 396, 398 (4th Cir. 1974). <em>See also Allen v. Califano, supra, </em>at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">We believe that the Secretary failed to afford the opinion of plaintiff\u2019s treating physician the substantial weight to which it is entitled. Moreover, we hold that the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, upon which the ALJ, the HEW Appeals Council, and the District Court primarily relied, does not in the context of this case constitute sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>stantial evidence to support the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The vocational expert testified that there were light assembly jobs available in the national economy which plaintiff\u2019s post-injury residual strength was adequate to perform. We take judicial notice that 19 years of heavy work in the construction industry does not prepare a person to perform light assembly work. The AU and vocational expert utterly ignored the fact that the basic human tools required for light assembly work are flexible fingers, speed in performance, and the ability to learn the jobs. We assume that no ALJ or vocational expert would suggest that plaintiff had residual capacity for substantial gainful employment as a pianist because he retained the physical capacity to sit for two hours at a concert piano bench and strike some keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Such omissions in the record would require remand for rehearing, absent the Secretary\u2019s implied concession that plaintiff is disabled as far as his previous employment is concerned, thus placing the burden on the Secretary to prove that plaintiff retains the capacity for substantial gainful employment. The Secretary has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The judgment of the District Court is vacated. The case is remanded to the District Court for remand to the Secretary for granting of benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
