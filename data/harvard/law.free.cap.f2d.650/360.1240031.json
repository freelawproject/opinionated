The Veterans\u2019 Administration (VA) guaranteed the loan under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1810-1819 and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 36.4300-36.-4364. Appellants defaulted on the loan in 1974. In early February 1975 the VA decided not to include them in a special refunding program.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-26\">The Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings on March 24, 1975, by having a sheriff serve appellants personally with notice of foreclosure. Under Me.Rev.Stat. tit. XIV, \u00a7 6203(2), this notice starts a one-year \u201credemption\u201d period running, at the end of which a mortgagor loses his interest in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>property if he has not arranged for refinancing or paid the full amount due. About six weeks later, the Bank assigned its interest in the property to the VA in return for the VA\u2019s payment to it of the amount due on the mortgage. , <em>(See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1816, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.4320(b)). The VA then informed appellants about how they could redeem their property, but after more time passed and appellants apparently refused reasonable offers to buy the property, the VA notified appellants that their \u201credemption\u201d period had expired and title to the property vested in the VA. About three months later, the VA sold appellants\u2019 property at a price that realized the VA a profit of $15,277.66 over and above its payment of appellants\u2019 mortgage debt and other relevant expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Appellants brought this suit seeking a declaration that the Maine foreclosure statute violates their constitutional right to due process, attacking various of the VA\u2019s actions as unconstitutional or outside of its statutory authority and seeking a return of the property, or, at least, of the $15,277.66 \u201cprofit\u201d that the VA realized. The district court rejected all appellants\u2019 claims. 498 F.Supp. 341 (D.Me.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The issues that appellants raise here were explored by the district court in depth and discussed at length in its opinion. Except as discussed below, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on the basis of that opinion. On the due process claim, we need not pass upon the court\u2019s discussion of state action for, as the court pointed out, the Maine foreclosure statute provides mortgagors with \u201cdue process\u201d in any event. It does not allow a mortgagee to seize a mortgagor\u2019s property, <em>cf. Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), but rather begins the running of a one-year redemption period during which time the mortgagor can obtain a judicial determination of any relevant issues in dispute. <em>See </em>Me.Rev.Stat. tit. XIV, \u00a7\u00a7 6301 <em>et </em>seq.; <em>Gosselin v. Better Homes, </em>256 A.2d 629 (Me.1969). Indeed, the Maine courts can toll the running of the redemption period while the judicial hearing takes place. <em>See Gosselin v. Better Homes, supra. </em>The essential requirements of notice and hearing prior to a significant deprivation of property are met. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The main point upon which we differ with the district court concerns the approximately $15,000 surplus, which the VA realized from the sale of appellants\u2019 property three months after foreclosure took effect in 1976. Contrary to the district court, we believe that the VA\u2019s authorizing statutes do not allow the retention of this money and that it must be returned to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Certainly, as a matter of equity it would seem unjust for a creditor to retain more from the sale of a security than the value of the underlying debt (plus relevant expenses). For this reason common law courts, and nearly all states, have recognized that surpluses that arise out of foreclosure sales must ordinarily be returned to the debtor, 3 R. Powell, <em>The Law of Real Property, </em>\u00a7 467 (1979); 4 American Law of Property \u00a7 16.10 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952); 55 Am.Jur.2d <em>Mortgages </em>\u00a7 930 (1971), and when foreclosure takes place through a court proceeding, the court ordinarily returns any surplus over and above the claims against the property to the debtor. 55 Am. Jur.2d <em>Mortgages </em>\u00a7 930 (1971); 59 CJS <em>Mortgages </em>\u00a7 799 (1955). The debtor\u2019s right to the surplus is an equitable right somewhat analogous to the creditor\u2019s legal right to proceed against the debtor for any deficiency in value \u2014 again, a right recognized in virtually every state. 3 R. Powell, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 467; 4 American Law of Property \u00a7 16.200; 55 Am.Jur.2d, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 905. Thus, had the bank chosen to foreclose upon appellants\u2019 property through (1) a <em>judicial action, </em>or (2) a <em>foreclosure sale, </em>the surplus under Maine law, would belong to the debtor. The VA would have had no right to the surplus, for the VA obtained only the Bank\u2019s interest under the second sentence of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1816, which provides that (upon payment by the VA to the Bank of the outstanding debt) the VA shall \u201creceive an assignment of the loan and security . . . \u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The Bank could not assign to the VA what it did not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The government argues, however, that this is a special case because the Bank (and then the VA) followed (3) the unusual Maine <em>\u201cstrict foreclosure\u201d </em>procedure, under which notice and the passage of one year automatically pass title to the entire property, eradicating not only the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption, but also any right to a surplus of value. The government claims that the Bank passed this interest to the VA, and therefore appellants have no right to the surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We note initially that we do not necessarily accept the government\u2019s interpretation of Maine law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is indeed true that dicta in <em>Pierce v. Northeast Bank of Westbrook, </em>381 A.2d 667 (Me.1978) state that the mortgagee\u2019s interest in the property includes a right to surplus value. The facts of that case, however, show that at least some mortgagee banks return that surplus to the mortgagor and the case also shows that the Maine courts readily find waivers of any such right of retention. It is just conceivable that a court \u2014 looking hard for evidence of a waiver \u2014 could find one here in the Bank\u2019s transfer of its interest to the VA in return for payment of the loan obligation for, had the Bank wished to retain the surplus in the property\u2019s value, it would presumably have refused the VA\u2019s offer of payment, kept the property, and resold it at a later time. Moreover, Maine enacted a new statutory provision in 1975, Me.Rev. Stat. tit. XIV, \u00a7 6204-A, which the parties concede' provides the mortgagor with any surplus of value over debt. That provision may well have applied to this foreclosure, which was not complete until after the statute became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We need not decide this issue of Maine law, however, because we believe that, as a matter of federal law, the VA must return the surplus. The relevant statute, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1816, allows the VA to obtain an \u201cassignment of the loan and security\u201d, but it does not specifically state how the VA is to treat the security that it receives. Faced with this statutory silence, the Supreme Court has made clear that the VA can promulgate reasonable regulations which, for example, allow the VA to collect from the debtor any deficiency in the value of the security, and which override any state law to the contrary. <em>United States v. Shimer, </em>367 U.S. 374, 377-86, 81 S.Ct. 1554, 1557-1562, 6 L.Ed.2d 908 (1961); <em>see also United States v. Wells, </em>403 F.2d 596, 597-98 (5th Cir. 1968). And, those regulations are to be interpreted in light of traditional property law practices. <em>McKnight v. United States, </em>259 F.2d 540, 545 (9th Cir. 1958); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>155 F.Supp. 52, 56 (M.D.Ga.1957). Moreover, the loan guarantee act evinces an intent to treat veteran mortgagors favorably, not harshly. Indeed, the very next sentence in \u00a7 1816(a) begins by stating \u201c[njothing in this section shall preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the veteran .... \u201d Thus, statutory authorization to' \u201creceive ... security\u201d implies an obligation to treat that security in accordance with ordinary property law principles \u2014 at least where those principles would prevent inequitably harsh treatment of veteran mortgagors and where the VA has not seen fit to publish regulations to the contrary. In this instance, since the statute <em>expressly </em>commands neither the holding of the surplus nor the return of the surplus and the VA has promulgated no rule,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one can infer an intent that ordinary property law principles apply \u2014 which favor the debt- or \u2014 and that the VA must therefore return the surplus to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Neither <em>McKnight </em>nor <em>Jones </em>holds to the contrary. Both of those cases involved VA suits for deficiency judgments. Those courts held that the ordinary state law rule \u2014 that a foreclosure sale determines the amount owed by the deficiency debtor (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the amount owed by the guarantor to the mortgagee) \u2014 applies to VA foreclosure sales as well. They went on to hold that <em>subsequent </em>sales, after the foreclosure sale, could not affect the amount of the deficiency. The reasoning of those courts suggests, if anything, that the rights of all parties are ordinarily determined as of the time of foreclosure and that, <em>mutatis mutandis, </em>appellants would have a right to the surplus of the value of their property less the relevant debt as of the date foreclosure took effect in March 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Section 1824(c) of Title 38 does not require a contrary holding. That provision, which states that \u201cthe proceeds from . .. the sale of property disposed of\u201d shall be \u201cdeposited in the [Loan Guaranty Revolving] Fund\u201d, surely means \u201cproceeds\u201d to which the VA is entitled, excluding expenses and other legitimate claims against the property and its proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Of course, strictly speaking, the surplus to which the appellant is entitled is the value of the property less relevant VA payments and expenses <em>as of the date of foreclosure. </em>As <em>McKnight </em>holds, subsequent sales after foreclosure are irrelevant. 259 F.2d at 544. (In <em>McKnight </em>foreclosure took place through sale.) Thus, appellants are entitled to a surplus determined on the basis of March 1976 values. In this instance, however, the subsequent sale took place so soon thereafter it can be taken as setting the relevant values as of three months earlier. None of the parties claims that there was any sudden rise in the property\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We therefore hold that appellants are entitled to the $15,277.66 surplus,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with interest to run from August 4, 1980. The judgment of the district' court is vacated to the extent that it is inconsistent with the foregoing, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\n<em>So ordered. No costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">. Not surprisingly, Maine case law on the subject is sparse, for a mortgagor with a property the value of which exceeds the debt could ordinarily find refinancing or would sell the. property and pay off the debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\">. Absent congressional intent to the contrary, the VA remains free to promulgate such a rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\">. The VA realized an additional $2,733.69 from the transaction, but, apparently, as a result of reselling the $50,000 note that it received when it sold the real property. <em>Fitzgerald v. Cleland, </em>498 F.Supp. at 345. The record shows no connection between this $2,733.69 and the underlying value of the real property; hence we see no obligation on the VA\u2019s part to give up those funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
