West, United States District Judge of the Western District of Oklahoma, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1241-17\">McWILLIAMS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1241-18\">The only issue on appeal is whether the Tax Court erred in holding that a corporation, after electing to liquidate under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) \u00a7 337 (1954), is entitled to recognize a loss because it accepts less than face value as the sale price for its trade accounts and notes receivable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the Tax Court did not err in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-19\">The essential facts are not in dispute and were stipulated to in the Tax Court. They are fully set forth in the Tax Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and will not be repeated here. <em>See Liberty National Bank and Trust Co. v. Commissioner, </em>38 T.C.M. (CCH) 314 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-20\">I.R.C. \u00a7 336 states the general rule that, except as provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 453(d) relating to the disposition of installment obligations, no gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation on the distribution of property in partial or complete liquidation. I.R.C. \u00a7 337(a) provides that no gain or loss is recognized to a corporation from the sale or exchange of \u201cproperty\u201d within a twelvemonth period beginning with the adoption of a plan of complete liquidation, if the corporation distributes all of its assets, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>counting those retained to meet claims, during the twelve-month period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">The term \u201cproperty\u201d is not defined in section 337. However, section 337(b)(1) <em>excludes </em>certain items from the nonrecognition provision of 337(a). Section 337(b)(1) states that, for the purposes of 337(a), the term \u201cproperty\u201d does <em>not </em>include the following: (1) the stock in trade of the corporation held primarily for sale to customers; (2) installment obligations acquired in the sale of stock in trade, regardless of whether the sale was before or after the adoption of a plan of liquidation; and (3) installment obligations acquired in the sale of all classes of property other than stock in trade where such sale was made prior to the adoption of a plan of liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">In the instant case, after adopting its liquidation plan, the taxpayer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sold its accounts receivable for $50,000 less than their face or book value. These accounts were generated from the sale of the taxpayer\u2019s stock in trade to customers in the ordinary course of its business. The accounts originated prior to taxpayer\u2019s adoption of its plan of liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">The Commissioner does not dispute the fact that the taxpayer realized a loss of $50,000 in the sale of its trade accounts and notes receivable. The Commissioner contends, however, that the loss is not recognizable under the provisions of section 337(a), which, as indicated, provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized from the sale or exchange of property by a corporation in the process of complete liquidation. The taxpayer contends that the loss realized must be recognized notwithstanding the provisions of section 337(a), since accounts receivable are a type of installment obligation, which, under section 337(b)(1)(B), are specifically excluded from the nonrecognition provision of section 337(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">As earlier mentioned, the Tax Court held that the loss was recognizable since, under section 337(b)(1)(B), installment obligations acquired in the sale of stock in trade do not constitute \u201cproperty\u201d as that term is used in the nonrecognition provision of section 337(a). Specifically, the Tax Court found that the \u201csale of accounts receivable qualifies for recognition under the exception in section 337(b)(1)(B) as an installment obligation.\u201d 38 T.C.M. at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-15\">We agree with the result reached by the Tax Court. Since we are in general accord with the Tax Court\u2019s rationale, such will not be repeated in any detail here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-16\">In this Court the Commissioner\u2019s main argument is that the term \u201cinstallment obligation\u201d is a term of art, and is limited to obligations received in connection with sales made on the installment plan, /. e., periodic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>payments spread out over a period of time, <em>and </em>reported in the manner permitted by section 453. The taxpayer in the instant case did not report its non-cash sales in the manner permitted by section 453, and, from this fact, the Commissioner argues that taxpayer\u2019s trade accounts and notes receivable cannot therefore be deemed to be \u201cinstallment obligations\u201d under section 337(b)(1)(B). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">The term \u201cinstallment obligation\u201d is not defined in the Code. Section 453 merely prescribes a method by which a taxpayer \u201cwho regularly sells or otherwise disposes of property on the installment plan\u201d <em>may </em>report such income. The wording of section 453 suggests that there may be income from installment obligations which will <em>not </em>be reported in the manner permitted by that section. Hence, the fact that a taxpayer elects not to use the method of reporting permitted by section 453 does not necessarily mean that obligations in the form of trade accounts and notes receivable are not \u201cinstallment obligations\u201d as that term is used in section 337(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Our disposition of the present matter finds support in <em>Coast Coil Co. v. Commissioner, </em>50 T.C. 528 (1968), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>422 F.2d 402 (9th Cir. 1970), and <em>Family Record Plan, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>36 T.C. 305 (1961), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>309 F.2d 208 (9th Cir. 1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>373 U.S. 910, 83 S.Ct. 1297, 10 L.Ed.2d 411 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">In <em>Coast Coil, </em>the Tax Court rejected the argument made here by the Commissioner that \u201cinstallment obligations,\u201d as that term is used in section 337(b)(1)(B), means only those obligations resulting from the sale of property which the seller has elected to report under the installment method provided in section 453. In so holding, the Tax Court- was of the view that the intent of section 337(b)(1)(B) \u201cis much broader than the ground covered by section 453 . .. and is designed to embrace accounts receivable arising under the sale of stock in trade by an accrual basis corporation as well.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Tax Court noted that,- as is true in'the instant case, the taxpayer had previously reported and paid income taxes on its sales and then suffered a loss when it sold those accounts. 50 T.C. at 533-34. As indicated, on appeal <em>Coast Coil </em>was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit in a 2-1 decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">In <em>Family Record, </em>there was a gain, not a loss, realized in the sale of accounts receivable, and in that situation the Commissioner\u2019s position was that the gain was taxable, and did not come within the nonrecognition provision of section 337(a). In other words, it was the taxpayer in <em>Family Record </em>who advanced the argument made here by the Commissioner that failure to report under section 453 precludes a finding that the obligations were \u201cinstallment obligations\u201d under section 337(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Family Record, </em>the Tax Court rejected the taxpayer\u2019s argument and upheld the Commissioner\u2019s position that gain realized on the sale of the accounts receivable <em>was </em>taxable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">On appeal in <em>Family Record, </em>the Ninth Circuit affirmed, using an anticipatory assignment of income theory. In thus hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>ing, however, the Ninth Circuit did not disapprove of the reasoning of the Tax Court. And, of course, in <em>Coast Coil, </em>the Ninth Circuit approved of the Tax Court\u2019s holding that accounts receivable are included within the broader term \u201cinstallment obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1241-13\">. There were two issues in the Tax Court. The issue of whether the taxpayer may deduct a loss as a result of a settlement of a lawsuit involving a sale of trade accounts and notes receivable is not before this Court on appeal. The Tax Court also decided that issue in favor of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-14\">We note at the outset that section 337 was passed in response to two Supreme Court decisions, <em>Commissioner v. Court Holding Co., </em>324 U.S. 331, 65 S.Ct. 707, 89 L.Ed. 981 (1945), and <em>United States v. Cumberland Public Service Co., </em>338 U.S. 451, 70 S.Ct. 280, 94 L.Ed. 251 (1950), cases in which the Court appeared to adopt conflicting rules. There is a good exploration of the history of section 337, including a discussion of the holdings in these two cases, in <em>Central Tablet Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 673, 677-83, 94 S.Ct. 2516, 2519-22, 41 L.Ed.2d 398 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">. I.R.C. \u00a7 337 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">\u00a7 337.

The taxpayer, Liberty Bank and Trust Co., a national banking association with its principal place of business in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is the liquidating trustee pursuant to a 1974 liquidating trust agreement between Liberty and Oharco Liquidating Co. (Oharco). An Oklahoma company headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oharco is the successor to Oklahoma Hardware Co., v/hich was incorporated in 1900 and was in the wholesale hardware business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">. Section 453 appears not to be definitional in nature. Rather, it merely describes one permitted method of accounting or reporting income. While some sections of the I.R.C. refer to section 453, the statute which is at issue, <em>i. </em>e., section 337, does not contain such a reference. This appears to be an indication that the term \u201cinstallment obligations\u201d in section 337(b)(1)(B) should not be limited by the terms of section 453.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">. The Commissioner recognizes that the opinion in <em>Coast Coil </em>is contrary to the result for which he argues. He cites the dissenting opinion in <em>Coast Coil, </em>apparently urging this Court to adopt the position of the dissent. We decline to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">. The Commissioner recognizes that his position here is exactly the opposite of his position in <em>Family Record. </em>He states, however, that this policy change was made subsequent to <em>Family Record, </em>decided by the Tax Court in 1961, and was his position in <em>Coast Coil, </em>decided in 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1243-16\">. A similar argument was made and rejected in <em>Commissioner v.
