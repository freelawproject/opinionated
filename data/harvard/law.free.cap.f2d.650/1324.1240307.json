RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1391-29\">Among the attractions offered visitors to the State Fair of Texas is the opportunity to take a trip on the \u201cSwiss Skyride.\u201d Skyride passengers travel in open gondolas, moving along a single cable, over the fairgrounds and enjoy a panoramic prospect. The Skyride is owned by the State Fair, but operated by Steck &amp; Stapf Attractions, a lessee. Manufactured in Switzerland by Van Roll, Ltd., the attraction has been bought by several amusement parks around the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-30\">Two recent Skyride accidents, one occurring at the State Fair, prompted the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>States Consumer Product Safety Commission to obtain an administrative search warrant authorizing an on-site inspection of the Skyride and an examination of relevant documents in the possession of the State Fair and Steck &amp; Stapf. The State Fair and Steck &amp; Stapf sued to prevent the Commission from conducting its investigation. Concluding that the Skyride is a \u201cconsumer product\u201d within the meaning of the Consumer Product Safety Act, we uphold the Commission\u2019s authority to conduct the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">The accident at the State Fair occurred on October 21, 1979. Four gondolas collided, falling to the ground and killing one passenger. A similar accident at a Missouri amusement park had caused three fatalities and led to an investigation of this type of ride by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. As part of its investigation, the Commission served the State Fair with a notice of inspection [see 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1118.2 (1980)] seeking access to the Skyride and to relevant records. The State Fair and Steck &amp; Stapf allowed a Commission engineer to view the ride from a distance, but would not allow him to inspect it more closely or to examine the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">To prevent further action by the Commission, the State Fair and Steck &amp; Stapf filed separate suits, later consolidated, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Skyride is not a \u201cconsumer product\u201d and, therefore, beyond the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. They also sought an injunction against further Commission attempts to inspect the ride. Finding no irreparable injury was threatened until the Commission obtained a search warrant enabling it to disregard the plaintiffs\u2019 refusal to cooperate, the district court held that the controversy was not yet ripe for judicial decision. The court retained jurisdiction, anticipating the search warrant that was later issued by a federal magistrate. When they again refused to permit inspection, the Commission sought an order to show cause why it should not be permitted to conduct the inspection as the warrant authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">The district court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s denial of the injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs. In all other respects, however, plaintiffs were granted the relief sought. The district court affirmed the denial of the Commission\u2019s motion for an order to show cause, granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to quash the warrant, and entered a declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs\u2019 victory was nonetheless partial. The court held that the Skyride is a consumer product under the Act and granted plaintiffs relief only because the Commission had not presented sufficient facts establishing authority to enter the premises. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u25a0\u00a7 2065(a). The Commission could thus continue its investigation, although at a distance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">Neither side is content with this decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> State Fair and Steck &amp; Stapf challenge the characterization of the Skyride as a consumer product, while the Commission argues that it has authority to inspect the premises and records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">To justify issuance of an administrative search warrant, the Commission must make some showing that it has statutory authority to conduct the investigation. Relying on <em>Marshall v. Barlow's Inc., </em>436 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978), the district court concluded that the Commission \u201cmust be able to demonstrate its own jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State Fair of Texas v. United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>481 F.Supp. 1070, 1076 (N.D.Tex.1979). The Commission, citing <em>pre-Barlow\u2019s </em>cases, argues that a reviewing court should assure itself only that statutory authority for the warrant is not obviously lacking. <em>See American General Insurance Co. v. F. T. C., </em>496 F.2d 197, 200 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">The Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures applies to administrative searches as well as criminal investigations. <em>Donovan v. Dewey, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2534, 69 L.Ed.2d 262 (1981); <em>Marshall v. Barlow's Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978); <em>See v. City of Seattle, </em>387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967). See <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). In <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>the Court held that, except in unusual circumstances, warrant-less searches of commercial premises are inherently unreasonable and, therefore, interdicted by the Fourth Amendment. To secure a warrant, the agency must show \u201cprobable cause\u201d that it should be issued. As Justice White noted, \u201c[pjrobable cause in the criminal sense is not required,\u201d 436 U.S. at 320-21, 98 S.Ct. at 1824, 56 L.Ed.2d at 316, but the agency must show that;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-9\">the inspection is reasonable under the Constitution, is authorized by statute, and is pursuant to an administrative plan containing specific neutral criteria.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 323, 98 S.Ct. at 1826, 56 L.Ed.2d at 318. The plaintiffs contest only the Commission\u2019s statutory authority and do not challenge the constitutionality of the search or the existence of an appropriate administrative plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-11\">In deciding whether the district court properly granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to quash the warrant, we must determine what showing of statutory authority is sufficient to justify issuance of a warrant. As with most Fourth Amendment issues, we determine the applicable standard by weighing the legitimate expectations of privacy regarding the object of the search against the level of intrusion on that privacy. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); <em>Wanger v. Bonner, </em>621 F.2d 675 (5th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1393-14\">It follows that the balance may be different depending on the kind of property that is to be searched, the place where it is located, and the degree of intrusiveness the search entails. We put different considerations on the scales when we consider the examination of private papers and the inspection of property that is usually in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-15\">Both plaintiffs have a significant privacy interest in the documents that are in their respective possession because these materials are kept in a private file away from public view. We agree with the district court that a search warrant is \u201cthe most disruptive of the arrows in this investigatory quiver,\u201d <em>State Fair of Texas v. United States Consumer Products Safety Commission, </em>481 F.Supp. at 1076, because the warrant would enable the inspectors to search these files for themselves. Accordingly, we hold that, in order to obtain a warrant for the documents, the Commission must demonstrate clear, not merely plausible, statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-16\">Unlike the documents, the Skyride stands entirely visible to the public. What is in \u201cplain view\u201d receives little or no Fourth Amendment protection because the owner\u2019s expectation of privacy is minimal. <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980); <em>United States v. Jonas, </em>639 F.2d 200 (5th Cir. 1981). <em>See Donovan v. Dewey, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 2534, 69 L.Ed.2d 262 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., concurring). The Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>seeks only to examine the Skyride machinery more closely than a fairgoer could. We take judicial notice that some of the machinery may be shielded or enclosed for safety or functional purposes but the record contains no evidence that it is purposely hidden from public view. In the absence of a command to shut down the ride\u2019s operation, a warrant.to examine its machinery has little disruptive effect on the owner\u2019s business and strips little, if any, secrecy cloak.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Inspection of the Skyride, is, therefore, governed by the lesser standard: a warrant to inspect premises shielded by a minimal privacy interest need only be not \u201cplainly incompetent to any lawful purpose.\u201d <em>See Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, </em>317 U.S. 501, 509, 63 S.Ct. 339, 343, 87 L.Ed.2d 424, 429 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">The provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2051 <em>et seq. </em>determine the Commission\u2019s authority to obtain a warrant to inspect the relevant documents. Concluding that the Commission clearly proved its statutory authority to conduct this search under the demanding standard applicable to the documents, we do not test its authority by the lesser standard applicable to the Skyride.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-6\">A. THE SKYRIDE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-7\">The Act covers more than toasters and other small household appliances. Congress defined the term \u201cconsumer product\u201d expansively to include any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZK\">(i) <em>for sale </em>to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALz\">(ii) <em>for the personal use, </em>consumption, or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise; ... .<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATy4\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2052(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). The statute thus embraces not only merchandise produced \u201cfor sale to a consumer,\u201d but also those articles that consumers do not ordinarily buy, but nonetheless use. The hallmark of the Commission\u2019s authority is not the customer\u2019s legal relation to a product, but the consumer\u2019s physical exposure to it. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No.92-1153, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 27 (1972); <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. Chance Manufacturing Co., </em>441 F.Supp. 228, 233 (D.C.D.C.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">The term \u201cpersonal use\u201d is, of course, modified. The article must be produced for use \u201cin or around a ... household or residence, a school, in recreation or otherwise.\u201d When the entire second paragraph of the definition is read literally, it encompasses the Skyride; the Skyride is an \u201carticle . . . produced or distributed ... for the personal use ... or enjoyment ... of a consumer ... in recreation.\u201d The House Report accompanying the Act substantiates this interpretation. It states that Subpart (ii) \u201calso\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-11\">products which are primarily or exclusively sold to industrial or institutional buyers ... so long as they were produced for the <em>use </em>of consumers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aud\">H.R.Rep.No.92-1153, 92 Cong., 2d Sess. 27 (1972) (emphasis and ellipsis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-12\">Of course, plaintiffs challenge this reading,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but we cannot ignore the usual signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>canee of the language employed, the legislative history of subpart (ii) and the broad remedial policy underlying the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">1. The Skyride is an \u201cArticle\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">Steck &amp; Stapf argues that the Sky-ride is not an \u201carticle\u201d because it is too large to be exchanged between consumers. The only authority cited to support this extremely limited interpretation is <em>Webster\u2019s </em>definition of an article as a \u201ccommodity.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>42 (1969). If <em>Webster\u2019s </em>definition is controlling, it designates the Skyride. The Skyride is certainly a commodity, a tangible item capable of being sold. Moreover, <em>Webster\u2019s </em>also defines commodity as \u201carticle of commerce.\u201d If there be a distinctive difference between the words, we are unable to discern it. That Congress found it necessary to exempt aircraft and boats from the definition of consumer product, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2052(a)(1)(F)-(G), indicates that size is not a defining limitation to the term \u201carticle.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Be it ever so large, the Skyride is an article.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">2. The Skyride is \u201cDistributed\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">The State Fair contends that the Skyride is not \u201cdistributed\u201d because it is not customarily sold directly to consumers. This argument is answered by the words of the provision to which the State Fair alludes. Section 2052(a)(1)(A), describing the first of the nine excepted classes of products excludes from the Commission\u2019s authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-9\">any article which is <em>not customarily </em>produced or <em>distributed for </em>sale to, or <em>use </em>or consumption by, <em>or enjoyment of, </em>a consumer. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1395-13\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2052(a)(1)(A). We have no cause to ignore the unaccommodating words italicized; the Skyride has been \u201ccustomarily\u201d distributed \u2014 to amusement parks \u2014 for \u201cuse ... or enjoyment of\u201d consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-14\"><em>ASG Industries, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>593 F.2d 1323 (D.C.Cir.1979), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>444 U.S. 864, 100 S.Ct. 133, 62 L.Ed.2d 87 (1979), and <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. Anaconda Co., </em>593 F.2d 1314 (D.C.Cir.1979), cited by the State Fair, are not to the contrary. Each turns on the court\u2019s conclusion that housing is not a consumer product. <em>ASG </em>involved architectural glazing materials, while <em>Anaconda </em>involved aluminum wiring circuits, both products incorporated into housing. Consumers do not \u201cuse\u201d these products until they have been incorporated into the exempted structure and are no longer used separately from their use as part of the whole. In both cases, however, Judge Leventhal noted that products \u201ccustomarily . .. used by consumers\u201d are not exempted. <em>ASG, </em>593 F.2d at 1328; <em>Anaconda, </em>593 F.2d at 1322. <em>See Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v. United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>574 F.2d 178 (3d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 881, 99 S.Ct. 218, 58 L.Ed.2d 193 (1978).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-15\">The language of Section 2052(a)(1)(A) is unambiguous. <em>ASG, Anaconda </em>and <em>Kaiser </em>confirm that a product customarily distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>uted for use by consumers is not exempt from the Commission\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">3. The Skyride is Used by Consumers</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">The statutory phrase \u201cfor the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of the consumer\u201d poses perhaps the most difficult question of interpretation raised by the congressional definition of consumer product. In the common sense of the word, consumers \u201cuse\u201d the Skyride, in that they \u201cenjoy, hold, occupy, or have some manner of benefit\u201d from the product. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1710 (4th ed. 1968) (defining \u201cNontechnical Sense\u201d). <em>See </em>2 E. Weekly, <em>An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English </em>1574 (1967). Taking the term as defined in <em>Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary </em>978 (1965), a common desk-top reference book, the passenger \u201cavail[s] oneself of\u201d the ride, for \u201cuse implies availing oneself of as a means to an end.\u201d Not only do passengers literally occupy the Skyride, but they also enjoy it for sightseeing and benefit from being transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">Steck &amp; Stapf argues that, because consumers do not exercise control over the particular gondola in which they ride, they do not \u201cuse\u201d the Skyride. Surprisingly, two courts have accepted this argument. <em>See Robert K. Bell Enterprises, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>645 F.2d 26, 29 (10th Cir. 1981); <em>Walt Disney Productions v. United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>No. 79-0170-LEW(Px), slip op. at 6 (C.D.Cal. April 18, 1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>No. 79-3435 (9th Cir. April 22, 1981). Neither opinion cites any legislative history to support such a narrow and unusual reading of \u201cuse\u201d in contradiction to the common understanding of its meaning. One court has found that no evidence supports their interpretation. <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. Chance Manufacturing Co., </em>441 F.Supp. 228, 233 (D.C.D.C.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-11\">If we created this requirement <em>sua sponte, </em>we would also ignore that portion of the House Report including as consumer products those products sold to institutions for the use of consumers. The power of consumers to control articles sold to and owned by an institution will usually be limited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Precisely because they cannot control the product, consumers may face even greater risks of injury. It certainly becomes more difficult for them to determine for themselves the risks posed by its use. In the absence of any evidence of a contrary congressional intent, we cannot assume that Congress excluded products falling within the language of the statute and contemplated by the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-12\">We are more troubled by an apparent redundancy in the definition. We find it difficult to imagine a product \u201csold\u201d to consumers, but not \u201cused\u201d by them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even the restrictive definitions urged by State Fair and Steck &amp; Stapf do not eliminate this redundancy. Ordinarily, we avoid treating statutory language as surplusage. <em>Ideal Mutual Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>C. D. I. Construction Inc., </em>640 F.2d 654, 658 n.7 (5th Cir. 1981). In this instance, however, Congress may have tolerated tautology. The Senate version of the Consumer Product Safety Act limited its definition to products \u201csold\u201d to consumers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The House bill also used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>the language now constituting subpart (i), but added the additional language regarding \u201cpersonal use\u201d embodied in subpart (ii).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In its desire for \u201can assurance of comprehensiveness,\u201d <em>ASG Industries, </em>593 F.2d at 1328, the House employed its more \u201cbroadly stated\u201d definition, H.R.Rep.No.92-1153, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 27 (1972), without considering to what degree it overlapped the Senate definition. <em>See id. </em>The effort to avoid lacunae by seeking embraciveness may easily result in overlapping coverage. Without any evidence that Congress, in passing the House version, intended \u201csold\u201d to have independent significance, we decline to fabricate a tortured distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">4. The Skyride is Used in Recreation</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">Both plaintiffs assert that the Skyride is used only as a means of transportation, not as a form of recreation. The district court found that the ride was \u201cintended for the enjoyment of recreation-minded consumers.\u201d 481 F.Supp. at 1077. Plaintiffs have not shown that this finding is clearly erroneous. <em>See Robert K. Bell Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>484 F.Supp. 1221, 1225 (N.D.Okl.1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other </em>grounds, 645 F.2d 26 (10th Cir. 1981), which quotes promotional literature describing the Skyride as \u201can attraction in itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">The plaintiffs then pose a more challenging argument. They construe \u201cin recreation\u201d to modify the immediately preceding language rather than to provide an additional basis for considering an item as a consumer product. The relevant portion of Section 2052(a)(l)(ii) states that a consumer product is used, enjoyed or consumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-8\">in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise.. ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-10\">This interpretation reads the phrase \u201cin recreation\u201d to refer only to household or school products used \u201cin recreation [] or otherwise.\u201d Plaintiffs urge that, if \u201cin recreation\u201d provides an independent basis whereby a product becomes \u201cconsumer,\u201d then the word \u201cotherwise\u201d also provides an independent basis whereby the statute includes every product imaginable. (Plaintiffs provide a parade of spectres for our edification.) Further, according to the plaintiffs, the references to \u201chousehold or residence\u201d would be rendered surplusage, subsumed by \u201cotherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-12\">With the court in Chance <em>Manufacturing, </em>we find this interpretation \u201cunduly strained.\u201d 441 F.Supp. at 233. The insertion of a comma after \u201crecreation\u201d indicates that the word was part of the preceding series, rather than functioning with \u201cotherwise\u201d as an independent adjectival phrase and thus limiting \u201cconsumer products\u201d to those used in recreation or otherwise in a household, residence or school. Further evidence that use \u201cin recreation\u201d provides a separate basis for including a product comes from the list of exceptions to Section 2052(a)(l)\u2019s definition of \u201cconsumer product.\u201d That Congress explicitly exempted aircraft and boats, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2052(a)(1)(F)-(G), indicates congressional belief that these products, having no connection with school or household, would otherwise have fallen within the general definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-13\">We imply no insight as to the precise meaning of the term \u201cotherwise\u201d in this context. As a matter of diction, it is not redundant with the items in the preceding series because, by definition, it refers only to \u201cother\u201d items. However, we are not required to read this statute as if it were a wonderfully constructed jig-saw puzzle, with each word having only one precise place, yielding, when assembled, an unambiguous picture. The statute was not so constructed, as the legislative history indicates. It seems likely that \u201cotherwise\u201d was inserted as \u201can assurance of comprehensiveness,\u201d to use Judge Leventhal\u2019s phrase. <em>ASG, </em>593 F.2d at 1328. This case does not require us to announce that any non-indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>trial product<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> posing hazards to individuals constitutes a consumer product. That issue is simply not before us because the Skyride falls within one of the stated bases of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">5. Other Statutory Provisions Do Not Compel Plaintiffs\u2019 Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">The Act authorizes the Commission to acquire free samples of imported consumer products and purchase domestic consumer products at cost. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2066, 2076. Steck &amp; Stapf argues that, because the Commission is unlikely to acquire the Skyride in either manner, the ride is not a consumer product.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We find this argument unpersuasive. Both sections are permissive; they enable the Commission to obtain sample products, but do not suggest that the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to products that it may thus acquire. Such a limitation would be puzzling. The Commission will usually be fiscally unable to acquire products as expensive or as large as the Skyride. Yet large and costly products pose hazards to consumers indistinguishable from the hazards posed by those that are small and inexpensive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Absent legislative history or other explicit evidence that Congress intended this distinction, we refuse to read it into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-6\">Both plaintiffs argue that the narrower definition of \u201cconsumer product\u201d in the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 <em>et seq., </em>controls the definition contained in Section 2052(a)(1). The Warranty Act defines consumer product \u201cfor the purposes of this chapter\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOsU\">tangible personal property which is distributed in commerce and which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE4\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(1). Unlike the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Warranty Act is concerned with fraud, the release of financial information, and contractual rights. Because the Warranty Act is concerned only with household products actually sold to consumers, Congress consciously chose to employ a more limited definition. Two acts with different purposes need not be construed <em>in pari materia. United Shoe Workers v. Bedell, </em>506 F.2d 174, 188-89 &amp; n.96 (D.C.Cir.1974); <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>285 F.2d 152, 157 (5th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">Steck &amp; Stapf also cites definitions of \u201cconsumer product\u201d in the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. 1459(a), and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6291(a)(1). In each of these statutes, Congress has chosen to use the same term, \u201cconsumer product,\u201d but to define it differently in each instance. Each definition reflects the basic concerns of the legislation in which it is found. Without any evidence that these different definitions are interrelated, we refuse to assume that each of these different definitions has the same meaning. Indeed, if we did, we would have difficulty deciding which definition controls the others. We conclude that none of the provisions suggested by plaintiffs would limit Section 2052(a)(1)\u2019s definition of \u201cconsumer product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">6. The Legislative History of the Act Does Not Exclude the Skyride</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-12\">Both plaintiffs rely on legislative history indicating that Congress was concerned with the hazards posed by small household products to argue that Congress was concerned only with small products. <em>See, e. g., </em>118 Cong.Rec. 21847 (1972) (remarks of Sen. Percy); <em>id. </em>at 31375 (remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>of Cong. Staggers). Without doubt, many congressmen spoke primarily in terms of small household products when discussing the Act. Their statements, while addressing a central concern, do not purport to describe the limits of the Act\u2019s reach. The language of Section 2052(a)(1) suggests a much broader scope. A small facet of a larger problem will frequently capture the attention of Congress. Even though much of its discussion may involve the aspect that initially gained congressional attention, Congress, in the end, frequently passes a statute dealing comprehensively with the larger problem.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Lacking specific evidence that the expansion of Congressional concern embodied in Section 2052(a)(l)\u2019s language is only apparent, we must give full effect to the language as written. A statute governs all of the circumstances falling within its purview, not only those that prompted its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">We find the House Report statement that the statute includes \u201cproducts sold to .. . institutional buyers ... for use of consumers,\u201d quoted <em>supra, </em>more probative of congressional intent. Unlike the comments cited by the plaintiffs, this language deals directly with the limits of Section 2052(a)(l)\u2019s definition of consumer product, as does the Report\u2019s exhortation that we construe the definition broadly. On balance, the legislative history favors the conclusion that the Skyride does not transcend the periphery of the Commission\u2019s expansive domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">7. The Policy of the Act Favors Inclusion of the Skyride as a Consumer Product</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">In 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2051, Congress specified the findings and purposes underlying the Act. These statements announce a broad remedial purpose. In addition, several bear specifically on the question before us. The primary justification for creating the Commission is expressed in the second finding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-17\">(a) The Congress finds that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-18\">(2) complexities of consumer products and the diverse natures and abilities of the consumers using them frequently result in an inability of users to anticipate risks and to safeguard themselves adequately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1399-19\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2051(a)(2). If small household appliances pose risks beyond the ability of the average consumer to evaluate, a large and far more complicated machine like the Skyride may pose even greater hazards, yet consumers have neither the technical expertise nor any real opportunity to evaluate the risks involved. In reality, only the institutional purchaser can effectively inquire into the risks posed by a product like the Skyride. The House Report statement that the statute includes products bought by institutions for consumer use indicates that Congress was unwilling to rely on the institutional buyer alone to ensure that consumers do not face unreasonable risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-20\">The fourth finding states that local government regulation of unreasonable risks posed by consumer products is \u201cinadequate.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2051(a)(4). This disposes of plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Dallas Building Code regulations governing the Skyride exempt the product from the Commission\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-21\">The Act\u2019s \u201cpurposes\u201d also favor inclusion of the Skyride.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-22\">(b) The purposes of this chapter are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-23\">(1) to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>(2) to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-4\">(3) to develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and to minimize conflicting State and local regulations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-5\">(4) to promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of product-related deaths, illnesses, and injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-6\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2051(b). An effective Commission investigation improving the safety of the Skyride would serve each of these ends. The relevance of the fourth finding is especially obvious. Consumers have died while using the Skyride; the protection of others who may use them cannot be assured by awaiting a personal injury action to determine fault. The manufacturers and owners whose products have already been involved in serious injuries to consumers bear an especially heavy burden in arguing that the Commission lacks jurisdiction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-7\">That burden has not been carried here. We hold that the Skyride is a \u201cconsumer product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">B. THE COMMISSION IS AUTHORIZED TO ENTER THE FAIR GROUNDS</p>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">The other statutory issue before us requires less explication. Section 2065(a)(2) of the Act authorizes the Commission</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1C\">to inspect, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner such conveyance or those areas of such factory, warehouse, or establishment where such products are manufactured, held, or transported and which relate to the safety of such products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-11\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2065(a)(2). Section 2052(a)(8) defines manufactured as \u201cto manufacture, produce, or assemble.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2052(a)(8). The district court concluded that, because neither of the plaintiffs fabricated or assembled the product, the Commission was not authorized to enter their premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-12\">Under the two sections, however, the Commission\u2019s authority depends not on who assembled (and thus \u201cmanufactured\u201d) the product, but on where the product was assembled. <em>Accord, Robert K. Bell Enterprises, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>484 F.Supp. 1221, 1228 (N.D.Okl.1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>645 F.2d 26 (10th Cir. 1981). Section 2065(a) speaks of <em>\u201careas . .. </em>where such products are manufactured.\u201d The Skyride was necessarily assembled at the site of the fair, which provides the only location where the Commission may observe the product in action. Whenever a product can be assembled only on the purchaser\u2019s site, the Commission must either have the authority to inspect the functioning product there or be in most circumstances unable to inspect it at all. No legislative history mandates that we so limit the Commission\u2019s authority. We hold that the Commission may enter plaintiffs\u2019 premises to inspect the Skyride and to examine documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-13\">\n<em>TV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-14\">Concluding that the Commission had authority to inspect the Skyride and relevant documents, we grant the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD4_\">1. The district court\u2019s decision denying plaintiffs injunctive relief is AFFIRMED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>2. The declaratory judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs is VACATED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-5\">3. The district court\u2019s decision granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to quash the administrative search warrant is REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-6\">4. The district court\u2019s decision denying the Commission\u2019s motion for an order to show cause is VACATED, the issue now being moot in the light of this opinion.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">. The judgment is final and appealable. The district court\u2019s statement that its dismissal of the Commission\u2019s suit was \u201cwithout prejudice to further application for a warrant under other circumstances,\u201d <em>State Fair of Texas v. United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>481 F.Supp. 1070, 1082 (N.D.Tex.1979), holding out the possibility of a subsequent suit unhindered by res <em>judicata, </em>did not rob the judgment entered of its finality in resolving all of the issues then before the court. <em>Cf.

Consequently, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-9\">Whether or not the aerial tramway known as the Skyride is a consumer product, under the jurisdiction of the Act, hinges specifically on the interpretation of the words of Section 2052(a)(1) which defines that term as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-10\">The term \u201cconsumer product\u201d means any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise; but such term does not include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARL\">(A) any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment ' of, a consumer .. .. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1401-11\">Plaintiffs state (referring to subsection ii) that if each of the four phrases (1) \u201cin or around a permanent or temporary household or residence,\u201d (2) \u201ca school,\u201d (3) \u201cin recreation,\u201d and (4) \u201cor otherwise\u201d provide independent bases of jurisdiction, as the majority now holds, the Act\u2019s jurisdiction extends to the entire universe of articles produced for the use or enjoyment of consumers. Thus, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, the Act\u2019s jurisdiction is virtually limitless in this context. It is true that \u201cor otherwise\u201d is a broad and all-inclusive term, but the phrase \u201cin recreation, or otherwise\u201d should be construed to modify the preceding words \u201chousehold or residence, a school.\u201d Unless such modification is accepted, there can be no sensible reason for Congress including the home and school use provisions which would be mere surplusage under the majority\u2019s interpretation since the \u201cor otherwise\u201d term is without restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-12\">The Tenth Circuit analyzed the identical statute in <em>Robert K. Bell Enterprises, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>645 F.2d 26, 29 (10th Cir. 1981), and concluded that the term \u201cin recreation, or otherwise\u201d did, indeed, modify the home and school use provisions in subsection ii. In my view, this is a more reasonable and proper construction and I would apply it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-13\">The legislative history of the Act supports the view that consumer products should be restricted to those used at home or at school. In the section of the House Report entitled Basis for Legislation, the Committee made specific reference to the home or household five times in the space of two and one-half pages. H.R.Rep.No. 1153, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 21-24 (1972). More importantly, the House Report stated, \u201cWithin the last six years, the Congress has exhibited an increasing concern with the safety of the products which consumers encounter in their daily lives.\u201d In contrast, although many people ride the Skyride each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>year, it can hardly be said that an aerial tramway at the State Fair of Texas is the type of product which consumers encounter in their daily lives.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1402-14\">.
