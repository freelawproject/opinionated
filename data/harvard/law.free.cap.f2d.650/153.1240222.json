Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">This is a patent case that has been before us on two previous occasions. On the first occasion we affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that a machine manufactured by Lahman Manufacturing Company, Inc. (Lahman), infringed Farmhand\u2019s patent. <em>Farmhand, Inc. v. Lahman Mfg. Co., </em>568 F.2d 112 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 913, 98 S.Ct. 2254, 56 L.Ed.2d 414 (1978). We are now called upon to review an order of the trial court denying a contempt motion of Farmhand\u2019s that was based on the contention that Lahman was manufacturing and selling a new machine that also infringed Farmhand\u2019s patent and thereby violated the trial court\u2019s injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Farmhand asserts on appeal that the district court failed to decide the motion for contempt on the merits. We agree. It appears from the record that the district judge below having earlier taken senior status, at the hearing on Farmhand\u2019s motion elected not to involve himself further with the case and denied Farmhand\u2019s motion on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">As authority for his decision to remove himself he relied on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 294(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-16\">(b) Any judge of the United States who has retired from regular active service under section 371(b) or 372(a) of this title shall be known and designated as a senior judge and may continue to perform such judicial duties as he is willing and able to undertake, when designated and assigned as provided in subsections (c) and (d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">While this statute would indeed seem to authorize the trial judge\u2019s decision to discontinue his involvement with the case, it does not authorize his failure to decide Farmhand\u2019s motion on the merits. Rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>than denying Farmhand\u2019s contempt motion, the senior judge should have arranged for reassignment of the motion to another judge for decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Accordingly, the order denying Farmhand\u2019s motion for contempt is reversed and the motion remanded to the chief district judge for reassignment to another judge for decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
