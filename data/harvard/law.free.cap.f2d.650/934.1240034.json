Because the Commission did not affirm, modify, or vacate the Secretary\u2019s citation or direct other relief its order is not reviewable under section 11(a) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">Judicial review of final orders of the Commission is authorized by section 11(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-16\">Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Commission issued under s\u00fabsection (c) of section 659 of this title may obtain a review of such order in any United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or where the employer has its principal office, or in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, by filing in such court within sixty days following the issuance of such order a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside. .. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-17\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a). The section to which section 11(a) refers, section 10(c) of the Act, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-18\">The Commission shall [after a hearing on a contested citation] issue an order, based on findings of fact, affirming, modifying, or vacating the Secretary\u2019s citation or proposed penalty, or directing other appropriate relief, and such order shall become final thirty days after its issuance ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-19\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-20\">In the instant case, the Commission\u2019s order reversing and remanding the case to the ALJ did not affirm, modify, or vacate the Secretary\u2019s citation. See <em>Stripe-A-Zone </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number><em>Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>634 F.2d 230, 233 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Fieldcrest Mills, Inc. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>545 F.2d 1384, 1386. (4th Cir. 1976). Moreover, the Commission did not direct \u201cother appropriate relief\u201d since this phrase refers only to remedial orders entered after a decision on the merits. <em>See Stripe-A-Zone v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, supra </em>at 233. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s decision was not an order that is reviewable under section 11(a) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for review is granted and the petition is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">. The ALJ vacated the Secretary\u2019s citation on the ground that the Secretary failed to make a timely response to Noranda\u2019s interrogatories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-13\">Each employer shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axo\">Noranda was cited for willfully violating section 654(a)(1) by exposing its employees to excessive heat stress without providing protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1007-22\">. In reversing the ALJ\u2019s decision, the Commission held that absent a showing that the Secretary\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery order was contumacious or that Noranda was prejudiced by the failure, vacation of the citation was too harsh a sanction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
