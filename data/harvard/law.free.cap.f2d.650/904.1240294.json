Defendant Carlson was Director of Plans, Training and Security at Fort Sheridan until August 1978 and was succeeded by defendant Dooley. The third defendant is Joseph A. Genna, Chief of Plan's, Operations and Training at Fort Sheridan.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-19\">The first amended complaint alleges that plaintiff founded the Fort Sheridan Museum which became \u201cthe Army\u2019s main public relations asset in the Chicago region\u201d (1st Amended Complaint Par. 6). However, commencing in 1974, the defendants assertedly sought because of personal dislike to obtain plaintiff\u2019s resignation or retirement \u201cby extra-legal means\u201d since her record<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was too distinguished to enable them to fire her after a due process hearing. The extralegal means were:</p>\n<p id=\"b977-20\">1. Pressuring plaintiff\u2019s subordinates to provide unfavorable reports about her work performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-21\">2. Compelling plaintiff to accept unqualified subordinates to be used by defendants as informants about her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>3. Encouraging informant co-conspirator George Elisia to refuse to obey plaintiff\u2019s orders, to scream insults at her and to provide defendants with untrue reports about plaintiff\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">4. Haranguing plaintiff at the Museum in front of her subordinates and visitors, with defendant Dooley calling her \u201ca liar, a fraud and a thief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">5. Preparing unfavorable evaluations of plaintiff\u2019s reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">6. Sending plaintiff notices of intent to discipline or fire her.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">7. Transferring plaintiff to the unapproved position of \u201cSenior Audio-Visual Services Clerk,\u201d with no work for her to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">8. Threatening in 1979 to close the Museum and abolish plaintiff\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">9.. Withholding plaintiff\u2019s within-grade salary increase and timing her response thereto to occur during her hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">10. After plaintiff\u2019s hospitalization, demanding she prepare a huge number of reports impossible to complete on the dates set, maliciously reporting her absent without leave during a period of her hospitalization, and withholding her salary during her sick time.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">In view of the foregoing, plaintiff charged that her health deteriorated so that in late 1979 she was compelled to follow her physician\u2019s advice to retire. Since plaintiff\u2019s long series of administrative complaints and protests from 1975 to 1980 were denied or ignored, she was forced to file this lawsuit based on defendants\u2019 constitutional torts (Count I) and Dooley\u2019s slander (Count II).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">In Count I, plaintiff sought $200,000 damages plus costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and in Count II she sought a judgment solely against defendant Dooley for $200,000 in punitive damages and costs because of his false and malicious statements about her.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Its reasoning is contained in a 6-page order reported in 495 F.Supp. 348. In the order, Judge Bua, citing <em>Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895, correctly rejected defendants\u2019 first defense that they were absolutely immune from damage claims for plaintiff\u2019s allegedly unlawful discharge. However, he held that Count I failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the complaint failed to show that plaintiff had been denied an opportunity for a fair hearing through administrative remedies and because plaintiff still had an appropriate post-resignation remedy before the Civil Service Commission<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under <em>Gratehouse v. United States, </em>512 F.2d 1104, 1112 (Ct.Cl.1975). In so doing, the district court especially relied upon <em>Bishop v. Tice, </em>622 F.2d 349, 357 (8th Cir. 1980), where it was held that substantive due process damages sustained by a federal employee from a wrongful 1976 dismissal coupled with defamation \u201ccould have been recovered or adverted by resort to the Civil Service remedies created by Congress\u201d and regulations in effect in 1976 so that it was unnecessary to give him a judicial \u201ccompensatory remedy inferred from the Constitution\u201d under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown, Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619. Since the district judge dismissed Count I, he held there was no independent jurisdiction to consider the pendent state claim for defamation contained in Count II. We reverse and remand the case for trial of both Counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Carlson v. Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 18-19, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 1472, 64 L.Ed.2d 15, a <em>Bivens </em>remedy exists for such constitutional violations as alleged here in Count I unless one of the following two exceptions exists: (1) special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress and (2) an alternative remedy provided by Congress. Neither exception applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>There is no question that the second <em>Carlson </em>exception does not apply because Congress has not provided \u201can alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a <em>substitute </em>for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective\u201d (Court\u2019s emphasis; 446 U.S. at 18-19, 100 S.Ct. at 1472). Similarly, defendants have not demonstrated \u201cspecial factors counseling hesitation\u201d under <em>Carlson </em>because they do not enjoy \u201csuch independent status in our constitutional scheme as to suggest that judicially created remedies against them might be inappropriate\u201d and because \u201ceven if requiring them to defend [plaintiff\u2019s] suit might inhibit their efforts to perform their official duties,\u201d their qualified immunity provides adequate protection for them. <em>Carlson v. Green, supra </em>at 19, 100 S.Ct. at 1472.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Even assuming that the district court were correct in concluding that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy cannot be implied where alternative remedies are available,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there is no alternative remedy available to plaintiff here. Plaintiff\u2019s claim is that defendants deliberately bypassed the administrative procedures designed to afford her due process because they knew she could not be discharged for cause and instead undertook a systematic program to harass her into unwanted retirement. Plaintiff alleged that her administrative complaints and protests were denied or ignored, and defendants appear to concede that she was not afforded an administrative hearing (Br. 10). The administrative remedies relied upon by defendants do not cover coerced resignations. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 771.101-771.119 (1979), the cited Office of Personnel Regulations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> do not refer to forced retirement and indeed expressly except \u201ca separation action\u201d from an agency\u2019s grievance system (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.108(c)). The regulations mentioned in the <em>Gratehouse </em>case, <em>supra, </em>(5 C.F.R. Parts 752 and 772 (1972)), which defendants cite to show that plaintiff had an available post-resignation remedy, were superseded by 5 C.F.R. Parts 752 and 771 (1979) at the time of plaintiff\u2019s retirement. Part 752 applies only to suspensions or removals (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.01), and Part 771, as just noted, is also inapplicable. Moreover, even if these provisions were applicable the only relief they afford is reinstatement and back pay. But plaintiff, because defendants allegedly destroyed her health, is now unable to work and seeks damages, not reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Finally, <em>Bishop v. Tice, supra, </em>does not support dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s claim. First, the Congressional remedies and regulations relied on in <em>Bishop </em>dealt with discharges and not forced retirements. Second, both the majority and the dissent in <em>Bishop </em>agreed that if the plaintiff there could prove that his failure to exhaust administrative remedies had been due, as alleged, to defendants\u2019 misconduct, he would have an actionable procedural due process claim such as that advanced by plaintiff here. See 622 F.2d at 357-358.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">Since the regulations afforded plaintiff no pre- or post-termination hearing or other procedural protection,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a <em>Bivens </em>remedy must be implied under <em>Carlson v. Green, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">As previously noted, Count II seeks punitive damages from defendant Dooley because of his maliciously making false and slanderous statements about plaintiff in the presence of her subordinates and museum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>visitors. Judge B\u00faa dismissed this pendent count on the ground that he had \u201cno independent jurisdiction to consider the state law claim of defamation contained in Count II.\u201d Since we have held that Count I should not have been dismissed, it follows that pendent Count II was improperly dismissed. While in his brief defendant Dooley asserts the defense of absolute immunity in response to Count II, that defense is applicable only if he can show that he was \u201ca policy-making executive official\u201d making \u201ca public statement of a general policy in respect to matters of wide public interest and concern\u201d and that his statements were \u201cwithin the outer perimeter of * * * [his] line of duty\u201d <em>(Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 575, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 1341, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434). Therefore a trial of Count II is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Reversed and remanded for trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-12\">.
