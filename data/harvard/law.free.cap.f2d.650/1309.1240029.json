Also argued were <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Kramarsky, </em>650 F.2d 1287 (2nd Cir.) <em>(\u201cDelta\u201d), </em>and <em>Burroughs Corporation v. Kramarsky, </em>650 F.2d 1308 (2nd Cir.). The plaintiff here is an employer which maintains employee benefit plans that are subject to federal regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). Plaintiff is also subject to New York\u2019s Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296 (McKinney 1972 &amp; Supp. 1980-81) (\u201cHRL\u201d). HRL requires that disability benefit plans such as plaintiff\u2019s provide benefits for disabilities related to pregnancy on the same basis as for other disabilities. Plaintiff\u2019s plans exclude disabilities related to pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">Plaintiff commenced the present action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the HRL on the sole ground that \u00a7 514(a) of ERISA provides that ERI-SA preempts state laws such as the HRL. Relying on <em>Pervel Industries, Inc. v. Connecticut Comm'n on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>468 F.Supp. 490 (D.Conn.1978), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>603 F.2d 214 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1031, 100 S.Ct. 701, 62 L.Ed.2d 667 (1980), in which this Court affirmed by summary order a ruling that ERISA \u00a7 514(a) preempted a Connecticut statute similar to the HRL, the district court granted a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the HRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">For the reasons stated in our opinion in <em>Delta, </em>plaintiff\u2019s claim is untenable in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s action in <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Minnesota, </em>444 U.S. 1041, 100 S.Ct. 725, 62 L.Ed.2d 726 (1980). We therefore reverse, and remand to the district court for dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
