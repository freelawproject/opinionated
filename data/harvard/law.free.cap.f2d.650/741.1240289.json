JOHNSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b814-14\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b814-15\">This case is before the Court on application of the National Labor Relations Board (the Board) pursuant to section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>for enforcement of its order issued against Howard Johnson Company, d/b/a Howard Johnson Distribution Center (the Company) on March 17, 1980.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board found on the General Counsel\u2019s motion for summary judgment that the Company had refused to bargain with the Dallas General Drivers, Ware-housemen and Helpers Local 745 (the Union) in violation of section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act, and ordered the Company to bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-16\">In opposition to the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement, the Company argues that the Regional Director failed to conduct a full investigation of the Company\u2019s objections to the underlying certification election, and that the Board abused its discretion in refusing to remand the case to the Regional Director for further investigation, thus rendering the certification invalid. Specifically, the Company argues that the Board agent investigating the Company\u2019s objections failed to interview two company witnesses \u2014 General Manager of Distributions Bowerfind and Distribution Center Manager Ken Schultz, and that the testimony of these witnesses would have supported the Company\u2019s allegations that the Union made false and misleading campaign statements to employees and coerced employees prior to the elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-17\">The Board based its refusal to remand the certification proceeding to the Director for further investigation on the ground that, even assuming that the alleged manner in which the investigation was conducted justified the Company\u2019s failure to present affidavits of Bowerfind and Schultz to the Board agent, the agent\u2019s conduct in no way precluded the Company from demonstrating <em>to the Board </em>that such testimony, if presented, would have supported its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>objections. Consequently, the Board held that \u201cregardless of the nature of the investigation here, the employer, in seeking to have the Board overrule a regional director\u2019s recommendation, was still required, under established Board policy, to supply <em>the Board </em>with specific evidence, tantamount to an offer of proof, which <em>prima facie </em>would warrant setting aside the election before the Board will direct a hearing or require the Regional Director to pursue the investigation further. Regency Electronics, Inc., 198 N.L.R.B. 627 (1972); Bufkor-Pelzner Division, Inc., 169 N.L.R.B. 998 (1968)\u201d (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, the Board concluded that the Company\u2019s exceptions were \u201cinsufficient to justify remanding this case since they do not specify the disagreement with the Regional Director\u2019s findings of fact and they do not provide any indication of what the employer\u2019s witnesses might testify to, were they permitted to testify, which would contradict the Regional Director\u2019s findings.\u201d (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">It is beyond peradventure that \u201cthe burden is on the employer to demonstrate that the election was not fairly conducted.\u201d <em>Contract Knitter, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>545 F.2d 967, 971 (5th Cir. 1977). This burden is a heavy one, and the objecting party must present \u201cspecific evidence\u201d which on its face would warrant setting aside the election. <em>NLRB v. Singleton Packing Corp., </em>418 F.2d 275, 280 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 824, 91 S.Ct. 47, 27 L.Ed.2d 53. Examination of the record leads this Court to conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to remand the representation proceeding to the Regional Director for further investigation of the Company\u2019s objections in this case. First, it is significant to note that the Board agent did interview the witnesses that the Company designated in its formal objections as witnesses supporting its disagreement with the Regional Director\u2019s findings, and that neither Schultz nor Bower-find was so designated by the Company. Even more significant is the fact that the Company failed to indicate how these management officials could have had personal knowledge of misrepresentations which were alleged to have been made to employees, and failed to indicate in even the most general terms what testimony those witnesses would have provided to contradict the Director\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the Company\u2019s exceptions failed to specify the disagreement with the Regional Director\u2019s findings, and failed to provide any indication of what the Company\u2019s witnesses might testify to, were they permitted to testify, the Board\u2019s adoption of the Regional Director\u2019s findings without further investigation of the Company\u2019s objections was not an abuse of discretion in this case, and consequently does not invalidate the certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">We have examined the Company\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Consequently, the Board\u2019s application for enforcement of its order is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">ORDER ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-13\">. The Board\u2019s decision and order is reported at 248 N.L.R.B. No. 45.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-6\">. Member Murphy dissented, based on her view that once an objecting party has alleged specific objectionable conduct and provided the names of witnesses \u201cit [is] incumbent upon the Region to interview the individuals named by the Employer to determine the merits of the objections, and the failure of the Regional Director to have done that constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">. The Company\u2019s objections simply stated that the two management officials would give \u201ctestimony in excess of that given by the rank-and-file employees relating to the misrepresentations, and their testimony would have been in direct contradiction to the alleged facts cited in the Regional Director\u2019s report on Objection 2 raising crucial and important credibility issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ajj\"><em>Electronic Components Corporation of North Carolina v. NLRB, </em>546 F.2d 1088 (4th Cir. 1976), relied upon by the Company, is inapposite. In that case, the employer provided the investigating agent with specific information concerning the substance of the proffered witnesses\u2019 testimony, and, equally important, the agent failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
