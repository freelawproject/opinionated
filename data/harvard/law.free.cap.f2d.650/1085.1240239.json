The Secretary contends that Union Pacific\u2019s failure to pay overtime violates section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). He also contends that the violation was \u201cwillful\u201d and that the three year statute of limitations applies. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a). Union Pacific argues that its dispatchers\u2019 duties affect the safety of operation of vehicles used in interstate commerce and that its dispatchers are subject to regulation by the Secretary of Transportation under section 4 of the Motor Carrier Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 304, and therefore exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(1). Union Pacific also contends that even if its dispatchers are not exempt from the overtime provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the failure to pay overtime compensation was not \u201cwillful\u201d and any recovery should be subject to the two rather than the three year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-14\">The district court found that Union Pacific\u2019s dispatchers are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The court concluded that their duties affect the safety of operation of defendant\u2019s business and that the power to regulate their qualifications and hours of service is vested in the Secretary of Transportation. The court also found, alternatively, that the defendant\u2019s failure to pay overtime compensation was not \u201cwillful\u201d within the meaning of the Act\u2019s limitations provision. Therefore, the district court held that any claim for unpaid compensation would be subject to the two year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-16\">The defendant, Union Pacific Motor Freight Company, operates as a motor common carrier and is engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce. Union Pacific operates under the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission (hereinafter ICC). Pursuant to this authority, Union Pacific handles freight that moves in part by rail on rail bills of lading at rail rates. There is no dispute that Union Pacific is a covered employer within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-17\">Th'e facts regarding the nature of the dispatchers\u2019 duties are not in dispute. During the period in question, Union Pacific\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>dispatchers performed both as inside dispatchers and outside, or gate, dispatchers. Inside dispatchers schedule and direct the pickup and delivery of trailers and containers that move over the railroad. They transmit the alignment schedule for train loading and unloading as established by the railroad foremen. Further, on certain limited occasions inside dispatchers have performed other duties, including the loading and unloading of trailers from flatcars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">The job of outside, or gate, dispatcher was created to control unsafe and congested conditions inside the terminal that inside dispatchers could not effectively handle when Union Pacific\u2019s business expanded. Outside dispatchers stand at the gate to the rail yard to check trailers in and out when they are brought to the terminal for loading onto, or are leaving the terminal after being unloaded from, rail flatcars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">Union Pacific\u2019s dispatchers inspect the company\u2019s trailers and containers for defects and damage. Thus, they carry out, in part, Federal Highway Administration inspection, repair, and maintenance regulations. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 396 (1980). They have received some instruction from Union Pacific in the application and enforcement of Federal Highway Administration regulations on the transportation of hazardous materials, and review shipping documents to assure proper notations regarding hazardous materials. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 397 (1980). They inspect shipments of hazardous materials to ensure that the containers and vehicles are properly placarded. Inspection of such shipments is required by Department of Transportation regulation, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 177.823 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">In 1966 the Department of Labor conducted an investigation of defendant\u2019s failure to pay overtime compensation to dispatchers. At the completion of the investigation, representatives of the Department and the company met and discussed the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and their applicability to the company. The record is far from complete with respect to the ultimate position taken by the parties at that time; however, as a result of the discussion, Union Pacific raised the dispatchers\u2019 monthly salary and the Department took no further action. Union Pacific contends that \u201cno significance\u201d should be attached to \u201cthis event\u201d and does not urge that the Department acquiesced in the company\u2019s actions, misled it in any way, or proferred any erroneous advice, either tacitly or expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">The Secretary of Labor has charged Union Pacific with failure to pay overtime compensation to dispatchers for the period since December 1, 1974. During this period Union Pacific paid its dispatchers a straight monthly salary for all hours worked, with no overtime compensation for hours in excess of forty per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\"><em>The Section </em>7 <em>Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-12\">Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act requires the payment of overtime compensation to employees covered by that section.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Overtime compensation must be paid at not less than one and one half times the regular hourly rate for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. Section 7; however, does not cover all employees who are subject to the Act generally. Section 13(b)(1) of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> exempts from the overtime compensation provision those employees who are subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation under section 4 of the Motor Carrier Act, 49 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>\u00a7 304.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no concurrent coverage of section 7 of the Pair Labor Standards Act and section 4 of the Motor Carrier Act. <em>Levinson v. Spector Motor Service, </em>330 U.S. 649, 661, 67 S.Ct. 931, 938, 91 L.Ed. 1158 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">The jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation under the Motor Carrier Act is \u201climited to those employees [of common carriers] whose activities affect the safety of operation. The [Secretary of Transportation] has no jurisdiction to regulate the qualifications or hours of service of any others.\u201d <em>United States v. American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc., </em>310 U.S. 534, 553, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1069, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For purposes of the section 13(b)(1) exemption of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Secretary of Transportation need only possess the power to regulate the employees in question. He need not have exercised that power. <em>Levinson, </em>330 U.S. at 678, 67 S.Ct. at 946; <em>Southland Gasoline Co. v. Bayley, </em>319 U.S. 44, 46-50, 63 S.Ct. 917, 918-920, 87 L.Ed. 1244 (1943). Thus, if Union Pacific\u2019s dispatchers\u2019 activities affect the safety of operation of motor vehicles, they are exempt from the Act\u2019s overtime compensation requirement under section 13(b)(1). <em>Levinson, </em>330 U.S. at 671, 67 S.Ct. at 942; <em>American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc., </em>310 U.S. at 553, 60 S.Ct. at 1068; <em>Crooker v. Sexton Motors, Inc., </em>469 F.2d 206, 209 (1st Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">\u2022 Following <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc., </em>the ICC issued a report defining, both affirmatively and negatively, the extent of its jurisdiction to prescribe regulations under the Motor Carrier Act. 28 M.C.C. 125, Ex parte Nos. MC-2 and MC-3 (March 3, 1941). Limiting its jurisdiction to \u201cthose employees who devote a <em>substantial </em>part of their time to activities which <em>directly affect </em>the safety of operation of motor vehicles\u201d in interstate commerce, <em>id. </em>at 139, the ICC concluded that drivers, mechanics, loaders and helpers employed by common carriers fall into that category. The Commission excluded from its jurisdiction all other classifications of employees, expressly listing <em>dispatchers </em>as among those employees whose activities do not directly affect safety of operation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in <em>Levinson, </em>330 U.S. at 669, 67 S.Ct. at 941, and a companion case, <em>Pyramid Motor Freight Corp. v. Ispass, </em>330 U.S. 695, 706-707, 67 S.Ct. 954, 959-960, 91 L.Ed. 1184 (1947), approved both the affirmative and negative elements of the ICC\u2019s definition of its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\">Union Pacific contends that the duties of its dispatchers present a situation not addressed by the ICC or by the Supreme Court in the earlier era of <em>Levinson </em>and <em>Pyramid Motor. </em>Union Pacific notes that since <em>Levinson </em>the jurisdiction of the ICC over employees whose activities affect safety of operation has been transferred to the Secretary of Transportation. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1655(e)(6)(C).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The company points out that the Secretary of Transportation has adopted regulations regarding (1) placarding of hazardous materials, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 177.823 (1979), (2) inspection and maintenance, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 396 (1980), and (3) identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>tion, on the bill of lading, of hazardous materials, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 397.19 (1980), all of which impose duties on motor carriers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Union Pacific\u2019s dispatchers perform certain limited inspection and enforcement duties pursuant to these regulations, such as reviewing documents to see that they contain the necessary information and ensuring proper placarding of vehicles carrying hazardous materials. Union Pacific argues that the performance of duties which implement safety regulations necessarily involves the performance of duties that directly affect safety of operation. Therefore, Union Pacific contends, its dispatchers are exempt from coverage of the overtime compensation provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Normally, whether duties <em>directly </em>affect safety of operation of interstate motor carriers and constitute a substantial part of the employees\u2019 activities is a matter for the Secretary of Transportation to determine. <em>Levinson, </em>330 U.S. at 669, 67 S.Ct. at 941.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Decisions regarding in which duties affect safety, and in what manner, require the Secretary\u2019s special knowledge and experience. <em>Pyramid Motor, </em>330 U.S. at 707, 67 S.Ct. at 960. Similarly, if the times, or the nature of job classifications, change, it is the Secretary of Transportation\u2019s function to reexamine the existing classifications. Only after the Secretary has had the opportunity to make the requisite determination regarding the new duties and to decide whether to establish new classifications or revise the current classifications, should the court consider whether the duties of particular employees place them within his jurisdiction under the Motor Carrier Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\">In this case, however, it has long been determined that the basic duties of dispatchers do not bring them within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation for purposes of section 4 of the Motor Carrier Act. The new or additional duties cited by Union Pacific are not significantly different in nature from those considered by the ICC in its original ruling excluding dispatchers. When the ICC decided that dispatchers were not covered by section 4 of the Motor Carriers Act, it applied a proximate cause test. It excluded dispatchers for the reason that, while errors in judgment made by dispatchers might result in accidents, those errors are not the proximate cause of such accidents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus the ICC concluded that dispatchers\u2019 duties did not <em>directly </em>affect the safety of operation of motor vehicles. The duties referred to by Union Pacific in this case have, at most, an equally indirect effect. Moreover, it is doubtful that they constitute a substantial part of the dispatchers\u2019 activities. Reviewing documents to see that proper notations have been made and inspecting vehicles to insure that proper placards have been attached would not, in our view, meet the test adopted by the ICC. Nor would the other comparatively minor inspection duties. Union Pacific\u2019s dispatchers therefore fall squarely within the dispatcher classification previously established by the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">We do not find persuasive Union Pacific\u2019s argument that the performance of duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>contemplated by safety regulations necessarily involves the performance of duties that directly affect safety. Were Union Pacific correct, any employer could rid itself of the obligation to pay overtime compensation by the simple expedient of parcelling out among his employees the various inspection and enforcement duties imposed by governmental safety regulations. We do not think that when the safety regulations were promulgated it was intended that every employee involved in their administration would, ipso facto, be exempted from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Unless and until the Secretary considers the issue of what effect, if any, the new duties of dispatchers have upon the existing classification,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Union Pacific\u2019s dispatchers, like all other dispatchers, are entitled to the protection and benefits of section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">Union Pacific also argues that loading activities sometimes performed by inside dispatchers place them within the classification \u201cpartial-duty loaders,\u201d a classification which is within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation. <em>Levinson, </em>330 U.S. at 651-653, 675, 67 S.Ct. at 933-934, 944. The district court in its findings of fact stated that Union Pacific\u2019s inside dispatchers \u201care flexible in the work they perform in various job classifications, often on a fill-in basis, including the loading and unloading of trailers from flatcars.\u201d While it is not clear what significance if any the district court attached to this finding, there is no evidence whatsoever in the record that would support a finding that Union Pacific\u2019s dispatchers are \u201cpartial-duty loaders.\u201d The only evidence that Union Pacific points to is a statement that during strikes and work stoppages its management personnel, including dispatchers, operate equipment normally operated by loaders. That fact cannot by any stretch of the imagination or distortion of legal theory turn dispatchers into \u201cpartial-duty loaders.\u201d <em>See Levinson, </em>330 U.S. at 673-674, 67 S.Ct. at 943-944; <em>Pyramid Motor, </em>330 U.S. at 708, 67 S.Ct. at 960.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">\n<em>Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APc\">We next consider whether the applicable statute of limitations is two or three years. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, an action to recover unpaid overtime compensation is barred unless commenced within two years after the cause of action accrues, except where the violation of the Act was \u201cwillful,\u201d in which case the action may be commenced within three years. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Secretary of Labor argues that the district court erred in determining that Union Pacific\u2019s failure to pay overtime wages to the dispatchers was not \u201cwillful.\u201d We agree with the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">This circuit has not adopted a standard for determining whether violations of the Act are \u201cwillful\u201d for purposes of section 255. Other circuits\u2019 decisions, however, provide useful guidance. We agree basically with the approach the District of Columbia and Fifth Circuits have taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>In <em>Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 429 (1976), the District of Columbia Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-4\">[T]he employer\u2019s noncompliance is \u201cwillful\u201d when he is cognizant of an appreciable possibility that he may be subject to the statutory requirements and fails to take steps reasonably calculated to resolve the doubt. We think too, that the same conclusion follows when an equally aware employer consciously and voluntarily charts a course which turns out to be wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 461-62 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">The Fifth Circuit has adopted a similar test. In <em>Brennan v. Heard, </em>491 F.2d 1 (1974), the Fifth Circuit, relying in part on <em>Coleman v. Jiffy June Farm's, Inc., </em>458 F.2d 1139 (5th Cir. 1972), stated that \u201c[a]n employer acts willfully and subjects himself to the three year liability provision if he knows or has reason to know, that his conduct is <em>governed by </em>the Fair Labor Standards Act.\u201d 491 F.2d at 3 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">In <em>Laffey </em>the employer was aware of the Equal Pay Act (an addition to the Fair Labor Standards Act)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and familiar with its provisions. The company had reviewed the Act to determine its possible applicability, but erroneously concluded that it did not apply. 567 F.2d at 462. The District of Columbia Circuit found the violation to be \u201cwillful,\u201d stating that \u201cthere is no good reason for translating the employer\u2019s error into loss of pay for the employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">In <em>Heard </em>the employer \u201cknew of the existence of the Fair Labor Standards Act and had \u2018heard talk\u2019 that recent amendments had extended coverage to those in the position of his employees.\u201d 491 F.2d at 3. The Fifth Circuit found that the defendant\u2019s unwillingness to determine his statutory obligation under the Act did not protect him from the three year statute of limitations: \u201c[a]n ostrichlike cultivation of ignorance has never been considered a defense to liability for willful violation of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). According to the <em>Heard </em>court, previous cases, including <em>Jiffy June, </em>\u201cestablished that neither a good faith belief in the lawfulness of his wage and overtime regulations nor complete ignorance of their invalidity shields the employer from the additional year of liability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">In <em>Jiffy June </em>the employer was aware that a change in his overtime pay rules might violate the Act. However, he implemented the change on the basis of his counsel\u2019s advice that it was lawful. The Fifth Circuit found the violation to be \u201cwillful,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-12\">The advice of counsel to proceed with a favorable wage settlement which undercuts the FLSA would be an easy way of circumventing the requirements of the Act \u2014 far too easy a way for us to assume that Congress intended to subject employees to the strict two-year limitations period whenever an employer\u2019s lawyer had given him the green light to restructure their pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-13\">458 F.2d at 1141-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-14\">We agree that an employer should not be relieved of its statutory obligation to pay its employees overtime compensation merely because of its own error. Nor should an employer\u2019s assertion of ignorance of the Act\u2019s requirements be sufficient to negate willfulness. Further, we agree that an employer\u2019s reliance on the incorrect advice of counsel should not excuse the employer from the three year statute of limitations. However, we believe that a violation is not \u201cwillful\u201d if the employer relies in good faith on the erroneous advice of an appropriate government agency-</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-15\">Accordingly, we adopt the following rule for determining willfulness under section 255: A violation is willful when the employer was, or should have been, cognizant of an appreciable possibility that the employees involved were covered by the statutory provisions. Reliance on erroneous advice is no bar to a finding of a \u201cwillful\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>violation, except for good faith reliance upon advice rendered by an appropriate government agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\">Union Pacific\u2019s conduct constitutes a \u201cwillful\u201d violation of the Act under the test set forth above. As long ago as 1941, the ICC had determined that dispatchers were not within its jurisdiction (now the Secretary of Transportation\u2019s) under the Motor Carrier Act for purposes of regulating hours of service, and that their duties did not affect the safety of operation of interstate motor carriers. In addition, the Department of Labor investigated Union Pacific\u2019s failure to pay its dispatchers overtime wages in 1966 and discussed the problem with the company. Therefore, Union Pacific was or should have been cognizant of an \u201cappreciable possibility\u201d that its dispatchers were subject to the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Union Pacific argues that government regulations created \u201cuncertainty\u201d and that this should negate any finding of willfulness. Uncertainty is no defense to an allegation of \u201cwillfulness.\u201d Moreover, Union Pacific did not attempt to resolve the uncertainty by obtaining advice from the Secretary of Transportation or the Secretary of Labor.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such unwillingness to obtain a determination as to the applicability of the Act further confirms our conclusion that the violation was \u201cwillful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">Union Pacific\u2019s failure to pay overtime compensation to dispatchers was a willful violation of the Act. The three year statute of limitations applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">The Secretary of Labor seeks both a prospective and a restitutionary injunction. We are aware of nothing in the record that would support a denial of either form of relief. <em>See Marshall v. Chala Enterprises, </em>Inc., 645 F.2d 799 at 804 (9th Cir., 1981).

While this may be true, it is clear that such errors in judgment are not the proximate causes of such accidents, and that the dispatchers engage in no activities which directly affect the safety of operation of motor vehicles in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">28 M.C.C. at 135.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">. Union Pacific has chosen not to initiate any proceedings regarding this matter before the Secretary of Transportation or to request any ruling from him. Union Pacific\u2019s counsel stated during oral argument that the Company is reluctant to become involved unnecessarily in any proceeding before government agencies. Thus, Union Pacific has in effect chosen to accept for purposes of this lawsuit the classifications as they currently stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">. As the court noted in <em>Pyramid Motor.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-8\">In contrast to the loading activities in the <em>Levinson </em>case, the mere handling of freight at a terminal, before or after loading, or even the placing of certain articles of freight on a motor carrier truck may form so trivial, casual, or occasional a part of an employee\u2019s activities . .. that his activities will not come within the kind of \u201cloading\u201d which is described by the Commission and which, in its opinion, affects safety of operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxY\">330 U.S. at 708, 67 S.Ct. at 960 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1163-14\">. Section 255 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-15\">Any action ... to enforce any cause of action for ... unpaid overtime compensation .. . under the Fair Labor Standards Act ...\u2014 (a) ... may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued ... except that a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued; ...</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1164-9\">. Pub. L. No. 88-38, sec. 3, 77 Stat. 56 (1963), <em>codified in </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1165-8\">. <em>See Hodgson v. Cactus Craft of Arizona, </em>481 F.2d 464, 467 (9th Cir. 1973), where this court held that willfulness was established where two prior investigations resulted in warnings which were ignored by the employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1165-9\">. Union Pacific\u2019s argument that the uncertainty arose because of an Internal Revenue Service Ruling is imaginative but not persuasive. We should also note that we would not consider the Internal Revenue Service an \u201cappropriate government agency\u201d from which to obtain advice concerning the scope of the Fair Labor Standards Act or the Motor Carrier Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
