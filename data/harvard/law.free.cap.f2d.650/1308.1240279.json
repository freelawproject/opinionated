Also argued were <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Kramarsky, </em>650 F.2d 1287 (2 Cir.) <em>(\u201cDelta\u201d) </em>and <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Company v. Kramarsky, </em>650 F.2d 1309 (2 Cir.). The plaintiff here is an employer which maintains an employee benefit plan that is subject to federal regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). Plaintiff is also subject to New York\u2019s Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296 (McKinney 1972 &amp; Supp. 1980-1981) (\u201cHRL\u201d). HRL requires that disability benefit plans such as plaintiff\u2019s provide benefits for disabilities related to pregnancy on the same basis as for other disabilities. Plaintiff\u2019s plan excludes disabilities related to pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>Plaintiff commenced the present action in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the HRL on the ground that \u00a7 514(a) of ERISA provides that ERISA preempts laws such as the HRL. Plaintiff also sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, contending that defendant had persistently denied it an opportunity to be heard on its ERISA argument, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Relying on <em>Pervel Industries, Inc. v. Connecticut Comm\u2019n on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>468 F.Supp. 490 (D.Conn.1978), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>603 F.2d 214 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1031, 100 S.Ct. 701, 62 L.Ed.2d 667 (1980), in which this Court affirmed by summary order a ruling that ERISA \u00a7 514(a) preempted a Connecticut statute similar to the HRL, the district court enjoined enforcement of the HRL with respect to plaintiff\u2019s employee benefit plans. The court did not reach plaintiff\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">For the reasons discussed in our decision today in <em>Delta, </em>plaintiff\u2019s claim that ERISA preempts the HRL is untenable in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s action in <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Minnesota, </em>444 U.S. 1041, 100 S.Ct. 725, 62 L.Ed.2d 726 (1980). We therefore reverse the injunction of the district court. Since the court did not rule on the \u00a7 1983 claim, we remand for whatever further consideration plaintiff may seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
