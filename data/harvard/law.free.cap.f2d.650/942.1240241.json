Appellant, an alien, pled guilty to a charge of entering the United States without authorization after he had been previously deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. In his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his conviction under \u00a7 1326, appellant asserts: (1) that he was not deported according to law as required by \u00a7 1326, in that the Immigration and Naturalization Service did not follow its own rules in the deportation proceedings; and (2) that his guilty plea was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel, in that his counsel did not advise him that a collateral attack on his deportation was a defense. The district court rejected appellant\u2019s claims, holding that the underlying deportation could not be collaterally attacked in a \u00a7 1326 prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Although recognizing that there was considerable support for appellant\u2019s position,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court held that Congress did not intend to allow a collateral attack upon a deportation in a \u00a7 1326 prosecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court used as its touchstone the recent decision by the Supreme Court in <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980), which held that the invalidity of the prior felony conviction is not a defense to a charge of violating 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the analytical approach used by the Supreme Court in <em>Lewis, </em>the district court found that: (1) on its face \u00a7 1326 does not limit its application to aliens who have been deported according to law; (2) there is no provision as in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3575(e) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(c)(2) authorizing collateral attack; (3) the statutory scheme as it appears in \u00a7 1105a expresses a congressional intent to limit review of deportation orders to direct or habeas review prior to indictment under \u00a7 1326; (4) there is a need to give finality to deportation orders; and (5) there is a lack of legislative history which would require a different interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">We hold that the validity of the original deportation is not a matter that is cognizable under \u00a7 2255. Allegations of government misconduct in pretrial matters that do not amount to a denial of a fair trial generally cannot be raised under \u00a7 2255. \u201cIt is firmly established that \u00a7 2255 cannot be used as a substitute for direct appeal from a conviction.\u201d <em>Houser v. United States, </em>508 F.2d 509, 513 (8th Cir. 1974). Whether the validity of the original deportation could have been raised on direct appeal is another question. <em>See </em>notes 2 &amp; 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">We also find that counsel for CabreraQuintero rendered satisfactory service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">.
