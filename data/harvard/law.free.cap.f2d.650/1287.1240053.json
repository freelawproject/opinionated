Lasker, <em>Judge, </em>485 F.Supp. 300 (S.D.N.Y.1980), as enjoined them from requiring plaintiffs to alter their employee benefit plans to conform with New York\u2019s Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296 (McKinney 1972 &amp; Supp. 1980-1981) (\u201cHRL\u201d). Plaintiffs Delta Air Lines, Inc., <em>et a I. </em>(the \u201cairlines\u201d), cross-appeal from so much of the judgment as dismissed their complaint seeking a similar injunction against enforcement by the New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and its Chairman, Arthur Cooperman (collectively the \u201cBoard\u201d), of New York\u2019s Disability Benefits Law, N.Y. Work. Comp. Law \u00a7 205(3) (McKinney Supp. 1980-81) (\u201cDBL\u201d). For the reasons below we reverse the ruling as to the HRL, and vacate the ruling as to the DBL and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">Section 296 of the HRL requires that employee benefit plans provide coverage for disability due to pregnancy on the same basis on which other disabling conditions are covered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section -205(3) of the DBL requires employers to provide at least eight weeks of coverage for pregnancy-related disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff airlines maintain various employee benefits plans, including sickness and accident disability plans, sick leave plans, and medical benefit plans, through which payments are made to their employees who suffer nonoccupational illnesses or injuries covered by the plans. During the periods relevant herein their plans did not provide complete coverage for disabilities or costs associated with pregnancies. Plaintiffs brought the present action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the HRL and the DBL on the grounds that each is preempted by any of three federal statutes: (1) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1381 (1976 &amp; Supp. II 1977) (\u201cERISA\u201d); (2) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (1976) (\u201cTitle VII\u201d); or (3) the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-188 (1976) (\u201cRLA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AgL\">A. <em>The Statutory Grid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">1. <em>Federal and State laws relating to discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">Section 703(a)(1) of Title VII, enacted in 1964 as part of the Civil Rights Act, makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee \u201cbecause of ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). As originally enacted, Title VII did not specify whether or not denial of employee benefits related to pregnancy was intended to constitute discrimination because of sex. In 1976, the Supreme Court held that an employer\u2019s exclusion of pregnancy-related benefits from coverage under disability benefit plans did not constitute discrimination \u201cbecause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>... sex\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 703(a)(1). <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 97 S.Ct. 401, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">Like Title VII, New York\u2019s HRL prohibits discrimination in employment \u201cbecause of . . . sex.\u201d Unlike the United States Supreme Court, however, the New York Court of Appeals interpreted this language in its own statute to require private employers maintaining disability benefits plans to provide benefits for pregnancy on the same basis as for other covered disabilities. <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v. New York State Human Rights Appeal Board, </em>41 N.Y.2d 84, 390 N.Y.S.2d 884, 359 N.E.2d 393 (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Soon afterward, New York amended the DBL to require employers to provide coverage for at least eight weeks of pregnancy-related disability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">As of April 29, 1979, Title VII was amended to provide that the term \u201cbecause of sex\u201d would include the meaning \u201cbecause of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\u201d Pub.L. 95-555, 92 Stat. 2076 (1978). The amendment further provided that \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work .... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k) (Supp. II 1978). Thus, after April 29, 1979, the HRL was no longer broader than Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">2. <em>Federal law relating to employee benefits plans</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-12\">In 1974, Congress enacted ERISA, a comprehensive federal statutory program designed to curb a variety of abuses associated with pension and other employee benefits plans, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (statement of congressional purpose). To protect the integrity of the federal regulatory scheme, ERISA \u00a7 514(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), provides that ERISA \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in [ERISA \u00a7 4(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(a)] and not exempt under [ERISA \u00a7 4(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(b)].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 4(a) of ERISA extends ERISA coverage to \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>employee benefit plan\u201d maintained by an employer or union that affects interstate commerce. Section 4(b)(3) exempts from ERISA, <em>inter alia, </em>benefit plans \u201cmaintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable ... disability insurance laws.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-4\">3. <em>Federal law relating to employer-employee relations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">The RLA, enacted in 1926, regulates labor relations of interstate rail carriers, and is made applicable to air carriers by 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 181. The RLA is designed to promote the collective bargaining process, and generally permits the parties to collective bargaining to agree upon whatever terms are mutually satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-17\">B. <em>The Airlines\u2019 Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-18\">Plaintiffs contend that from December 20,1976, when the HRL was first interpreted more broadly than Title VII, until April 29,1979, when Title VII became as broad as the HRL, the HRL could not lawfully be applied to their employee benefit plans. Their principal contention is that because the HRL \u201crelate[s] to\u201d employee benefits plans within the meaning of ERISA \u00a7 514(a), that statute preempted the HRL during the above period, and thus relieved plaintiffs of any obligation to comply with it. In addition they argue that the RLA supersedes the HRL under general principles of federal labor law preemption, and that the inclusion of pregnancy benefits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>its disability plan pursuant to the HRL during that period would have constituted sex discrimination against male employees in violation of Title VII.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">Plaintiffs similarly contend that the DBL is preempted or superseded by ERISA, RLA and Title VII, but their challenge is not limited to the same period. Because the DBL imposes a specific minimum level of benefits for disability due to pregnancy (whereas the HRL requires only that pregnancy be treated the same as other disabilities), the DBL\u2019s command is not congruent with that of Title VII. Accordingly, plaintiffs argue that the DBL amendment was invalid from its effective date, August 3, 1977, to the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">C. <em>The District Court\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"Asl\">The district court entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their claim that the HRL was preempted by ERISA, and enjoined enforcement of the HRL with respect to their employee benefit plans. In so ruling, the court relied on <em>Pervel Industries, Inc. v. Connecticut Comm'n on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>468 F.Supp. 490 (D.Conn.1978), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>603 F.2d 214 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1031, 100 S.Ct. 701, 62 L.Ed.2d 667 (1980), in which this Court affirmed by summary order a ruling of then-District Judge Newman that ERISA \u00a7 514(a) preempted a Connecticut statute that is quite similar to the HRL. The court found it unnecessary to pass on the airlines\u2019 RLA and Title VII arguments concerning the HRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">As to the DBL, the court rejected all of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court found that any provision of a benefit plan maintained in compliance with the DBL would be exempted from ERISA coverage by virtue of ERISA \u00a7 4(b)(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(b)(3), so that the preemption provisions of \u00a7 514(a) were inapplicable to the DBL. As to the RLA, the court held that the DBL regulated activity in which there was a \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d local interest and therefore fell within an exception to the general rule that federal labor laws preempt state laws impinging on the collective bargaining process. Finally, relying on <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, supra, </em>and <em>City of Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power v. Manhart, </em>435 U.S. 702, 98 S.Ct. 1370, 55 L.Ed.2d 657 (1978), the court held that the DBL did not conflict with, and thus was not preempted by, federal antidiscrimination laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">The Commissioner appeals from the district court\u2019s order invalidating the HRL; the airlines cross-appeal from the order upholding the DBL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">II. ENFORCEABILITY OF THE HRL</p>\n<p id=\"AASO\">We consider first plaintiffs\u2019 claims that federal law forbade enforcement of the HRL. For the reasons below, we conclude that the HRL was not preempted by ERISA, or Title VII, or the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-11\">A. <em>HRL and ERISA</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3H\">We turn first to the question of the validity of the HRL under \u00a7 514(a) of ERISA. Although at first glance our summary affirmance in the <em>Pervel </em>case, discussed above, would seem to require us to find the HRL invalid, equally summary action from another quarter compels a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-12\">After the decision below was rendered, the United States Supreme Court dismissed, for want of a substantial federal question, appeals from decisions of two state courts, each holding that ERISA \u00a7 514(a) does not preempt state laws similar to the HRL. <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Minnesota, </em>444 U.S. 1041, 100 S.Ct. 725, 62 L.Ed.2d 726 (1980), <em>dismissing appeal from </em>289 N.W.2d 396 (Minn. 1979) (hereinafter <em>\u201cMinnesota\u201d); Mountain States Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Commissioner of Labor &amp; Industry, </em>445 U.S. 921, 100 S.Ct. 1304, 63 L.Ed.2d 754 (1980), <em>dismissing appeal from </em>608 P.2d 1047 (Mont.1979) (hereinafter <em>\u201cMountain </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number><em>States\u201d). </em>The Commissioner here contends that <em>Minnesota </em>and <em>Mountain States </em>require us to hold that ERISA does not preempt the HRL, despite our contrary holding, relied on below, with respect to a comparable Connecticut statute in <em>Pervel, supra. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">It is well-established that Supreme Court summary affirmances and dismissals for want of a substantial federal question are judgments on the merits that bind lower courts with respect to the \u201cprecise issues presented [to the Supreme Court] and necessarily decided\u201d by it in disposing of the appeal. <em>Mandel v. Bradley, </em>432 U.S. 173, 176, 97 S.Ct. 2238, 2240, 53 L.Ed.2d 199 (1977) (per curiam). <em>See also Illinois State Board of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, </em>440 U.S. 173, 182-83, 99 S.Ct. 983, 989-90, 59 L.Ed.2d 230 (1979); <em>Washington v. Confederated Bands &amp; Tribes of the Yakima Indian Nation, </em>439 U.S. 463, 477-78 n.20, 99 S.Ct. 740, 749-50 n.20, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979); <em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. 332, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975). In attempting to apply the rule resulting from such a summary decision, however, lower courts must undertake a careful analysis of the precise \u201creach and content\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s action. <em>Mandel v. Bradley, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 176, 97 S.Ct. at 2240 (quoting <em>Hicks v. Miranda, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 345 n.14, 95 S.Ct. at 2289 n.14). Such summary dispositions affirm only the judgment of the court below and do not necessarily adopt its reasoning. <em>Illinois State Board of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, supra; Mandel v. Bradley, supra. </em>Thus, a court seeking to apply such a precedent must carefully examine the appellant\u2019s jurisdictional statement in order to determine which questions the Supreme Court necessarily decided. <em>Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, supra; Mandel v. Bradley, supra; Hicks v. Miranda, supra. </em>Applying this analysis to the dismissal in the <em>Minnesota </em>case, we conclude that it compels a holding that ERISA does not preempt the HRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">In <em>Minnesota, </em>an employee who had been denied benefits for pregnancy-related disability sued her employer under a state law that explicitly required employers to treat pregnancy the same as other disabling conditions for purposes of disability benefits plans. The state court held that the employer\u2019s disability program violated state law, and further held that ERISA \u00a7 514(a) did not preempt the state statute. 289 N.W.2d 396.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In its jurisdictional statement on appeal to the Supreme Court, the employer framed the question presented as whether ERISA \u201cpreempts Minnesota\u2019s effort, by means of its fair employment practice statute, to dictate the contents of [the employer\u2019s] national employee benefit plan.\u201d The jurisdictional statement as a whole presented arguments, substantially similar to those presented by the plaintiffs here, to the effect that \u00a7 514(a) preempted the Minnesota law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-9\">We can see no sound reason to decline to follow <em>Minnesota </em>here. The state statute at issue in that case is virtually identical to the HRL.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the ERISA preemption issue was squarely presented to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>Supreme Court in the appeal papers, and the appeal was plainly within the Supreme Court\u2019s obligatory appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(2) (1976). We can discern no possible basis for the <em>Minnesota </em>dismissal other than a holding that ERISA does not preempt a state law requiring that disability benefits plans treat pregnancy the same as other disabling conditions. Therefore, <em>Minnesota </em>requires us to uphold the HRL against the ERISA challenge mounted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments for a contrary course are unpersuasive. For the most part, plaintiffs reiterate the Supreme Court\u2019s cautionary remarks about the danger of reading summary decisions too broadly, citing, e. <em>g., Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, supra, </em>440 U.S. at 183, 99 S.Ct. at 990. While we have recognized this danger in our own decisions, <em>see, e. g., New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>566 F.2d 388, 391 n.2 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>440 U.S. 519, 99 S.Ct. 1328, 59 L.Ed.2d 553 (1979); <em>In re Letourneau, </em>559 F.2d 892, 893 n.4 (2d Cir. 1977), our analysis has satisfied us that the issue presented in the instant case is virtually identical to that decided in <em>Minnesota. </em>Moreover, while it is true, as plaintiffs note, that summary actions carry less precedential weight in the Supreme Court than do decisions rendered with opinion after argument, <em>see, e. g., Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, supra, </em>439 U.S. at 476-77 n.20, 99 S.Ct. at 749-50 n.20; <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 670-71, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1359-60, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), it is also true that \u201cthe privilege of disregarding even summary Supreme Court holdings rests with that court alone,\u201d and not with us. <em>Doe v. Hodgson, </em>500 F.2d 1206, 1207-08 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that the timing of the <em>Minnesota </em>dismissal weakens its precedential force. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in <em>Minnesota </em>exactly one week after it had denied certiorari in both <em>Pervel, supra, </em>in which we summarily struck down under ERISA a Connecticut pregnancy benefits law, and <em>Bucyrus-Erie Co. v. Department of Industry, Labor &amp; Human Relations, </em>599 F.2d 205 (7th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1031, 100 S.Ct. 701, 62 L.Ed.2d 667 (1980), in which the Seventh Circuit, taking the opposite view, rejected an ERISA-based challenge to a similar Wisconsin statute. Because the Court let stand these divergent circuit court rulings at a time when it could easily have remanded them for further consideration in light of the forthcoming affirmance in <em>Minnesota, </em>plaintiffs conclude that the Justices did not intend \u201cto create a unified body of precedent on the ERISA preemption issue,\u201d Brief on Appeal at 14, and that <em>Pervel </em>therefore retains its vitality in this Circuit, <em>Minnesota </em>notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">We reject this contention. Like the plaintiffs, we find the sequence of events described above rather mystifying. Nonetheless, it remains the law that dismissals of appeals are binding precedents, while denials of certiorari have no precedential force. <em>Compare Hicks v. Miranda, supra, with Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., </em>338 U.S. 912, 70 S.Ct. 252, 94 L.Ed. 562 (1950) (opinion of Frankfurter, J., with respect to denial of certiorari). <em>See generally </em>R. Stern &amp; E. Gressman, Supreme Court Practice \u00a7\u00a7 4.31, 5.7 (5th ed. 1978); Linzer, <em>The Meaning of Certiorari Denials, </em>79 Colum.L.Rev. 1227 (1979). Although courts have sometimes disregarded the latter rule on the ground that special circumstances surrounding a particular denial of certiorari revealed the Justices\u2019 view of the merits, see Linzer, <em>supra, </em>at 1277-91, we see no reason for such an undertaking here, where the denials have tended more to obscure than to illuminate the Court\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">Accordingly, we hold that the HRL was not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-12\">B. <em>HRL and Title VII</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-13\">We turn next to the airlines\u2019 contention that Title VII<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> preempted the HRL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>during the periods at issue here. Title VII forbids employers to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against their employees \u201cbecause of ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), (2). Generally speaking, the statute prohibits not only those employment practices designed to discriminate on proscribed grounds, but also those facially neutral practices that have the effect of discriminating on such grounds.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See generally Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971). Plaintiffs argue that by compelling employers to provide disability benefits for their pregnant employees, all of whom are necessarily female, the HRL mandated discrimination against <em>male </em>employees \u201cbecause of .. . [their] sex,\u201d in violation of Title VII. If the HRL mandated discrimination that was unlawful under Title VII during the relevant time period, then, of course, it was invalid under the Supremacy Clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We hold, however, that the HRL was entirely lawful under Title VII.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">In contending that the HRL contravened Title VII, the airlines rely primarily on <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, supra, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that the exclusion of pregnancy from coverage under a disability plan did not discriminate against women in violation of Title VII. In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that the \u201cpackage\u201d of fringe benefits provided under the employer\u2019s plan was \u201cfacially nondiscriminatory in the sense that \u2018[t]here is no risk from which men are protected and women are not.\u2019\u201d 429 U.S. at 138, 97 S.Ct. at 409, quoting <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 496-97, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 2491-92, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974) <em>(see </em>note 4 <em>supra). </em>In addition, the Court noted that the plan did not have a discriminatory effect upon women:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-7\">As there is no proof that the package [of insurance benefits] is in fact worth more to men than to women, it is impossible to find any gender-based discriminatory effect in this scheme simply because women disabled as a result of pregnancy do not receive benefits; that is to say, gender-based discrimination does not result simply because an employer\u2019s disability-benefits plan is less than all-inclusive.... [P]regnancy-related disabilities constitute an <em>additional </em>risk, unique to women, and the failure to compensate them for this risk does not destroy the presumed parity of the benefits, accruing to men and women alike, which results from the facially evenhanded <em>inclusion </em>of risks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">429 U.S. at 138-39, 97 S.Ct. at 409-10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-9\">From the quoted language, the airlines derive their two principal arguments. First, they argue that the pre-1979 inclusion of pregnancy as a covered condition under their disability plans would have been unlawful under Title VII because it would have destroyed the plans\u2019 \u201cfacially evenhanded inclusion of risks.\u201d Second, they contend that the provision of pregnancy benefits would render the \u201cpackage\u201d of benefits under a plan more valuable to women than to men, so that the plan would have the unlawful effect of discriminating against men in their compensation because of their sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-10\">The airlines\u2019 first argument is easily disposed of. That <em>Gilbert </em>held the exclusion of pregnancy benefits to be nondiscriminatory does not compel the conclusion that the inclusion of such benefits is necessarily discriminatory. The <em>Gilbert </em>Court itself, quoting <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, supra, </em>417 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>U.S. at 496-97 n.20, 94 S.Ct. at 2491-92 n.20, explicitly observed that classifications based on pregnancy are not facially discriminatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-4\">Absent a showing that distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other, lawmakers are constitutionally free to include or exclude pregnancy from the coverage of legislation such as this on any reasonable basis, just as with respect to any other physical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-5\">The lack of identity between the excluded disability and gender as such under this insurance program becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis. The program divides potential recipients into two groups \u2014 pregnant women and non-pregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">429 U.S. at 134-35, 97 S.Ct. at 407-08. Therefore, the inclusion of pregnancy benefits is no more \u201cdiscriminatory per se\u201d than was their exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">To evaluate plaintiffs\u2019 second argument, that a disability plan complying with the HRL has a discriminatory effect upon men, we must review the allegations of the complaint. The airlines alleged, and we must therefore accept as true for these purposes, that the disability benefits provided their male and female employees during the relevant period were \u201cfairly equivalent in value in terms of dollar benefits paid per salary dollar,\u201d and that their employees were \u201ccovered equally under the [disability] plans,\u201d regardless of sex, for all disabilities unrelated to pregnancy. They alleged further that the provision of pregnancy benefits pursuant to the HRL would have increased the value of the disability \u201cpackage\u201d to women without providing a corresponding increase to men. Therefore, plaintiffs conclude, the New York statutes had the unlawful effect of mandating discrimination against men on the basis of their sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-10\">This argument is unfounded. Although we must accept plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations as true, we need not assume the truth of conclusions of law or unwarranted factual inferences that they have pleaded. <em>See generally </em>2A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 12.08, at 2266-69 (2d ed. 1980). The airlines\u2019 characterization of the \u201cvalue\u201d of disability benefits to their employees falls into the latter category. The \u201cvalue\u201d of a disability plan as an item of compensation for ' an individual worker is not the amount of benefits payable to that worker in the event of disability. Rather, it is the worker\u2019s pro rata share of the total cost of providing disability coverage, which in turn equals the sum of the plan\u2019s total payout and expenses.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have not alleged that the HRL would require male employees to pay greater individual pro rata shares of the total cost of coverage. The increase in total cost occasioned by the inclusion of pregnancy benefits, and the corresponding increase in the plan\u2019s value as an item of compensation, is uniformly spread among all employees. Because this increase is uniform for all, it can hardly be said to have a discriminatory effect upon men. <em>Cf. City of Los Angeles Dep't of Water &amp; Power v. Manhart, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1364-11\">Similarly, we reject the airlines\u2019 contention that a plan complying with the HRL has a discriminatory effect upon men because they will never receive the pregnancy benefits for which they have paid. Large numbers of women will be equally empty-handed. Under the HRL, all workers bear the cost of payments to the comparatively few who become disabled through pregnancy. The cost of these benefits does not depend upon the number of women in the employer\u2019s labor force, but upon the number of women who become pregnant. The latter variable is not a function solely of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>their sex, as the airlines would have it, but as well of age and marital status.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In short, the HRL did not require employers to discriminate against men on the basis of their sex and was therefore not unlawful under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">C. <em>HRL and the RLA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">Finally, we consider the airlines\u2019 contention that the HRL was preempted by the RLA.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The RLA governs the collective bargaining agreements between the airlines and their employees pursuant to which the disability plans at issue here were established. Plaintiffs argue that by mandating pregnancy coverage not otherwise available under its collective bargaining agreements, the HRL unlawfully alters the terms of those agreements and impermissibly interferes with the collective bargaining processes established by the RLA. We disagree.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">In <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959), the Supreme Court set forth the basic framework of analysis for questions of federal labor law preemption. First, \u201c[w]hen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate\u201d are either protected or proscribed by federal law, then \u201cdue regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 79 S.Ct. at 779. Second, even if a state law touches upon conduct arguably governed by the federal scheme, the state may nevertheless regulate that conduct if it is \u201ca merely peripheral concern\u201d of the federal law, or if it involves \u201cinterests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, [the court] could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243-44, 79 S.Ct. at 778-79 (footnote omitted). Courts must carefully examine both the state interest in regulating the conduct at issue and the potential for interference with the federal regime. <em>Farmer v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters, Local 25, </em>430 U.S. 290, 297, 300-01, 97 S.Ct. 1056, 1061, 1063-64, 51 L.Ed.2d 338 (1977). Ultimately, however, the question is one of congressional intent. <em>Garmon, supra, </em>359 U.S. at 239-40, 79 S.Ct. at 776-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-10\">At the outset, the airlines raise a contention that would divert us from this task of statutory analysis. Relying upon <em>Railway Employees' Dep't v. Hanson, </em>351 U.S. 225, 76 S.Ct. 714, 100 L.Ed. 1112 (1956), and <em>California v. Taylor, </em>353 U.S. 553, 77 S.Ct. 1037, 1 L.Ed.2d 1034 (1957), they argue that the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, by themselves, override the HRL. Quoting <em>Hanson, </em>plaintiffs assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1365-11\">A union agreement made pursuant to the Railway Labor Act has .. . the imprimatur of the federal law upon it and, by force of the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution, could not be made illegal nor vitiated by any provision of the laws of a State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1365-12\">351 U.S. at 232, 76 S.Ct. at 718. <em>See also Taylor, supra, </em>353 U.S. at 561, 77 S.Ct. at 1042 (RLA collective bargaining agreement \u201cwould take precedence over conflicting provisions\u201d of state law). Because the air<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>lines\u2019 collective bargaining agreements were negotiated pursuant to the RLA, they contend that the agreements themselves supersede state law, so that New York was powerless to require the insertion, through the HRL, of terms concerning disability benefits that the parties themselves had omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\"><em>Hanson </em>and <em>Taylor </em>do not stand for so sweeping a proposition. <em>Hanson </em>involved the application of a state \u201cright to work\u201d law, which forbade agreements requiring employees to join a union, to a collective bargaining agreement that contained an express \u201cunion shop\u201d clause requiring union membership. The RLA expressly permitted unions to negotiate such union shop agreements \u201c[njotwithstanding any ... statute or law ... of any State.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (Eleventh). The essential point was that the state law conflicted with the terms of the RLA itself, not merely with an agreement negotiated under the RLA. <em>Taylor </em>involved an attempt by state authorities to subject employees of a state-owned railroad to the state civil service law, which forbade collective bargaining, despite the fact that the employees were then covered by a collective bargaining agreement negotiated with the state pursuant to the RLA. The Court held that the RLA applied to the state as employer, and that its conflicting civil service laws were therefore preempted. 353 U.S. at 561-68, 77 S.Ct. at 1042-46. As the <em>Taylor </em>Court\u2019s discussion of <em>Hanson </em>makes plain, the existing collective bargaining agreement would \u201ctake precedence over\u201d the state civil service laws because those laws were invalid, as applied to the railroad, under the RLA itself. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61, 77 S.Ct. at 1041-42. We must therefore determine the validity of the New York statute by ascertaining the intent of Congress, not merely by perusing the airlines\u2019 agreements with their workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">Nothing in the RLA clearly addresses the permissibility of state regulation such as the HRL. Among other things, the RLA places upon employers a duty to bargain, empowers employees to organize and select representatives, establishes administrative bodies for the resolution of disputes, and prescribes certain rules concerning union security agreements, dues check-offs, and the like. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 152, 153, 154. With very few exceptions, it permits parties to collective bargaining to adopt whatever terms are mutually satisfactory. We must therefore scrutinize the New York statutes in terms of their potential for interfering with the federal scheme and the strength of the state interests they reflect. <em>See, e. g., Garmon, supra; Farmer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">The RLA protects and vigorously promotes the collective bargaining process. <em>See, e. g., Taylor, supra, </em>353 U.S. at 559, 77 S.Ct. at 1040, and cases cited. Thus, the airlines\u2019 most telling argument against the HRL is that it impermissibly curbs the parties\u2019 freedom to bargain over fringe benefits, a concededly valuable item of compensation. As the airlines note, \u201c[t]he inclusion or noninclusion of a substantial economic benefit in a collectively bargained compensation package goes to the heart of the bargaining process.\u201d (Brief on Appeal at 38). Moreover, it is generally true that state laws designed to alter the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, <em>see Lodge 76, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, </em>427 U.S. 132, 153, 96 S.Ct. 2548, 2559, 49 L.Ed.2d 396 (1976), or to adjust the economic relations of parties to collective bargaining, <em>see Local 24, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Oliver, </em>358 U.S. 283, 297, 79 S.Ct. 297, 305, 3 L.Ed.2d 312 (1959), are inconsistent with federal policies protecting the bargaining process. At first glance, therefore, the HRL does seem to intrude impermissibly upon an area that Congress has reserved for private negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">Nonetheless, closer inspection of the complex of state and federal interests at stake persuades us that the HRL is fully valid under the RLA. First, it is consistent with prevailing federal policies concerning employment relations. The RLA, like other federal labor statutes, does not address the problem of employment discrimination. <em>Colorado Anti-Discrimination Comm'n v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., </em>372 U.S. 714, 83 S.Ct. 1022, 10 L.Ed.2d 84 (1963). <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number><em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974) (Title VII remedies operate independently of arbitration process established under collective bargaining agreement). Thus the fact that state antidiscrimination laws have some effect on collective bargaining under the RLA does not automatically invalidate them. We must look to other federal laws that govern employment discrimination in order to gauge their harmony with the overall federal scheme. <em>Cf. Malone v. White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 504-05, 98 S.Ct. 1185, 1189-90, 55 L.Ed.2d 443 (1978) (federal pension legislation provides \u201cfar more reliable\u201d guide to legislative intent than does the National Labor Relations Act in determining validity of state statute affecting pension plan established by collective bargaining). Title VII, the principal federal employment discrimination law, indicates that the HRL is and was in accordance with the federal scheme. Although the practices prohibited by the state statute were not prohibited by Title VII prior to its amendment in 1978, <em>see General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, supra, </em>Title VII permits the states to adopt antidiscrimination measures more stringent than its own, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-7, and vigorous enforcement of state fair employment laws by state agencies is an integral part of the federal scheme, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b), (c), (d), (e). The HRL is precisely the sort of state law that Congress had in mind. It provides protections beyond the federal minimum and establishes orderly administrative procedures for enforcing those protections. Thus, far from offending the principal federal regime in point, the HRL actually promoted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">Furthermore, the statute reflects strong state interests and policies. As Title VII itself recognizes, the states have an abiding interest in eradicating employment discrimination. Title VII permits the states to act not only against forms of discrimination that have afflicted the nation as a whole, but also against those that are peculiarly local in character or peculiarly harmful in their local effects. New York has decided that the denial of certain minimum benefits for workers disabled by pregnancy contravenes its own policy of sheltering women from the economic dislocations otherwise attendant upon childbirth. <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Co., supra; Union Free School District No. 6 v. New York State Human Rights Appeal Board, </em>35 N.Y.2d 371, 362 N.Y.S.2d 139, 320 N.E.2d 859 (1974). Nothing in that choice offends the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the HRL was not preempted by the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-9\">III. ENFORCEABILITY OF THE DBL</p>\n<p id=\"ATi\">We turn finally to the question whether federal law forbids enforcement of the DBL with respect to the airlines\u2019 employee benefit plans. While we agree with the district court\u2019s view that neither Title VII nor the RLA preempts the DBL, we are constrained to conclude that the DBL may well be preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-10\">A. <em>DBL and Title VII</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">In rejecting the airlines\u2019 contention that the DBL is preempted by Title VII, the district court took the view that the DBL does not create a sex-based classification by mandating minimum benefits for pregnancy-related disability, and that it does not have the prohibited effect of compelling employers to compensate employees at different rates on the basis of their sex. 485 F.Supp. at 309-11. We agree. Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions with regard to the DBL are substantively identical to their arguments with regard to the HRL,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and our discussion in Part II.B. above as to why Title VII did not preempt the HRL applies with equal force to the DBL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-12\">B. <em>DBL and the RLA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-13\">In rejecting the airlines\u2019 contention that the DBL is preempted by the RLA, the district court reasoned that the DBL reflects a state interest in eliminating sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>discrimination that is \u201cso deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility\u201d that Congress could not have intended to preempt it. 485 F.Supp. at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Although we agree with the airlines that the DBL is not necessarily a law of the sort \u201cso deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility\u201d as to fall within the second exception of <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, supra; cf. Lodge 76, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 137 n.2, 96 S.Ct. at 2551 n.2 (\u201clocal interest\u201d exception predicated on state\u2019s power over \u201csuch traditionally local matters as public safety and order and the use of streets and highways\u201d), our agreement does not mean that plaintiffs\u2019 RLA contention should be upheld. The local interest exception applies only when the disputed state law governs conduct that comes within the ambit of federal labor law. For the reasons we have discussed in Part II.C. above with respect to the HRL, we conclude that the DBL governs matters outside the intended reach of the RLA and that the RLA therefore does not preempt the DBL.</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">C. <em>The DBL and ERISA</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-MW\">We turn finally to the question whether the DBL is preempted by ERISA. We do not consider this issue to be foreclosed in the Board\u2019s favor by our holding above concerning the validity of the HRL under ERISA. Unlike the HRL and the state statutes upheld against ERISA preemption in <em>Minnesota </em>and <em>Mountain States, supra, </em>the DBL does not merely forbid employers to discriminate against workers disabled through pregnancy, but instead affirmatively requires employers to provide minimum pregnancy benefits. Because the DBL thus differs from the \u201cpure\u201d antidiscrimination laws upheld in <em>Minnesota </em>and <em>Mountain States, </em>those decisions are not controlling with respect to it, and we must make an independent review of its validity. <em>Cf. Mandel </em>v. <em>Bradley, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 176, 97 S.Ct. at 2240.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">Nor is the issue of ERISA preemption foreclosed by our analysis of the validity of the HRL and DBL under the RLA. It is true that ERISA does not address problems of sex discrimination any more than does the RLA, so that the analysis of state and federal interests presented with respect to the RLA would apply with equal force to ERISA, absent any other indications of congressional intent. Unlike any provision of the RLA, however, ERISA \u00a7 514(a) explicitly addresses the preemption question. Thus, in considering that question, we cannot rely solely upon the general policy considerations which lead us to uphold the HRL and DBL under the RLA. Instead, we must seek to divine the intent of Congress as expressed in \u00a7 514(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">The airlines\u2019 principal contention is that insofar as the DBL requires employers to provide minimum benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities, it \u201crelate[s] to\u201d employee benefit plans within the meaning of \u00a7 514(a) of ERISA and is therefore invalid.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s principal response is that the DBL does not \u201crelate to\u201d such plans in the manner Congress contemplated, so that \u00a7 514(a) is inapplicable to it. The district court did not rule on this question; it held instead that ERISA \u00a7 4(b)(3) exempted the disputed portions of the airlines\u2019 plans from regulation under ERISA, so that ERISA \u00a7 514(a) had no bearing on the case. Our own views, however, compel us to begin with the proper construction of \u00a7 514(a). We agree with the plaintiffs that the section is broad enough to encompass the DBL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">Section 514(a) explicitly preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Despite the apparent all-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>inclusiveness of this language, the Board argues that only laws governing ERISA\u2019s own subject matter \u2014 funding, vesting, disclosure, and the like \u2014 actually \u201crelate to\u201d benefit plans in the manner Congress intended. Because the DBL addresses only the level of benefits provided, a matter ungoverned by ERISA, the Board contends that \u00a7 514(a) is inapplicable to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Our review of the legislative history leads us to conclude that the statute is as sweeping as it seems. As other courts have noted, the legislative history of ERISA supports a broad reading of the phrase \u201crelate^] to\u201d in \u00a7 514(a). The preemption provisions of the bills that preceded ERISA applied only to state laws that regulated ERISA\u2019s specific subject matters. <em>See </em>H.R. 2, \u00a7 514(a), (c), 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), <em>reprinted in </em>120 Cong.Rec. 4742 (1974) (House version); H.R. 2, \u00a7 699(a), 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), <em>reprinted in </em>120 Cong.Rec. 5002 (1974) (Senate version). The present language of \u00a7 514(a) was adopted by the Conference Committee, whose report indicated that the provision was as broad as its language. H.R.Conf. Rep. No. 93-1280, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 383, <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 4639, 5038, 5162. Statements in both Houses of Congress emphasized the breadth of federal preemption. <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. 29197 (1974) (remarks of Rep. Dent) (\u00a7 514(a) \u201creservfes] to Federal authority the sole power to regulate the field of employee benefit plans\u201d; conferees applied preemption principle \u201cin its broadest sense\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 29933 (remarks of Sen. Williams) (\u00a7 514(a) \u201cintended to preempt the field for Federal regulations\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 29942 (remarks of Sen. Javits) (conference version adopted to avoid litigation concerning scope of narrower provisions of predecessor bills). Thus, most courts of appeals that have considered the issue have held that the phrase \u201crelates to\u201d in \u00a7 514(a) does not limit the provision to those state laws that are directed toward ERISA\u2019s subject matter. <em>See Buczynski v. General Motors Corp., </em>616 F.2d 1238, 1250 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. </em>granted, - U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 352, 66 L.Ed.2d 213 (1980); <em>Wadsworth v.

A state law \u201crelate[s] to\u201d employee benefit plans, and is thus subject to preemption, whenever it has a direct bearing on such plans, not merely when it parallels the federal scheme for regulating them.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> By prescribing minimum plan benefits, the DBL plainly \u201crelate[s] to\u201d employee benefit plans in the manner contemplated under \u00a7 514(a). Therefore, it may be preempted under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">That the DBL provisions are within the purview of \u00a7 514(a), however, does not necessarily mean that they are preempted, for \u00a7 514(a) excepts from preemption state laws that \u201crelate to\u201d benefit plans that are themselves exempted from coverage under ERISA by ERISA \u00a7 4(b).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Section 4(b)(3) exempts from ERISA coverage any \u201cplan\u201d that is \u201cmaintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable ... disability insurance laws.\u201d The Board contends that the DBL is exempted from preemption by this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>The Board\u2019s argument begins with the premises, not challenged here, that the pregnancy provisions of the DBL are \u201cdisability insurance laws\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4(b)(3), and that the airlines would not provide pregnancy benefits for their employees if they were not compelled to do so by the DBL. Thus, the Board contends, any portions of the airlines\u2019 benefits plans devoted to pregnancy benefits would be maintained \u201csolely\u201d for purposes of complying with the DBL. If this is so, the argument continues, then these portions of the plans are exempt from regulation under ERISA by virtue of \u00a7 4(b)(3). If they are exempt under \u00a7 4(b), then the DBL continues to govern them, notwithstanding \u00a7 514(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">This argument assumes that the word \u201cplan\u201d as used in \u00a7 4(b)(3) can be read to mean either a whole plan or a portion of a plan, such as the specific pregnancy provisions the Board seeks to impose upon the airlines. In ruling for the Board on this issue, the district court accepted this assumption. Reasoning that ERISA contemplates \u201cindependent and concurrent obligations\u201d under federal and state law, the court held that \u201cthose provisions of an employee plan which are maintained to comply with [state disability insurance] laws are excluded from ERISA.\u201d 485 F.Supp. at 307. In attacking the district court's ruling, the airlines argue that \u201cplan\u201d must mean a benefits plan in its entirety, and that their \u201cplan[s]\u201d were adopted largely for competitive reasons, not \u201csolely\u201d to comply with the DBL. In the airlines\u2019 view, \u00a7 4(b)(3) was intended to exempt small, intrastate employers whose \u201cplan[s]\u201d are designed only to meet the minimum requirements of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">We think the district court took an unduly expansive view of the role that ERISA assigns to state law in governing employee benefit plans. As discussed above, ERISA contemplates a federal occupation of the regulatory field that is very nearly total. Section 514(a) was meant to clear away all state laws bearing on benefits plans, and the various exceptions to the general rule of federal preemption were meant to be \u201cnarrow.\u201d 120 Cong.Rec. 29933 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Williams); <em>id. </em>at 29197 (remarks of Rep. Dent). We recognize that many aspects of benefits plans generally, and of welfare benefits plans in particular, will go unregulated under this regime of broad preemption, and that \u00a7 514(a) may therefore permit abuses that Congress might otherwise have wished to avert. <em>See generally </em>Brummond, <em>Federal Preemption of State Insurance Regulation Under ERISA, </em>62 Iowa L.Rev. 57 (1976).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nonetheless, it is clear that Congress sought to. stay the states\u2019 hands, at least for a certain period, with the thought that \u201cappropriate modifications\u201d could be made if later shown to be needed. <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. 29942 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Javits). <em>See also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1222(a)(4); H.R.Conf.Rep.No.93-1280, <em>supra, </em>at 361, <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 5140 (Joint Pension Task Force to study \u201ceffects and desirability\u201d of ERISA preemption policy). Thus, ERISA ordinarily does not permit \u201cindependent and concurrent obligations\u201d under federal and state law. Under ERISA, federal law will govern, even in those instances where federal governance effectively means no governance, save where Congress has clearly declared otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">With these principles in mind, we conclude that the word \u201cplan\u201d as used in \u00a7 4(b)(3) refers to a plan as an integral unit, not to isolated and subsidiary provisions of a plan. The plain terms of the statute refer to \u201cplan[s](\u201d not to portions or provisions of a plan. Moreover, permitting the fragmentation of the term \u201cplan\u201d would disrupt the uniformity that Congress sought to achieve through \u00a7 514(a), allowing a state to remove specific disability provisions of a corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>plex benefits scheme from coverage under ERISA merely by legislating on a particular subject. For a nationwide employer, those provisions might be subject to New York\u2019s DBL, yet also subject to ERISA requirements in states without \u201capplicable . .. disability insurance laws,\u201d and subject to further, and probably conflicting, requirements imposed by other states that do have such laws. Congress could scarcely have intended to permit such successive layers of regulation to be imposed on certain portions of a plan otherwise subject in its entirety to ERISA alone. Thus we conclude that \u201cplan\u201d refers to an integral unit or program, not to selected provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">This does not necessarily mean that the airlines are entitled to relief against enforcement of the pregnancy provisions of the DBL. While we reject the argument that those provisions alone enable the Board to compel plaintiffs to provide minimum pregnancy benefits, the Board may be empowered to do so by the DBL as a whole. If a plaintiff\u2019s disability \u201cplan\u201d as a whole is maintained \u201csolely\u201d to comply with the requirements of the DBL as a whole, then that plan in its entirety would be exempted from ERISA under \u00a7 4(b)(3). With respect to such a plan, the Board would be free to enforce all provisions of the DBL, including those that govern pregnancy, \u00a7 514(a) notwithstanding. Because it is entirely possible that some or all of the plaintiffs do maintain disability \u201cplan[s]\u201d adopted \u201csolely\u201d to comply with the DBL, we must give content to those statutory terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">Nothing in the legislative history of ERISA explicitly addresses the purpose of the \u00a7 4(b)(3) exemption.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Congress\u2019s thought seems fairly clearly to have been that \u201cplan[s]\u201d adopted \u201csolely\u201d to comply with state social insurance laws were adequately regulated by state authorities and that state regulation of such plans would not unduly disrupt the ERISA scheme. In determining the meaning of the troublesome terms \u201cplan\u201d and \u201csolely,\u201d it will be helpful to examine the characteristics of the social insurance programs potentially affected by \u00a7 4(b)(3).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">Unemployment insurance systems function in substantially the same manner in \u25a0every state. Each state requires employers to contribute to a central unemployment fund. The fund is a state agency that superintends collections from employers and pays stated benefits to idled workers.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Some states permit employers to provide supplemental unemployment benefits through private arrangements, but such supplemental plans are wholly independent of the state fund. They provide benefits in addition to those available from the state fund and their establishment does not relieve the employer of his obligation to contribute to the state fund. <em>See generally </em>IB Unempl.Ins.Rep. (CCH) K 2300.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-11\">Workmen\u2019s compensation systems are more diverse. Some follow the pattern established by unemployment insurance legislation and permit an employer to satisfy his obligations under state law only by participation in a state-administered insurance fund. Others permit employers to choose between participation in the state fund and the establishment of equivalent coverage through private means, as by purchasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>insurance, establishing a trust or other fund, or maintaining a plan of self-insurance. Many states have no state fund and merely require employers to make satisfactory private arrangements. Where private arrangements are permitted, they are generally subject to review and approval by state authorities. . See <em>generally </em>4 A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 92.10 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">The comparatively few states that have disability insurance laws have varying requirements. One, Rhode Island, establishes participation in a state fund as the exclusive means of compliance. Most give employers the option to participate in a state-administered fund or to provide alternate private arrangements, subject to approval by state authorities. <em>See generally </em>4 A. Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 96.40, 97.42. New York falls into the latter mold. Employers may discharge their obligation to provide disability benefits by participating in a state fund that is financed by employer and employee contributions. N.Y.Work.Comp.Law \u00a7\u00a7 209, 210, 211(1), 214. Alternatively, employers may provide the required benefits through private insurance, a plan of self-insurance, or other \u201cplan or agreement,\u201d subject to the Board\u2019s approval. N.Y.Work.Comp.Law \u00a7 211(2), (3), (4), (5) (McKinney 1965 &amp; Supp.1980-1981). The Board will approve a private disability benefits program if it provides benefits \u201cat least as favorable\u201d to employees as those provided by the state fund. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 211(5); 12 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7\u00a7 375.1, 358-3.1 (regulations governing approval of alternate plans).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">It is relatively easy to see how Congress would classify the programs at the extreme ends of this spectrum of social insurance schemes. At one end of the spectrum are employers whom the state compels to participate in state-administered funds as the exclusive means of providing protection for their employees. In this situation, state regulation is quite comprehensive and presumably suffices to protect workers\u2019 interests. In addition, the centralization of the state\u2019s regime sharply diminishes its potential for disrupting the federal scheme under ERISA. Thus, when the state compels participation in a state-administered fund, the policies of the \u00a7 4(b)(3) exemption are fully satisfied. In the language of \u00a7 4(b)(3), the employer\u2019s program for complying with such a state law will constitute his \u201cplan,\u201d and that plan will have been adopted \u201csolely\u201d to comply with the state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">At the opposite end of the spectrum are employers who provide a type of benefit commonly associated with social insurance schemes, but who do so voluntarily, with no compulsion by the state. Because such programs are not closely supervised by the state, they are far more susceptible to abuse than are compulsory, state-administered programs. Moreover, because such voluntary programs are typically part of a complex benefits scheme established through collective bargaining, state efforts to regulate them pose a significant risk of conflict with ERISA requirements. The policies of \u00a7 4(b)(3) do not apply to such programs, and \u00a7 514(a) would ordinarily preempt state laws purporting to regulate them. Particularly because state law does not compel employers to establish programs of this sort, it would be sensible to say, in the language of \u00a7 4(b)(3), that such programs are not maintained \u201csolely\u201d to comply with state laws, even if they do constitute separate \u201cplan[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">The troublesome cases, falling in the middle of the spectrum, arise when state laws compel an employer to maintain <em>some </em>program, but permit him to satisfy this obligation through private arrangements that may vary from, and exceed, the state-mandated norms. In such cases, the nature and scope of the program sought to be regulated by state authorities will largely determine whether state regulation comports with ERISA policies. If the employer's program for providing the particular benefit comprises a separate administrative unit, as where an employer insures his employees against disability through a single group policy or establishes a separate disability trust, then state authorities can adequately police that unit without affecting federal authority to regulate programs for other types of benefits. If, however, the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>er\u2019s program encompasses types of benefits besides those reserved to state authority under \u00a7 4(b)(3), and if the various benefits are administered through a single vehicle, then state regulation may quickly run afoul of federal policies. The unit selected by the employer for administering the complex benefits scheme would be subject to state requirements insofar as it provided benefits enumerated in \u00a7 4(b)(3), but subject to federal requirements insofar as it provided other types of benefits. As we noted above, ERISA does not permit such regulatory disharmony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\">Thus, we think that the word \u201cplan\u201d as used in \u00a7 4(b)(3) must refer to a benefits program as an integral administrative unit. If an employer, using a single administrative unit, provides disability benefits as part of a larger welfare scheme, comprising, for example, health insurance as well as disability benefits, then that scheme as a whole constitutes the employer\u2019s \u201cplan.\u201d Because such a plan provides types of benefits that the states cannot permissibly require under \u00a7 514(a), the plan could not be said to be maintained \u201csolely\u201d to comply with state disability insurance laws. On the other hand, if an employer\u2019s disability program constitutes a separate unit, concerned predominantly with disability benefits and organized so that it is substantially independent of other benefits programs, then that program itself constitutes a \u201cplan.\u201d Such a plan is potentially subject to state regulation under a law like the DBL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">Most disability programs that constitute separate \u201cplan[s]\u201d will have been adopted \u201csolely\u201d to comply with state disability insurance laws applicable to the employer. The airlines\u2019 argument that the employer\u2019s intentions are dispositive in determining this issue proves too much. Any employer, even the small intrastate employer at whom the airlines contend \u00a7 4(b)(3) was aimed, could credibly claim that it had adopted a disability plan in order to attract and keep good employees, smooth labor relations, and the like. Congress did not intend \u00a7 4(b)(3) to empower employers to evade state regulation by engaging in a swearing contest concerning their motives. Structural considerations, not subjective intentions, must govern the analysis under \u00a7 4(b)(3). Thus, if an employer maintains a separate disability plan that generally meets the requirements of applicable state disability insurance laws, the court should find that the plan was adopted \u201csolely\u201d to comply with those laws, unless compelling circumstances, not applicable to employers generally, dictate otherwise. <em>See Standard Oil Co. v. Agsalud, </em>442 F.Supp. 695, 704 (N.D.Cal.1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>633 F.2d 760 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">Turning to the case before us, we note that the airlines\u2019 amended complaint did not clearly describe their benefits plans. It stated in general terms that \u201c[p]laintiffs maintain various employee benefit plans, including sickness and accident disability plans, sick leave plans, and medical benefit plans,\u201d and that these plans \u201care funded and administered in several different ways.\u201d It is possible that some or all of the plaintiffs maintain disability benefits programs that are \u201cplan[s]\u201d maintained \u201csolely\u201d to comply with state law under the analysis presented above. Such plans would be exempt from regulation under ERISA and would be subject to the DBL in its entirety, including its provisions governing minimum pregnancy benefits. Such plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief against the Board. Other plaintiffs, however, may maintain more complex benefits systems that do not employ a separate \u201cplan\u201d for disability. The DBL is preempted in its entirety with respect to such plaintiffs, and is wholly unenforceable against them.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Each plaintiff must have an opportunity to show the nature of its disability program under the analysis set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">Insofar as the judgment of the district court enjoined enforcement of the HRL, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>reverse.

Bradley, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 176, 97 S.Ct. at 2240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">. It is immaterial that the Minnesota statute explicitly prohibited the denial of pregnancy benefits while the HRL took on this meaning only through judicial interpretation. The net effect of the statutes is exactly the same, and ERISA \u00a7 514(c), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(c), defines the state laws subject to preemption as including court decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">. The airlines also sued under the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d), and under Executive Order No. 11246. The operative principles of these provisions are identical to those of Title VII and we do not consider them separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">. Title VII insulates an employer from liability if he can show that a neutral practice having a discriminatory effect is justified by business necessity. <em>See, e. g., Dothard v. Rawlinson, </em>433 U.S. 321, 329, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 2726, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977); <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S.Ct. 849, 853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971). No party has contended that this exception applies in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1363-11\">. Section 708 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-7, provides that Title VII does not preempt any state law \u201cother than any such law which purports to require or permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment practice\u201d under Title VII.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1363-12\">. Because these issues are purely legal and have been extensively briefed by the parties, we proceed to resolve them here, without need for a remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">. The benefits payable in the future have no present value, being a mere expectancy, contingent upon the occurrence of an insured risk. Therefore, in a plan where the employer bears the full cost of providing benefits, the value of the plan is equal to the cost to the worker of purchasing equivalent coverage directly from an insurer. To the extent that the employee pays for some or all of the cost of insurance, the value of the plan is the difference between the lower cost of purchasing group insurance and that of purchasing individual coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">. Contrary to the airlines\u2019 contention, our disposition of the Title VII claims does not dispense with disparate impact analysis in employment discrimination litigation. We recognize that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>Manhart, supra, </em>are somewhat difficult to reconcile in their application of disparate impact analysis to insurance schemes. Nonetheless, that analysis plainly remains valid in employment discrimination cases. We reject the airlines\u2019 argument because it improperly defines the group that feels the impact of the New York statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1365-13\">. We reject the argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal in <em>Mountain States, supra, </em>is dispositive of the RLA preemption issue. The labor law preemption claim in <em>Mountain States </em>was based upon the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141 <em>et seq., </em>not upon the RLA. <em>Mountain States </em>therefore does not govern this case, <em>cf. Mandel v. Bradley, supra, </em>and we are free to examine the question in depth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1365-14\">. As with the airlines\u2019 Title VII preemption arguments, we believe that the issues raised respecting the RLA are purely legal, and we resolve them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">. The fact that the DBL mandates specific minimum benefits while the HRL theoretically does not has no significance in this analysis. New York could permissibly conclude that minimum benefits are necessary to protect women from discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">. Section 514(a) is set out in note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">. Section 514(a) does not use the term \u201cpreempt.\u201d Instead, it provides that ERISA \u201cshall supersede\u201d state laws relating to benefits plans. Although it might be argued that \u201csupersede\u201d has a narrower meaning than \u201cpreempt,\u201d see Brummond, <em>Federal Preemption of State Insurance Regulation Under </em>ERISA, 62 Iowa L.Rev. 57, 67 (1976), the legislative history indicates that Congress used \u201csupersede\u201d as an equivalent of \u201cpreempt\u201d and that the legislature assigned the term a very broad meaning. See our review of the legislative history <em>infra. See also Wadsworth v. Whaland, </em>562 F.2d 70, 76-77 (1st Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 980, 981, 98 S.Ct. 1630, 56 L.Ed.2d 72 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">. This holding is not inconsistent with our ruling in <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Merry, </em>592 F.2d 118 (2d Cir. 1979). <em>Merry </em>held that ERISA did not preempt the application of a state garnishment law to payments from a pension plan regulated under ERISA. As we noted, a reading of \u00a7 514(a) broad enough to include local garnishment laws would \u201clead to the unreasonable conclusion that Congress intended to preempt even those state laws that only in the most remote and peripheral manner touch upon\u201d ERISA-regulated plans. <em>Id. </em>at 121. By contrast, the DBL\u2019s relation to benefits plans is anything but \u201cremote and peripheral.\u201d It regulates the benefits provided under such plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1369-14\">. Section 4(b) is set out in note 8 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">. Of the various ERISA provisions, only those governing disclosure and fiduciary standards are applicable to employee welfare benefit plans. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1021-1031 (disclosure); <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1101-1112 (fiduciary standards). Other provisions governing vesting, participation, and funding requirements apply only to certain employee pension benefit plans. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1051(1), 1081(a)(1). See <em>generally </em>Brummond, <em>supra, </em>at 60-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">. Section 4(b)(3) closely parallels \u00a7 4(b)(2) of the Welfare and Pensions Plan Disclosure Act of 1958, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b)(2) (repealed by ERISA), which exempted from regulation under that act \u201cplan[s] ... established and ... maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable workmen\u2019s compensation laws or unemployment compensation disability insurance laws.\u201d The legislative history of the WPPDA reveals as little about the meaning of these terms as does that of ERISA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">. Section 4(b)(3) applies to workmen\u2019s compensation plans and unemployment insurance plans as well as disability plans. <em>See </em>note 8 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">. This uniformity in administrative methods flows from the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3311, which imposes a payroll tax upon employers but also provides a substantial credit against this tax for payments made to a qualifying state unemployment fund. The state fund must have the characteristics specified in <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3306(f). In other respects, particularly in the level of benefits provided, state unemployment insurance systems differ widely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">. Nothing in our decision today forbids the states to require employers to administer disability benefits through a separate \u201cplan\u201d as described herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
