The district court reviewed the evidence under the strict standard established by <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), and concluded that \u201ca rational trier of fact could have found the Petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt ... . \u201d Record at 264. We also have reviewed the evidence, and assuming without deciding that the <em>Jackson </em>standard applies, reach the same conclusion. On the record before us, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found petitioner guilty of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-36\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
