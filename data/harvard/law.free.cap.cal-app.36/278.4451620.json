On the first of this series of transactions the defendant took plaintiff\u2019s note for $85, with interest at two per cent per month, for which she received from him in cash $50, which was the amount she desired to borrow, the balance of the note ($35) representing so-called expenses, and being the amount charged by defendant for his trouble in ascertaining whether or not the loan might be safely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On the occasion of each of the other loans the defendant, in addition to deducting interest at the rate of two per cent per month on the previous loans, also deducted ten per cent, by agreement with the plaintiff, as a commission for making the loan. When the indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant thus created reached the sum of nine hundred dollars, and the defendant had received six several conveyances of the plaintiff\u2019s said interest (which it is not disputed were in effect mortgages given to secure the repayment of the loans), the defendant refused to advance plaintiff any further money on her interest in said estate, but agreed to purchase her said Interest for a total sum of $1,550, which he did, the purchase pyice being made up of the nine hundred dollars owed as aforesaid by plaintiff to the defendant, one hundred dollars paid by defendant, with the consent of plaintiff reluctantly given, to an attorney who represented her interest in said estate; $75 paid by defendant with her consent for searching and perfecting title to the property covered by the conveyance ; $75 charged by the defendant as a commission for making this sale to himself, and, finally, the sum of four hundred dollars paid by defendant to plaintiff. According to the appraisement made in the estate in which the property in question figured and other evidence in'.the case, $1,550 appears to have been about the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s interest thus sold to the defendant, although evidence was also introduced placing its value at a much higher figure. It also appears that on the occasions of her transactions with the defendant plaintiff was accompanied by her husband, who approved of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>It is perfectly apparent that the plaintiff was unfamiliar with business affairs and that the defendant imposed unconscionable burdens upon her; but it is not claimed that at the time of the transactions she was an infant, or incompetent, or that the relations between her and the defendant were confidential. No evidence was introduced to show that the defendant made any misstatements or misrepresentations of fact to the plaintiff, or that he practiced upon her any deceit or fraud. It follows that this appellate court is powerless, as was the court of first, instance, to afford the plaintiff any relief against this modern Shylock.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">\u25a0Some criticism is made of the findings. While they cannot be commended for clearness, still under all the circumstances of the case they cannot be regarded as seriously defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Lennon, P. J., and Flood, J., <em>pro tem., </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on April 16, 1918.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
