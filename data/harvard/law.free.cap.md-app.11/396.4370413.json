The decree also provided in the interlineated personal handwriting of the Chancellor, the Honorable D. K. McLaughlin, that \u201cthis court shall have continuing jurisdiction in these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">On February 3, 1970, approximately fifteen years after the original decree was enrolled, appellee petitioned for modification of the decree to require appellant to pay her \u201can amount of money each month for her support.\u201d Appellant moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction because the decree of November 5, 1955, dissolving the marriage awarded no alimony to appellee, and did not reserve jurisdiction to consider and pass upon alimony in the future. By opinion dated April 22, 1970, Judge McLaughlin, interpreting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>own decree, concluded that the court had retained jurisdiction to award alimony or support money to the appellee. Judge McLaughlin held that his purpose in inserting the provision in the decree that \u201cthis court shall have continuing jurisdiction in these proceedings\u201d was to preserve jurisdiction for future alimony award. He stated in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u201cKnowing throughout the years that lawyers inadvertently do not protect their clients as to alimony and support in Decrees, I have continuously made additions to Decrees throughout the past fifteen years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Subsequently, a hearing was held on the merits of appellee\u2019s petition for modification before Judge Irvine Rutledge, at the conclusion of which alimony in the amount of $130.00 monthly was awarded appellee. From this order, the instant appeal was filed, raising as the primary question: \u201cWhether the statement that \u2018this Court shall have continuing jurisdiction in these proceedings\u2019 is sufficient to reserve jurisdiction over the subject matter as to questions of alimony in a case in which no alimony was prayed for and the decree dissolving the marriage awarded no alimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Appellant contends that the wording in the decree was insufficient to preserve jurisdiction to award alimony because it did not specifically so provide. He relies on <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>128 S.E.2d 910 (S. C.), wherein the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201c* * * an intention to reserve jurisdiction of the subject of alimony cannot be derived from a provision in a divorce decree where there are no words of express reference thereto. In the absence of an express reservation, the element of uncertainty would characterize all such decrees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">It is, of course, the settled law of this State that unless an <em>a vinculo </em>decree either awards alimony, or preserves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>jurisdiction, the court is powerless after the decree has become enrolled to award alimony. <em>See Dackman v. Dackman, </em>252 Md. 331; <em>Staub v. Staub, </em>170 Md. 202; <em>Marshall v. Marshall, </em>164 Md. 107. We think it apparent from the face of the decree that it was Judge McLaughlin\u2019s intention to retain jurisdiction to award alimony in the future if warranted by the circumstances. The court in <em>Dackman, </em>at page 342, referred with apparent approval to the observation made in the concurring opinion in <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>202 Md. 547, that where the decree awarded alimony or preserved jurisdiction \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\u201c* * * if the court awarded alimony of one cent a year, it could at any time, years later perhaps, require the husband, if his circumstances warranted it, to pay ten thousand dollars a year. Also, by adding four words \u2014 \u2018The Court retains jurisdiction\u2019 \u2014 alimony could be given for the first time twenty years after the decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">While the statement in <em>Dackman </em>may have been dictum, as contended by appellant, we are persuaded that on the facts of this case the court retained jurisdiction to make the alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Nor do we find merit in appellant\u2019s contention that appellee should be barred, by the principle of <em>res judicata, </em>from asking for alimony fifteen years after the original decree. He claims that by failing to raise or litigate the alimony question at the time of the original action, she has now waived her right to do so and should be estopped from now presenting the issue. We find no merit in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed; appellant to pap costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
