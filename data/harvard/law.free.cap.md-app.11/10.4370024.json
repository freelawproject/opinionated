Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 51. The petitioner was Mrs. Mary L. Mack, Department of Social Services, Bel Air, Maryland, and alleged that Judy Woods, under the age of 18 years,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cis NEGLECTED * * * and is by reason thereof, in need of care and treatment.\u201d It gave the father of the child as Harry O. Woods, Jr. and the mother as Martha L. Woods, both residing at 2753 Augusta Avenue, APG, Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The child was stated to be living with a custodian, \u201cDepartment of Social Services, 119 S. Hayes St., Bel Air, Md.\u201d The grounds for the petition were: \u201cthe said child who suffers or is likely to suffer serious harm from an improper home environment.\u201d The petitioner prayed that the Court make such findings and pass such order as may be deemed proper. On the back of the petition the \u201cparents, guardian, custodian\u201d were advised of the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing and upon showing of financial inability to employ counsel, an Attorney would be appointed for the child \u201cin certain cases.\u201d There was the further advice of the right to summons witnesses. On the same day the court ordered that Judy be committed to the control and custody of Dept, of Social Services for temporary placement, the court retaining jurisdiction over her. On 22 September Judy\u2019s father filed a petition alleging he was without funds to employ counsel for the child and prayed \u201cfor the assignment of counsel to represent Juvenile at the Hearing\u201d in the cause. There is written on the petition over the signature of the presiding judge: \u201c9/25/1969 \u2014 Petition granted with the intention that Parent pay something on account of Service of Public Defender.\u201d On 26 September the court appointed the Public Defender for Harford County to represent the juvenile. At a preliminary hearing the same date Shelter Care of the child was continued \u201cuntil further investigation is made.\u201d On 27 October the case was continued \u2014 \u201cMrs. Woods has consented to hospital evaluation for herself.\u201d On 15 January 1970 records ordered by the court from Walter Reed Hospital were received and filed. The matter was before the court on 25 February, 27 February, 13 March and 25 March. On 2 April 1970 the court passed a disposition order and a commitment order. The disposition order read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-4\">\u201cUpon agreement of counsel for Petitioner and counsel for the parents of the juvenile, that all of the matters and facts which would ordinarily be obtained from social studies and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ports in aid of disposition are contained in the record of the adjudicatory hearing herein; and that a formal disposition hearing is therefore unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\">It is hereby determined this 2nd day of April, 1970, that disposition of this case shall be that the juvenile, Judy Woods, be placed outside of her home. The Court assigns as reasons for this disposition those grounds set forth in the Statement Of Grounds Upon Which Adjudicatory Determination Based heretofore filed and they are hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The commitment order read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">\u201cWHEREAS, it has been duly adjudged after hearing before the Circuit Court for Harford County, sitting as a Juvenile Court, that Judy Woods is a neglected child,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, this 2nd day of April, 1970, by the Circuit Court for Harford County, sitting as a Juvenile Court, that you shall receive said Judy Woods to be kept in your care and custody, subject to the further Order of this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The Statement of Grounds dated 1 April which was incorporated in the disposition order assigned as the ground for the court\u2019s determination that Judy was neglected the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">\u201c1. She is a child who suffers and is likely to suffer serious harm from an improper home environment because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">(a) She was caused to be hospitalized as a result of an episode at home of breathing difficulty and cyanosis, while her mother, Martha L. Woods, was present alone with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">(b) Five other children died on prior separate occasions of an episode of a similar nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>which occurred at home or commenced at home while Martha L. Woods was present alone with them in at least four of those cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The purposes of the subtitle \u201cJuvenile Causes\u201d in Code, Art. 26, are spelled out in \u00a7 70. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">\u201c(1) To provide for the care, protection and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">(2) To remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior, and to substitute therefor a program of treatment training, and rehabilitation consistent with the protection of the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">(3) To place a child in a wholesome family environment whenever possible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">(4) To separate a child from his parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interests of public safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">(5) To provide judicial procedures for carrying out the provisions of this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">There is direction that \u201c[t]his subtitle be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.\u201d A \u201cneglected child\u201d means a child <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who requires the aid of the court and includes a child \u201c [w] ho suffers or is likely to suffer serious harm from an improper home environment or guardianship * * \u00a7 70-1 (j) (3). The Juvenile Court has exclusive jurisdiction over children alleged to be neglected children. \u00a7 70-2 (a) (3). The allegations that a child is neglected shall be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, \u00a7 70-18 (c), and the rules of evidence applicable to civil cases shall apply, Rule 912 c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Juvenile Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>has exclusive jurisdiction to try any person who has reached his 18th birthday for any wilful act or omission causing a child to be adjudicated neglected, delinquent or in need of supervision. \u00a7 70-2 (a) (7). Such person shall have the right to elect to be tried either in the juvenile court or in the criminal court, according to the usual criminal procedure. \u00a7 70-2 (e) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Section 70-25 provides: \u201cAn aggrieved party may appeal from any final order, judgment, or decree of the juvenile court to the Court of Special Appeals in the manner prescribed by the Maryland Rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\n<em>THE INSTANT CASE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The parents of the child named in the petition appeal to this Court as parties aggrieved by the order determining their child to be a neglected child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">(1) They were charged with a crime and the degree of proof of the charge was beyond a reasonable doubt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">(2) The evidence was not sufficient to support the finding that they were guilty of child neglect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">(3) Their right under the confrontation clause of the 6th Amendment to the federal constitution was violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">We find it pellucidly clear that the petition here did not charge either parent under \u00a7 70-2 (a) (7). By its terms it did not allege any wilful act or omission on the part of either parent which could cause the child to be adjudicated neglected. The allegation was simply that Judy Woods was a neglected child. Under the petition the Juvenile Court had no power to try either parent or punish them and it made no attempt to do so. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>determination was that Judy Woods was a neglected child and the disposition of the matter was that she be placed outside her home. And we observe that the court, upon petition of the father, appointed counsel for the child, not the parents. Thus the allegations were properly to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence and it was not required that they be established beyond a reasonable doubt. We hold the lower court did not err in ruling that the petition did not charge appellants either with a crime or under the Juvenile Act. Nor did the court err in ruling that the allegations were not required to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but only by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The finding was not, as appellants assert, that they were found guilty of child neglect. The court did not determine that appellants\u2019 acts or omissions caused the child to be adjudicated neglected for that matter was not before it. It only found that the child was a neglected child. The result of that determination was that the child was adjudicated neglected, nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We have carefully reviewed the evidence and find that it was sufficient in law to support the determination that the child suffered and was likely to suffer serious harm from an improper home environment. There was evidence tending to show that the child was hospitalized as a result of an episode at home of breathing difficulty and cyanosis while Mrs. Woods was alone with her. Five other children died on prior separate occasions of an episode of a similar nature which occurred at home or commenced at home. In at least four of these cases, only Mrs. Woods was present.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On this evidence we cannot say that the court\u2019s judgment was clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">As we have seen, appellants were neither charged nor tried in the proceeding here reviewed and were not subject to punishment thereunder. Thus none of the evidence was \u201cagainst them\u201d and the constitutional right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses\u201d was simply not applicable as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In short, all of appellants\u2019 contentions fall because they are predicated upon the incorrect premise that appellants were charged and tried under the Juvenile Act. It is clear that they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\n<em>Order of disposition and order of commitment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-13\">.
