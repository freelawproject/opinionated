Myron Saul Buckner died on 13 April 1970 before sentences were imposed on the convictions against him. On 30 April a motion for a new trial was granted as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Allen Myron Buckner, Lydia Buckner and Joyce Buckner on the 1st count of indictment 4565. Allen Myron Buckner, Lydia Buckner and Joyce Buckner were sentenced on 8 May 1970. As to each a fine of $250 and costs and imprisonment for one year were imposed on the conviction on each of the 1st and 4th counts of indictment 4564 and on the conviction under the 2nd count of indictment 4565. As to each the prison sentences under the 4th count of indictment 4564 and the 2nd count of indictment 4565 were to run concurrently with that imposed on the 1st count of indictment 4564. Each prison sentence was suspended and probation granted on conditions stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">A separate appeal was noted on behalf of each of Allen Myron Buckner, Lydia Buckner and Joyce Buckner. As to Myron Saul Buckner the Clerk was requested by the Attorneys for the Administrator of the Estate of Myron Saul Buckner to enter an appeal \u201con behalf of Myron Saul Buckner and the Estate of Myron Saul Buckner by Allen Myron Buckner, Administrator of the Estate of Myron Saul Buckner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The State moves to dismiss the appeal involving Myron Saul Buckner. It quotes Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">\u201cA defendant in a criminal action, may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from any conviction where the sentence is other than death or from any sentence other than death imposed by a circuit court of a county or by the Criminal Court of Baltimore * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">It claims that the appeal as to Myron Saul Buckner is improper because no sentence was imposed op his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Art;. 5, \u00a7 12 is the, codification of \u00a7 1, ch. 12, Acts 1966, effective contemporaneously with the adoption of amendments to the Constitution proposed to permit the creation of this Court. The amendments were ratified 8 November 1966.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Act further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>defendant in a criminal action may appeal to the Court of Appeals from any conviction where the sentence is death or from any death sentence imposed by a circuit court of a county or the Criminal Court of Baltimore * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u201cConviction\u201d and \u201csentence\u201d are legally distinct. Conviction is the determination of guilt; sentence is the judgment entered thereon. <em>Sands v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 71, 79. The question is whether an appeal lies from either a conviction or a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Prior to the amendment of Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 12 by Acts 1966, ch. 12, \u00a7 1, a defendant in a criminal action was empowered to appeal to the Court of Appeals \u201cfrom any conviction or sentence\u201d imposed by a circuit court of a county or by the Criminal Court of Baltimore.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is clear that the 1966 Act made no change in the right of appeal from any conviction or sentence but merely delineated the right in terms of the jurisdiction of this Court and the Court of Appeals. The right of appeal so conferred must be construed, the Court of Appeals held in <em>Pearlman v. State, </em>226 Md. 67, in the light of Code, Art. 5, \u00a7 IB, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cIn all criminal actions where sentence has been suspended by the court the defendant shall have a right to appeal under \u00a7 12 or \u00a7 12A of this article in the same manner as if sentence or judgment had been entered in said action.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">So in <em>Pearlman, </em>observing that it is settled that an appeal in a criminal case is premature until after final judgment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see <em>Greathouse v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 675, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>rejected the argument that when ch. 399, Acts 1957 gave a right to appeal \u201cfrom any conviction or sentence\u201d, it changed the former law as established by Acts 1892, ch. 506, expressly giving the right of appeal from a final judgment. It was claimed that the 1957 Act made the law as it was before the passage of the 1892 Act, when appeals in criminal cases were entered before the interposition of sentence. The Court said, at 71:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201cWe think Sections 12 and 13 must be read together to mean that in a criminal case there is an appeal from any judgment and <em>from any conviction where sentence has been suspended.\" </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">And \u00a7 13 refers to the suspension of the imposition of sentence, not to the suspension of its execution. <em>Brown v. State, </em>237 Md. 492, note 7, at 506. See <em>Knight v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 313, 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">As to Myron Saul Buckner in the instant case there was no judgment nor was there a <em>suspension </em>of the imposition of sentence. It was simply that the defendant died before he was sentenced and upon his death no sentence could be imposed. There is no constitutional right to appeal, under the due process clause or otherwise, <em>Brown v. State, supra, </em>at 499. The right is given by statute in this jurisdiction and in the circumstances existent the statute does not entitle Myron Saul Buckner to appeal. His appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The crux of this case is the validity of the search and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>seizure warrant under the authority of which evidence was seized by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">A judge may issue a search warrant when it is made to appear to him by a written application signed and sworn to by the applicant, accompanied by an affidavit containing facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant, that there is probable cause to believe that a crime is being committed by any individual or in a building within his territorial jurisdiction, and that evidence of the crime is upon the person or within the place to be searched. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 551; <em>Salmon v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 513, 519. Probable cause is less than certainty or demonstration but more than suspicion or possibility. It is to be determined by the judge to whom application for the warrant is made. If a prudent and cautious man would be justified from the facts presented in the affidavit in believing that the offense has been or is being committed, the warrant properly may be issued. In determining the existence <em>vel non </em>of probable cause, the judge may give consideration to the special significance which objects, happenings, and individuals may have conveyed to a trained, experienced and knowledgeable police officer making the affidavit accompanying the warrant. <em>Henson v. State, </em>236 Md. 518, 521. And the affidavit may be based on hearsay information, even from an unidentified informant, and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the affiant, but it must contain some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant could be reasonably justified in a belief that the hearsay information was reliable or the informant was credible. <em>Grimm v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 321; <em>Colopietro v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 312; <em>Kist v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 282. See <em>Nutter v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 635, 641; <em>Mullaney v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 248, note 4 at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">When a search warrant is challenged, the lower court, and the appellate court when the determination of the lower court is before it on appeal, must look for probable cause only in the affidavit itself and may not go outside it. <em>Scarborough v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 208. However <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the affidavit should be interpreted in a common-sense and not in a hypertechnical manner, and the resolution, of doubtful or marginal cases should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants. <em>Frey v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 38, 45-46, summarizing the observations in <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102. But, as we noted in <em>Frey, </em>this is not to say that probable cause can be made out by affidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant\u2019s or an informer\u2019s belief that probable cause exists. See <em>Hall v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 394. In short, there are established propositions lately specifically affirmed in <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, 419 and noted by us in <em>Price v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 131, 137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">1) the standard of probable cause is only the probability and not a <em>prima facie </em>showing, of criminal activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">2) affidavits of probable cause are tested by much less rigorous standards than those governing the admissibility of evidence at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">3) issuing judges are not to be confined to niggardly limitations or by restrictions on the use of their common sense in judging probable cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">4) the determination of probable cause by the issuing judge should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The search and seizure warrant, issued by a judge of the Circuit Court for Howard County, commanded any officer of the Maryland State Police, with the necessary and proper assistants, to search Myron S. Buckner, Joel Tidman, Vivian Helen Larkin, and Allen Buckner, three described automobiles owned respectively by Myron S. Buckner, Joel and Patricia Carolyn Tidman and Allen Buckner, and the premises 448 Columbia Road, Howard County, Maryland for records and paraphernalia related to gambling and if such property be found to seize it. The officer was further commanded upon execution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>warrant to arrest any persons found \u201cthen and there engaged in the commission of a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The warrant, issued on an affidavit by Lieutenant Thomas J. Coppinger of the Baltimore City Police Department, consisted of 36 legal size pages of double spaced typewriting. The question is whether this application, tested by the rules above discussed, showed probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The first page of the affidavit established Coppinger as a police officer experienced in the investigation of violation of the gambling laws. The second page set out the usual method of operation of those engaged in unlawful lottery operations, tracing the procedure from the placing of a numbers bet with a writer, to the turn-in of the slips at an \u201coffice\u201d, to the pay-off of winners. Coppinger concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201cThere are certain \u2018hallmarks\u2019 that have become characteristic of the methods of transporting and conveying lottery wagering paraphernalia and money such as small brown paper bags and various size envelopes. Because possession of any lottery paraphernalia is a crime in Maryland, it is usual for anyone engaged in the numbers or lottery operation to act in a covert and clandestine manner in order to secrete the records and funds of the operation and to avoid detection and seizure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Pages 3 through 10 of the affidavit set out information received from an unnamed informant during an interview on 10 and 11 February 1969 in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office of Baltimore City, the Emerson Hotel and a Baltimore City Police Department unmarked automobile. Coppinger was not one of the interviewers; he learned what the informant had said \u201cby means of listening to tape recordings of the interview and discussion with the Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys involved in the actual interrogation of the confidential informant,\u201d known to Coppinger since 10 May 1968 \u201cas being involved in lottery opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>tions in the City of Baltimore and Baltimore County.\u201d The informant said he had been a high-level writer in a lottery and book making operation which received bets of about $100,000 to $150,000 a week. The top men in the organization were \u201cMickey\u201d and \u201cGene\u201d, owners of the Village Bar in Baltimore City, and Warren Toelle, owner of an Atlantic Service Station at Cat\u00f3n and Monastery Avenues in Baltimore City. The informant received bets, lottery and horse-race, from 50 to 60 writers who identified themselves by code, over two unlisted, private telephones provided him in his place of operation. He was instructed by Mickey to \u201clay off\u201d any bet over $5 and by Toelle to \u201clay off\u201d any bet over $3, with the organization\u2019s \u201clay-off man\u201d, who would call every day at 2:00 P.M. He would lay-off between $1000 and $1500. As soon as the lay-off man called, the informant would total the day\u2019s bets and prepare them either for delivery to the pick-up man or drop-off to one of the backers. This would have to be accomplished by 2:30 P.M. He would turn the bets over to the pick-up man, or send them by his runner to the bosses or personally take them to a pre-arranged location, usually a shopping center parking lot, where he met Mickey or Toelle and passed the bets through their automobile window. He telephoned Mickey every evening at his home, telephone number 465-1653. He had never been to Mickey\u2019s house but knew it was in the county on Route 40 West past a shopping center. Mickey drove an Oldsmobile which the informant thought was a 1966 model. Mickey was at his residence between 3 P.M. and 6 P.M. where he took bets over the telephone. Earlier in the day he was \u201cdowntown.\u201d A woman named Vivian worked for Mickey as a high-level writer in the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">A man named Tony was a writer for the organization and turned in his bets to Mickey, Gene, and Toelle. Tony lived at 543 Yale Avenue and received his bets there. He drove a blue Chevrolet convertible with a white top, license FH 6132.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The informant was trained by \u201cJules\u201d, a young man about 25 years old of tall, thin build. When informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>was arrested during a raid in May of 1968 and terminated his activities as a writer, the bets formerly taken by him were taken by Jules. Jules\u2019 telephone number was 247-1474 and all the \u201cbig stuff\u201d came through that number.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The informant said that Toelle also owned M &amp; F Motors, Inc., a used car lot, with Edward \u201cMoe\u201d Morehead. The lot was located at 2040 Frederick Avenue and Moe wrote a small amount of numbers there.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Toelle employed a \u201ccolored woman\u201d named Ann who took bets for him at a location never disclosed to the informant. She would call informant and ask if he wanted to lay-off any bets.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The informant gave the usual \u201cdaily activity pattern\u201d of Toelle. He left his home on Frederick Avenue about 11:00 A.M. and went to the Atlantic Station at Cat\u00f3n and Monastery Avenues. He took bets over the pay phone in the station and when the local race tracks were open, left for the track. He spent the afternoon at the track and then went to Ann\u2019s apartment about 7:00 P.M., where he remained for several hours and at times all night. Toelle took the betting records to his home at 6621 Frederick Avenue and worked on them at his dining room table.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The informant said he received a salary and commission totaling between $400 to $700 a week and in addition all rent, furniture, utilities and living expenses were paid by the organization. He was told by Toelle when he first went to work that \u201che would be protected by the organization as far as fines and counsel fees were concerned should he ever be arrested * * *. In addition Warren Toelle informed [him] that he would be tipped off in advance of any raid by the Baltimore City Police Department at which time he was to \u2018lock up shop, destroy the stuff, and get out.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108 the Supreme Court recognized that the constitutional requirement of probable cause can be established by hearsay information <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>but the application must set forth some of the underlying circumstances necessary to enable the judge independently to determine the validity of the informant\u2019s conclusion that the crime was being committed as alleged and the affiant must support his claim that the informant was \u201ccredible\u201d or his information \u201creliable.\u201d Explicating <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>principles in <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U. S. 410, the Court said that the informer\u2019s report must first be measured against <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>standards so that its probative value can be assessed. If the tip is found inadequate under <em>Aguilar </em>the other allegations which corroborate the information contained in the hearsay report should then be considered. The judge must ask: \u201cCan it fairly be said that the tip, even when certain parts of it have been corroborated by independent sources, is as trustworthy as a tip which would pass <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>tests without independent corroboration?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Coppinger does not expressly claim in his affidavit that the informant was credible or his information reliable. But the affidavit contains reasons why the informant was credible and his information reliable. Coppinger ascertained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">(1) that the informant \u201cwas arrested in a raid in Baltimore City in the summer of 1968 which resulted in the recovery of a large amount of lottery paraphernalia indicating approximately $40,000 in play\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">(2) that since 22 May 1964 the licensees of the Village Bar have been Eugene Adler, Harry A. Buckner and George H. Finecey;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">(3) that the lessee of the Atlantic Station at Cat\u00f3n and Monastery Avenues from October 1966 to September 1968 was M &amp; F Motors, Inc., the president of which was Toelle and the secretary of which was Vivian Larkin;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>(4) that the telephone number 465-1658 was listed to Mrs. Lydia B. Buckner of 448 Columbia Road, Howard County, Maryland, which is adjacent to Route 29 about two miles from Route 40;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">(5) that in the driveway of 448 Columbia Road was a 1967 Oldsmobile listed to Myron S. Buckner, 448 Columbia Road, Howard County, Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">(6) that the automobile driven by the writer named \u201cTony\u201d whose residence was pointed out by the informant to be 543 Yale Avenue was listed to Anthony Gerard Constantino, 543 Yale Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">(7) that the telephone number of the writer \u201cJules\u201d was listed to Joel Tidman, 4341 Alan Drive, and was disconnected on 23 January 1969;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">(8) that 2040 Frederick Avenue was occupied by M &amp; F Motors, Inc., a used car dealership;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">(9) that there was a telephone listing in the name of Alfred W. Toelle at 6621 Frederick Avenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">From Coppinger\u2019s training experience and knowledge he was familiar with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">(1) the practice of laying-off bets as described by the informant \u201cso that the organization is never required to pay out too much by way of pay-off to the bettors if a \u2018hit\u2019 is made\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">(2) the practice of those engaged in lottery operations of picking up the day\u2019s wagers from all of the numbers writers in the organization by a time in the day near 2 P.M. for delivery to the \u201cbackers\u201d or \u201cbosses\u201d so as to preclude the submission of a wager after the winning number for the day has been calculated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">(3) the course of conduct described by the informant as being the usual means whereby lot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tery and horse-bet wagers are transported from the high-level writers to the backers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">(4) the standard practice in the conduct of bookmaking and lottery operations of the backers taking steps both to protect and immunize their employees from prosecution as set out by informant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We believe that the affidavit was sufficient to establish the informant\u2019s credibility and the reliability of his information.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">It is patent that the information given by the informant contained a sufficient statement of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that Mickey and Toelle were running a bookmaking operation and that Jules, Ann, Vivian and Tony were actively engaged in the unlawful enterprise. The informant worked for and with them. He obtained his information by working for the organization of which they were a part and he described the criminal activity in sufficient detail so that the issuing judge could know that he was relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation. In <em>Spinelli </em>the Court said that the detail provided by the informant in <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U. S. 307, provides a suitable benchmark. At 416. This being so, the detail provided by the informant here is certainly sufficient. See <em>Price v. State, supra, </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The informant did not expressly identify Myron Saul Buckner as Mickey nor did he expressly assert that violations of the gambling laws were being committed in the premises 448 Columbia Road. But'we think that Coppinger had probable cause, within the definition of that term and upon application of the rules to be followed in ascertaining its existence, to believe that Mickey was Myron Saul Buckner and that 448 Columbia Road had been used to carry on the unlawful operation. We reach this conclusion in the light of the telephone number habitually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>called by the informant, the general location of Mickey\u2019s residence as known by informant, and the similarity of the automobile informant knew to be driven by Mickey and the automobile seen by Coppinger parked at 448 Columbia Road and listed in Myron S. Buckner\u2019s name. And we think Coppinger had probable cause to believe that \u201cJules\u201d was Joel Tidman, the telephone over which Jules took bets being listed to Joel Tidman. And, of course, Warren was identified by the informant as Warren Toelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The warrant was issued on 14 April 1969 and the informant\u2019s disclosures covered a period ending a year before. While the information from the informant justified probable cause to believe as of May 1968 that gambling records and paraphernalia were concealed in the premises 448 Columbia Road and on the person of each of Myron Saul Buckner, Joel Tidman, Vivian Helen Lark-in and Warren Toelle, there was nothing in what the informant said, standing alone, to give probable cause to believe that such contraband was so concealed in April 1969. However, as set out in the affidavit, Lieutenant Coppinger and Detectives Charles Rothrock and Richard Nevin conducted an investigation and surveillance during the period 14 February 1969 through 2 April 1969 which included the persons and places referred to by the informant. During that period there was, at various times, surveillance of the Atlantic Gas Station at Cat\u00f3n and Monastery Avenues, 6621 Frederick Avenue, 448 Columbia Road, 2314 Edmondson Avenue, 2502 Edgecomb Circle North, 720 S. Woodington Avenue, 5602 Pembroke Avenue, 5623 Johnny Cake Road, and the Village Bar at 615 E. Baltimore Street (which had not then reopened for business after changing its location from Baltimore and Harrison Streets). Persons observed who were identified were Myron Buckner, Warren Toelle, Tayfoid Hargrove, Allen Buckner, Carolyn Jones, Joel Tidman and Vivian Larkin. The observations of the police showed an interrelationship between these places and persons. The Atlantic Gas Station was owned by a corporation of which Warren Toelle was president and Toelle lived at 6621 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Frederick Avenue. Myron Buckner and Allen Buckner lived at 448 Columbia Road. Tayfoid Hargrove lived at 2314 Edmondson Avenue. Carolyn Jones lived at 2502 Edgecomb Circle North, Apartment T1 in the basement. Joel Tidman lived at 720 S. Woodington Avenue. Vivian Larkin lived at 5623 Johnny Cake Road. As the surveillance progressed it became readily evident that the daily activities of the principals were similar to those as described by the informant. Toelle would leave his home at 6621 Frederick Avenue, drive to the Atlantic Gas Station and stay only a short time. In the afternoon he would go to the Pimlico Race Track, from there to the Pimlico Hotel and from there to the basement apartment, T1 at 2502 Edgecomb Circle North where at times he spent the night. A nonpublished phone at the Edgecomb Circle address was in the name of Carolyn Jones. He was seen there on 26 March, 29 March, 10 April, and 11 April. On 29 March a surveillance van and a private automobile were used to watch 2502 Edgecomb Circle North. The affidavit reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">\u201cParked directly outside of 2502 Edgecomb Circle was a light blue and black Mustang bearing Maryland registration CY 9807 (old issue). Your Affiant has checked the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles and learned that the aforesaid vehicle is listed to Carolyn Virginia Williams, 101 Edgewood Street. It is noted by your Affiant that premises 101 Edgewood Street is approximately one block from the Atlantic gas station at Cat\u00f3n and Monastery Avenues. At 12:32 p.m., an unidentified colored male approximately 25 years old entered the apartment at 2502 Edgecomb Circle and walked down to the basement towards the left. Your Affiant has ascertained that the apartment toward the left is apartment T1 listed to Carolyn Jones as set forth previously. At approximately 1 p.m., the blue and black Oldsmobile C987 owned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Warren Toelle parked in front of 2502 Edge-comb Circle. The car was driven by a colored female who became obviously interested and anxious at the sight of the surveillance van parked across the street. The aforesaid colored female alighted from the vehicle glancing at the surveillance van. The aforesaid colored female reached back into Toelle\u2019s car and removed her coat and three brown paper bags. Two of the bags were small and light in weight and carried together in one hand. The third brown paper bag was approximately 12\" long, 8\" wide and 6\" deep and appeared light in weight. This bag was carried in the colored female\u2019s other hand by the top with no apparent effort. Your Affiant is familiar with the customary use of such brown paper bags by backers, runners, pick-up men, and writers engaged in a lottery operation as the means whereby lottery paraphernalia and currency are transported from location to location. The colored female carried the bags into 2502 Edgecomb Circle North and once inside the door, turned around to watch the surveillance van again. She walked down the steps to the basement apartment and looked up once more at the van. She then entered the apartment on the left, ascertained by your Affiant to be Apartment Tl. The aforesaid colored female who entered 2502 Edgecomb Circle, Apartment Tl with the brown paper bags is in her late 30\u2019s or early 40\u2019s, heavy set and wearing what appeared to the Affiant to be a wig of frosted hair. At 1:07 p.m., a colored female in her early 20\u2019s and thin came out of the basement apartment on the left at 2502 Edgecomb Circle and entered a blue and black Ford automobile which had been parked in front of 2502 Edgecomb Circle. At 2:08 p.m., your Affiant observed that someone from the basement apartment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>left at 2502 Edgeeomb Circle was looking through the Venetian blinds at the surveillance van. At 2:10 p.m., an unidentified colored male arrived at 2502 Edgeeomb Circle and entered the basement apartment on the left. This colored male left the apartment at 2:43 p.m., and drove away from the area. At 2:37 p.m., Warren Toelle came out of the basement apartment on the left ascertained by your Affiant to be Apartment Tl, and entered C987 which had been parked in front of 2502 Edgeeomb Circle by the aforesaid colored female. As Toelle entered his automobile he looked at the surveillance van several times. Toelle left the area in C987 at 2:55 p.m. Your Affiant once more observed that someone was looking out through the Venetian blinds of the basement apartment to the left at 2502 Edgeeomb Circle. At 4:48 p.m., your Affiant once again observed that someone was observing the surveillance van through the Venetian blinds. At 5:30 p.m., an unidentified colored male approximately 5T0\", 150 lbs. entered apartment Tl at 2502 Edgeeomb Circle. This unidentified colored male was carrying in one hand a light paper shopping bag. The aforesaid colored male left the premises at 2502 Edgeeomb Circle at 6:01 p.m., along with an unidentified colored female who had not been previously observed by your Affiant on this day. At 5:55 p.m., an unidentified colored male approximately 5T0\", 150 lbs. entered 2502 Edgeeomb Circle and went down to the basement apartment and towards the left. At 6:40 p.m., the unidentified female previously described, who had earlier on that day been driving Toelle\u2019s car, came out of the apartment Tl at 2502 Edge-comb Circle and then drove the blue and black Mustang CY9807 previously described and registered to Carolyn Virginia Williams, 101 Edge-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>wood Street. This colored female left the area driving CY9807. At 6:45 p.m., a yellow cab stopped in front of 2502 Edgecomb Circle and the unidentified colored male and female who had previously left apartment Tl at 6:01 p.m., re-entered apartment Tl. The cab waited for an hour, until 6:48 p.m., when the two aforementioned individuals came out of apartment Tl at 2502 Edgecomb Circle at which time the colored male was carrying a large brown paper bag similar to that that he had carried into the premises at 5 :30 p.m. At this time the man and the woman entered the yellow cab which had been waiting. At 7:55 p.m., the aforesaid described unidentified colored male who had previously carried a brown paper bag into and out of apartment Tl returned to apartment Tl in a Diamond Cab and left in the Diamond Cab at 8:10 p.m. It was noted by your Affiant that on several occasions during the period of surveillance on this date a 1959 or 1960 Chrysler Imperial bearing Rhode Island license plates EP210 slowly cruised by in front of 2502 Edgecomb Circle. This vehicle did not stop. At approximately 6:30 p.m., an unidentified colored male parked in an automobile behind the surveillance van. This unidentified colored male sat in the automobile for approximately one hour smoking cigarettes and watching the surveillance van.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">On 1 April Toelle went to the Atlantic Station and into the office. \u201cAlmost simultaneously\u201d the same Chrysler automobile which had driven past 2502 Edgecomb Circle North several times on 29 March pulled in the station. A colored male got out and went into the office. About a half hour later both the man and Toelle came out and each drove away. The Chrysler was later seen on Pennsylvania Avenue near Wilson Street. The affidavit reads: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201cYour affiant from previous experience knows that the area of Pennsylvania Avenue and Wilson Street is reputed to be an area of very heavy lottery activity.\u201d Coppinger determined that the license tags on the Chrysler (Rhode Island EP210) were listed to a black 1963 Chevrolet Impala. He stated in the affidavit: \u201cYour affiant is familiar with the strategem of switching license plates between various motor vehicles as a common device employed by lottery writers, pick-up men, and backers as a means to avoid identification and detection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On 10 April a colored male walked out of 2502 Edge-comb Circle North about 10 minutes after Toelle entered about 6:45 P.M. The colored male had in his hand a brown paper bag \u201cappearing full and light in weight.\u201d He was the same person seen on 29 March carrying a brown paper bag into and out of the basement apartment Tl. Almost immediately thereafter another colored male went into the basement at 2502 Edgecomb Circle North with a brown paper bag in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">While watching Toelle\u2019s home at 6621 Frederick Avenue on 26 March the police saw a colored male later identified as Tayfoid Hargrove of 2314 Edmondson Avenue enter the premises about 9:00 A.M., he remained about 10 minutes and left. The police determined that 2314 Edmondson Avenue had two non-listed telephones located in the basement and upstairs. On 1 April a colored male left 2314 Edmondson Avenue about 8:45 A.M. and drove in an automobile listed to Tayfoid and Otelia Hargrove to the vicinity of Toelle\u2019s home. Surveillance was broken \u2018\u201cby means of deceptive and evasive driving patterns.\u201d On 11 April the same man left 2314 Edmondson Avenue about 10:00 A.M. in the Hargrove\u2019s automobile and returned at 10:33 A.M. He entered the premises carrying a brown paper bag which appeared light in weight. On 12 April two colored males left 2314 Edmondson Avenue at 8:00 A.M. and started to open the trunk of the Hargrove\u2019s car but then walked away. They returned twenty minutes later. One was carrying a brown paper bag between two larger white plastic bags and the other had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>small parcel wrapped in white paper or cloth. About 8:30 A.M. the man who had driven the Hargrove\u2019s car on 11 April came out of the premises, removed a small parcel in a brown paper bag and put it in the trunk. He drove away. He returned at 9:40 A.M. There was \u201ca large bulge in his right front pocket.\u201d He entered the premises. He left about 5 minutes later; \u201cthere was no longer a bulge as described in the right pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On 1 April Joel Tidman entered the picture. The police followed Myron Buckner from his residence to the E. J. Korvette parking lot off of Route 40. Buckner pulled beside a white Ford later ascertained to be registered to Patricia Carolyn Tidman, 720 S. Woodington Avenue. A young white male in his early twenties, tall and thin, known by sight to the police as Joel Tidman alighted from the Ford and talked to Buckner still seated in his car. The police were unable to see whether \u201canything physically transferred between the cars.\u201d After a few minutes Tidman got back in his car and both he and Buckner drove away. On 5 April the police placed 720 S. Woodington Avenue under surveillance. About 6:45 P.M. Tidman came out of the house and drove the Ford to 448 Columbia Road. He went inside and stayed only a few minutes. Buckner\u2019s car was parked in the driveway. On 7 April the police followed Tidman from his residence to a parking lot in the rear of the Pancake House at Johnny Cake Road on Route 40 in close proximity to the E. J. Korvette parking lot. He was joined by Vivian Lark-in and within a few seconds Buckner drove in. Buckner walked over to Tidman and Larkin. The two men conversed for 2 or 3 minutes, shook hands and each of the three drove away in their respective automobiles. The officer was unable to ascertain whether or not anything had been transferred between the two men. On 8 April Tidman left his house about 6:55 P.M., drove to the Korvette parking lot on Route 40. At 7:10 P.M. Buckner pulled alongside Tidman\u2019s car, Tidman got out and walked over to Buckner\u2019s car. With the aid of binoculars the po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>lice saw Tidman give Buckner some papers. Both drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">On 3 April after Buckner and Tidman met on the parking lot, Buckner drove to the Village Bar, arriving about 7:30 P.M. Twelve minutes later he left and drove <em>\u201cby </em>means of an extremely deceptive and evasive pattern to 5206 Pembroke Avenue, arriving at 8:02 P.M. He entered the premises. Six minutes later a young white man between 17 and 19 years of age came out and removed a white box approximately 12 inches high, 18 inches long and 18 inches wide, which appeared light in weight, from the rear seat of Buckner\u2019s car and took it into the house. About 20 minutes later Buckner, the young man and two women left the house and went to a nearby tavern where they remained until 11:05 P.M. While Buckner was gone the dining room of 5206 Pembroke Avenue was \u201ccompletely closed off by drawn shades\u201d, although well lighted and the police could see that people were moving about. When Buckner left the tavern he entered 5206 Pembroke Avenue and remained about an hour. He then drove to the Village Bar at 615 E. Baltimore Street and entered by means of a key. The Village Bar had moved from Baltimore and Harrison Streets and was not as yet open for business. About 1:30 A.M. a white male came out of the Bar carrying a small brown parcel appearing light in weight and placed it in a black Oldsmobile. Shortly thereafter Buckner left and drove home. On 5 April Buckner\u2019s car was seen parked in front of 5206 Pembroke Avenue at 1:05 P.M. and at 2:24 P.M. Buckner came out of the premises and drove away. On 8 April after Buckner met Tidman on the parking lot he drove to the Village Bar, entered, remained only 3 minutes and then drove to 5206 Pembroke Avenue. From his car he took a box which appeared light in weight and a parcel and went into the house. He left about 20 minutes later and broke surveillance by means of an evasive and deceptive driving pattern.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Surveillance of 448 Columbia Road was conducted on 11, 13, 27, 28 and 31 March and 1, 2, 3,' and 7 April. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Buckner usually left home between 10:00 and 11:00 A.M. On 27 March, before he left, a woman entered and left in 5 minutes and two men entered and stayed 4 minutes. On 2 April, before he left, a woman entered and remained about 50 minutes and two men who drove up in a cream-colored Chrysler, entered, one of whom was carrying a small paper bag appearing light in weight. They stayed 2 minutes. Another woman entered and left in 5 minutes. About 5:10 P.M. after Buckner had returned home a woman carrying a small white bag went in the house and left 5 minutes later. Then the Chrysler which had been there in the morning drove up and the same two men went in the house. They left about a half hour later carrying what appeared to be an adding machine. On three of the days Buckner was under surveillance he went to Blumson\u2019s Drug Store at Front and Baltimore Streets, staying 5 minutes, 2 minutes and 1 minute respectively. On 5 of the days he went to the Village Bar. He entered the Bar on the dates and at the times set forth below and remained on the premises for the time indicated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">28 March \u2014 11:20 A.M.\u2014 30 minutes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">2 April \u2014 11:30 A.M. \u2014 4 hours</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">3 April\u2014 7 :30 P.M.\u2014 12 minutes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">4 April \u2014 12:50 <em>A.M. </em>\u2014 iy\u00bf hours</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">8 April\u2014 7:34 P.M.\u2014 3 minutes</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">On 28 March Buckner left the Bar accompanied by two men. They drove \u201cin a circuitous, deceptive and evasive manner\u201d to the corner of Webster Street and Fort Avenue. The driver walked around the corner, returned carrying a small parcel in his hand and reentered the vehicle. The circuitous driving resumed. In the vicinity of Baltimore Street and Central Avenue, the car \u201cquickly pulled into an open parking space out of a fast moving lane of traffic.\u201d The officer conducting the surveillance had to drive past the car and then lost sight of it. On 5 April after Tidman had gone to Buckner\u2019s home, Buckner was observed by the police with the aid of binoculars \u201csitting in what appeared to be the dining room speaking into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>a telephone while looking at some papers he held in his hand. The papers appeared to be 8% x 11\" sheets of loose leaf paper and Buckner appeared to be reading from the sheets into the telephone.\u201d Coppinger stated in the affidavit: \u201cYour affiant on the basis of previous experience in lottery investigation and this investigation and his participation in the preparation of lottery prosecutions is aware that backers or principals of lottery operations normally receive on a daily basis tally sheets, run-down sheets and hit sheets which are commonly prepared on 81/2 x 11\" sheets of white loose leaf paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The police observed during the surveillance of Buckner and Toelle that each of them habitually drove from place to place by means of an evasive and deceptive driving pattern, as for example, driving at approximately 25 m.p.h. on a high speed limited express highway, thus making it impossible for surveillance to be maintained from the rear; speeding through yellow and red traffic lights to separate themselves from the traffic behind; traveling along in a fast moving left lane and suddenly stopping, causing traffic to back up and pull around, and then making a U-turn and driving off in the opposite direction: and driving to the place of destination by a circuitous route.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We think that the affidavit contained a substantial basis for the issuing judge to conclude that probably gambling records and paraphernalia were in the premises 448 Columbia Road and in the automobiles and, except for Allen Buckner, on the persons designated in the warrant. We reach this determination by considering the observations of the police in the light of the disclosures of an informant shown to be reliable. Even if neither the observations nor the disclosures standing alone were enough, together they gave probable cause for the trained, experienced and knowledgeable affiant to believe that Myron Saul Buckner and Warren Toelle had been and were still engaged in unlawful gambling activities, that Myron Saul Buckner was \u201cMickey\u201d, that Joel Tidman was \u201cJules\u201d, that Carolyn Jones was \u201cAnn\u201d, that Vivian Lark-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>in was \u201cVivian\u201d, that Tidman took over the work formerly performed by the informant and that Jones and Larkin were active participants in the illegal operation. We can reach no other result when the affidavit is considered in a common sense rather than a hypertechnical manner, granting as we must, deference to the issuing judge\u2019s determination of probable cause. And we observe that if the affidavit here is deemed doubtful or marginal, it is to be resolved by the preference accorded warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Except as to the command to search Allen Buckner we find that the search and seizure warrant was valid. We hold that the trial court did not err in denying motion made to quash it.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The warrant was not valid as to its command to search Allen Buckner because the affidavit did not give probable cause to believe he was engaged in violation of the gambling laws. The informant did not mention him and although he was observed on the premises 448 Columbia Road during the police surveillance, he lived there. His actions observed by the police did not meet the test of probable cause to believe he was participating in the illegal operation. While Myron Saul Buckner drove Allen Buckner\u2019s automobile on several occasions, he was not accompanied by Allen Buckner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The warrant was executed on 14 April 1969 about 8:00 P.M. at 448 Columbia Road by Detective Sergeant Gary R. Grant of the Maryland State Police. He was assisted by Sergeant Jack Burke of the Howard County police, Sergeant George Snyder of the Maryland State Police and Robert Stewart, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, from whom he obtained the warrant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>premises consisted of a living room, dining room, kitchen and bedroom on the first floor and two bedrooms and bath on the second floor. After conducting a search on the first floor Grant, accompanied by Stewart, went to the second floor. Grant searched a bedroom occupied by Allen Buckner who was in the room. In a desk drawer Grant found a can containing memorandum pads and behind the pads was $650. There was also $33 in cash in the drawer. At this point defense counsel, anticipating testimony to come, objected to the admission of anything found by Stewart. Evidence on the issue was taken out of the presence of the jury. Grant said that Stewart called his attention to and picked up a small metal, box in a closet. Stewart placed it on the bed. Grant asked Allen Buckner if he had a key to it. Grant did not remember whether the box was locked or unlocked but he opened the box and examined the contents. On cross-examination Grant said he did not remember whether Buckner had a key or whether the box was unlocked or who actually released the locking mechanism, but it was done in any event at his direction. Nor did he recall whether the closet door was open or closed. Allen Buckner said the box was in the far end of a seven foot long closet with louver doors that were closed. Stewart opened the doors, took out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>box, put it on the bed and asked if it was locked. Buckner said there was a key someplace but he did not have it. Stewart opened the box. It was not locked \u2014 he just released the catch and opened it. When the box was placed on the bed Grant stopped searching the desk and came over and stood by the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 551 provides <em>inter alia </em>that a judge may issue a search warrant \u201c* * * directed to any duly constituted policeman, constable or police officer authorizing him to search * * * and to seize any property found liable to seizure * * Allen Buckner relied on this statute in objecting below and relies on it on appeal in arguing that the seizure of the box and its contents was illegal. The warrant was directed to a duly constituted police officer \u2014 \u201cany officer of the Maryland State Police\u201d \u2014 and was executed by a duly constituted police officer \u2014 Sergeant Grant of the Maryland State Police. The search of the bedroom was under the personal and immediate direction of Grant and the contents <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the box were seized by Grant. In these circumstances that Stewart was not a duly constituted policeman, constable, or police officer did not invalidate the search and seizure. In overruling the objection the lower court said: \u201c* *\u2022 * Sergeant Grant was in the room conducting the search. The fact that Mr. Stewart pulled out a box and put it on the bed in Sergeant Grant\u2019s presence, I don\u2019t think would invalidate the search and seizure.\u201d We agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Appellants contend that the search of Allen Buckner\u2019s bedroom and the search of a bedroom occupied by Joyce Buckner <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were unreasonable. The warrant commanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the search of the premises 448 Columbia Road. It was clear that these premises were a single family dwelling, not divided into apartments or sub-units. In denying a motion below to suppress the property found in the bedrooms occupied by Joyce Buckner and Allen Buckner the court observed that the point was whether a search under a validly issued search warrant was required to stop short of certain parts of premises because they are occupied by other members of the family. The court said that the search was pursuant to a warrant which described the premises and the police had the right to search the entire premises. \u201cThe fact that a family was living there as a unit didn\u2019t mean that they were precluded from going into the entire premises.\u201d It found that because the various people in the family lived in various rooms of the house did not prohibit the police from searching those rooms under the warrant. We agree. Cases involving apartments and sub-units are not apposite in the factual posture of the case here. See <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>236 Md. 148; <em>Hall v. State, </em>232 Md. 588; <em>Frey v. State, supra. </em>We hold the lower court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Appellants contend that any search beyond the immediate person of Myron Buckner was exploratory and therefore invalid. They cite <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56 as holding that a search incident to a valid arrest could only be made in the area under the immediate control of the arrestee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Rabinowitz </em>is in nowise apposite. The question there was \u201cthe reasonableness of a search without a warrant of a place of business consisting of a one-room office, incident to a valid arrest.\u201d At 57. There is no question here of the scope of a warrantless search incident to a legal arrest. Here the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>was under the authority of a search and seizure warrant which directed a search of the premises. Myron Buckner was searched in the living room and thereafter Grant searched the dining room. Appellants\u2019 claim that Grant \u201chad no business in the dining room and his intrusion therein was unreasonable since there was nothing going on illegal in the living room\u201d is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">As <em>to Myron Saul Buckner appeal dismissed; as to Allen Myron Buckner, individually, Lydia Buckner and Joyce Buckner: judgments affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-11\">.
