The court denied the petition and Heath appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">While the Court of Appeals in <em>Whiteley v. Warden, </em>258 Md. 634, decided in 1970, did entertain an appeal in a habeas corpus case involving the alleged erroneous denial of bail after conviction pending direct, appeal, the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to do so was never raised. We held in <em>Hudson v. Superintendent, </em>11 Md. App. 253, that there is no right of appeal in such cases. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
