She stated that her last menstrual period was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the beginning of May; that she had intercourse on two occasions with another man several months prior to her last menstrual period; but that she had intercourse with appellant and only him subsequent to her last menstrual period. She testified that two other persons \u2014 whom she named \u2014 were present during her intercourse with appellant in June. No contraceptives were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Appellant testified on his own behalf. He admitted being in appellee\u2019s presence in June of 1969 but denied having intercourse with her. Neither of the alleged eyewitnesses to the June intercourse were called to testify. A blood test was taken; it did not exclude appellant as the father of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The case having been tried by the court without a jury, the sole question presented on appeal is whether the trial judge was clearly erroneous in determining that appellant was the father of appellee\u2019s child.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Paternity proceedings instituted under Maryland Code, Article 16, Section 66A, <em>et seq., </em>are civil proceedings. <em>Corley v. Moore, </em>236 Md. 241. The burden of proof is upon the petitioner \u2014 in this case the mother. She is required to establish, by a fair preponderance of the affirmative evidence, that the defendant is the father of the child. Code, Article 16, Section 66F (b) ; <em>Corley v. Moore, supra. </em>The mother\u2019s testimony standing alone may be sufficient to establish the necessary elements of the alleged father\u2019s paternity. Schlatkin, <em>Disputed Paternity Proceedings, </em>4th Ed., p. 74. In the present case, the mother\u2019s testimony, if believed, would establish that her act of sexual intercourse with the appellant caused the onset of pregnancy and that the appellant to the exclusion of all others was the father of her child. On the evidence in this case, we cannot say that the trial judge, who had the opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses, was clearly erroneous. See Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
