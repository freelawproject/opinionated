On appeal, we affirmed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-19\">In 1997, Hamm filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, which the district court denied in an order issued on June 30, 2000. On July 19, 2000, Hamm filed a motion for reconsideration, raising for the first time an <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), claim. Specifically, his claim was that because only a \u201cdetectible amount of marijuana\u201d had been alleged in the indictment and (implicitly) found by the jury, it was unconstitutional to sentence him to more than the ten-year maximum (enhanced from five years because of a prior conviction) under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) for each \u00a7 841(a) offense, and to more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>the five-year maximum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(4) for each \u00a7 952 offense. Without asking for or receiving a response for the government, the district court denied that claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Hamm appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. He contends that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), his sentence should be reduced to the statutory m\u00e1ximums provided for the least quantity of marijuana, because the indictment under which he was convicted did not allege any larger amount, and the jury did not make a finding as to drug quantity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that <em>Apprendi </em>errors are jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">Hamm\u2019s position is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245 (11th Cir.2001), which held that <em>Apprendi </em>.errors are not jurisdictional, and also held that under the doctrine of <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), the <em>Apprendi </em>decision is not retroactively applicable to cases in which the conviction became final before the <em>Apprendi </em>decision was released on June 29, 2000. Hamm\u2019s conviction became final no later than February 13, 1997 when we issued the mandate affirming his conviction and sentence. So, his claim is Teague-barred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">We realize, of course, that Hamm\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim differs from the one in <em>McCoy, </em>because the sentences imposed on Hamm exceeded the maximum sentences for the crimes of conviction when only a detectable amount of the drug is involved (and his indictment alleged in each count only \u201ca detectible amount of marijuana\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>In other words, Hamm\u2019s claim might be meritorious under <em>Apprendi </em>if the rule of that decision was available to him. But the <em>Teague </em>bar applies without regard to the merits of the underlying claim, or that doctrine would have no function and meaning. The effect of McCoy\u2019s holding that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review \u2014 or more accurately, that <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable to cases in which the conviction had become final before that decision was released \u2014 is to bar all <em>Apprendi </em>claims in such cases whether or not they are meritorious.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">.Although the district court denied this claim on the merits, the government contends that it could and should have been denied as untimely, because the claim was first raised in a motion for reconsideration that was filed outside the one-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (para. 6). Hamm argues that the claim was timely raised because the underlying motion was filed within the one-year limitations period, and the motion for reconsideration was filed within the time for such motions. We need not address this untimeliness issue because of our holding that the claim is barred from \u00a7 2255 review applies regardless of whether it is also barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">For the same reason, we need not address an issue arising from the fact that Hamm raised the <em>Apprendi </em>claim for the first time in a motion for reconsideration after the district court had denied all the claims in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion. That issue is whether the motion for reconsideration is an impermissible attempt to circumvent the restrictions on second or successive motions that are contained in \u00a7 2255 (para. 8) and \u00a7 2244(a)-(b). If it is, the district court should have denied the motion for failure to comply with \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), and any application in this Court for permission to file a second motion in order to raise the <em>Apprendi </em>claim would have been denied because of In <em>re Joshua, </em>224 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir.2000). For present purposes only, we assume that the motion for reconsideration Hamm filed is not subject to the restrictions on second and successive motions, and we will treat his <em>Apprendi </em>claim as though it had been raised in the \u00a7 2255 motion he initially filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1277-12\">. Hamm argues that we should not apply the <em>Teague </em>bar because the government did not raise it in a timely fashion. Of course, the government did not raise any defenses to the <em>Apprendi </em>claim in the district court, because the court denied the claim on the merits without a response from the government. In any event, as the <em>McCoy </em>opinion establishes, 266 F.3d at 1254, this Court can and should apply the <em>Teague </em>bar to <em>Apprendi </em>claims even when that defense was not raised in the district court. <em>See also Spaziano v. Singletary, </em>36 F.3d 1028, 1041-42 n. 5 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1277-13\">. In his reply brief, shifting from the position he took in the district court, Hamm argues that for Counts II and III the maximum sentence to which he should have been exposed is not the ten years (enhanced from five years because of a prior conviction) set out in 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), but because of \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(4) and 844, the appropriate maximum sentence for those counts is one year. He cites <em>United States v. Lowe, </em>143 F.Supp.2d 613 (S.D.W.Va.)(2000), in support of that position. Putting aside the fact that Hamm did not raise this contention until he filed his reply brief, it is just as Jeagne-barred as the earlier version of his <em>Apprendi </em>claim relating to those counts,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A6eY\">. The government did not argue procedural default in this case, and in view of our decision that the <em>Apprendi </em>claim is <em>Teague-barred, </em>we have no need to address that issue, anyway.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
