He argues that the (1) Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) improperly evaluated his allegations of pain; (2) the ALJ did not give appropriate weight to the Veterans Administration\u2019s (\u201cVA\u201d) determination that he was permanently and totally disabled; and (3) the ALJ relied solely on expert witness testimony and not his medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\n<em>1. Allegations of Pain</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The ALJ did not improperly evaluate the claimant\u2019s allegations of pain. Whether pain is disabling is an issue for the ALJ, who has the primary responsibility for resolving conflicts in the evidence. <em>See Carrier v. Sullivan, </em>944 F.2d 243, 247 (5th Cir.1991). It is within the ALJ\u2019s discretion to determine the disabling nature of a claimant\u2019s pain, and the ALJ\u2019s determination is entitled to considerable deference. <em>See Wren v. Sullivan, </em>925 F.2d 123, 128 (5th Cir.1991); <em>James v. Bowen, </em>793 F.2d 702, 706 (5th Cir.1986). The determination whether an applicant is able to work despite some pain is within the province of the administrative agency and should be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Jones v. Heckler, </em>702 F.2d 616, 622 (5th Cir.1983). Moreover, pain must be constant, unremitting, and wholly unresponsive to therapeutic treatment to be disabling. <em>See Falco v. Shalala, </em>27 F.3d 160, 163 (5th Cir.1994). Subjective complaints of pain must also be corroborated by objective medical evidence. <em>See Houston v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1012, 1016 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In the instant case, the ALJ properly considered Chambliss\u2019 complaints of chest pain. However, the ALJ determined that Chambliss\u2019 statements concerning his impairments, i.e., chest pain, and their impact on his ability to work were \u201cnot entirely credible in light of the reports of the treating and examining practitioners and the medical history.\u201d The ALJ concluded that \u201cnothing [in the medical records] shows significant ongoing cardiac problems or any basis for restricting the claimant to less than light work activity, limited by seizure precautions and a restriction from exposure to concentrated pulmonary irritants.\u201d (Tr. At 14). Based upon the medical records in evidence, we find the ALJ\u2019s determination that the claimant\u2019s alleged pain was not sufficient enough to prevent substantial gainful employment to be supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\n<em>2. VA Disability Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">A VA rating of total and permanent disability is not legally binding on the Commissioner because the criteria applied by the two agencies is different, but it is evidence that is entitled to a certain amount of weight and must be considered by the ALJ. <em>See Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 394 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Latham v. Shalala, </em>36 F.3d 482, 483 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Rodriguez v. Schweiker, </em>640 F.2d 682, 686 (5th Cir.1981). In <em>Rodriguez </em>and its progeny, we have sometimes referred to a VA disability determination as being entitled to \u201cgreat weight.\u201d While this is true in most cases, the relative weight to be given this type of evidence will vary depending upon the factual circumstances of each case. Since the regulations for disability status differ between the SSA and the VA, ALJs need not give \u201cgreat weight\u201d to a VA disability determination if they adequately explain the valid reasons for not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">In the case at bar, the ALJ considered the VA\u2019s determination that Chambliss was permanently and totally disabled, but gave it diminished weight. However, the ALJ provided specific reasons for giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ing the VA determination diminished weight. First, the ALJ noted that the VA disability determination was made only a year after Chambliss\u2019 heart surgery. Second, although not entirely clear from the ALJ\u2019s decision, the ALJ apparently found that the VA disability determination and the treating physician\u2019s opinion that Cham-bliss could not work were \u201cconclusory\u201d in nature because they did not adequately explain why Chambliss could not engage in light work activity. Furthermore, the ALJ evidently discounted the treating physician\u2019s opinion because it was made as part of an application for food stamps (based upon need). Because the ALJ considered the VA disability determination and set forth valid reasons for giving the determination diminished weight, we cannot say that the ALJ erred simply because it did not give \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the VA disability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\n<em>S. Inappropriate Weight Given to Expert Witness Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Chambliss argues for the first time in this appeal that the ALJ based his decision solely upon the expert witness\u2019 testimony and not the medical records. As a general rule, this court does not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Kinash v. Callahan, </em>129 F.3d 736, 739 n. 10 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, it is not necessary to address this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">A <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Our review of the evidence indicates a mixed record concerning Chambliss\u2019 health problems and their impact on his ability to engage in substantial gainful work activity during the relevant time period. However, the task of weighing the evidence is the province of the ALJ. Our job is merely to determine if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole which supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 240 (5th Cir.1994). Since substantial evidence does exist, the ALJ\u2019s decision is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\">. We note, however, that Chambliss\u2019 contention is without merit because the ALJ based his decision upon both the testimony elicited from the expert witness as well as claimant\u2019s medical records. The relative weight to be given these pieces of evidence is within the ALJ\u2019s discretion. <em>See Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 347 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
