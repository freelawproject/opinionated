L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (8) and (9) (1992 ed.), which define the taxable net worth of domestic and foreign intangible property corporations. The challenged provisions allow a domestic intangible property corporation to deduct from its taxable net worth the value of a subsidiary of which it owns 80% or more of the voting stock, but only if that subsidiary is incorporated in Massachusetts. A foreign intangible property corporation may deduct from its taxable net worth the value of a subsidiary of which it owns 80% or more of the voting stock, but only if that subsidiary is incorporated outside of Massachusetts and does no business in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs allege that the excise discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, and also that the excise discriminates on the basis of domicil in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs commenced this action in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1 (1992 ed.); G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1 (1992 ed.); and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1988). A single justice of this court reserved and reported the case to the full court based on the pleadings and the statement of agreed facts. We conclude that the challenged provisions of the corporate excise, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (8) and (9), facially discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We remand the matter of attorney\u2019s fees to the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>1. <em>Constitutionality of excise. </em>We outline briefly the structure of the corporate excise as applied to both domestic and foreign intangible property corporations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Massachusetts imposes a corporate excise on domestic corporations \u201cfor the right ... to exist as such an organization and for the enjoyment under the protection of the laws of the commonwealth, of the powers, rights, privileges and immunities\u201d derived from its corporate existence and operation. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32 (1992 ed.). See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39 (1992 ed.), as to foreign corporations. Both domestic and foreign corporations \u201cexercising [their] charter [s], or qualified to do business or actually doing business in the commonwealth,\u201d must pay the excise. \u00a7\u00a7 32, 39. The excise is measured by a percentage of a corporation\u2019s net worth plus a percentage of the corporation\u2019s net income. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">For domestic intangible property corporations, net worth is calculated according to the definition set forth in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (8).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under this provision, a domestic corporation may exclude from its taxable net worth the value of its investment in a subsidiary corporation of which it owns 80% or more of the voting stock, but only if that subsidiary is incorporated in Massachusetts. A subsidiary incorporated outside of Massachusetts, is not excludable from the net worth calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">For foreign intangible property corporations, a different net worth definition applies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (9), a foreign corporation may exclude from its taxable net worth the value of its investment in a subsidiary of which it owns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>80% or more of the voting stock, but only if that subsidiary does not do business in Massachusetts. The Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) has construed this provision to mean that subsidiaries are excludable only if they are not doing business in Massachusetts and they are incorporated outside of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The plaintiffs, Perini Corporation (Perini), Perini Land and Development Corporation (PL&amp;D), Dynatech Corporation (Dynatech), and Neworld Bancorp, Inc. (Neworld), are all intangible property corporations as defined in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (11). Each plaintiff conducts business in Massachusetts and is subject to the annual corporate excise. Each plaintiff is also a parent corporation which owns 80% or more of the voting stock of one or more subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Two plaintiffs, Perini and Dynatech, are Massachusetts corporations with subsidiaries incorporated both in and outside of Massachusetts. Many of the subsidiaries owned by these corporations either do business in Massachusetts or are incorporated in Massachusetts, and as such, must also pay the annual corporate excise. Under the terms of \u00a7 30 (8), Perini and Dynatech have been able to exclude from their taxable net worth the value of their Massachusetts subsidiaries, but not the value of their foreign subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The other two plaintiffs, PL&amp;D and Neworld, are both foreign corporations each of which wholly owns a Massachusetts subsidiary. Because PL&amp;D and Neworld are foreign corporations, neither corporation has been able to exclude from its taxable net worth the value of its Massachusetts subsidiary. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (9).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Before considering whether the challenged excise violates interstate commerce, we consider whether the excise has a sufficient effect on interstate commerce to evoke commerce clause scrutiny. <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>401 Mass. 244, 248 (1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 818 (1988). The plaintiffs are parent corporations which currently conduct business in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs own subsidiaries located both in and outside of Massachusetts. \u201cBy its nature, a unitary business is characterized by a flow of value among its compo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>nents.\u201d <em>Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Iowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue &amp; Fin., </em>505 U.S. 71, 76 (1992). The flow of value between the plaintiffs and their foreign subsidiaries clearly constitutes interstate commerce. This flow includes not only the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries, but also the flow of dividends, employee benefits, insurance, and other services from parent corporations to their subsidiaries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Having concluded that the excise has impact on interstate commerce, we turn next to the question whether the challenged provisions are unconstitutional under the commerce clause, which provides that \u201ccongress shall have power ... to regulate commerce . . . among the several states.\u201d \u201cThough phrased as a grant of regulatory power to Congress, the Clause has long been understood to have a \u2018negative\u2019 aspect that denies the States the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce.\u201d <em>Oregon Waste Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Quality, </em>114 S. Ct. 1345, 1349 (1994). The first step in analyzing a law subject to judicial scrutiny under the negative commerce clause is to determine whether the law regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce, or whether it discriminates against interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 1350. The term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d as used in this context means \u201cdifferential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The purpose of, or justification for, a law has no bearing on whether it is facially discriminatory. \u201cIf a restriction on commerce is discriminatory, it is virtually <em>per se </em>invalid.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>We conclude that the challenged provisions of the corporate excise facially discriminate against interstate commerce. Under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (8), a domestic parent corporation may exclude from its taxable net worth the value of its subsidiary, but only if that subsidiary is also incorporated in Massachusetts. This provision draws a distinction solely on the basis of the domicil of the subsidiary, and treats a domestic corporation more favorably if it chooses to acquire a domestic subsidiary, rather than a foreign subsidiary. Consequently, the statutory scheme imposes a heavier burden on domestic corporations who own <em>foreign </em>subsidiaries than on domestic corporations who own <em>domestic </em>subsidiaries. See <em>Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Iowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue &amp; Fin., supra </em>at 77 (Iowa statute that treated dividends received from foreign subsidiaries less favorably than those received from domestic subsidiaries facially discriminated against foreign commerce in violation of foreign commerce clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The challenged deductions also create an incentive for domestic corporations to acquire in-State subsidiaries, and penalize corporations that choose to cross State lines. State laws that tax a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses State lines than when it occurs entirely within the State have repeatedly been struck down as discriminatory. <em>Oregon Waste Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Quality, supra </em>at 1350, quoting <em>Chemical Waste Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>504 U.S. 334, 342 (1992). In <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Beer Inst., Inc., </em>491 U.S. 324, 326 (1989), a Connecticut statute requiring out-of-State shippers of beer to affirm that their posted prices for products sold to Connecticut wholesalers were no higher than the prices at which those products were sold in bordering States, was struck down as violative of the commerce clause. The Supreme Court held that the statute on its face discriminated against brewers and shippers of beer engaged in interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 341. The Court stated: \u201cThis discriminatory treatment establishes a substantial disincentive for companies doing business in Connecticut to engage in interstate commerce, essentially penalizing Connecticut brewers if they seek border-state markets and out-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>of-state shippers if they choose to sell both in Connecticut and in a border State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Beer Inst., Inc., supra, </em>the deductions at issue create a substantial disincentive for domestic parent corporations to engage in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The challenged provisions also treat foreign parent corporations less favorably than similarly situated domestic parent corporations. \u201cIn considering claims of discriminatory taxation under the Commerce Clause ... it is necessary to compare the taxpayers who are \u2018most similarly situated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Iowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue &amp; Fin., supra </em>at 80 n.23. Therefore, we compare a domestic corporation that owns a Massachusetts subsidiary to a foreign corporation that owns a Massachusetts subsidiary. Although the domestic corporation would be entitled to deduct the value of its subsidiary, the foreign corporation would not. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (8) and (9). Thus, as currently formulated, the excise discriminates against foreign corporations. See <em>West Lynn Creamery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>114 S. Ct. 2205, 2212, 2214 (1994), rev\u2019g <em>West Lynn Creamery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Food &amp; Agric., </em>415 Mass. 8 (1993) (Massachusetts pricing order which effectively benefited in-State economic interests by burdening out-of-State competitors held to be unconstitutional in violation of commerce clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The commissioner argues, however, that the statute does not discriminate or unduly burden interstate commerce because the deduction given to foreign corporations for certain foreign subsidiaries adequately compensates for the deduction given to domestic corporations for domestic subsidiaries. The commissioner further argues that, because the deduction given to foreign corporations encourages foreign corporations to organize its subsidiaries <em>outside </em>of Massachusetts, there is no concomitant benefit to Massachusetts, and thus, no commerce clause violation. While it is true that under \u00a7 30 (9) a foreign corporation is entitled to deduct from its taxable net worth the value of any foreign subsidiaries which do no business in Massachusetts, the commissioner\u2019s argument fails to persuade us for several reasons. First, because the net worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>formulas for domestic and foreign corporations differ, the deduction given to a foreign corporation for a matching subsidiary is less favorable than that given to a domestic corporation. Compare G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (8), with G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (9). See <em>Oregon Waste Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Quality, supra </em>at 1352 (to justify charge on interstate commerce as compensatory tax, the burden on interstate commerce must not exceed burden on intrastate commerce). In addition, even assuming that the deductions given for matching subsidiaries are substantially equal, the statute as a whole still places an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. Under \u00a7 30 (8) and (9), only those corporate structures which are exclusively domestic or exclusively foreign are given a deduction. Once a domestic corporation acquires a subsidiary outside of its home State, and regardless of whether that subsidiary does business in Massachusetts, the parent corporation must include the value of that subsidiary in its net worth calculation. Thus, the effect of this taxing scheme is to encourage single-State corporate structures and to penalize parent corporations that choose to cross State lines in order to acquire or create foreign subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The discriminatory effect of such a taxing scheme is further demonstrated by applying the so-called \u201cinternal consistency test.\u201d \u201c[A] tax must have \u2018what might be called internal consistency \u2014 that is the [tax] must be such that, if applied by every jurisdiction,\u2019 there would be no impermissible interference with free trade.\u201d <em>Armco Inc. </em>v. <em>Hardesty, </em>467 U.S. 638, 644 (1984), quoting <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159, 169 (1983). Clearly, if every State applied a similar excise, the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries would be reduced and multi-State corporate structures would be significantly burdened. Such a scheme clearly interferes with free trade among the States and cannot be considered consistent with the commerce clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Because the excise is discriminatory, unless the commissioner can demonstrate that the excise \u201cadvances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives,\u201d it must be invalidated. <em>New Energy Co. of Ind. </em>v. <em>Limbach, </em>486 U.S. 269, 278 (1988). The commissioner\u2019s burden is a heavy one and any justification for the discriminatory restrictions must survive the strictest scrutiny. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Tully, </em>466 U.S. 388, 406-407 (1984). In demonstrating that the statute serves a legitimate local purpose, the commissioner must demonstrate that the statute is narrowly tailored to serve the State\u2019s asserted purpose. <em>Sporhase </em>v. <em>Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, </em>458 U.S. 941, 957-958 (1982). <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>401 Mass. 244, 251 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The commissioner argues that the deductions at issue advance the legitimate State goal of preventing double taxation. Although we agree that preventing double taxation is a legitimate local purpose, \u00a7 30 (8) and (9) are not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The excise deductions only prevent double taxation for Massachusetts corporations which own Massachusetts subsidiaries. All subsidiaries that do business in Massachusetts, regardless of their State of incorporation, however, are subject to the annual corporate excise. Thus, although double taxation is avoided for Massachusetts corporations which own only Massachusetts subsidiaries, the problem of double taxation persists for multi-State corporate families. In light of this fact, we conclude that the challenged provisions do not significantly advance the legitimate State interest in avoiding double taxation, and thus, cannot withstand scrutiny.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore hold that the chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>lenged provisions are unconstitutional in violation of the commerce clause. We need not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">2. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The plaintiffs also seek attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988 (1988). Section 1983 provides a Federal cause of action against every person who under the color of State law deprives another person of any rights, privileges, or immunities guaranteed by the Constitution or the laws of the United States. Section 1988 authorizes a court, in its discretion, to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in any action to enforce a provision of \u00a7 1983. A court\u2019s discretion in this regard is limited, however. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 89 n.1 (1989). A court should deny a prevailing party attorney\u2019s fees only if there are special circumstances which would render an award unjust. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The commissioner offers no special circumstances which would justify the denial of attorney\u2019s fees. Rather, he argues that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1988), evinces a congressional intent that adequate State remedies are to be the exclusive means for resolving State tax disputes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He further argues that because an adequate State remedy exists in this case, the plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">State courts have split on whether, in a State tax dispute, a plaintiff may maintain a \u00a7 1983 action where an adequate State remedy exists. Compare <em>State ex rel. Hanson </em>v. <em>Quill Corp., </em>500 N.W.2d 196, 197 (N.D.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 859 (1993) (where adequate remedy exists under State law, taxpayer not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>\u00a7 1988) with <em>Bung\u2019s Bar &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Township Council of Florence, </em>206 N.J. Super. 432, 459-462 (1985) (taxpayer entitled to maintain \u00a7 1983 action in State court regardless of adequacy of State remedies). Further, the United States Supreme Court has recently granted certiorari in the case of <em>Private Truck Council of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>879 P.2d 137 (Okla. 1994) (per curiam), cert. granted, 115 S. Ct. 714 (1995), which held that under the principles of comity and federalism, State courts should decline to impose Federal remedies where an adequate State remedy exists. Because the state of the law in this area is uncomfortably unsettled, see <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>498 U.S. 439, 464-465 (1991) (Kennedy, J., dissenting), and the nature and extent of the plaintiffs\u2019 relief has not been determined, we need not decide the issue of attorney\u2019s fees at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We remand the case to the county court for the entry of a suitable declaration that the challenged deductions in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (8) and (9), violate the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, and for the entry of an order that the Appellate Tax Board should decide the amount of the abatements to be made to the plaintiffs. We remand the matter of attorney\u2019s fees to the single justice for consideration and decision based on further, argument of counsel and such guidance as may be obtained in the opinion or opinions in <em>Private Truck Council of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Each plaintiff has applied to the Department of Revenue for abatement of the corporate excise which it paid in prior tax years.
