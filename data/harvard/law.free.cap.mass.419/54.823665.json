He admitted in the bench session to sufficient facts for a finding of delin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>quency on all counts except the intimidation of a witness complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was committed to the Department of Youth Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The juvenile appealed to the jury session. Pursuant to the juvenile\u2019s motion in limine, the judge conducted hearings to determine the competency of the three child witnesses, to whom we assign fictitious names. The judge determined that nine year old Donald and eight year old Peter were competent to testify. The judge declared the juvenile\u2019s youngest complainant, six year old Ned, incompetent to testify because he concluded that Ned did not fully comprehend the consequences of telling a lie. Pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge allowed Ned\u2019s mother to testify about her son\u2019s ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tra judicial statements because he found that Ned had made those statements \u201cunder circumstances inherently demonstrating a special guarantee of reliability.\u201d See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81 (c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the judge allowed the juvenile\u2019s motion for a required finding of not delinquent with respect to two of the complaints charging the juvenile with one count of rape of Ned and one count of kidnapping Ned. The jury subsequently found the juvenile delinquent on all charges except one count of indecent assault and battery of Ned. On March 25, 1992, the juvenile was committed to the Department of Youth Services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The juvenile filed a timely notice of appeal, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The juvenile asserts five issues on appeal. First, he argues that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81, on its face violates his right to confront the witnesses against him as guaranteed under art. 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. Second, the juvenile argues that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81, is unconstitutional as applied in this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the judge did not comply with the requirements of the statute. Third, the juvenile asserts that the judge erred in allowing an expert opinion on the ultimate issue in the case. Fourth, the juvenile asserts that the judge erred in allowing hearsay testimony under the guise of fresh complaint. Fifth, the juvenile asserts that the judge committed reversible error when he refused to give certain requested instructions to the jury on the credibility of child witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We reverse because the judge erred in allowing an expert to testify that, in her opinion, Donald and Ned were sexually abused. We need not, therefore, reach the juvenile\u2019s other assertions of error. However, because the issue may arise on retrial, we discuss some of the juvenile\u2019s arguments in regard to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the evidence before the jury. In the summer of 1990, the juvenile constructed a tree house near his home. Several neighborhood children assisted in building the tree house, including Donald, Peter, and Ned, the complainants. One could climb up to the tree house using either a ladder or a rope. After the tree house was built, the three younger children played in and around it with the older boys, the juvenile and his cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Donald and Peter testified that in this location, the juvenile and his cousin touched the three younger boys, performed acts on the younger boys amounting to oral and anal rape, and forced them to perform similar acts on the older boys as well as on each other. The juvenile and his cousin also allegedly forced the three younger boys to take off their clothes and to watch as the older boys pulled down their pants and performed sexual acts on each other. Donald testified that the juvenile had, on several occasions, pulled up the ladder and rope to the tree house and blocked the door to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>prevent the younger boys from leaving. Neither Donald nor Peter came forward immediately, nor could either boy state when precisely the abuse had occurred. Both children, however, did relate the timing of the acts of sexual abuse to the construction of the tree house.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Following the alleged abuse, Dr. Deborah Madansky, a child psychiatrist and an expert in child abuse, conducted physical examinations and clinical interviews of Donald and Ned. She also conducted separate interviews with their parents. At trial, she testified generally about the effect of sexual abuse on children, and she explained the psychological dimensions of disclosure. Dr. Madansky testified, over objectian, that in her opinion Donald and Ned had been sexually abused. She also relayed to the jury, over objection, what Ned had told her about the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-18\">As noted above, during the course of the trial, the judge determined that Ned was not competent to testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He found that Ned could relate the events and be cross-examined. The judge further found that Ned could articulate the difference between the truth and a lie. However, the trial judge was not convinced that Ned understood the consequences of lying. Subsequently, the judge conducted a voir dire hearing to determine whether the hearsay statements Ned made to his mother should be admitted under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-27\">During the voir dire hearing, Ned\u2019s mother testified that Ned first disclosed the alleged abuse to her in May, 1991. She took ten pages of notes while Ned made the disclosures, and recorded his statements in a journal. She also told about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>certain disclosures made to her by Ned and Peter. Following her voir dire testimony, the judge concluded that Ned\u2019s hearsay statements could be admitted pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He concluded that Ned\u2019s mother had made \u201cmore or less\u201d contemporaneous notes of the statements. He considered the clarity of the statements and noted that Ned\u2019s statements to his mother were consistent with those he made to Dr. Madansky. The judge also found that the statements were made at the locus of the alleged abuse while Ned was not under undue stress. Consequently, the judge ruled that Ned\u2019s statements were made in circumstances inherently demonstrating a special guarantee of reliability. Ned\u2019s mother then testified before the jury about what Ned had told her about the alleged sexual abuse of the three children.</p>\n<p id=\"ANb\">1. <em>Expert testimony. </em>The juvenile asserts that the judge committed reversible error in allowing Dr. Madansky, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, to give an opinion as to whether Ned and Donald had been the victims of sexual abuse. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AHl\">A trial judge has broad discretion with respect to the admission of expert testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 628 (1989). Expert testimony on matters within the witness\u2019s field of expertise is admissible when it will aid the jury in reaching a decision. <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>400 Mass. 550, 553 (1987). <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"Ajh\">We have held that a question calling for an opinion which is in the domain of the expert\u2019s professional knowledge is not necessarily to be excluded merely because the expert\u2019s conelusion reaches or approaches the ultimate issue before the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCorte, </em>373 Mass. 700, 705 (1977). <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, supra </em>at 105. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montmeny, </em>360 Mass. 526, 527-528 (1971). \u201cAn expert may not, however, offer his opinion on issues that the jury are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>equally competent to assess, such as credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, supra. </em>Such an opinion impermissibly would intrude upon the jury\u2019s vital factfinding function. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 201-202 (1987). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>417 Mass. 536, 541 (1994) (stating the same principle, but concluding that behavioral characteristics were a proper subject for expert opinion). An expert may not render an opinion about a witness\u2019s credibility because, the jury are capable of making that assessment without an expert\u2019s aid. <em>Ianello, supra </em>at 202. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. 325, 331 n.12 (1986) (\u201cWhether a witness testifies truthfully or according to some fictional script is for the jury to decide\u201d). \u201cOn such questions, the influence of an expert\u2019s opinion may threaten the independence of the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, supra </em>at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We have allowed expert testimony relating generally to behavioral characteristics of sexual assault and sexual abuse victims. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 421 (1990) (expert\u2019s testimony relating to rape and sexual assault syndrome generally, and not relating to the victims, was properly admitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, supra </em>at 630 (expert testimony about the general behavioral characteristics of sexually abused children was admissible, where expert made no references of comparison to the child witness). Such information is beyond the jury\u2019s common knowledge and may aid them in reaching a decision. However, we have never extended this holding to allow an expert to testify that an alleged victim was in fact sexually assaulted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We refuse to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Dr. Madansky\u2019s opinion testimony that Donald and Ned were sexually abused was tantamount to an expert opinion that the children\u2019s claims of sexual abuse were likely true. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 147-148 (1994). Although Dr. Madansky\u2019s \"testimony fell short of explicitly rendering an opinion on the credibility of the child witnesses, we see little difference in the final result. Her testimony that the child Ned was sexually abused, being based in large part on his statements to her, was essentially a statement vouching for Ned\u2019s credibility. It would be unrealistic to allow this type of expert testimony and then expect the jurors to ignore it when evaluating the credibility of the alleged child victims. Such testimony could substantially influence the jury\u2019s decision about whom to' believe. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, supra </em>at 201-202. It was within the province of the jury to determine whether the children were sexually abused. By allowing Dr. Madansky\u2019s opinion testimony that Donald and Ned were sexually abused, the judge committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">2. <em>General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 81. </em>We next consider the juvenile\u2019s assertion that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81, on its face contravenes art. 12. We do not, however, rule that the statute is facially unconstitutional, since we need not reach that issue in light of our ruling, on other grounds, that the matter must go back for retrial. See <em>Manor </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Cedar Junction, </em>416 Mass. 820, 824 (1994) (constitutional issues should not be addressed except as a matter of last resort). We assume the statute to be facially valid, for purposes of discussion, but offer these comments for guidance on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The Justices analyzed the precursor to this statute in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>406 Mass. 1201 (1989). That 1989 bill (Senate No. 795) would have allowed out-of-court statements to be admitted substantively in a number of circumstances, including where the child was unavailable as a witness for any of several reasons (including a refusal to testify), and there was corroborative evidence of sexual contact. <em>Id. </em>at 1202 n.2, 1211, 1217. We expressed a variety of concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>with the proposed bill\u2019s constitutionality. For example, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass. 733, 745 (1982), we noted that the bill did not explicitly require a showing of good faith and due diligence in establishing unavailability. <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1211. We also stated that a child witness\u2019s refusal to testify does not reach that measure of necessity which justifies other hearsay exceptions. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirouac, </em>405 Mass. 557, 562-563 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, supra </em>at 332. In addition, we were concerned because the bill did not require that a child witness\u2019s prior statements have been made under oath in order to be admitted for their truth. <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1212. Additionally, we stated that the criteria for determining the reliability of admissible statements under the bill were inadequate and that the proposed hearsay exception did not have the same guarantees of reliability as other hearsay exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at 1212-1213, 1215-1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The present statute, for the most part, seems to address the concerns we expressed in <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra. </em>We would, however, impose a further requirement for the use of child hearsay statements pursuant to the statute. We believe that, if a child witness\u2019s out-of-court statements are to be admitted substantively, there must be other evidence, independently admitted, that corroborates those hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Article 12 provides that every criminal defendant \u201cshall have a right ... to meet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d In other cases interpreting art. 12, we have noted that this language establishes a clear constitutional mandate that should not be easily circumvented. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>417 Mass. 498, 501-502, 504 (1994); <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1207, 1209-1210; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass. 534, 553 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass. 733, 741-742 (1982). Indeed, \u201c[cjonstitutional language more definitively guaranteeing the right to a direct confrontation between witness and accused is difficult to imagine.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra </em>at 541-542. The plain interpretation of the phrase \u201cto meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the witnesses against him face to face\u201d is that \u201cthe accused, shall not be tried without the presence, in a court of law, of both himself and the witnesses testifying against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">While we have emphasized the importance of the constitutionally guaranteed confrontation right, we also \u201crecognize that the right to confrontation under art. 12 . . . may yield in appropriate, although limited, circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 503. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra </em>at 545-546. \u201c[T]he necessities of the case and the attainment of justice justify admission of hearsay against a criminal defendant in some cases.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, supra </em>at 741-742. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>404 Mass. 204, 207 (1989) (declaration against penal interest); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polian, </em>288 Mass. 494, 497 (1934) (dying declaration with knowledge of impending death); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>275 Mass. 320, 333-334 (1931) (prior recorded testimony). See also <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1207-1209, 1212-1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Although the confrontation right may yield in limited circumstances, our Constitution dictates that a hearsay statement may be used against a criminal defendant only when such use is necessary and when the statement is reliable. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1209-1210; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra </em>at 545. The prosecution bears the burden of showing the necessity for admitting the out-of-court statement by establishing the declarant\u2019s unavailability to testify during the trial. <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1210. Once unavailability is established, the statement may be admissible if imbued with such \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d that there is no material departure from the reasoning behind the confrontation right. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra </em>at 545; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trigones, </em>397 Mass. 633, 637-638 (1986). Unless both unavailability and reliability are established, an out-of-court statement cannot be admitted against a criminal defendant. The confrontation right remains paramount. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>We recognize the need to protect children. Additionally, we are aware of the constitutional need to protect the rights of criminal defendants. \u201cThe right of the accused to be tried in the manner which our Constitution guarantees cannot dissolve under the pressures of changing social circumstance or societal focus. We have recognized before, in the context of interpreting art. 12, that \u2018[c] hanged conditions afford no warrant for straining the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra </em>at 553, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallo, supra </em>at 334. Indeed, \u201c[sjociety may justify a person\u2019s conviction only after a trial scrupulous in its adherence to a process which, so far as humanly possible, assures that the innocent are not mistakenly deprived of liberty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra. </em>Consequently, we set out procedures that a trial judge should follow when admitting such evidence pursuant to the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">We begin by discussing the Commonwealth\u2019s responsibilities when attempting to use child hearsay statements pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81. First, in order to provide the defendant with a meaningful opportunity to respond to hearsay allegations, the Commonwealth must give prior notice to the criminal defendant that it will seek to use such hearsay statements. Second, the \u201cCommonwealth must show, by more than a mere preponderance of evidence, a compelling need for use of such a procedure.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra </em>at 550. We noted in the <em>Bergstrom </em>case that \u201c[sjuch a compelling need could be shown where, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the recording of the testimony of a child witness outside the courtroom ... is shown to be necessary so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>as to avoid severe and long lasting emotional trauma to the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550. A similar requirement of necessity should be imposed where the Commonwealth wishes to introduce child hearsay statements pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We further require that any separate hearing regarding the reliability of a child witness\u2019s out-of-court statement be on the record, and that the judge\u2019s determination that the child\u2019s statement is reliable be supported by specific findings on the record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>Where possible without causing severe emotional trauma to the child witness, the defendant, and defense counsel should be given the opportunity to be present at the hearing. Expert testimony may aid the trial judge in determining whether the defendant\u2019s and defense counsel\u2019s presence at the hearing would severely traumatize the child witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Although the trial judge has discretion in finding both unavailability and reliability under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81, we note that, if the judge determines that the child is unavailable because the child is \u201cincompetent to testify,\u201d the judge\u2019s reasons for finding the child incompetent should not be those that call into question the reliability of the child\u2019s out-of-court statements. For example, if the trial judge finds that the child witness is incompetent to testify because the child is unable to tell the truth at the time of trial or does not know the consequences of not telling the truth in court, the judge should exercise extreme caution in allowing that child\u2019s out-of-court statements in evidence pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Finally, we require that, in order to admit a child witness\u2019s hearsay statements for substantive purposes under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81, there must be other independently admitted evidence that corroborates those out-of-court statements. This corroboration requirement would provide an additional guarantee of trustworthiness that would justify admitting the statement as substantive evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, supra </em>at 545.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The judgments are reversed and the verdicts are set aside.

L. c. 233, \u00a7 81, is unconstitutional, and further that the judge incorrectly applied the section\u2019s requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montmeny, </em>360 Mass. 526 (1971), does not dictate a different result. In that case, we held that a question as to whether what the expert physician had \u201cseen\u201d was \u201cconsistent with\u201d the history that he had obtained from the victim was not an attempt to elicit from the expert a direct opinion that the rape had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 528. We noted then, as we' do now, that \u201c[s]uch a direct opinion would have been . . . beyond the witness\u2019s appropriate province as an expert witness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b86-21\">We discuss procedures supplemental to those outlined in the statute. We note, however, that the judge also must strictly adhere to the statutory procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-23\">For example, in this case there was no expert testimony with respect to \u201cthe clarity of the statement, meaning, the child\u2019s capacity to observe, remember, and give expression to that which such child has seen, heard, or experienced.\u201d This contravenes the explicit requirement of subsection (c) (i) that a treating psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinician so testify when a judge finds that the child\u2019s prior statement was \u201cmade under circumstances inherently demonstrating a special guarantee of reliability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">We do not consider the judge\u2019s oral findings of reliability in this case to have been adequately specific, especially since he apparently relied erroneously on the expert\u2019s opinion (see part 1, <em>supra) </em>that Ned had been sexually abused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\">We note that the jury in this case were not informed that the judge had declared Ned to be incompetent because Ned \u201ccouldn\u2019t convey to me that he understood what the consequences would be of lying.\u201d Putting aside the question of how such a witness\u2019s extra judicial hearsay statements could be viewed as \u201creliable\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81 (a) and (c), it would seem highly preferable, on request, for the jury to have been informed of this finding. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 81 (c) (iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Other related concerns of the court arising from a care and protection hearing, governed by G.
