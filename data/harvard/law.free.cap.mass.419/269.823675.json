L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3 (1992 ed.). The Commonwealth contends that the warrantless arrest of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>was valid because G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 6 (7) (1992 ed.), authorizes police to make warrantless arrests if there is probable cause to believe that an individual has committed a misdemeanor involving \u201cabuse\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. The Commonwealth argues that G. L. c. 209A may be read harmoniously with G. L. c. 275, or alternatively, that G. L. c. 209A impliedly repeals the warrant requirement of G. L. c. 275 in the context of domestic abuse. The Commonwealth\u2019s final contention is that, even if the warrantless arrest of the defendant was unlawful, dismissal of the complaint was too harsh a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The facts of this case are largely undisputed. On June 14, 1993, Barnstable police were dispatched to the defendant\u2019s home and spoke with the defendant\u2019s girl friend. As a result of this conversation, the defendant was arrested without a warrant and charged with threatening to commit a crime in violation of G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 <em>2.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because no protective orders were in effect, the defendant was not charged with a violation of G. L. c. 209A.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, he was arraigned and held on bail for fourteen days awaiting trial. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss alleging that his arrest was unlawful because it failed to comply with the statutory warrant requirement set forth in G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3. At the motion hearing, the parties stipulated to the following: (1) that the defendant was arrested without a warrant; (2) that there was no clerk magistrate hearing. No other testimony or evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>dence was offered for the record. The judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint. The Commonwealth appeals from this decision. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">1. <em>Validity of the warrantless arrest under G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. </em>We first consider whether the warrantless arrest of the defendant was valid under G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. Section 2 of G. L. c. 275 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201cIf complaint is made to any such court or justice that a person has threatened to commit a crime against the person or property of another, such court or justice shall examine the complainant and any witnesses who may be produced, on oath, reduce the complaint to writing and cause it to be subscribed by the complainant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Section 3 of G. L. c. 275 states further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cIf, upon such examination, it is found there is just cause to fear that such crime may be committed, such court or justice shall issue a warrant, reciting the substance of the complaint, and requiring the officer to whom it is directed forthwith to apprehend the person \u25a0 complained of . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The statutory scheme set out in G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, is clear and unambiguous. Before arresting someone for threatening to commit a crime, the court must examine the sworn testimony of the complainant, reduce the complaint to writing, and on a finding of \u201cjust cause\u201d to fear that the threatened crime may be committed, issue an arrest warrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present case, however, the procedures outlined - in G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, were not followed. The complainant, the defendant\u2019s girl friend, did not give sworn testimony regarding the alleged threats. There was no finding that there was \u201cjust cause\u201d to fear that the threatened crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>may be committed, and no warrant was issued for the defendant\u2019s arrest. Because the clear directives of the statute were ignored, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s arrest was unlawful. See <em>Wagenmann </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>829 F.2d 196, 207 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">2. <em>Applicability of G. L. c. 209A. </em>The Commonwealth argues, however, that the warrantless arrest of the defendant was valid because G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 6 (7) <em>(b), </em>authorizes warrantless arrests for certain misdemeanors in the context of domestic abuse. We consider whether G. L. c. 209A applies to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u201cAt common law, \u2018[a] peace officer, in the absence of statute . . . may arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor which (1) involves a breach of the peace, (2) is committed in the presence or view of the officer . . . and (3) is still continuing at the time of the arrest or only interrupted, so that the offence and the arrest form parts of one transaction\u2019 (citations omitted).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>405 Mass. 332, 334 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>288 Mass. 294, 297 (1934). With the enactment of G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 6 (7), the Legislature expanded the authority of police to make warrantless arrests for certain misdemeanors in the context of domestic abuse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 6 (7), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cWhenever any law officer has reason to believe that a family or household member has been abused or is in danger of being abused, such officer shall use all reasonable means to prevent further abuse. The officer shall take, but not be limited to the following action: . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>When there are no vacate, restraining, or no-contact orders or judgments in effect, arrest shall be the preferred response whenever an officer witnesses or has probable cause to believe that a person: <em>(a) </em>has committed a felony; (b) <em>has committed a misdemeanor involving abuse as defined in section one of this chapter, </em>(c) has committed an assault and battery in violation of section thirteen A of chapter two hundred and sixty-five\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In the present case, because there is no evidence that the defendant committed either a felony or an assault and battery, the only possible justification for his warrantless arrest is if the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that the defendant \u201ccommitted a misdemeanor involving abuse as defined in section one of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u201cAbuse\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, as: \u201c[T]he occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members: <em>(a) </em>attempting to cause or causing physical harm; <em>(b) placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm-, </em>(c) causing another to engage involuntarily in sexual relations by force, threat or duress\u201d (emphasis added). It is not alleged that the defendant either physically harmed or attempted physically to harm his girl friend on the date of the arrest. Nor is it alleged that the defendant caused his girl friend to engage involuntarily in sexual relations. Thus, any attempt to justify the defendant\u2019s warrant-less arrest must be based on a claim that the defendant\u2019s threats \u201cploc[ed] [his girl friend] in fear of imminent serious physical harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">On the limited record before us, we cannot say that the defendant\u2019s threats constituted \u201cabuse\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. The language of the relevant definition of \u201cabuse,\u201d \u201cplacing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm,\u201d requires that the threatened harm be not only \u201cphysical,\u201d but also \u201cimminent\u201d and \u201cserious.\u201d In the present case, however, there was no evidence offered as to the substance of the alleged threats. It is not clear whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>crime threatened involved bodily harm, or mere property damage. Furthermore, there was no evidence offered as to \u201cimminence\u201d or \u201cseriousness\u201d of the threatened harm. The only evidence offered at the motion hearing was that the defendant was arrested without a warrant, and that there was no clerk or magistrate hearing. On this record alone, we cannot say that the defendant\u2019s actions constituted \u201cabuse\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1 of G. L. c. 209A. As such, we conclude that G. L. c. 209A may not presently be relied on to justify the warrantless arrest of the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We point out, however, that a warrantless arrest for \u201cabuse\u201d properly may be made under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 6 (7), if a police officer has reason to believe that a defendant\u2019s conduct with respect to a person protected under G. L. c. 209A, placed the person in fear of imminent serious physical harm. The appropriate complaint in such a circumstance would be one for assault under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (1992 ed.). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gordon, 407 Mass. 340, 349 (1990). The arrest, and ensuing assault complaint, are based on the application of G. L. c. 209A and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, and do not involve the procedures called for by G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3. If in fact the arresting police officer in this case believed that the defendant committed the abuse under G. L. c. 209A, it would still be open to the Commonwealth to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>miss the present complaint and to seek a new complaint, under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, charging the defendant with assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">3. <em>Dismissal of complaint. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s final contention is that, even if the arrest did not comply with G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, dismissal of the complaint was too harsh a remedy. We agree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">We begin our analysis with the general rule that \u201c[a]n illegal arrest, without more, has never been viewed as a bar to subsequent prosecution, nor as a defense to a valid conviction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463, 474 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of the United States has never held that searches and seizures contrary to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution warrant dismissal of the indictment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 366 (1981). Rather, the remedy for an illegal arrest is suppression of the evidence tainted by the police misconduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>413 Mass. 50, 58-59 (1992) (where dismissal of indictments would have little or no deterrent effect, suppression of evidence is proper remedy for Fourth Amendment violation); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>948 F.2d 914, 916 (5th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 987 (1992) (remedy for Fourth Amendment violation is exclusion of evidence rather than dismissal of indictment). \u201cAn unlawful detention cannot deprive the government of the opportunity to prove guilt through the introduction of evidence wholly untainted by the police misconduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fredette, 396 Mass. 455, 459 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Dismissal of a complaint is a drastic remedy which should be used in only a limited number of circumstances. \u201cAbsent egregious misconduct or at least a serious threat of prejudice, the remedy of dismissal infringes too severely on the public interest in bringing guilty persons to justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 210, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983). Whether an indictment should be dismissed turns primarily on the ability of the defendant to obtain a fair trial after, and in light of, the police misconduct. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301, 312-313 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pellegrini, </em>414 Mass. 402, 405-406 (1993) (\u201can indictment valid on its face should not be dismissed absent a showing that the defendant\u2019s ability to obtain a fair trial is prejudiced\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>405 Mass. 566, 588 (1989) (if the defendant \u201ccan receive a fair trial in spite of the police misconduct . . . that misconduct provides no reason to dismiss the charges\u201d). Although we have suggested that egregious prosecutorial misconduct, not resulting in prejudice to the defendant, might in some circumstances warrant dismissal of an indictment, we have never ordered the dismissal of charges in such a circumstance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra </em>at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In the present case, we conclude that, despite the unlawfulness of the defendant\u2019s arrest, the judge erred in dismissing the complaint. The defendant\u2019s trial was scheduled to begin two weeks after his arrest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There was no substantial del\u00e1y in the proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Mass. 351, 357 (1974) (failure of prosecutor to adhere to speedy trial standards warranted dismissal). In addition, there was no showing that the police misconduct prejudiced the defendant or in any way impeded his ability to obtain a fair trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>400 Mass. 283, 287-288 (1987) (where an attempt by police to intercept and record conversations between defendant and his attorneys failed to prejudice the defendant, dismissal of indictments was not warranted). Furthermore, although the police failed to comply with the warrant requirement of G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, the misconduct in this case was not so egregious as to warrant dismissal of the complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 199 (1985) (Commonwealth\u2019s failure to comply with discovery orders not sufficiently egregious to warrant dismissal); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, supra </em>at 207-210 (police officers\u2019 improper postarraignment interview without defense counsel not sufficiently egregious to warrant dismissal). Finally, any prejudice to the defendant may be remedied by suppression of illegally obtained evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Accordingly, the order dismissing the complaint for threatening to commit a crime, is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court. On remand, the Commonwealth has the option of trying the case on the original complaint if there remains any evidence after suppression, or bringing a new complaint under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, if the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that \u201cabuse\u201d had been committed under G. L. c. 209A.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The complaint against the defendant read: \u201cdid threaten to commit a crime against the person or property of another, to wit: domestic violence, in violation of G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In a footnote, citing no authority, the defendant raises the issue whether, because there is no statute in the Commonwealth criminalizing or defining the term \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d the complaint is facially deficient. We decline to consider issues which are not fully developed and are mentioned in only a cursory and conclusory fashion. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>381 Mass. 208, 214 n.7 (1980); <em>Beaton </em>v. <em>Land Court, </em>367 Mass. 385, 389, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 806 (1975). Furthermore, because this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we need not consider it. <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 88 (1977), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\">\u201cJust cause\u201d has been equated with \u201cclear and present danger.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>300 F.

Mass. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The Legislature has the power to enact legislation which provides for warrantless arrests, so long as the minimum standards set out by the Supreme Court are met. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>358 Mass. 721, 724-725 (1971). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>792 F. Supp. 768, 771 n.2 (M.D. Ala. 1992). The constitutionality of a warrantless arrest depends on whether the arresting officer had probable cause at the time of the arrest. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 417 (1976). The issue of the existence of probable cause at the time of the warrantless arrest has not been raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The authority of police to make warrantless arrests for certain misdemeanors involving abuse exists only if the alleged abuse occurs between \u201cfamily or household members.\u201d The term \u201c[f]amily or household members\u201d is defined in part in G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, as persons who <em>\u201care or have been in a substantive dating or engagement relationship, </em>which shall be adjudged by district, probate or Boston municipal courts consideration of the following factors: (1) the length of time of the relationship; (2) the type of relationship; (3) the frequency of interaction between the parties; and (4) if the relationship has been terminated by either person, the length of time elapsed since the termination of the relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The defendant argues that G. L. c. 209A does not apply to this case because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the defendant and his girl friend were in a \u201csubstantive dating relationship.\u201d Because we conclude that on this record the defendant\u2019s threats did not constitute \u201cabuse\u201d under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, we do not reach the issue regarding the extent of the relationship. See <em>Brossard </em>v. <em>West Roxbury Div. of the Dist.
