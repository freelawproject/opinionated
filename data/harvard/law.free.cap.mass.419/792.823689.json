The plaintiff claims on appeal that the judge erred by granting the defendant\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>tian to strike his demand for a trial by jury. The plaintiff argues also that the judge erred in concluding that he failed to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">The plaintiff commenced this action in the Superior Court alleging that the defendant had refused to hire him for the position of premise sales representative on the basis of his handicap.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge granted summary judgment for the defendant on two of the plaintiffs three counts, allowing the plaintiffs claim under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (16) (1992 ed.), to remain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge also granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs demand for a jury trial. After a two-day bench trial, the judge determined that the plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination on the basis of a handicap and entered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff then filed a timely notice of appeal in the Appeals Court. The Appeals Court affirmed the decision of the Superior Court after concluding that the plaintiff did not have a right to a trial by jury for a handicap discrimination claim filed pursuant to G. L. c. 151B. 36 Mass. App. Ct. 148 (1994). We granted the plaintiffs application for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>appellate review. Although we conclude that a trial by jury is a matter of State constitutional right in cases of employment discrimination on the basis of a handicap, the judge\u2019s error in striking the plaintiff\u2019s claim for a trial by jury was not prejudicial because the plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination pursuant to G. L. c. 151B.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">1. <em>Right to a trial by jury. </em>The issue whether a plaintiff is entitled to a trial by jury on a claim of handicap discrimination in employment is an issue of first impression in the Commonwealth. We have stated that art. 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights \u201cpreserves the \u2018common law trial by jury in its indispensable characteristics as established and known at the time the Constitution was adopted\u2019 in 1780.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. Jarvenpaa, 404 Mass. 177, 185-186 (1989), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>237 Mass. 591, 596 (1921). In addition, we have concluded that \u201cthe Legislature may grant a right to a trial by jury to one who is aggrieved by a violation of a statute.\u201d <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 312 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 220, 226 (1994), an opinion released after the opinion of the Appeals Court in this case, we held that art. 15 protects a plaintiff\u2019s right to a trial by jury on a claim of employment discrimination based on sex.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As in <em>Dalis, </em>a plaintiff\u2019s handicap dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>crimination claim filed pursuant to G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (16), is \u201canalogous to common law actions sounding in both tort and contract.\u201d <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., supra </em>at 223. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff is constitutionally entitled to a trial by jury for his claim of employment discrimination based on his handicap. See art. 15; G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (16).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">2. <em>Prima facie case of handicap discrimination. </em>The plaintiff claims that the judge erred in concluding that he failed to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">We have recognized a distinction between employment discrimination cases where the plaintiff alleges \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d and those cases involving a claim of \u201cdisparate impact.\u201d See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 384 (1993), citing <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 227 (1978). In a \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d case, \u201cproof of the employer\u2019s discriminatory motive is critical.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 384-385. We have adopted, therefore, a framework of shifting burdens of persuasion and production of evidence that is \u201cintended progressively to sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual question of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 255 n.8 (1981). See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra. </em>This framework of shifting burdens, however, does not apply in a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d case because \u201cdiscriminatory motive is not an essential part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>of the proof.\u201d <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The present case is one of alleged \u201cdisparate treatment.\u201d In an employment discrimination case involving \u201cdisparate treatment,\u201d the plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., ante </em>437, 441 (1995); <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, ante </em>356, 361 (1995). To establish a prima facie case of \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d on the basis of a handicap, a plaintiff must produce some evidence that: (1) he is handicapped; (2) he is a qualified handicapped person and he applied for a position for which the employer was seeking applicants; (3) the employer rejected the plaintiff for the position in spite of his qualifications; (4) after the employer rejected the plaintiff, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants. See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 441, 445; <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, supra. </em>See also <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 135 &amp; n.5 (1976). The plaintiff does not have to <em>prove </em>each of the four elements to establish a prima facie case in order to avoid a directed verdict. See PJ. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 5.6.1 (6th ed. 1994); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2494 (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981). Rather, the plaintiff must produce evidence that, if believed, would be sufficient to establish facts that would entitle him to judgment. See P.J. Liacos, <em>supra </em>at 220 (stating that evidence must be such that \u201cjury could reasonably find either way\u201d as to existence of fact); 9 J. Wigmore, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">A \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d is one who \u201cis capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16). See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra </em>at 381-384. The issue on further appellate review is whether the plaintiff offered sufficient evidence that he was a. qualified handicapped person. If he did, the case should be remanded for a jury trial. If he did not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>despite the judge\u2019s erroneous ruling on the jury trial issue, there is no need to remand this matter to the Superior Court for trial. We conclude that the evidence was insufficient on the issue whether the plaintiff was a qualified handicapped person.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The defendant used a three-part testing process to screen applicants for the position of premise sales representative.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant considered hiring only those applicants who had passed all three tests. The third test replicates situations that confront premise sales representatives. The test measures skills such as oral communication skills, factfinding, quality of reasoning, and problem-solving ability. The evidence was that the test was a valid predictor of success on the job. The plaintiff failed the third test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the issue of qualified handicapped person was insufficient to submit the case to the jury. The judge\u2019s error in striking the plaintiff\u2019s demand for a jury trial was not prejudicial because the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The plaintiff had suffered an injury to his brain stem in an automobile accident in 1975. In 1986, the plaintiff applied for a sales representative position with the defendant. When the defendant declined to offer the plaintiff a job, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court alleging that the defendant had discriminated against him on the basis of his handicap in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1992 ed.), art. 114 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (1992 ed.). The plaintiff also filed a handicap discrimination claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. In his complaint filed in the Superior Court, the plaintiff made a demand for a trial by jury and sought, inter alla, compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest and costs, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1992 ed.), states: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful practice:. . . 16. For any employer, personally or through an agent, to dismiss from employment or refuse to hire, rehire or advance in employment or otherwise discriminate against, because of his handicap, any person alleging to be a qualified handicapped person, capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved with reasonable accommodation, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation required to be made to the physical or mental limitations of the person would impose an undue hardship to the employer\u2019s business.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides: \u201cIn all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has heretofore been otherways used and practiced, the parties have a right to a trial by jury; and this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless, in causes arising on the high seas, and such as relate to mariners\u2019 wages, the legislature shall hereafter find it necessary to alter it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">In <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 220 (1994), the plaintiff claimed that her employer had discharged her because she had become pregnant. The plaintiff filed suit under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1) (1992 ed.), claiming that her employer had discriminated against her on the basis of sex. On appeal from a Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s jury demand, we held that the plaintiff had a right to a jury trial on her G. L. c. 151B claim. See <em>id. </em>at 226. We decided first that the plaintiff\u2019s sex discrimination claim \u201c[fell] squarely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>within the language of art. 15\u201d because it was a \u201csuit between two persons which clearly set[] forth a controversy concerning property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. We then concluded that the plaintiffs claim was not within the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction, as it existed at the time of the adoption of the State Constitution, in either subject matter or remedy sought. See <em>id., </em>citing <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>180 Mass. 334, 355 (1902). Instead, we determined that \u201cthe plaintiffs sex discrimination claim [was] analogous to common law actions sounding in both tort and contract.\u201d <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., supra </em>at 223, citing <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Wilton Enters., Inc., </em>962 F.2d 120, 122-123 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that employment discrimination suits are comparable to common law tort and contract actions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">In the sales assessment process, the applicant participates in two separate role-playing exercises with three sales assessment staff members and the sales assessment staff director. The entire process takes approximately five and one-half hours. Each of the evaluators then rates the applicant on his performance based on eleven different criteria. The evaluator\u2019s results are combined and collectively result in one of three ratings: (1) more than acceptable; (2) acceptable, and; (3) not acceptable. Although the plaintiff had passed the first two tests, he received a rating of \u201cnot acceptable\u201d on the third test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">There was no evidence challenging the validity of the test.
