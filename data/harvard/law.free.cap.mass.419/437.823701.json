L. c. 151B (1992 ed.), and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 103 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated in this opinion, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment should not have been allowed. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>Reviewing the materials submitted for the summary judgment motion in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party (Blare), <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>418 Mass. 394, 396 (1994); <em>White </em>v. <em>University of Mass. at Boston, </em>410 Mass. 553, 557 (1991), we recite the following facts. The plaintiff was employed by Husky as a machine operator from 1984 until April, 1992. At the time he was terminated, plaintiff was fifty-seven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">From 1984 until 1992, the plaintiffs file was free of disciplinary notices. The plaintiff does not dispute that his supervisor submitted formal disciplinary notices against him during the four months preceding his termination (January 1, 1992, until April, 1992). Rather, the plaintiff presented evidence that workers not within the protected age category <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>who had similar disciplinary records were not terminated. To further support his contention that age, and not the disciplinary notices, were the basis of his termination, the plaintiff alleged that his supervisor asked on at least one occasion, \u201cAre you getting too [sic] old that you can\u2019t handle two machines?\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit further alleged that the supervisor told him that few people retired from Husky. On April 27, 1992, the plaintiff was terminated and younger employees assumed his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The defendants filed motions for summary judgment on the ground that in admitting the notices the plaintiff failed to present evidence tending to show that Husky\u2019s explanation that its decision based on the notices was a pretext. The judge ordered summary judgment be entered for the employer on the ground that the record was devoid of evidence \u201cto dispute the basic accuracy of the four documented disciplinary incidents of quality errors and low productivity in the three months between January 20 and the April 27 termination.\u201d We allowed the plaintiff\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We now reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">2. <em>Summary judgment standard. </em>Summary judgment is a disfavored remedy in the context of discrimination cases based on disparate treatment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>413 Mass. 698, 705 (1992) (\u201cwhere motive, intent, or other state of mind questions are at issue, summary judgment is often inappropriate\u201d), quoting <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communication Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 809 (1991), because the ultimate issue of discriminatory intent is a factual question, <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 572-573 (1985) (issue of intent in Federal discrimination cases is a question of fact). The ultimate question of the defendants\u2019 state of mind is elusive and rarely is established by other than circumstantial evidence, <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>chusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 137 (1976), which requires the jury to weigh the credibility of conflicting explanations of the adverse hiring decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">However, summary judgment is not always inappropriate in discrimination cases. Where a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment demonstrates that the plaintiffs evidence of intent, motive, or state of mind is insufficient to support a judgment in plaintiffs favor, we have upheld summary judgment in favor of defendants. See <em>Brunner, supra </em>at 705 (summary judgment for defendant where plaintiff failed to offer evidence sufficient to carry burden of persuasion on employer\u2019s discriminatory motive); <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Brigham &amp; Women\u2019s Hosp., </em>405 Mass. 432, 437-438 (1989) (summary judgment for defendant where plaintiff offered no admissible evidence that would carry burden of persuasion on intent at trial); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Area II Homecare for Senior Citizens, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 761, 770 (1986) (summary judgment for defendant where plaintiff did not offer evidence sufficient to carry burden of persuasion on employer\u2019s discriminatory motive at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">3. <em>Three-stage order of proof in discrimination cases. </em>General Laws c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (1992 ed.), provides in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful practice: ... 1B. For an employer in the private sector, by himself or his agent, because of the age of any individual, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual, or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.\u201d Section 1 (8) of G. L. c. 151B (1992 ed.) provides that \u201c[t]he term \u2018age\u2019 unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context, includes any duration of time since an individual\u2019s birth of greater than forty years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In applying Massachusetts\u2019 antidiscrimination statute, it has been our practice to follow the three-stage order of proof set forth by the United States Supreme Court under the Federal antidiscrimination provisions of Title VII. See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>371 Mass. 130, 134-136 (1976), citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973); <em>White </em>v. <em>University of Mass. at Boston, </em>410 Mass. 553, 557 (1991). Our holding in <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 163 (1987), stated that in interpreting G. L. c. 151B, \u201cwe may look to the interpretations of . . . the . . . Federal statute; we are not, however, bound by interpretations of the Federal statute in construing our own State statute.\u201d See also <em>Lynn Teachers Union, Local 1037 </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass. 515, 521-522 n.7 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Because the trial judge ruled that the plaintiff failed to \u201cdispute the basic accuracy\u201d of the disciplinary notices, the issue in this case is what evidence the plaintiff is required to produce at the third stage in the order of proof in discrimination cases to clear the summary judgment hurdle. It is useful to review each stage in the order of proof before reaching this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In the first stage, the plaintiff has the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Since our decision in <em>Wheelock College, supra, </em>a plaintiff carries the burden of a prima facie case of discrimination with evidence that: (1) he is a member of a class protected by G. L. c. 15IB; (2) he performed his job at an acceptable level; (3) he was terminated; and (4) his employer sought to fill the plaintiff\u2019s position by hiring another individual with qualifications similar to the plaintiffs. See also <em>White, supra </em>at 557. We noted in <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 135 n.5, that the elements of the plaintiffs initial burden may vary depending on the specific facts of a case. The prima facie case \u201celiminates the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiffs rejection,\u201d <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981), thereby creating a presumption of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In the second stage, the employer can rebut the presumption created by the prima facie case by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its hiring decision. <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 136, quoting <em>McDonnell Doug</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>las Corp., supra. </em>\u201c[A]n employer must not only give a lawful reason or reasons for its employment decision but also must produce credible evidence to show that the reason or reasons advanced were the real reasons.\u201d <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 138. This burden of production is not onerous. If the defendant fails to meet its burden, however, then the presumption created by the preponderance of evidence supporting a prima facie case entitles plaintiff to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Once the defendant articulates a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged hiring action, the proceedings have reached the third stage in the order of proof. What the plaintiff must prove in the third stage of the order of proof has been controversial in Federal courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502 (1993), the Federal circuit courts of appeals were divided into \u201cpretext plus\u201d and \u201cpretext only\u201d jurisdictions. Those in favor of the pretext plus position argue that the presumption of intentional discrimination created by the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case \u201cbursts\u201d when the defendant satisfies its second-stage burden of production, and requires a plaintiff in the third stage to prove that intentional discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>nation was the basis of the hiring decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The pretext only rule is similar to the pretext plus position in that the presumption created by a prima facie case drops from the case if the defendant satisfies its burden of production, but differs in the third stage in that a plaintiff who has established a prima facie case and persuaded the trier of fact that the employer\u2019s articulated justification is not true but a pretext, is entitled to judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Massachusetts is a pretext only jurisdiction. See <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 138 (\u201cif the employee has proved a prima facie case . . . and the employer gives an explanation for a hiring decision which has no reasonable support in the evidence or is wholly disbelieved (and hence is transparently a pretext), the employee should prevail\u201d); <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>413 Mass. 698, 700 (1992) (\u201c[i]f a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, but the defendant [employer] answers it by advancing lawful grounds for the action taken and produces evidence of underlying facts in support thereof, the plaintiff, in order to prevail, must persuade the fact finder by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s asserted reasons were not the real reasons for the action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>In <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks, supra, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the split between Federal circuit courts as to the third stage. A majority of the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who reaches the third stage is not entitled to an inference of discrimination on a showing of pretext, but rather must prove that the hiring action was actually motivated by discrimination:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cTitle VII does not award damages against employers who cannot prove a nondiscriminatory reason for adverse employment action, but only against employers who are proven to have taken adverse employment action by reason of [a protected category]. That the employer\u2019s proffered reason is unpersuasive, or even obviously contrived, does not necessarily establish that the plaintiff\u2019s proffered reason . . . is correct.\u201d <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 523-524. The dissent reasoned that a showing of pretext entitles the plaintiff to a determination of discrimination. Otherwise, \u201cunder the majority\u2019s scheme, a victim of discrimination lacking direct evidence will now be saddled with the tremendous disadvantage of having to confront, not the defined task of proving the employer\u2019s stated reasons to be false, but the amorphous requirement of disproving all possible nondiscriminatory reasons that a factfinder might find lurking in the record.\u201d <em>Hicks, supra </em>at 534-535 (Sauter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We think the better policy is to remain with our own precedent that, once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case and further shows either that the employer\u2019s articulated reasons are a pretext or by direct evidence that the actual motivation was discrimination, the plaintiff is entitled to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>covery for illegal discrimination under G. L. c. 151B.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 138. <em>Brunner, supra </em>at 700. With respect to summary judgment, it follows that, if a plaintiff has produced evidence sufficient to support a prima facie case of discrimination, and has further offered evidence sufficient to support a determination either that the employer\u2019s reason was a pretext or that the actual reason for the adverse hiring decision was discrimination, summary judgment for a defendant is inappropriate. The ultimate issue of discrimination, raised by the plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 conflicting evidence as to the defendants\u2019 motive, is not for a court to decide on the basis of affidavits, but is for the fact finder after weighing the circumstantial evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses..</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on the ultimate issue of discrimination. <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>384 Mass. 559, 566 (1981). Although the three-stage order of proof \u201clightens the employee\u2019s burden\u201d by requiring the employer to provide information at the second stage which \u201cnarrows the field of possible lawful reasons\u201d for its decision, it does not go so far as to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendants. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, if the evidence is in balance, the employer must prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence is rare, <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 137, the plaintiff may, and more often than not must, carry his burden of persuasion with circumstantial evidence that convinces the fact finder that the proffered explanation is not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The plaintiff prevails on a showing of pretext because \u201cwe know from our experience that more often than not people do not act in a totally arbitrary manner, without any underlying reasons, especially in a business setting. Thus, when all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer\u2019s actions, it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally assume acts only with <em>some </em>reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration . . .\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Furnco Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978). See <em>Wheelock College, supra </em>at 138. Combined with establishment of a prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence, a showing of pretext eliminates any legitimate explanation for the adverse hiring decision and warrants a determination that the plaintiff was the victim of unlawful discrimination. The plaintiff need not conclusively exclude all other possible explanations for the decision and prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">At the third stage in our order of proof, if the fact finder concludes that the plaintiff has proved that the employer\u2019s reasons are a pretext, then the plaintiff prevails. If the fact finder concludes that the plaintiff did not prove pretext then the defendant prevails. Direct proof of discrimination is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">4. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The record is sufficient to support a prima facie case. Donald Blare was born on October 26, 1934, and was fifty-seven years old at the time he was terminated from Husky. The periodic reviews in the plaintiff\u2019s file for the seven years preceding his first written warning indicate that he consistently and conscientiously performed his job. Finally, after the plaintiff was terminated Husky delegated his duties to various other employees who were not within the protected age category. In addition, the employer met its burden of production by articulating that its legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Blare\u2019s employment was poor performance as documented by the written notices for quality and attendance infractions against Blare.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Husky satisfied its burden by producing Blare\u2019s disciplinary file as its nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate Blare. Blare then had to produce evidence sufficient to support a jury verdict that it was more likely than not that the articulated reason was pretext for actual discrimination. \u201c[Ajbsent direct proof of [age] discrimination, evidence which may be relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s showing of pretext may include application of a certain criterion to employees [not within the protected category]; the employer\u2019s general practice and policies concerning employment of [those within the protected category]; and the employer\u2019s treatment of the plaintiff during [his] employment.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Area II Homecare for Senior Citizens, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 761, 767 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We think that, in addition to the plaintiffs prima facie evidence, the three remarks made by Blare\u2019s supervisor regarding the ability of Blare to work considering his age,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the evidence that other workers not in the protected category who committed similar errors were not terminated was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of his age. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of the defendants was error. We reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The plaintiff filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination alleging age discrimination in his termination by the defendants. The plaintiff withdrew the complaint and thereafter he filed this complaint in the Superior Court.
