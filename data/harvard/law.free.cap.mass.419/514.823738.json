R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979): \u201c(1) Whether it is a violation of statutory or [constitutional rights for an individual who is arrested . . . for operating under the influence of alcohol when courts are not in session to be denied access to a bail commissioner and held over night; and (2) [i]f so, is the proper remedy dismissal of the charge?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We transferred the case here on our own motion. Our responses to these questions are: Question 1, \u201cYes, it is a violation of statutory rights\u201d; Question 2, \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>We summarize the relevant facts found, after hearing, by the District Court judge. At approximately 2:30 a.m. on February 14, 1992, Officer Mark Alonzi of the Weston police, in response to a radio broadcast regarding a possible larceny in the area, stopped an automobile being operated by the defendant. Just prior to hearing this broadcast, Alonzi observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle to be proceeding without its headlights illuminated. During the course of questioning the defendant, Alonzi noticed that the defendant\u2019s eyes were red and bloodshot, that his speech was slurred, and that there was an odor of alcohol on his breath. The defendant consented to performing three field sdbriety tests, all of which, in Alonzi\u2019s opinion, the defendant failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Officer Alonzi placed the defendant under arrest and brought him to the Weston police station. During the ride to the police station, the defendant was belligerent, sarcastic, and offensive toward the officer. The judge found, based on the testimony of Alonzi and another police officer, that this behavior of the defendant was not unusual for an individual arrested for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">At the police station, Officer Francis Hines, the officer in charge of the shift, informed the defendant of his Miranda rights; his right to use the telephone, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A (1992 ed.); his right to take a breathalyzer test, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (e) (1992 ed.); and his right to obtain an independent blood test, G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A (1992 ed.). The defendant consented to a breathalyzer test. That test was administered twice and the results were 0.11 and 0.12 per cent, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The defendant expressed a desire to obtain an independent blood test pursuant to G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, and an interest in being released as quickly as possible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>given a telephone and a telephone book and was observed to be looking up hospital telephone numbers. It is unclear whether the defendant made any telephone calls at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Despite the defendant\u2019s request to be released on bail, none of the Weston police officers called a bail commissioner, nor does it appear that the defendant was allowed to make such a call. Officer Hines decided that the defendant was not in a condition to be released and needed to \u201csleep it off.\u201d The defendant was placed in a holding cell where he fell asleep. At approximately 8:30 a.m., he was brought to the Waltham District Court for arraignment. He was then released by the court. Later that day, the defendant underwent an independent blood test, but by that time any alcohol in his system would have been metabolized.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">1. <em>Access to bail commissioner. </em>The District Court judge determined that the defendant\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights to have his bail considered were violated, relying on G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 58, the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and art. 26 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>For the purposes of this case, we need not explore the extent of a constitutional right to be considered for bail under the Eighth Amendment, or art. 26, the provisions on which the judge below based, in part, his decision. To reach our conclusion in affirmative response to the first reported question, we need only consider the statutory scheme which provides an arrested party the statutory right to prompt release on bail, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 57, 58,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his statutory right to an independent blood test under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. In doing so, we are mindful of our duty to consider these statutes as part of a statutory scheme which we ought harmonize so as to give full effect to the expressed intent of the Legislature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 720 (1984); <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975). These statutory rights, considered together, lead us to conclude that, in order for G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, to have its intended force and effect,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it must be read as requiring the police to telephone a bail commissioner or to allow the defendant to do so in circumstances such as those present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 58 (1992 ed.), provides, in relevant part, that \u201ca bail commissioner . . . <em>shall, </em>when a prisoner is held under arrest or committed either with or without a warrant for an offense . . . <em>hold a hearing </em>in which the defendant and his counsel, if any, may participate and inquire into the case and <em>shall admit such person to bail </em>on his personal recognizance without surety unless said . . . bail commissioner . . . determines, in the exercise of his discretion . . . that such a release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the prisoner before the court\u201d (emphasis supplied). Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules Governing Persons Authorized to Take Bail (1991) provides, in relevant part, that \u201call persons authorized to take bail are entitled to participate fairly in the out-of-court bailing activity in their jurisdiction <em>so long as they are willing and able to respond with all reasonable promptness </em>to calls for their services\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">As the above quoted paragraph of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, demonstrates, an arrestee must be released on bail without surety unless there is a risk that he will not appear in court. To assist in this process, individuals are appointed as bail commissioners, and those individuals are permitted to participate in bail activity as long as they are ready, willing and able to do so with all promptness. Part of the responsibility of a bail commissioner is, as rule 14 provides, \u201cto respond with all reasonable promptness to calls for their services.\u201d This requirement is clearly within the knowledge of police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">General Laws c. 263, \u00a7 5A, confers on a defendant the right to a reasonable opportunity to obtain his own evidence regarding his alleged intoxication. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>389 Mass. 874, 881 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marley, </em>396 Mass. 433, 443 (1985) (Liacos, J., concurring).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>This evidence, obtained through an independent blood or breath test, is extremely fleeting and thus time is of the essence in obtaining the requisite testing. <em>Andrade, supra. </em>See G. L. c. 263, \u00a7. 5A (statute confers right to be examined immediately and defendant must be informed of this right immediately). However, the \u201cstatute places primary responsibility for an independent blood test in the hands of the defendant, not the police.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lindner, </em>395 Mass. 144, 148 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">It is true that the police have no obligation to assist the defendant in obtaining a medical examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>410 Mass. 603, 608 (1991). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosewarne, </em>410 Mass. 53, 55 (1991). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, </em>388 Mass. 871, 879 (1983). Nevertheless, the police may not prevent or hinder the defendant\u2019s reasonable and timely attempt to obtain such an examination. <em>Rosewarne, supra </em>at 55. <em>Alano, supra </em>at 879. Furthermore, the \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d which the statute compels the police to afford to a defendant will depend on the particular circumr stances of the case. <em>Alano, supra </em>at 879-880.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In <em>Rosewarne, </em>the defendant telephoned a local hospital from a State police barracks to arrange for a blood test. <em>Id. </em>at 54. The hospital employees would not go to the barracks to administer the test and the police would not transport the defendant to the hospital. The defendant\u2019s girl friend then telephoned the barracks to arrange the defendant\u2019s release on bail. She was informed that it would not be possible. <em>Id. </em>Although it was unclear in <em>Rosewarne </em>whether the judge dismissed the complaint because of the police refusal to transport the defendant or because of their refusal to arrange bail, we noted that \u201c[i]f the police did in fact obstruct the defendant\u2019s attempts to get released on bail, his c. [263], \u00a7 5A, rights were violated.\u201d <em>Rosewarne, supra </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The Legislature has expressed clearly its concern that the right of a defendant to an independent examination under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>this section be protected. <em>Andrade, supra </em>at 878. While the police do not have to help the defendant by transporting him to a hospital, it remains true that, absent exigent circumstances, the police should telephone a bail commissioner or other authorized person, when courts are not in session, to facilitate a defendant\u2019s release in a timely fashion, or at least to allow him to make his own arrangements for a hearing on bail. The police should advise the defendant of this right at the time of booking. For us to require anything less would repeal this statute, in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In determining whether the police obstructed the defendant\u2019s release on bail, thus resulting in a violation of his right, we need not concern ourselves with the frame of mind or the good faith of the police. See <em>Marley, supra </em>at 444 (Liacos, J., concurring). Instead the question whether there was misconduct by the police appropriately is considered in determining the remedy for a violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. <em>Rosewarne, supra </em>at 57. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>404 Mass. 459, 464 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In this case the judge found correctly that the police obstructed the defendant\u2019s release on bail. The record reflects that Officer Hines made a deliberate choice to keep the defendant in custody and not to telephone the bail commissioner. As justification, the Commonwealth contends that Officer Hines properly was holding the defendant in protective custody. This contention is without merit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">General Laws c. 11 IB, \u00a7 8 (1992 ed.), governs the placement of incapacitated persons in protective custody. This statute dictates several steps which the police must follow to place someone in custody, including notification of a treatment facility and entry on an appropriate form that the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>son is being so held. None of the requirements of \u00a7 8 was met in this case. General Laws c. 111B, \u00a7 8, states: \u201cA person . . . held in protective custody . . . pursuant to . . . this section, shall not be considered to have been arrested or to have been charged with any crime.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>406 Mass. 112 (1989), for a contrary proposition, is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Based on the requirements of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, we conclude that the police obstructed the defendant\u2019s release on bail and therefore violated his right under that section. We next turn to the question of the appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">2. <em>Remedy for violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. </em>In determining the appropriate remedy for a violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, we consider the conduct of the police, the exigent circumstances of the particular case, and other admissible evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Rosewarne, supra </em>at 57. <em>Kelley, supra </em>at 464. Dismissal may be deemed appropriate where there is deliberate or intentional misconduct by the police. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>373 Mass. 438, 443 (1977). In cases arising under c. 263, \u00a7 5A, we must consider the purpose of the statute, namely, to give the defendant a reasonable opportunity to obtain his own evidence, available only for a short period of time, regarding his alleged intoxication. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marley, </em>396 Mass. 433, 443 (1985) (Liacos, J., concurring). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>389 Mass. 874, 881 (1983). Thus, the remedy must be \u201cadequate to cure potential or actual prejudice resulting from a violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A,\u201d given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>particular facts of the case. <em>Andrade, supra </em>at 878-879, 881-882.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In <em>Andrade, </em>we said that dismissal was not appropriate in a case where no breathalyzer test was administered if there was overwhelming evidence of guilt apart from the testimony of the police officers. <em>Id. </em>at 882. We see no reason for a different rule in a case where a breathalyzer test was performed. Thus, if there is overwhelming evidence of guilt apart from the breathalyzer test and police testimony as discussed below, dismissal may be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We believe that, ordinarily, the appropriate remedy in a case where dismissal is not required is the suppression of the breathalyzer result, if such test was performed, and of certain other police testimony. The determination of what evidence should be suppressed to eliminate prejudice to the defendant is, in the first instance, a matter for the judge\u2019s sound discretion. He may, but is not required to, rule that all police testimony be suppressed. This is so because some police testimony may be based on observations made and opinions formed before the violation of the defendant\u2019s right under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, occurred. This evidence might include observations made and opinions formed at the scene when the defendant was placed under arrest, such as in this case, the arresting officer\u2019s observations of the defendant\u2019s behavior and the officer\u2019s opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s performance of field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">When the defendant is \u201cin custody at a police station or other place of detention charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence,\u201d his right under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A, attaches pursuant to the statutory language at the time he is booked. \u201cThe police official . . . shall inform him of such right immediately upon being booked . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>Thus, observations made or opinions formed by police officers after that right is violated, either by failure to inform the defendant of the right or by failure to afford a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right (for example, failing to call the bail commissioner or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>informing the defendant that he may do so), should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We believe that the suppression of the breathalyzer results and of police testimony regarding events, observations and opinions after the violation of the statutory right, in combination with an appropriate instruction regarding the existence of the statutory right and the violation thereof by the police, will be adequate in most cases, where dismissal is not required, to cure potential or actual prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In this case, the judge concluded that there was not overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. From the judge\u2019s written findings and conclusions, we cannot say what evidence he considered in reaching that conclusion. Accordingly, this case must be remanded for rehearing, if necessary, and reconsideration by the judge as to whether there is sufficient evidence of guilt apart from the breathalyzer results and police testimony regarding events, observations and opinions after the violation of the right protected by G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In summary, we answer the first question, \u201cYes, it is a violation of statutory rights\u201d; and the second question, \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\">In his \u201cDecision Re Motion to Dismiss or Suppress,\u201d the District Court judge ordered dismissal of the driving under the influence complaint. Technically, a dismissed case cannot be reported pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979), since the rule allows for reporting a case either prior to trial or after conviction of the defendant, with his consent for the report. A dismissed case fits into neither category. It would have been more appropriate for the judge to report the questions without deciding the motion to dismiss. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, </em>407 Mass. 779, 780 (1990) (case reported without decision after motion to dismiss filed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>389 Mass. 874, 875 (1983) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">However, neither party has argued here or below that the case should not have been reported. We note that the Commonwealth would have had a right to appeal from the judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. Mass. R. Crim. P. 15, 378 Mass. 884 (1979), and both parties have thoroughly briefed all the relevant issues. In these circumstances, we believe that \u201cefficiency in the administration of justice would be best served by our answering the reported question [s] regardless of whether, as a technical matter, [they are] properly before us.\u201d <em>Matter of a John Doe Grand Jury Investigation, </em>408 Mass. 480, 481 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The findings of the judge are as follows: \u201cAt the Weston police station, Officer Francis Heins gave Mr. Hampe his <em>Miranda </em>rights, informed him of his right to take a breathalyzer test, his right to use a telephone, and his right to obtain an independent blood or breath test. See G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A. Mr. Hampe accepted the offer to take a breath test. The results of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the breath test were readings of .11 and .12, slightly above the standard for presumption of impairment. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (e). Although Mr. Hampe expressed interest in obtaining an independent breath or blood test, as permitted by G. L. c. 253, \u00a7 5A, and an interest in being bailed out of jail quickly, the officers at the Weston police station did not release Mr. Hampe or call a bail commissioner. Officer Heins, the person in charge of the station, gave Mr. Hampe a telephone book and a telephone so that he could call Waltham-Weston Hospital to arrange for a blood test. However, Officer Heins determined to hold Mr. Hampe at the station because [the officer] believed that Mr. Hampe needed to sleep off the effects of the alcohol he had consumed. [] The officers believed that Mr. Hampe should remain in the station holding cell until morning. Officer Heins did not call a bail commissioner, and Mr. Hampe was not released during the night. Instead, he was transported to Waltham District Court the following morning for arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Zx\">\u201cThe next afternoon, after arraignment, Mr. Hampe obtained an independent blood test, but the alcohol had left his system.</p>\n<p id=\"ANM\">\u201cAlthough Mr. Hampe had more than $50.00 in his pocket and thus could have paid the bail fee for his release, he was kept in jail until 8:30 A.M. the next morning when he was taken to Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b540-4\">A person under arrest has a right to a hearing on admission to bail with a presumption of release on personal recognizance.

A bail commissioner is charged with the responsibility of responding with all reasonable promptness, after regular court hours, to admit arrested persons to bail. <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 210, 212-213 (1987). Only a properly designated person (not a police officer) is authorized to take bail. G. L, c. 276, \u00a7 57.

This latter statute governs the admissibility of police-administered blood or breath tests and provides that if such test is administered, the results of the test will be admissible at trial only if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>defendant was offered the opportunity to obtain another, independent test. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alano, </em>388 Mass. 871, 874-875 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">It must be noted that nothing we say here requires police to allow a defendant in circumstances of apparent intoxication to resume the operation of his or her motor vehicle. The release of the defendant when other means of transportation, such as the assistance of a friend who will operate the defendant\u2019s vehicle or his own, or of public transportation (should it be available) may be appropriate. Obviously, the police have no duty to transport a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\">At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, the police officers who testified seemed to suggest that they had some sort of discretionary authority, apart from G.

In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>406 Mass. 112, 115 (1989), the defendant was found incapacitated, whereas here there was no such finding. Additionally, in <em>O\u2019Connor, supra </em>at 120 n.7, unlike here, the defendant was not first placed under arrest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tomeo, </em>400 Mass. 23, 26 (1987) (where defendant first taken into protective custody and, later arrested, \u201c[o]nce the defendant was arrested ... the protective custody statute [c. 111B, \u00a7 8] became irrelevant\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b546-7\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX9\">(dissenting in part). The first reported question, \u201cWhether it is a violation of statutory or [constitutional rights for an individual who is arrested ... for operating under the influence of alcohol when courts are not in session to be denied access to a bail commissioner and held over night,\u201d construed literally, surely requires the court\u2019s answer \u2014 \u201cYes.\u201d See G.

However, the court devotes much of its opinion to the question whether in this case the judge was correct in concluding that, based on his subsidiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>findings, the police \u201cdenied [the defendant] access to a bail commissioner.\u201d I agree that the court should focus on that question, but I do not agree that the judge\u2019s findings warrant the conclusion that the defendant was denied access to a bail commissioner. Therefore, I do not agree that the defendant\u2019s statutory rights were violated or that the complaint was rightly dismissed. If I were to agree that they had been violated, though, I would conclude, differently from the court, that the judge properly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">General Laws c. 263, \u00a7 5A (1992 ed.), provides in material part: \u201cA person held in custody at a police station or other place of detention, charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, shall have the right, at his request and at his expense, to be examined immediately by a physician selected by him. The police official in charge of such station or place of detention, or his designee, shall inform him of such right immediately upon being booked, and shall afford him a reasonable opportunity to exercise it.\u201d I agree with the court that, in aid of the legislative objectives in enacting the relevant statutes, the police must either telephone a bail commissioner or allow the arrested individual to do so, <em>ante </em>at 518, 521, and must advise him of his right to make his own arrangements at the time of booking. <em>Ante </em>at 521. I would require that the police make a telephone and directory available for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">I am content that those requirements should be applied to this case. Therefore, if the judge had found on sufficient evidence that the police did not honor those rights, I would join . in the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe police obstructed the defendant\u2019s release on bail.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 521. However, the judge made no such finding and none would have been warranted. Although the judge found that the police did not call a bail commissioner, the new requirements do not mandate them to do so, and it is of no consequence that Officer Hines\u2019s reason for not calling a bail commissioner, which he was not required to do, was that he or the officers thought that the defendant should sleep off the effects of the alcohol he had consumed. The question is not what the officers thought, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>what they did or failed to do in violation of the aforesaid requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The court states, <em>ante </em>at 517, that \u201cnone of the Weston police officers called a bail commissioner, nor does it appear that the defendant was allowed to make such a call.\u201d As I have said, it is of no consequence that none of the officers called a bail commissioner. It also is of no consequence that it does not \u201cappear that the defendant was allowed to make such a call.\u201d The important point is that there was no finding, or even evidence, that the defendant was <em>not </em>allowed to make such a call or that he was not advised in timely fashion of his right to do so. Therefore, it has not been established that the police did not satisfy the aforesaid requirements or otherwise obstruct the defendant\u2019s release on bail. I conclude that the motion to dismiss should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In response to the second reported question concerning the appropriate remedy when a defendant charged with operating under the influence has been denied access to a bail commissioner, the court concludes that, in some cases, resulting prejudice may be eliminated by suppression of evidence. <em>Ante </em>at 524. I do not agree. In my view, if prejudice has been shown, dismissal is required. Of course, dismissal is inappropriate when prejudice has not been shown, as when there is overwhelming evidence of guilt <em>\u201capart from the officers\u2019 testimony (as shown on videotape, for example)'' </em>(emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrade, </em>389 Mass. 874, 882 (1983). In such circumstances, \u201cit could fairly be said that the defendant was not prejudiced by the police officers\u2019 violation of G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>In that situation, the complaint should not be dismissed, <em>id., </em>and no other corrective measure, such as suppression of evidence, is called for. On the other hand, if prejudice has been shown, it cannot be eliminated by suppression of evidence, leaving the finder of fact to determine the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence without the benefit of a physician\u2019s testimony or a blood test result that, but for the unlawful intervention of the police, might have created reasonable doubt in the fact finder\u2019s mind. My view is that, if a defendant\u2019s right to a bail hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>ing has been violated, a complaint for driving while under the influence of liquor must be dismissed unless there is clearly no prejudice, see <em>Andrade, supra </em>at 882, in which case there is no need for a remedy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
