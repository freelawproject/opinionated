His sentences have been stayed pending appeal. The Appeals Court determined that evidentiary errors occurred at trial, but held that the errors were harmless and thus affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions. 36 Mass. App. Ct. 950 (1994). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">On further appellate review, the defendant asserts two claims. First, he argues that his answer to a booking question concerning his employment status was improperly admitted because there was no evidence at trial that the police had informed him of the Miranda warnings before asking him about his occupation. Second, he asserts that the trial judge erred in admitting the arresting officers\u2019 expert opinion testimony that the defendant had committed the charged offenses. We conclude that the defendant did not adequately preserve the first issue for appellate review. We also conclude that, although the police officers\u2019 testimony was improperly admitted, the error was not prejudicial. Therefore, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We summarize the evidence presented at trial. Two Boston police officers, Robert Luongo and Santos Perez, testified about the alleged drug transaction. At a distance of from twenty-five to fifty yards, the two officers observed the defendant standing in front of 37 Standish Street in the Dorchester section of Boston. Officer Luongo used binoculars to observe the defendant. The officers saw a woman approach the defendant and engage him in conversation. She gave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>defendant what appeared to be money in exchange for an object. The woman walked away from the defendant, placed the object into her mouth, entered a vehicle, and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Believing that a drug transaction had occurred, the officers followed the automobile and stopped it about one-quarter mile from where they had observed the exchange. At Officer Luongo\u2019s request, the woman removed from her mouth a small package wrapped in tin foil.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officers returned to 37 Standish Street and found the defendant still there. They arrested him, and found $207 on his person. The defendant did not have any drugs on his person at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Officers Luongo and Perez both testified as to certain general practices of street drug dealers. They explained the absence of drugs on the defendant\u2019s person by describing how street drug dealers secrete a \u201cstash\u201d of drugs nearby. They also explained the significance of buyers and sellers placing small packages of drugs in their mouths for easy disposal. Over objection, Officer Luongo testified that, in his opinion, \u201ca drug transaction had just taken place.\u201d When asked why the officers arrested the defendant, Officer Luongo stated: \u201cWe believe we observed a sale, we stopped the buyer, recovered the product. It is our belief that he was selling crack cocaine, which is why I went back to place him under arrest.\u201d Officer Perez also testified, over objection, to his belief that the defendant was involved in a drug transaction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">While being booked at the police station after his arrest, the defendant was asked a number of routine questions. Officer Perez testified that, when the defendant was asked his occupation, he responded that he was an unemployed hairdresser. There was no evidence that the police had given the defendant Miranda warnings before asking him about his employment status. Defense counsel objected when Officer Perez was first asked about the booking process, but that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>before any mention was made of the defendant\u2019s occupation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge called a bench conference, and overruled the objection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecutor then asked Officer Perez about the defendant\u2019s statement regarding his occupation. Defense counsel made no objection to this question or motion to strike the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">1. <em>Booking question about employment. </em>On appeal, the defendant alleges that his statement during booking that he was unemployed should have been suppressed because there was no evidence at trial that the police had given him Miranda warnings before asking him about his occupation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant failed to preserve the issue for appeal. See <em>Nancy P. </em>v. <em>D\u2018Amato, </em>401 Mass. 516, 524 (1988) (where counsel fails to make proper objection, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>late review of ruling is generally precluded); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668, 674 (1987) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The proper method for challenging the admissibility of a statement allegedly obtained in violation of the Miranda standards is a pretrial motion to suppress or a motion for a voir dire. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 (c) (2), 378 Mass. 871 (1979); P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 9.10, at 605 (6th ed. 1994). The defendant, however, did not challenge the admissibility of his statement by either of these methods, nor has he established on appeal any reason to excuse his failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In certain very limited circumstances, a defendant may object at trial to the admission of statements allegedly made without benefit of Miranda warnings, even where the defendant has not adhered to the preferred procedure of a pretrial motion to suppress or for a voir dire.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265 (1983), we stated that, \u201c[ejven if the defendant has not moved to suppress his statements the burden is still on the Commonwealth, <em>upon seasonable objection, </em>to prove affirmatively, prior to the admission of [the defendant\u2019s] statements, that the statements were properly obtained and that the defendant waived his rights\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 269-270. In this case, however, the inadequate record does not enable us to conclude that the defendant did make a \u201cseasonable objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The defendant argues that \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s objection should be treated as a general one for which the ground was obvious.\u201d Our review of the transcript does not support this assertion. The defendant objected to an inquiry about booking before the prosecutor asked any question about employment. Instead, the objection interrupted a question beginning, \u201cAnd was there a question about.\u201d At that point, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>not clear that the solicited testimony was inadmissible. We also note that the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s specific question concerning the defendant\u2019s employment status.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The defendant has made no effort to reconstruct the record of the sidebar discussion for appellate review. See Mass. R. A. P. 8 (c) and (e), as amended, 378 Mass. 932 (1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The burden is on the appellant to ensure that an adequate record exists for an appellate court to evaluate. Indeed, rule 8 provides ample opportunity to supplement the trial record. Despite this opportunity, and despite the fact that the Appeals Court noted that the record was insufficient as to this issue, defense counsel failed to supplement the record for our review. Indeed, defense counsel stated both in his brief and at oral argument that the record \u201cclearly show[ed]\u201d the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>of the objection and that he therefore determined not to reconstruct the record of the sidebar discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Despite this, we cannot determine on the record before us whether the defendant asserted below that he did not receive Miranda warnings before booking, nor can we conclude that the defendant timely objected and adequately preserved the issue for appeal. We decline to speculate about what occurred during the sidebar discussion. In the absence of a timely objection, our review is limited to whether there is a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La </em>Cruz, 405 Mass. 269, 275 (1989). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>401 Mass. 318, 329 (1987). In view of the Commonwealth\u2019s strong case against the defendant apart from the testimony now challenged, we conclude that there was no such risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">However, we believe that, in view of the significant public interest in protecting the Miranda rights of criminal defendants, we must express briefly our opinion on this issue. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943). See also <em>Tamerlane Corp. </em>v. <em>Warwick Ins. Co., </em>412 Mass. 486, 489 n.5 (1992); <em>Guardianship of Weedon, </em>409 Mass. 196, 197 (1991). We believe that, where an arrestee\u2019s employment status may prove incriminatory, the police must give Miranda warnings before asking questions about employment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 601 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201croutine booking question [s]\u201d may be asked without Miranda warnings because such questions are not usually designed to elicit incriminatory statements. The Court stated that the \u201croutine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>booking question\u201d exception \u201cexempts from <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>coverage questions to secure the biographical data necessary to complete booking or pretrial services.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>873 F.2d 180, 181 n.2 (8th Cir. 1989). As examples of permissible routine booking questions, the Court cited questions regarding an arrestee\u2019s name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and current age. <em>Muniz, supra </em>at 601, 602. The Court noted that such questions \u201cappear reasonably related to the police\u2019s administrative concerns [and hence] fall outside the protections of <em>Miranda.\u2019\u2019 Id. </em>at 601-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Recognizing an exception to the Miranda requirement for \u201croutine booking question [s]\u201d does not mean that <em>any </em>question asked during the booking process falls within that exception. Unless they first give the arrestee Miranda warnings or obtain a waiver of those rights, the police may not ask questions, even during booking, that are designed to elicit incriminatory admissions. <em>Id. </em>at 602 n.14. For example, in <em>Muniz, </em>where the defendant had been arrested for driving while intoxicated, the Court held that the police should have administered Miranda warnings before asking the defendant the date of his sixth birthday. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 605. Although the police were not interested in the date of Muniz\u2019s sixth birthday, but rather in his ability to calculate it, the Court concluded that the <em>content </em>of his answer (that he did not know the date of his sixth birthday) had potential to incriminate him because it supported an inference that his mental faculties were impaired. <em>Id. </em>at 599. Because of this potential, the Court held that the police, in order to protect Muniz\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, should have given Muniz the Miranda warnings before asking him that question. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The reasoning of the <em>Muniz </em>decision applies with equal force to booking questions about employment in cases involving drug charges. Although a booking officer proceeding down a litany of routine questions may have no investigatory purpose in asking the arrested person how he is employed, the <em>content </em>of that person\u2019s response may be incriminating. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>For example, in drug cases such as the instant one, an arrestee\u2019s statement that he is unemployed may prove incriminating where the arrestee possessed a substantial amount of cash at the time of the arrest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, an arrestee\u2019s employment status seems less relevant to the police in performing their custodial responsibilities than the information gleaned from those questions identified by the <em>Muniz </em>Court, <em>supra </em>at 601, as \u201croutine booking question [s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">As noted above, our reflections on the <em>Muniz </em>case do not influence our analysis of the defendant\u2019s case because the defendant did not properly preserve this issue for appeal. The record does not show \"that the defendant argued at trial that his statement about his unemployment was inadmissible because he had not received timely or adequate Miranda warnings. He cannot now attempt to argue on appeal an issue that rests on the assumption that he had not received adequate Miranda warnings when he was booked.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">2. <em>Expert testimony. </em>The defendant also asserts that the expert testimony of Officers Luongo and Perez crossed the line between touching on an ultimate issue and commenting on the defendant\u2019s guilt. Although we agree that it was error to allow the testimony, we conclude that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">A trial judge has broad discretion with respect to the admission of expert testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., ante </em>54, 59 (1994). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 628 (1989). Expert testimony is generally admissible whenever it will aid the jury in reaching a decision. <em>Id: Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>400 Mass. 550, 553 (1987). An opinion within the domain of the expert\u2019s professional knowledge may be admissible even if the expert\u2019s testimony touches on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the ultimate issues before the jury. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCorte, </em>373 Mass. 700, 705 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">An expert may not, however, offer an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hesketh, </em>386 Mass. 153, 161 (1982). Although the question is a close one, we agree with the Appeals Court, 36 Mass. App. Ct. at 952, that, in this case, the police officers\u2019 testimony that the defendant was involved in a drug sale was, in effect, expert opinion that the defendant was guilty of the charges. Such expert opinion testimony was unnecessary and impermissibly intruded on the jury\u2019s vital fact finding function. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 202-203 (1987). But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>410 Mass. 199, 202 (1991) (police detective, experienced with narcotic trade, properly allowed to express opinion that amount of cocaine possessed by defendant was \u201cconsistent with an intent to distribute\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The jury, given the facts and the expert testimony about the general practices of street drug dealers, could draw their own conclusions about the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The officers\u2019 testimony exceeded the bounds of admissible expert testimony, and it was error to allow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We conclude, however, that the error was harmless. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). In light of the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the admission of the improper testimony was not substantially prejudicial. The Commonwealth presented the firsthand accounts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Officers Luengo and Perez, who had observed the defendant\u2019s exchange with the woman who had approached him. In addition, at the officers\u2019 request, the woman removed a small package from her mouth almost immediately after her encounter with the defendant. This evidence gave rise to a strong inference as to the nature of the transaction. Furthermore, the improper testimony went only slightly beyond the opinions offered which were admissible, namely, that a hand-to-hand transaction, and the storage of drugs in the mouth, are consistent with drug dealing. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In his application for further appellate review, the defendant states the issues to be presented to this court: \u201cThis case offers the Supreme Judicial Court the opportunity, first, to breathe life into the apparently moribund concept \u2018harmless error\u2019 as it extends to the Appeals Court\u2019s review of District Court trials of drug charges, and, second, to address whether certain \u2018routine\u2019 booking questions-and-answers, routinely argued by prosecutors as evidence of guilt, are admissible absent evidence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d The application was granted on this basis. 418 Mass. 1104 (1994). Accordingly, we consider only these issues. For disposition of the other issues, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 950, 953 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Subsequent laboratory tests indicated that the package contained crack cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The defendant does not challenge the credentials of the officers as expert witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b391-5\">During direct examination by the prosecutor, Officer Perez\u2019s testimony about the booking procedure was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd what occurred next?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The witness: \u201cThen, uh, he was booked.
