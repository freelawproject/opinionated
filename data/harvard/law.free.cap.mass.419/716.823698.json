Jackson, Jr., was convicted of armed robbery, armed assault in a dwelling house with intent to commit a felony, and assault and battery. The defendant appeals. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the convictions. The facts are set forth in the discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">1. <em>Right to self-representation. </em>After the defendant was indicted, the court appointed counsel to represent the defendant. The defendant subsequently waived his right to counsel, electing to \"proceed pro se. The court then designated standby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>counsel, who withdrew from the case three months later. The defendant assumed his own representation unassisted by standby counsel from that date forward.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">On appeal, represented by appellate counsel, the defendant argues that the conduct of the judge and the prosecutor at trial impaired his right to represent himself in a fair criminal proceeding. The defendant asserts that the judge interrupted his cross-examination of the victim unnecessarily. The defendant failed to object on the record to any of these interruptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The defendant further points to the prosecutor\u2019s use of statements elicited by the defendant on cross-examination, which were damaging to the defendant, as evidence that the prosecutor somehow \u201ctook advantage\u201d of the defendant\u2019s pro se status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In addition, according to the defendant, the prosecutor\u2019s failure to counsel witnesses to refer to the defendant as \u201cMr. Jackson\u201d rather than \u201cSam\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d and the prosecutor\u2019s failure to avoid leading or improper questions which elicited hearsay responses violated the prosecutor\u2019s duty to guarantee a fair proceeding. In sum, the defendant argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>that the conduct of the judge and the prosecutor prejudiced him before the jury and denied him an opportunity to represent himself in a fair proceeding. The defendant did not object to many of the issues urged on appeal. Although \u201cwe may consider issues on appeal not raised at trial . . . our power to do so is rarely exercised, and is exercised only in response to a serious and obvious error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pares-Ramirez, </em>400 Mass. 604, 609 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A. <em>Rights waived and risks assumed by pro se defendants. </em>The right to assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution is premised on \u201ca realistic recognition of the obvious truth that the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned counsel.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 462-463 (1938). But because \u201c[t]he defendant, and not his lawyer or the State, will bear the personal consequences of a conviction . . . the defendant . . . must be free personally to decide whether in his particular case counsel is to his advantage.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>410 Mass. 1, 10-11 (1991). Accordingly, a defendant may waive his right to the \u201cguiding hand of counsel,\u201d <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 69 (1932), and exercise his right of self-representation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mott, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 47 (1974). Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Despite their lack of legal training, pro se litigants are held to the same standards as practicing members of the bar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385, 392 (1987). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u201cWhen an accused manages his own defense, he relinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Faretta, supra </em>at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The defendant waived his right to effective assistance of counsel when he refused appointed counsel and standby counsel. At the time of each of the incidents outlined above, the defendant did not object on the record. His tactical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>legal errors, many of which might constitute ineffective assistance of counsel if committed by a member of the bar, were inherent in the risk he assumed. See, e.g., <em>Faretta, supra </em>at 834-835 n.46 (pro se defendants cannot raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the prosecutor did not unfairly \u201ctake advantage\u201d of the defendant\u2019s pro se status. Nor did the judge prejudicially conduct the trial by limiting the introduction of cumulative evidence and excluding improper questions. No lenience is required on the part of the judge or prosecutor toward a pro se defendant. There is no judicial obligation to protect a pro se defendant from his lack of legal training. <em>Faretta, supra </em>(\u201cThe right of self-represent\u00e1tion is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom. Neither is it a license not to comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law\u201d). See also note 3, <em>supra. </em>Neither the trial judge nor the prosecutor impaired the defendant\u2019s right to represent himself in a fair proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">B. <em>Courtroom decorum in pro se cases. </em>The defendant raises matters of courtroom decorum which we mention briefly. We note that pro se defendants should be addressed with titles connoting equal respect to that afforded opposing counsel. The defendant asserts that the judge referred to the defendant frequently as \u201cyou\u201d rather than as \u201cMr. Jackson,\u201d and allowed witnesses to refer to the defendant either as \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cSam.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no error. The defendant himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>asked questions in the same manner throughout the trial. There is no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The defendant asserts that he was prejudiced by the judge\u2019s repeated interruptions. As we read the interruptions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the judge simply told the defendant how to ask questions which would show any inconsistencies with testimony at the probable cause hearing. While the trial judge has a duty, \u201c \u2018as the directing and controlling mind at the trial,\u2019 to see that the trial [does] not get out of hand,\u201d in general \u201cit is the better practice to warn and rebuke counsel out of the jury\u2019s hearing\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>352 Mass. 218, 226-227, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 916 (1967), quoting <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Wellesley &amp; Boston St. Ry., </em>197 Mass. 495, 502 (1908). However, we recognize that \u201c[s]ome warnings and rebukes must unavoidably be made in the jury\u2019s presence.\u201d <em>McLaughlin, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>352 Mass. 636, 641-642 (1967). The record reveals that the defendant\u2019s cross-examination was argumentative and repetitive. Questions were inartfully phrased. The judge correctly excluded or curtailed repetitive or argumentative cross-examination. He also correctly excluded improperly phrased questions. A pro se defendant cannot put the judge or prosecutor in a \u201cheads, I win, tails, you lose,\u201d position. That is exactly what the defendant is attempting to do. The record does not disclose a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence of dangerous weapon. </em>The defendant was convicted of armed robbery and armed assault in a dwelling under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 18A (1992 ed.). Each statute states that the robbery or assault be committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>by one armed with a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On January 22, 1991, the defendant and two other men entered the apartment of the victim. The victim said that he heard the other men moving videocassettes. He asked the defendant, \u201cWait a minute, what are they doing back there?\u201d The victim then got up from the chair where the defendant had told him to sit. The defendant put his hand in his \u201cpocket and motioned it\u201d toward the victim and said, \u201cI\u2019ll blow you away.\u201d The victim said that the defendant carried himself as if he was armed with a gun. The victim said that he was afraid he would be harmed. The victim did not see a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The judge instructed the jury that \u201can appearance of a dangerous weapon when a defendant causes that appearance to exist, can be found to be a dangerous weapon.\u201d The defendant objected to the instruction and raised the issue in his motion for a required finding of not guilty. The defendant argues this issue is governed by our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Howard, 386 Mass. 607 (1982), while the Commonwealth maintains that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432 (1975), governs this appeal. A majority of the court agrees with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In <em>Howard, supra </em>at 607, we reversed the conviction of robbery while \u201carmed with a dangerous weapon\u201d where the evidence showed the defendant did not possess a gun even though when he approached the victim, \u201che had his right hand in his jacket, and he said, \u2018Walk straight, look down, and don\u2019t try anything foolish or I\u2019ll pull the trigger.\u2019 \u201d The defendant was arrested during the robbery. Despite the defendant\u2019s words, the police did not find a gun when they ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>rested and searched him. We reasoned that \u201cwhere a robber had no instrumentality at all, although he said he had a gun, a conviction of armed robbery is not warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608. We said that \u201c[i]t is the absence of any basis to infer that the defendant may have had a gun that distinguishes this case from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Delgado.\u201d <em>Howard, supra </em>at 610. We concluded that statutes making it a crime to commit a robbery or an assault while armed \u201cshould not be read as including a robbery while <em>apparently </em>armed with a dangerous weapon when in fact the defendant was unarmed\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Id. </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In <em>Delgado, </em>the defendant and three other men entered a store. One man held a knife to the store manager while his coventurers took property from the store. The defendant said, \u201cHold him or I\u2019m going to shoot him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434. At trial, \u201cthere was no direct evidence of a gun, no gun was seen by the store manager, and no gun was found on the defendant\u2019s person or in the area where the defendant was apprehended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436. We affirmed the conviction of armed robbery by means of a gun and armed assault on the basis of the defendant\u2019s conduct and words, which suggested that he was armed with a gun. The defendant\u2019s conduct placed the victim \u201cin reasonable apprehension that force may be used,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 437, and we concluded that the \u201cjury could reasonably conclude that the defendant should be taken at his word.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Unlike the defendant in <em>Howard, </em>Jackson was not apprehended in the course of the robbery. Thus, Jackson\u2019s conduct and words \u2014 with his hand in his jacket stating that \u201cI\u2019ll blow you away\u201d \u2014 were designed to place the victim in fear and did in fact do so. In these circumstances, there is no reason not to take an assailant at his word.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Because the defendant, like Delgado, had the opportunity to dispose of the gun before he was arrested, a distinguishing fact from <em>Howard, </em>it was proper to instruct the jurors that it was up to them to determine whether the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>armed with a gun when he said \u201cI\u2019ll blow you away\u201d during the crimes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">3. <em>Armed robbery indictment. </em>The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the armed robbery indictment on the ground that the indictment failed to state the required mens rea for armed robbery and thus failed to charge a crime. The indictment against the defendant charged that \u201cbeing armed with a dangerous weapon, to wit: a gun, [the defendant] did assault [the victim] with intent to rob him, and thereby did rob and steal from the person of said [victim] a betamax recorder . . . .\u201d The defendant argues the proper mens rea is the \u201cintent to steal.\u201d See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39 (1992 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79 (1992 ed.), which prescribes the proper form of indictments for various crimes, including \u201c[a]ssault with dangerous weapon, with intent to rob,\u201d the intent is \u201cwith intent to rob.\u201d The indictment against the defendant for armed robbery tracks the language provided in G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79. \u201cWe have consistently held that indictments that follow the statutory form are constitutionally sufficient.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hrycenko, </em>417 Mass. 309, 313 (1994). There was no error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the armed robbery indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">4. <em>Right to cross-examine witnesses. </em>The defendant also argues that his right to cross-examine witnesses against him was infringed by the judge\u2019s interjection of comments and instructions to the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>308, 316 (1974) (criminal defendants guaranteed Sixth Amendment right to reasonable cross-examination of witnesses against them). We review the issue to determine whether there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\u201c [C] ross-examination of witnesses, in particular the principal accuser of the defendant, is a fundamental component of the right of self-representation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>410 Mass. 1, 12 (1991). It is well settled that \u201cthe scope of cross-examination, including to what extent the accuracy, veracity, and credibility of a witness may be tested, rests largely in the sound discretion of the judge, not subject to revision unless prejudice is shown to a party by reason of too narrow restriction or too great breadth of inquiry.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>382 Mass. 119, 125 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 516, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 935 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>329 Mass. 477, 479 (1952). The bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>den of demonstrating abuse of discretion rests with the defendant. We consider the entire cross-examination in evaluating the defendant\u2019s claim. <em>Reposa, supra, </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">As the exchange set forth in the margin shows,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> see note 9, <em>supra, </em>the defendant\u2019s strategy in cross-examining the victim was to develop inconsistencies and highlight omissions in the victim\u2019s initial description and identification of the defendant. The judge allowed exploration of the witness\u2019s conviction in the accuracy of his recollection of the defendant. However, when the defendant continued at length to press the witness as to the \u201cpossibility\u201d that he was mistaken in identifying the defendant, the judge excluded that question on cross-examination. \u201cA judge certainly has wide discretion to limit repetitive or redundant cross-examination, and there was no showing that the judge\u2019s action on these matters unfairly impaired the defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>377 Mass. 814, 837 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>409 Mass. 110 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">5. <em>Identification. </em>The victim saw the defendant two times on January 22, 1991, once as a visitor to his apartment with an acquaintance of the victim, and later the same evening as one of three men who called on him at his home and committed these crimes. When the three men left the apartment, the victim telephoned the police to report the crimes. The defendant challenges the photographic identification made by the victim. The police showed the victim a photographic array of eight men. The victim \u201cimmediately\u201d identified the defendant\u2019s photograph. After the victim selected the defendant\u2019s photograph, the police assured the victim that he had identified his assailant, told the victim that they had the suspect in custody on an unrelated crime, and told the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>that the man he selected had committed a murder in the past.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant filed a late motion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to suppress the photographic identification and the in-court identification, arguing that the police officer\u2019s conduct was impermissibly suggestive and that a lineup rather than a photographic array was the proper identification procedure. The judge denied the motion after a voir dire hearing. The judge found that the victim was a very perceptive, \u201cvery acute observer, and his testimony [had] a high degree of reliability.\u201d He found the \u201cidentifications of the defendant in this courtroom and his photographic identification [to be] based upon his clear recollections that came as a result of his observations of the defendant at the time of the incident . . . [and that] the initial meeting [at the victim\u2019s] apartment with Rich [an acquaintance of the victim] was for fifteen to twenty minutes.\u201d The judge determined \u201cthere was nothing suggestive at all about the circumstances under which the defendant was first seen.\u201d He also ruled that \u201cthere was nothing suggestive about [the photographic identification] until after the identification was made. It is unfortunate the officer did say what he did say concerning the defendant then being in custody, but that certainly didn\u2019t [a] fleet the photographic identification, but it did certainly tend to confirm in the witnesses] mind that his choice had been a correct one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In order to suppress a photographic identification, the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his due process rights were violated by an identification process \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thornley, </em>406 Mass. 96, 98 (1989) <em>(Thornley II), </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thornley, </em>400 Mass. 355, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>364 (1987) <em>(Thornley I). Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>410 Mass. 248, 253 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The defendant points only to police conduct which occurred <em>after </em>the victim had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph out of a photographic array in arguing that the process was unnecessarily suggestive. The totality of the circumstances does not indicate that the police, prior to or while presenting the photographs, focused the victim\u2019s attention on the photograph of the defendant or otherwise made suggestions that could result in an irreparable misidentification.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Cf. <em>Thornley II, supra </em>(where eyeglasses were determinative identifying feature of defendant and only defendant\u2019s photograph had eyeglasses, photographic array was impermissibly suggestive). The judge did not improperly deny the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the photographic identification. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>403 Mass. 137, 139 (1988) (\u201cWhen the procedures are not suggestive, the pretrial identifications are admissible without a further showing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The defendant further challenges the judge\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the victim\u2019s in-court identification. Under the standard set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, </em>369 Mass. 860, 866 (1976), the in-court testimony may be suppressed if (1) the defendant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the photographic identification was unnecessarily suggestive, and (2) the Commonwealth is unable to show by clear and convincing evidence that the witness\u2019s in-court identification was not derived from a source independent of the unnecessarily suggestive photographic identification. The photographic identification was not impermissibly suggestive. There was no error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">6. <em>Consciousness of guilt evidence. </em>As part of its case-in-chief, the prosecution presented evidence that, when the defendant was approached by a police officer on January 23, 1991, the day after the assault and robbery of the victim, he told the officer his name was \u201cJames Johnson.\u201d The defendant objected to the introduction of this consciousness of guilt evidence on the ground that the police officer was investigating a crime unrelated to the assault and robbery at the time the defendant misrepresented his identity. The defendant argues that'it was error to admit this evidence because it is likely that he gave a false name because of the unrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>crime, which occurred on the same day that he spoke to the police. There was no error. \u201cFalse statements made to the police are a standard example of admissible evidence on consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 276 (1990), and cases cited. The defendant argues that he might have misrepresented his name to the police not because of the robbery and assault on the victim which occurred on January 22, 1991, but rather because of a crime he was subsequently charged with which occurred on January 23, 1991, the day of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\u201cEvidence that tends to show consciousness of guilt is relevant and is not rendered inadmissible simply because it may indicate that the defendant has committed another offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>386 Mass. 466, 471 (1982) (citations omitted). Because the evidence had a tendency to show that the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation was motivated by the assaults and robbery, the defendant\u2019s argument goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of the consciousness of guilt evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">7. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant raises three issues regarding the jury instructions. The defendant first challenges the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right not to testify and on identification and further argues that the judge failed to instruct the jury on consciousness of guilt evidence. Because the defendant did not preserve these issues below, \u201cwe review the jury instructions for clear error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pares-Ramirez, </em>400 Mass. 604, 610 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">A. <em>Right not to testify. </em>The judge instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s choice not to testify was not relevant to his guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>committed prejudicial error by failing to ask the defendant whether he desired such a charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buiel, </em>391 Mass. 744, 745 (1984), in which we held that, \u201cwhen a defendant seasonably requests that the jury not be instructed concerning the defendant\u2019s right not to testify, the judge must accede to that request.\u201d <em>Buiel </em>does not support the proposition that a trial judge commits reversible error by instructing the jury on the defendant\u2019s right not to testify when a defendant makes no request that the judge not give such an instruction. We noted in <em>Buiel, supra, </em>that, even if the defendant \u201chad the right under the State Constitution to have no instruction given concerning his failure to testify, the giving of that instruction, over the defendant\u2019s objection, was harmless error.\u201d There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">B. <em>Identification. </em>The judge instructed the jury that, \u201c[y]ou may also consider the length of time that lapsed between the occurrence of the crime and the next opportunity of the witness to see the defendant as a factor bearing upon the reliability of the identification.\u201d The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s instruction on identification on the ground that it was prejudicial. The Commonwealth argues that, even though the instruction did not mirror that adopted by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. 632, 640 (1993),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the variance does not constitute reversible error. We agree. Although the instructions varied from those recommended in <em>Cuffie, supra </em>at 640-641, the identification instructions as a whole made clear to the jury that the identification of the defendant as the assailant was subject to error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>and suggestion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the instructions on identification were not prejudicial and did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">C. <em>Consciousness of guilt instruction. </em>The defendant did not request and the trial judge did not give an instruction on the consciousness of guilt evidence. The defendant claims that the failure to give the instruction requires reversal. Recently, we reconsidered our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>416 Mass. 27, 29-30 (1993), and concluded that \u201cthe better practice is not to require that a judge, on his or her own initiative, instruct on the subject. The matter is left to the sound discretion of the judge, and it will not be error if he or she chooses not to instruct on the subject in the absence of a request.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, ante </em>426, 436 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>(1995).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We conclude that' there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">No issue of the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, to waive his right to counsel, or to represent himself has been raised.

The defendant thus urges this court to adopt a rule that, unless a lineup is not possible, \u201cidentification by photograph should not be used where the accused is in custody.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>389 Mich. 155, 186-187 (1973). See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>391 Mich. 323, 339 (1974) (adopting rule of evidence that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218 [1967], as to corporeal identifications, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>as to photographic showings, \u201cshall govern the receipt in evidence of identification testimony where the witness has viewed or seen photographs of the suspect without regard to when the judicial phase of the prosecution is commenced\u201d [footnotes omitted]). The <em>Anderson </em>case is inapplicable to these facts because Anderson was in custody for the crime in which he claims the lineup should have been held. Jackson was in custody for an unrelated crime. Thus, there was no violation of a \u201cright\u201d to a lineup even under <em>Anderson. </em>Although lineups are, as a general rule, the better identification procedure, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 319 (1979), photographic identifications which are not impermissibly suggestive are not constitutionally infirm. After viewing the array of eight photographs, we conclude the photographic array was not \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of an irreparable misidentification.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>399 Mass. 201, 205 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The defendant also argues that, by selecting a photographic array instead of a lineup identification procedure when the defendant is readily available for a lineup the police subvert his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>356 Mass. 74, 83 (1969). This argument is without merit. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>413 U.S. 300 (1973) (no right to counsel at postindictment photographic array because photographic array is not a critical stage of the prosecution), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>371 Mass. 862, 868 (1977) (\u201cSixth Amendment right to counsel does not extend to the showing of standard police identification photographs\u201d). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>362 Mass. 448, 451 (1972), we said that \u201c[t]o the extent that our decision[ ] in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>356 Mass. 74, 83 (1969), assume[s] that a right to counsel in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>connection with an identification procedure arises at an earlier stage [before defendant is indicted or charged with the crime], we no longer follow\u201d it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Because the victim had been to the District Court for the probable cause hearing at that time and a hearing was held on an unrelated matter and this case continued to another date, the judge did suppress the evidence of the identification made at the probable cause hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Specifically, the judge instructed: \u201cNow, there are certain other basic considerations in every case, and one of them in this case is this defendant obviously as you have seen has chosen not to testify. Well, whether he testifies or not, again is his right. He can testify or not as he chooses. When he does not testify, he is simply exercising his right, and you are not to infer anything harmful to him in any way because of that fact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The portion of the instruction adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. 632, 640 (1993), which the judge did not follow precisely reads, \u201cYou may also consider the length of time that lapsed between the occurrence of the crime and the opportunity of the witness, some time after the occurrence of the crime, to see and identify the defendant as the offender, as a factor bearing on the reliability of the identification.\u201d For the entire instruction, see <em>id. </em>at 640-641.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The judge instructed the jury as follows regarding identification: \u201cIn general, a witness bases any identification he makes on his perception through the use of his senses. Usually the witness identifies an offender by the sense of sight, and they go on and talk about the times when other senses are used. Are you satisfied that the identification made by the witness subsequent to the offense was the product of his own recollection? You may take into account both the strength of the identification and the circumstances under which the identification was made. If the identification by the witness may have been influenced by\" the circumstances under which the defendant was presented to him for identification, you should scrutinize the identification with great care. You may also consider the length of time that lapsed between the occurrence of the crime and the next opportunity of the witness to see the defendant as a factor bearing upon the reliability of the identification. By the way, here when we are talking about identifications, that applies as well to photographs as it does to person-to-person type observations. You may also take into account that an identification made by picking the defendant out of a group of similar individuals, is generally more reliable than one that results in the presentation of the defendant alone to the witness. You may take into account any occasions in which the witness failed to make an identification of a defendant, or made an identification that was inconsistent with his identification at trial. Finally, you must consider the credibility of each identification witness in the same way as any other witness, consider whether he is truthful, and consider whether he had the capacity and opportunity to make a reliable observation on the matter covered in his testimony. Consider also the alternative of a mistaken identification having \"been made in good faith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\">We note that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>416 Mass. 27, 29-30 (1993), was decided after the instructions in this case and thus there is no question that <em>Cruz </em>should apply to these instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b756-6\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzC\">(dissenting). I would reverse the convictions of armed robbery and armed assault in a dwelling house with intent to commit a felony. The evidence did not warrant those convictions. I would remand this case to the Superior Court for the entry of verdicts of guilty of unarmed robbery and assault in a dwelling house with intent to commit a felony and for the imposition of sentences for those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The court correctly says, <em>ante </em>at 723, that there was evidence that, when the victim \u201cgot up from the chair where the defendant had told him to sit . . . [t]he defendant put his hand in his \u2018pocket and motioned it\u2019 toward the victim and said, \u2018I\u2019ll blow you away.\u2019 The victim said that the defendant carried himself as if he was armed with a gun. The victim said he was afraid he would be harmed. The victim did not see a gun.\u201d There was no other evidence bearing on the question whether the defendant was armed when, as the indictments allege, he assaulted and robbed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">In holding that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts, the court concludes that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432 (1975), and not <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>386 Mass. 607 (1982), governs. <em>Ante </em>at 723. In both of those cases, by words and body language, the defendant told the victim that he had a gun and was prepared to use it. <em>Delgado, supra </em>at 434. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 607. In neither case was a gun seen or thereafter found. <em>Delgado, supra </em>at 436. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 609. In neither case was there evidence, other than the aforementioned communication, that the defendant was armed. Yet, in <em>Delgado, </em>decided in 1975, the court held that the evidence warranted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>finding that the defendant was guilty of robbery \u201cwith a dangerous weapon, to wit: a gun,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 437, and, in <em>Howard, </em>decided in 1982, the court held that the evidence did not warrant such a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 611. The court in <em>Howard </em>concluded that \u201cwhere a robber had no instrumentality at all, although he said he had a gun, a conviction of armed robbery is not warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">As the court points out here, <em>ante </em>at 724, in <em>Howard </em>\u201c[the court] said that \u2018[i]t is the absence of any basis to infer that the defendant may have had a gun that distinguishes <em>[Howard] </em>from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado.'\" </em>The fair implication of that explanation is that, if there had been an evidentiary basis for the jury in <em>Howard </em>to find that the defendant \u201cmay have\u201d had a gun, the evidence would have warranted the jury in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant actually had a gun when he robbed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The court\u2019s rationale in <em>Howard </em>for distinguishing <em>Delgado </em>was that, in <em>Delgado, </em>the evidence showed that the defendant had an opportunity before he was apprehended to discard a gun <em>{if </em>he had one), which would have warranted the jury in finding that he \u201cmay have\u201d had a gun, whereas, in <em>Howard, </em>the defendant did not have such an opportunity, so the jury would not have been warranted in finding that the defendant \u201cmay have\u201d had a gun. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 610. As a result, the court reversed the conviction in <em>Howard </em>while implying, at least, that <em>Delgado </em>was still good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The court now repeats the distinction it made in <em>Howard, </em>saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">\u201cUnlike the defendant in <em>Howard </em>[and like the defendant in <em>Delgado], </em>Jackson was not apprehended in the course of the robbery. Thus, Jackson\u2019s conduct and words with his hand in his jacket stating that \u2018I\u2019ll blow you away\u2019 were designed to place the victim in fear and did in fact do so. In these circumstances, there is no reason not to take an assailant at his word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">\u201cBecause the defendant, like Delgado, had the opportunity to dispose of the gun before he was arrested, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>distinguishing fact from <em>Howard, </em>it was proper to instruct the jurors [and, by implication, to submit the armed robbery and armed assault indictments to the jury] that it was up to them to determine whether the defendant was armed with a gun when he said, \u2018I\u2019ll blow you away\u2019 during the crimes.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 723.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">I wrote a concurring opinion in <em>Howard. Id. </em>at 611-618 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). I agreed that the evidence in that case did not warrant a finding that the defendant was armed at the time of the alleged robbery, <em>id. </em>at 611, but I argued that the same result should have obtained in <em>Delgado </em>and that the <em>Howard </em>court should have expressly overruled <em>Delgado. Id. </em>at 618. I wrote in part that \u201c[i]n light of common experience [see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 678 (1979)], a defendant\u2019s statement during a robbery that he has a gun, threatening as such a statement is, does not warrant an inference beyond a reasonable doubt that in fact he has one. Common experience suggests that a robber who does not have a weapon may say he has one in order to facilitate the robbery. This is unlike a defendant\u2019s statement, after the crime has been completed, that at the time of the crime he had a weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fiore, </em>364 Mass. 819, 822 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>321 Mass. 290 (1947). Common experience tells us that ordinarily such an admission is not made unless it is true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612-613. In my concurrence in <em>Howard, </em>I also stated: \u201cEven if the defendant has moved from the crime scene before being apprehended by the police, so that if he had a gun he could have disposed of it, a jury would not be warranted in finding that he had a gun. This is because evidence of such a circumstance is irrelevant; it lacks probative worth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613. Evidence that a defendant <em>may have </em>disposed of a gun has no tendency whatsoever to show that he <em>did </em>dispose of a gun, and therefore it sheds no light on the critical question whether he ever had a gun. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s words and body language at the time of the alleged crimes is insufficient, standing alone, to warrant a finding beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>reasonable doubt that the defendant was armed. It is illogical and grossly unfair to a defendant to say that evidence that is inadequate to warrant a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he was armed at the time of a robbery or assault is somehow elevated to that lofty plateau by additional evidence that he had time to dispose of a weapon if he had one that he <em>may have </em>(Howard, <em>supra </em>at 610) or may <em>not </em>have had a gun and disposed of it. For all that appears in this case, the \u201crobber had no instrumentality at all, although he said he had a gun,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 608, and therefore the \u201cconviction [s] of armed robbery [and armed assault are] not warranted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
