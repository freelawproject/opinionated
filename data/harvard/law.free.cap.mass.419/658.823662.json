NET\u2019s breach of contract claim, based on damage that allegedly occurred in August, 1986, is barred under a New Hampshire three-year statute of limitations, if it is applicable. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 508:4 (Supp. 1994) (three-year statute of limitations, effective July 1, 1986 [1986 N.H. Laws c. 227, \u00a7 12]). On the other hand, the Massachusetts statute of limitations for contract actions is six years (G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2 [1992 ed.]), and, if that is the appropriate statute of limitations to apply in this action, NET\u2019s claim is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">A judge of the Superior Court recognized that, pursuant to decided cases in the Commonwealth, the statute of limitations of Massachusetts, the forum State, should be applied in this case because statutes of limitations have been viewed as a procedural matter. She, therefore, denied Gourdeau\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the contract count of NET\u2019s complaint. In a thorough memorandum in response to Gourdeau\u2019s request for a report of the issue to the Appeals Court, the judge stated that there is a trend elsewhere toward \u201cabandoning the former policy of automatically applying the statute of limitations of the forum State. Many jurisdictions are now applying the statute of limitations of the place with the most significant relationship to or interest in the matter,\u201d citing cases. She added, citing authorities, that \u201c[m]any commentators have criticized the traditional conflicts analysis that treated statutes of limitation as \u2018procedural\u2019 rather than \u2018substantive\u2019 and have urged courts to consider alternative approaches.\u201d She further recognized that the principle stated in a 1988 amendment to the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 142 (Supp. 1989) reflects a shift away from the automatic use of a forum\u2019s statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>(1974), the judge reported the propriety of her order denying Gourdeau\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and we allowed Gourdeau\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Massachusetts precedent calls for the application of the Massachusetts statute of limitations to NET\u2019s contract claim. That rule is stated in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>215 Mass. 552, 553 (1913), which relies on the opinion of Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Bulger </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>11 Pick. 36, 39-40 (1831). Last year in a case involving the question whether to apply a foreign jurisdiction\u2019s statute of repose, we said in dicta that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth considers statutes of limitations as procedural: \u2018Massachusetts views statutes of limitation as relating to the remedy, and it applies its own law as the law of the forum.\u2019 <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Riverside Park Enters., </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 419, 421 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>399 Mass. 533 (1987), and cases cited.\u201d <em>Cosme </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 643, 645 (1994). The <em>Cosme </em>opinion is interesting for our purposes because the court concluded that it would take a functional approach in determining the choice of law issue, because statutes of repose were not clearly procedural for choice of law purposes in the Commonwealth. <em>Id. </em>at 645-646. It is this same functional approach that this court has applied in selecting which State\u2019s substantive law to apply (see, e.g., <em>Bushkin Assocs. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>393 Mass. 622, 631-632 [1985]) and that Gourdeau urges this court to use now in deciding which statute of limitations to apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>ment is that we should apply the New Hampshire statute of limitations because New Hampshire has a more significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We discuss first whether consideration of the more significant relationship test would direct us to New Hampshire\u2019s statute of limitations, because, if it would not, both the traditional rule and the significant relationship test would lead us to apply the Massachusetts statute of limitations. Our focus should be on which State has the more significant relationship to the occurrence and to the parties with respect to the issue of limitations. See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 142 comment e (Supp. 1989). See also <em>id. </em>comment g (\u201cthe forum should not entertain a claim when doing so would not advance any local interest and would frustrate the policy of a state with a closer connection with the case and whose statute of limitations would bar the claim\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The motion judge concluded that \u201cMassachusetts has no substantial interest in NET\u2019s claim against Gourdeau\u201d and that New Hampshire has a far more significant relationship to the parties and the occurrence because the events in question occurred in New Hampshire and the construction contract provided that \u201c[t]he Contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the Project is located.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gourdeau repeats these points but does not argue that the quoted contract language dictates that New Hampshire\u2019s statute of limitations must be used. NET argues, on the other hand, that (1) both parties have principal places of business in Massachusetts; (2) Gourdeau is a Massachusetts corporation; (3) the contract was executed in Massachusetts; and (4) at the time that the contract was entered into, each State had a six-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> NET also argues that the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the forum\u2019s statute of limitations in all instances involves a rule of easy application and eliminates the uncertainty that the use of a balancing test often will create.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The functional approach calls for consideration of the choice of law question, not generally (as the Uniform Act would have us do [see last paragraph of note 3 above]), but with particular reference to the statute of limitations issue. See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 142 comment e (the emerging trend is to bar a claim if barred by \u201cthe state which, <em>with respect to the issue of limitations </em>is the state of most significant relationship to the occurrence and to the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Certainly the Legislature has the right, within constitutional limits, to prescribe the answer to the statute of limitations issue. See <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Wortman, </em>486 U.S. 717 (1988). See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6 (1) (court should follow any statutory directive on choice of law). Massachusetts has a statutory provision under which the statute of limitations of another State will be applied or \u201cborrowed\u201d in certain limited situations. See G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 9 (1992 ed.). The scope of that statute is narrow. See <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Riverside Park Enters., Inc., </em>399 Mass. 533, 539 (1987). The legislative decision to enact only a limited exceptian to the general common law rule is entitled to weight as a statement of the Commonwealth\u2019s policy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">Restatement \u00a7 142 (2) (a) states that Massachusetts should apply its own statute of limitations permitting a claim to be asserted unless \u201cmaintenance of the claim would serve no substantial interest of [Massachusetts].\u201d Massachusetts has a substantial interest in letting NET\u2019s claim go forward. Each party has its principal place of business here; the contract was executed here; Massachusetts has expressed a preference that contracts be enforceable within six years of the accrual of the cause of action; Massachusetts could have, but has not, enacted broad legislation importing the statutes of limitations of other States; and the predictability of our judicial processes in providing answers with respect to completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>transactions would be lessened by an abrupt change of law in this case. The fact of the amendment of the New Hampshire statute, adopted after the contract was entered into and shortly before the alleged cause of action arose (reducing the limitations period from six years to three), does not offer a proper basis to change the result that unquestionably would have obtained if the New Hampshire statute had not been amended. In amending its statute of limitations as it did after the opinion in <em>Keeton </em>v. <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>465 U.S. 770, 778 n.10 (1984), New Hampshire itself stated its continuing preference for the application of the forum\u2019s statute of limitations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The judge was correct in denying Gourdeau\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the contract count. We state for the future that this court\u2019s treatment of the application of statutes of limitations as procedural will no longer be continued. The certainty of the traditional answer as to which statute of limitations to apply does not justify a refusal to apply the statute of limitations of another jurisdiction in particular circumstances. The order denying the motion of Gourdeau Construction Company for summary judgment on the contract count of its complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Section 142 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, as amended in 1988, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201cWhether a claim will be maintained against the defense of the statute of limitations is determined under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.
