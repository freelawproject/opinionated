Steven Molinaro, a minor, was allegedly injured by a defective slide on a play<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ground owned by the town and available for public use without charge. The plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint alleges that (1) the town was negligent in various respects causing Steven\u2019s injuries and (2) the town was \u201cwillful, wanton and reckless\u201d causing Steven\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The allowance of the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims was correct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Anderson </em>v. Springfield, 406 Mass. 632, 634 (1990), we held that under G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C (1992 ed.), the city was protected from negligence claims based on injuries sustained while using recreational facilities made available to the public without charge. Section 17C provides immunity for injuries sustained at such a facility \u201cin the absence of wilful, wanton or reckless conduct by [the] owner.\u201d See <em>Forbush </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 696, 704 (1994); <em>Catanzarite </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 967, 968 (1992). There is no statutory exemption for playground injuries to children (cf. <em>Magro </em>v. <em>Vineland, </em>148 N.J. Super. 34, 38-39 [App. Div. 1977]), nor does \u00a7 17C exclude from its reach public playgrounds or structures in such a playground. We apply \u00a7 17C as written and as construed in our <em>Anderson </em>opinion, which we decline to overrule.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the town acted wantonly or recklessly should not have been dismissed. Under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, the town is not liable for intentional torts. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (c) (1992 ed.). Wanton conduct and reckless conduct, however, do not involve the intentional infliction of harm. The Appeals Court identified this distinction in <em>Forbush </em>v. <em>Lynn, supra </em>at 699, an opinion that was released after the motion judge\u2019s allowance of the town\u2019s motion to dismiss. We agree with the conclusion of the <em>Forbush </em>opinion. Section 10 (c) does not immunize a municipality from claims based on wanton or reckless conduct. <em>Forbush </em>v. <em>Lynn, supra </em>at 699-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">The judgment is vacated insofar as it dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, set forth in count four of the amended com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>plaint, based on the town\u2019s alleged wanton or reckless conduct. The portion of the judgment dismissing the other counts of the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-17\">The motion had a summary judgment component but it appears that the judge\u2019s ruling was based on the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
