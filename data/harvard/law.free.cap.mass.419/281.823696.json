L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P (1992 ed.), and G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (1992 ed.), from a decision of the Energy Facilities Siting Board issued December 15, 1993. In that matter, Altresco Lynn, Inc. (Altresco), petitioned the board to approve Altresco\u2019s planned construction of a gas-fired cogeneration 170 megawatt power facility at the General Electric River Works in Lynn. The proposal contemplated a facility that would begin operation in 1996. The board concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201cHere, in light of the need for the proposed project beginning in the year 2000 on reliability grounds, the Siting Board[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] finds that submission of (1) a signed and approved contract with [Boston Edison Company] for 132 [megawatts], or (2) signed and approved [power purchase agreements] [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] which include capacity payments for at least 75 percent of the proposed project\u2019s electric output, will be sufficient to establish that the proposed project will provide a necessary energy supply for the Commonwealth. Altresco must satisfy this condition within four years from the date of this condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tional approval. Altresco will not receive final approval of its project until it complies with this condition. The Siting board finds that, at such time that Altresco complies with this condition, Altresco will have demonstrated that the proposed project will provide a necessary energy supply for the Commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">A single justice of this court allowed Altresco\u2019s motion to intervene in this appeal, and reserved and reported the matter to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 69J, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201cNo applicant shall commence construction of a facility at a site unless a petition for approval of construction of that facility has been approved by the board .... The board shall within twelve months from the date of filing approve a petition to construct a facility .. . if it determines that it meets the following requirements: . . . plans for expansion and construction of the applicant\u2019s new facilities are consistent with . . . policies stated in section sixty-nine H <em>to provide a necessary energy supply for the commonwealth </em>with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The statute \u201crequires that the energy the facility will supply is necessary for the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>413 Mass. 482, 486 (1992). In the absence of need, a facility cannot properly be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Since Altresco\u2019s proposal contemplated a facility that would begin operation in 1996, the board considered whether, beginning in that year, the Commonwealth would have need for the energy the facility is designed to generate. In order to make the required showing, Altresco submitted to the board voluminous material regarding capacity and demand forecasts for the Commonwealth and for New England. The board found the record to be \u201cunclear regarding the ability of Massachusetts utilities to acquire surplus sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>plies from out-of-state providers\u201d before the year 2000, and thus concluded that, \u201cbased on the record, the Siting Board is unable to determine that the proposed project is needed to provide a necessary energy supply for the Commonwealth prior to the year 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The board then turned to a procedure that it had used in an earlier decision on remand in <em>Eastern Energy Corporation </em>(Remand). See <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Board, post </em>1003 (1995). In that case, the board concluded that, for the years in which the Commonwealth\u2019s energy requirements might be met by surplus energy produced elsewhere in New England, the board would nevertheless find the Commonwealth to have need of energy if the board were to receive signed power purchase agreements, previously approved by the Department of Public Utilities (department), which provide buyers for a specified percentage of the proposed facility\u2019s output. In the present case, the board applied the same principle and concluded that \u201cat such time as Altresco [submits approved power purchase agreements], Altresco will have demonstrated that the proposed project will provide a necessary energy supply for the Commonwealth.\u201d The plaintiffs challenge the board\u2019s logic, arguing that an approved power purchase agreement, standing alone, cannot demonstrate need.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In <em>Eastern Energy Corporation </em>(Remand), the board did not explain how the existence of approved power purchase agreements would demonstrate the existence of Commonwealth need. The board merely cited its own earlier (1987) decision, <em>Northeast Energy Associates, </em>for the proposition that signed and approved power purchase agreements constitute prima facie evidence that the energy contracted for is needed by the Commonwealth. The <em>Northeast Energy Associates </em>decision, however, does not support the proposition for which it is cited. In that case, the board concluded that a power purchase agreement may be evidence that a particular <em>utility </em>needs energy, but the board did not conclude that the existence of such an agreement by itself demonstrates the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>need for energy, and no explanation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>inferability of Commonwealth need from utility need has been furnished to us either in reasoned argument or by reference to board decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In <em>Northeast Energy Associates, </em>the board did find Commonwealth need based <em>in part </em>on evidence of a utility\u2019s need. The board\u2019s \u201c[conclusion on [n]ced\u201d was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cNBA [Northeast Energy Associates] has established (1) that New England needs at least 300 MW of additional power resources for reliability purposes by 1990, and (2) that the Commonwealth is likely to receive reliability and economic benefits from the proposed additional power within the same time period. Accordingly, the Siting Council finds that the proposed 300 MW of additional power resources are needed by 1990.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The board relied on an almost identical rationale in the original <em>Eastern Energy Corporation </em>case and, on appeal in that case, this court rejected that rationale. <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, supra </em>at 489-490.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The board argues that it properly may rely on approved power purchase agreements to establish Commonwealth need because the department must be satisfied of the existence of such need as a prerequisite to its approval. By according deference to the department\u2019s findings in this regard, the board argues, the public interest is served by ensuring a harmonious and consistent energy policy. Such reasoning fails to take into account G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J\u2019s provision that the \u201cboard shall . . . approve a petition to construct a facility . . . if it determines that it meets the following requirements: . . . plans for expansion and construction of the applicant\u2019s new facilities are consistent with . . . policies stated in section sixty-nine H to provide a necessary energy supply for the commonwealth . . . .\u201d The board must ensure that every project it approves is necessary, and it may not abdicate its responsibility by relying on conclusions of the department. We note that, in this case, the board concluded that \u201cbased on the record, the Siting board is unable to determine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the proposed project is needed to provide a necessary energy supply for the Commonwealth prior to the year 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Even apart from the statutory requirement that the board make an independent finding of Commonwealth need as a prerequisite to approving construction of a facility, the board\u2019s approval in this case must be set aside because, standing alone, the department\u2019s approval of a power purchase agreement does not warrant an inference of Commonwealth need. This is illustrated by the very agreement relied on by the board and Altresco in this case. The board has concluded that a signed and approved contract between Altresco, as supplier, and Boston Edison Company, as purchaser, will be sufficient to establish that the proposed project will provide a necessary energy supply for the Commonwealth. Altresco argues that the board has a right to supplement its statistical forecasts with a so-called \u201cmarket test\u201d; the agreement demonstrates consumer demand (need). However, at least in this case, as we explain below, it is apparent that the Altresco-Boston Edison power purchase agreement contemplated by the board\u2019s order would not be the product of market forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">As part of its implementation of the Federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 796 and 824a-3 (1988), which was enacted to encourage the development of alternative energy sources that would reduce the demand for fossil fuels, the department adopted regulations that require electric utilities to request project proposals from nonutility generators for the furnishing of electric power pursuant to long term fixed price contracts. Boston Edison Company was ordered by the department to proceed with a request for proposals, which led to the Altresco proposal that was ultimately approved. Boston Edison is thus faced with entering into the power purchase agreement .with Altresco by compulsion and without reference to market forces. Claiming that it has no need for additional energy, Boston Edison has contested the department\u2019s mandate that it purchase it, <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>417 Mass. 458 (1994), and continues to contest that man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>date by appealing the board\u2019s decision after remand. That appeal is now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We remand the case to the single justice with instructions that the board\u2019s decision issued December 15, 1993, be vacated. We leave any question concerning a reopening of the board\u2019s hearings to the discretion of the board.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Altresco had originally filed the petition with the Energy Facilities Siting Council. By St. 1992, c. 141, effective September 1, 1992, the Energy Facilities Siting Council was reorganized, renamed the Energy Facilities Siting Board, and merged into the Department of Public Utilities. The board is now within, but not under the control or supervision of, the Department of Public Utilities. Other than the name change, St. 1992, c. 141, has no bearing on this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\">A power purchase agreement is a long-term fixed price contract for the sale of energy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We have considered and reject Altresco\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
