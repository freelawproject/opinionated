L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1992 ed.), seeking to vacate a decision of a Superior Court judge ordering him to produce documents contained within a prosecutorial file. We remand this case to the single justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>where a judgment is to enter vacating the order of the Superior Court judge and remanding the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">This matter arises from a civil action pending in the Superior Court Department, in which it is alleged that the plaintiff was the victim of an aggravated rape and an assault and battery which occurred in her apartment. The individual who perpetrated those crimes was prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to prison. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgments. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stande, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1115 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The apartment where the rape occurred is owned and managed by the defendant, Thomas J. Flatley. In the course of discovery in this case, Flatley subpoenaed the assistant district attorney who had prosecuted the criminal case (prosecutor), to produce the contents of his files which related to the investigation, prosecution, or trial of the criminal case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Flatley argued that the contents of the file were relevant to the issues in the civil case and that inconsistencies exist between the victim\u2019s statements to the Randolph police department and her later testimony at the criminal trial. At the hearing on Flatley\u2019s motion to compel production, the prosecutor described generally the categories of documents contained within the file. After hearing arguments by counsel, the motion judge allowed Flatley\u2019s motion to compel \u201cbut only to the extent of statements of witnesses, sworn or unsworn, in the possession of the district attorney.\u201d The prosecutor then notified the judge and the parties to the civil litigation that he had located additional materials in his criminal prosecution file constituting fifteen pages of handwritten notes created by him following his initial interview with the victim. When the district attorney argued that these notes did not fall within the purview of the judge\u2019s order for production, the judge convened a supplemental telephonic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>hearing regarding the newly discovered documentation contained within the prosecutorial file. After hearing arguments by counsel, including a specific description of the prosecutor\u2019s notes, the judge ruled that the notes were within the scope of his order, and therefore, must be produced. The district attorney then filed a motion for reconsideration, which another judge denied. The district attorney then sought review of the judge\u2019s decision before the single justice pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. After determining that it was proper to use the extraordinary powers under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to review the judge\u2019s decision, the single justice dismissed the district attorney\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">We review a decision of a single justice to determine whether there has been a clear error of law or an abuse of discretion. See <em>Department of Mental Retardation </em>v. <em>Kendrew, </em>418 Mass. 50, 53 (1994); <em>Delisle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. 359, 360 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">1. <em>Deliberative process privilege. </em>The district attorney contends that the documents sought (i.e., fifteen pages of handwritten notes assembled after prosecutor\u2019s initial interview with rape victim) are \u201cprosecutorial deliberative material,\u201d and therefore, should be protected from public access. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>239 Mass. 458, 490-491 (1921). See <em>Gomez </em>v. <em>Nashua, </em>126 F.R.D. 432, 435 (D.N.H. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Berrigan, </em>482 F.2d 171, 180-181 (3d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Federal courts have long recognized the \u201cdeliberative process privilege\u201d which prevents the disclosure of intraagency memoranda and documents that record the deliberative, predecisional process leading to an agency decision. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 150-151 (1975); <em>N.O. </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>110 F.R.D. 637, 641 (D. Mass. 1986) (documents containing discussions regarding fiscal policy privileged). However, in Massachusetts, neither the courts nor the Legislature has adopted a \u201cdeliberative process\u201d privilege as the district attorney now suggests. See <em>Babets </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>403 Mass. 230, 239 (1988) (declining to create \u201cdeliberative process\u201d or \u201cexecutive\u201d privilege as asserted by the defendants); <em>N.O. </em>v. <em>Callahan, supra </em>at 642 (acknowledging absence of any Massachusetts opinion recognizing deliberative process privilege).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">However, this court has stated that \u201c[i]t is a principle of law founded upon sound public policy and arising out of the creation and establishment of constitutional government that communications made to a district attorney in order to secure the enforcement of law are privileged and confidential in the sense that they cannot be revealed at the instance of private parties in aid of actions at law.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, supra. </em>Over one century ago this court explained the rationale for this rule: \u201cIt is the duty of every citizen to communicate to his government any information which he has of the commission of an offence against its laws. To encourage him in performing this duty without fear of consequences, the law holds such information to be among the secrets of state, and leaves the question how far and under what circumstances the names of the informers and the channel of communication shall be suffered to be known, to the absolute discretion of the government. . . .\u201d <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Scribner, </em>109 Mass. 487, 488 (1872). These two cases not only establish a broad privilege encompassing all communications made to a prosecutor for the purpose of securing law enforcement, but also make the privilege absolute. No subsequent Massachusetts decision modifies or abrogates either <em>Tufts </em>or <em>Worthington. </em>However, the Legislature has adopted G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (1992 ed.), the public records statute, which requires public access to various records and documents in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>possession of public officials unless otherwise exempt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812, 815-816 (1978) (discussing history of public records statute). \u201cThe class of records to which the public must be afforded access is defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth [1992 ed.].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 430 (1983) (discussing interrelationship between statutes). Generally, the public records statute favors disclosure by creating a \u201cpresumption that the record sought is public.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, details specific exemptions to the public records statute, but in order for a record to qualify as exempt, the custodian of the record has the burden \u201cto prove with specificity\u201d that an exemption applies. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c). See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Northampton, </em>375 Mass. 127, 131 (1978); <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 61-62 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">2. <em>G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (f) exemption. </em>The district attorney contends that the information sought constitutes \u201claw enforcement investigative materials,\u201d and therefore, is protected from public access under the specific statutory exemption of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (/) (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>exemption advanced by the district attorney recognizes that \u201cdisclosure of certain investigatory materials could detract from effective law enforcement to such a degree as to operate in derogation, and not in support, of the public interest.\u201d <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, supra. </em>The public policy concerns that support this exemption include \u201cthe prevention of the disclosure of confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information, [and] the encouragement of individual citizens to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">With these policy concerns in mind, this court held in <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, supra, </em>that certain police reports and letters from private citizens regarding a specific incident under investigation were exempt from public disclosure under cl. Twenty-Sixth (f) of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7. <em>Id. </em>at 66. Similarly, in <em>WBZ-TV4 </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>408 Mass. 595, 602-604 (1990), we held that disclosure of a videotape of a lineup conducted for grand jury purposes, as well as a videotaped witness statement \u201ccould well have an adverse effect on effective law enforcement,\u201d and therefore, both were exempt from disclosure under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(f).</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Therefore, recognizing the absence of a blanket exemption for police records or investigatory materials, this court has stated that a case-by-case review is required to determine whether an exemption applies, <em>Reinstein </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>378 Mass. 281, 289-290 (1979), and that \u201c[t]here must be specific proof elicited that the documents sought are of a type for which an exemption has been provided. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>doubtful questions an in camera inspection <em>may be appropri</em>ate\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, supra </em>at 65-66. Therefore, given the precedent set forth in <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, supra, </em>and <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Scribner, supra, </em>and because it is unclear from the record whether the lower court judge found that the prosecutor\u2019s handwritten notes constituted public records under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, or whether the district attorney met his burden of proof that the documents indeed were exempt from public disclosure under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (/), we remand the case for a determination of these two issues.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The case is remanded to a single justice of this court, where a judgment is to be entered vacating the order of the Superior Court judge and remanding the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In this case, the defendant Flatley served the prosecutor with a subpoena duces tecum and notice of deposition seeking \u201c[t]he entire contents of the District Attorney\u2019s office file or files which relate to the investigation, prosecution and trial of [the criminal defendant] for the aggravated rape [and] assault and battery of [the victim].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The single justice decided that \u201cit is proper for this Court to use its extraordinary powers under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to review the Superior Court\u2019s action at this stage rather than to limit the [district attorney] to an appeal to the full court after an adjudication of contempt.\u201d Given the district attorney\u2019s position as both an elected official and the chief law enforcement officer of the Commonwealth in the Norfolk district, we agree with the single justice\u2019s decision that it was proper for the district attorney to seek relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1992 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-6\">General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10 (a) (1992 ed.), states in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person having custody of any public record . . . shall, at reasonable times and without unreasonable delay, permit it, or any segregable portion of a record which is an independent public record, to be inspected and examined by any person, under his supervision, and shall furnish one copy thereof upon payment of a reasonable fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\">General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (1992 ed.), states that public records shall include \u201call books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded tapes, financial statements, statistical tabulations, or other documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of an agency, executive office, department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority of the commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c) (1992 ed.), states in pertinent part: \u201c[T]here shall be a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden shall be upon the custodian to prove with specificity the exemption which applies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Clause Twenty-sixth (/) of G.
