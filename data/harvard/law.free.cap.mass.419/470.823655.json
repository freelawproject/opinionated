After a jury trial, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>was convicted, on March 29, 1989, of the lesser crime of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to from nineteen to twenty years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. The Appeals Court, in an unreported decision pursuant to its Rule 1:28, affirmed the conviction. 36 Mass. App. Ct. 1104 (1994). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. The defendant argues that the trial judge erred in (1) refusing his request to recross-examine the victim\u2019s mother, Carol Shanahan and (2) prohibiting his inspection of a document used by the prosecution to refresh the recollection of Carol Shanahan on the witness stand. We find no reversible error. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The jury were presented with sufficient evidence to find the following facts. Late in the evening of October 3, 1987, Sean Patrick Shanahan, a five month old infant, was found dead in his crib at his mother\u2019s Somerville apartment. There were no external injuries to Sean\u2019s body except a small (one-eighth inch) abrasion on the right side of his nose. An autopsy revealed that Sean died as a result of blunt head trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">When initially questioned by police, the defendant, the live-in boy friend of Sean\u2019s mother, denied involvement in the child\u2019s death. However, when he was informed of the results of the autopsy, the defendant gave two separate statements admitting involvement in Sean\u2019s death. In both statements he claimed that he had accidently dropped the child during the day on October 2, but the statements differed as to how the accident occurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Carol Shanahan had had three children prior to Sean\u2019s death. The two older children, Justin, four years old in October, 1987, and Julia, two years old in October, 1987, were fathered by the defendant, with whom Carol had had an intermittent relationship since she was fourteen years old. Prior to Sean\u2019s birth in April of 1987, Carol and the defendant had not lived together for some time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In August of 1987, when Sean was about four months old, the defendant and Carol Shanahan resumed their relationship and the defendant began living with Shanahan and her three children in her apartment in Somerville. Evidence admitted at trial tended to show that the defendant had been abusive toward Sean on a few occasions between the time that he moved into the apartment and the child\u2019s death. Carol Shanahan and her neighbor, Selena Gonzalez, both testified about an incident in which the defendant put Sean in a closet and shut the door because he was crying. Carol Shanahan also testified that one day she noticed that the child had a black eye but it was not clear whether the defendant had caused the injury. There was evidence that the defendant yelled at Sean when he cried and would sometimes shake the baby while holding him by his sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">On October 2, 1987, Shanahan left for work at about 8 a.m., leaving the three children at home with the defendant. Just before 3 p.m. she left work and went home. Taking Justin with her, she went to her mother\u2019s house in Charles-town. She stayed at her mother\u2019s for about twenty minutes and returned to her apartment with Justin and her eight year old sister, Darlene. They arrived at approximately 4 p.m. While Shanahan was preparing dinner, Sean woke up and she fed him. She testified he appeared normal although he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>had a runny nose. After feeding Sean, she put him back to bed. After dinner Shanahan left the apartment to buy some marihuana at the housing project across the street. When she left, Justin and Julia were in their bedroom playing, and Sean was sleeping in his crib. The defendant and Darlene were otherwise alone. Shanahan testified that she was gone about fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Darlene, almost ten years old at the time of trial, testified that after Shanahan left Sean began to cry. The defendant went into Sean\u2019s room and came out carrying the baby. The defendant carried Sean into the kitchen and Sean vomited on the defendant\u2019s shoulder. Darlene testified that the defendant got a \u201cmean\u201d look on his face and threw Sean up in the air over his head. The defendant bent down to try to catch Sean but he was unsuccessful and Sean hit the floor, making a \u201cloud noise\u201d when he landed. Sean began to cry and the defendant picked him up. Darlene testified that as the defendant was carrying Sean back to his room he turned to Darlene and told her to \u201cswear to God on Sean\u2019s soul that you won\u2019t tell anyone\u201d or he would \u201cget someone after [her].\u201d The de- . fendant put Sean back in his crib, and then sat down and watched television with Darlene until Shanahan returned. At no time did the defendant seek medical assistance for Sean.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Shanahan testified that after she returned from purchasing the marihuana the defendant\u2019s behavior changed. He said that he accepted Sean as his own child and wanted to marry her. Shanahan also testified that Darlene seemed particularly quiet. Later that evening Sean woke up and Shanahan noticed that he looked as though he had a cold; his face was puffy, his eyes were runny, and he was wheezing. She attempted to feed him but he would not eat. The next morning, October 3, Sean again appeared as if he had a cold so Shanahan left him in his crib. Shanahan\u2019s mother came over .in the afternoon and looked at Sean. She testified at trial that she thought Sean looked sick. Sean remained in his crib for the rest of the day and Shanahan did not check on him again. Her neighbor, Selena Gonzalez, watched the children for a time in the afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Late that evening the defendant, Shanahan, and Selena Gonzalez -decided to look in on Sean. The defendant quickly rose from his seat and entered the child\u2019s room. He came out seconds later with a look of shock on his face. He pointed to Sean\u2019s room and then ran out of the apartment. Gonzalez and Carol then went into the room and discovered that the child was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">1. <em>Denial of recross-examination. </em>The defendant asserts that it was his strategy at trial to impeach the testimony of Darlene and thereby establish that the head injury occurred as the result of an accident earlier on October 2 as claimed by the defendant. In order to argue successfully this theory, the defendant claims he had to show that there were symptoms of the head injury prior to the time that Darlene claims Shanahan left the apartment to buy marihuana. The defendant claims that the \u201ccold\u201d symptoms observed by Shanahan and other witnesses were actually symptoms of a head injury. Therefore, the defendant argues, the issue of when Sean\u2019s \u201ccold\u201d symptoms appeared was crucial to the defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Under cross-examination, Carol Shanahan testified, consistent with her testimony on direct examination, that she did not see Sean on October 2, 1987, from the time she left for ' work in the morning until around dinner time. When she saw him, Sean appeared to have a runny nose but exhibited no other cold symptoms. Defense counsel asked Shanahan whether she remembered making a statement to the police shortly after Sean\u2019s death in which she stated that when she got home with Darlene in the afternoon the two of them looked in on Sean and that he appeared to have a cold, and that he was wheezing and gasping and sounded hoarse. Shanahan testified that, while she remembered making a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>statement to the police, she could not remember stating that she checked on Sean in the afternoon or that he had appeared to have had a cold at that time. On being shown her written statement to police made following Sean\u2019s death, Shanahan repeated that she could not recall stating she had checked on Sean in the afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">On redirect examination, the prosecutor elicited testimony from Shanahan explaining that she was in an upset state on October 7 when she gave the statement because Sean\u2019s funeral had been the day before. On recross-examination, defense counsel attempted to ask Shanahan about a second statement she made some time after the October 7 statement, in preparation for trial. On the prosecutor\u2019s objection and the court\u2019s suggestion that the second statement was beyond the scope of redirect examination, defense counsel argued that the statement was within the scope of redirect because it impeached Shanahan\u2019s explanation as to why her October 7 statement was inconsistent with her trial testimony. The judge sustained the prosecution\u2019s objection. The judge precluded defense counsel from asking Shanahan about the contents of the second statement, which was not in evidence, ruling that it did not address a new matter raised on redirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The defendant argues that his right to confrontation under the Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions was violated when the judge denied his request to recross-examine Carol Shanahan regarding the second statement. We conclude that the judge acted within his sound discretion in ruling that the matter on which the defendant sought to examine Shanahan was not a new matter raised for the first time on redirect examination of the witness. Therefore, the defendant had no right to recross-examine her on the statement as it was beyond the scope of redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution guarantee a defendant the right to cross-examine each witness against him. This right to cross-examination is an essential component to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the right to a fair trial. <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 405 (1965). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caudle, </em>606 F.2d 451, 457 (4th Cir. 1979). However, as opposed to cross-examination, a defendant has no right to recross-examination unless the examination addresses a new matter brought out for the first time on redirect examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 119 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pickles, </em>364 Mass. 395, 401 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>356 Mass. 598, 602 (1970). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 950, 952 (1983). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>33 F.3d 1507, 1518 (11th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2558 (1995); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caudle, supra </em>at 457-458. If the recross-examinatian proposes to enter new territory not raised on redirect, the trial judge has discretion in determining whether to allow the examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, supra. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>10 F.3d 1374, 1404 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 330 (1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Riggi, </em>951 F.2d 1368, 1374-1375 (3d Cir. 1991). A ruling by a trial judge in this situation is given substantial weight by an appellate court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berth, </em>385 Mass. 784, 790 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The questions asked by the prosecutor on redirect examination regarding Shanahan\u2019s state of mind at the time she gave her October 7 statement were entirely proper in that they sought to explain the circumstances surrounding the making of a statement which had been used to impeach the witness on cross-examination. \u201cOne purpose of redirect examination is to allow a witness to \u2018explain, correct or modify the evidence elicited from / . . [him] on cross by the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caine, </em>366 Mass. 366, 368-369 (1974), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>310 Mass. 733, 747 (1942). \u201cA witness who has been impeached by a prior inconsistent statement may explain <em>why </em>he has made inconsistent statements\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 880 (1984). The questions which defense counsel proposed to ask on recross-examination involved an entirely separate statement, a statement which was not brought out at any point on direct, cross, or redirect ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>animation. He asked no question pertaining directly to her alleged state of mind. While it is true that had the defendant been permitted to recross-examine Shanahan on the second statement, her testimony might have been impeached, this possibility does not affect the outcome of this issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cefalo, </em>381 Mass. 319, 334-335 (1980) (judge did not abuse discretion in disallowing question on recross-examination whose answer might have impeached prosecution\u2019s witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The defendant had every opportunity to examine Shanahan regarding the second statement during the original cross-examination. Counsel\u2019s conduct in not taking that opportunity may have been an unfortunate tactical decision, but such a decision cannot now be considered a constitutional error on the judge\u2019s part. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>974 F.2d 1241, 1245 (10th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">2. <em>Recollection refreshed. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge erred when he refused the defendant\u2019s request that he be allowed to inspect a document used by the prosecution to refresh the recollection of Carol Shanahan during her testimony at trial. The judge refused the request apparently on the ground that the document constituted the prosecutor\u2019s protected work product and therefore was not subject to disclosure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We conclude that the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s request to inspect the document. However, the defendant failed adequately to preserve this issue for appellate review when he neglected to ensure that the document used to refresh Shanahan\u2019s testimony was marked for identification. Thus, because the document in question is not part of the record before us we have no way of determining whether the defendant was prejudiced by the judge\u2019s error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>369 Mass. 715, 724-725 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>379 Mass. 117, 153 (1979). See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewinski, </em>367 Mass. 889, 901 (1975). Although we deny the defendant\u2019s request that we order a reversal of his conviction on this point, we believe a discussion of the issue is appropriate as it has never been directly addressed by an appellate court in this Commonwealth and some guidance may help prevent future uncertainty in the trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">'In Massachusetts, it has long been an established rule in both civil and criminal practice that an examiner may refresh the recollection of a witness during her testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>374 Mass. 613, 617-618 (1978). Although a writing of some variety is usually employed in this procedure, the examiner may use any other means. See <em>id.; United States </em>v. <em>Riccardi, </em>174 F.2d 883 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 337 U.S. 941 (1949). The only prerequisite to refreshing recollection is a showing that the witness\u2019s memory is clearly exhausted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>385 Mass. 165, 178-179 (1982). The opposing party is not entitled to inspect the writing prior to its being shown to the witness but he or she is entitled to an inspection after it is shown to the witness and before cross-examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>339 Mass. 557, 581 (1959). See <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>315 Mass. 580, 583 (1944); <em>Bendett </em>v. <em>Bendett, </em>315 Mass. 59, 62 (1943). Although these evidentiary rules are well settled in Massachusetts, a conflict may arise, as it did in this case, when the party in possession of the writing used to refresh the witness\u2019s recollection claims that disclosure of its contents is not required because the writing contains material protected by the work product doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">It is our opinion that, when materials protected by the work product doctrine are used by the examiner to refresh a witness\u2019s recollection on the stand, the protection afforded by the work product doctrine is waived and the opponent\u2019s attorney is entitled to inspect the writing. We reach this conclusion after a careful survey of the issue as approached by other jurisdictions, both State and Federal. We are also persuaded in deciding this issue by the basic judicial objectives of fairness and the determination of truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Rule 612 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that, \u201cif a witness uses a writing to refresh memory . . . while testifying ... an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness.\u201d Although the rule does not address itself directly to the issue of writings protected by the work product doctrine, Federal courts have held that the use of protected writings to refresh memory on the stand constitutes a waiver of that protection and the material used to refresh memory must be shown to the opposing party if requested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Derderian </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>121 F.R.D. 13, 15-16 (D. Mass. 1988); <em>S &amp; A Painting Co. </em>v. <em>O.W.B. Corp., </em>103 F.R.D. 407, 409 (W.D. Pa. 1984). <em>James Julian, Inc. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>93 F.R.D. 138, 144-145 (D. Del. 1982); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., </em>88 F.R.D. 348, 350 (D.D.C. 1980); <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Meister Brau, Inc., </em>57 F.R.D. 11, 13 (N.D. Ill. 1972). Rule 612 of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence is identical in all relevant respects to Fed. R. Evid. 612, which a majority of the States have adopted. Many others have adopted the similar Rule 612 of the Uniform Rules of Evidence, 13A U.L.A. 966 (1994). The few State courts that have addressed the issue of the conflict between the rule and protected documents used while the witness is on the stand have reached conclusions similar to the Federal courts, i.e., that use of protected material to refresh a witness\u2019s recollection on the stand constitutes waiver of that protection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The Commonwealth argues that the protection provided by the work-product doctrine \u201ctrumps\u201d the right to inspect documents used to refresh memory on the stand. We disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One \u201ccan no more advance the work-product doctrine to sustain a unilateral testimonial use of work-product materials than he could elect to testify in his own behalf and thereafter assert his Fifth Amendment privilege to resist cross-examinatian on matters reasonably related to those brought out in direct examination.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 240 (1975). It is clear to us that a rule against disclosure in these circumstances would impair the fairness of the trial process. For example, examining counsel might choose only protected materials to refresh a witness\u2019s recollection in order to avoid a potentially damaging cross-examination by opposing counsel. There is also, obviously, the danger of witness prompting by examining counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Without the right to inspect the protected writing, opposing counsel would have no opportunity to cross-examine the witness as to the accuracy of the writing and its effect on his or her memory. Results such as these would go a long way toward impairing the judicial process and are therefore clearly unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">In the first statement the defendant claimed that he fell while carrying Sean and that, when he fell, Sean\u2019s back and head hit the floor and the weight of the defendant\u2019s body fell on top of the child. After consulting the pathologist, the police informed the defendant that the injury could not have happened in the way the defendant claimed. The defendant then admitted he had lied when giving the first statement and proceeded to give a second statement. In the second statement, the defendant claimed that the injury occurred while he was playing with Sean on the living room floor. He said he flipped the child while holding his hands and that Sean acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>dentally slipped and landed on the floor. This second statement was the defendant\u2019s theory of the case at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Carol had been involved with another man during the time that she and the defendant were apart. Carol claimed that this man was Sean\u2019s father. There was some dispute as to whether this was true, or whether the defendant was Sean\u2019s father. The resolution of this issue, and its relevance, were left to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\">This point is contested by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth cites the testimony of Dr. William Zane, a pathologist, who stated on cross-examination that the possible symptoms of a recent head injury such as that suffered by Sean might be any or a combination of the following: crying, loss of consciousness, irritability, vomiting, inability to eat, and drowsiness and not the wheezing, gasping, and hoarseness the mother said she had observed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The prosecutor described the document as her own notes taken during an interview with the witness. We shall assume, for purposes of discussion, that the prosecutor\u2019s notes fell within the work product rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b501-5\">This fact is so well established in the case law interpreting rule 612 that often the issue is passed over with only a brief comment supporting the conclusion that such use of a protected document constitutes a waiver. Presently, the more controversial issue, and the one on which the courts are still somewhat unclear, is whether an adverse party has a right under rule 612 to inspect protected and privileged documents used by the witness to refresh her recollection <em>prior </em>to testifying. We leave for another day our determination of the rights of the parties in that situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\">See, e.g., <em>Samaritan Health Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>142 Ariz. 435, 438 (1984) (use of interview summaries to refresh recollection prior to deposition amounted to waiver of attorney-client privilege and work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>product protection); <em>Summerlin </em>v. <em>State, </em>256 Ind. 652, 659 (1971) (work product protection of memorandum waived when used to refresh recollection of testifying witness); <em>Herrmann </em>v. <em>General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>79 A.D.2d 955, 956 (N.Y. 1981) (work product protection of tape recording waived when it was used to refresh recollection of witness prior to deposition); <em>E.R.

Darlene, a sister of the infant victim\u2019s mother, testified that, in the evening, after the mother had left the family\u2019s apartment, the infant cried and vomited on the defendant\u2019s shoulder, and that the defendant got a \u201cmean\u201d look on his face and threw the infant in the air. Darlene also testified that the infant hit the floor, making a \u201cloud noise\u201d when he landed. As the court notes, <em>ante </em>at 471 n.l, the defendant\u2019s theory of the case at trial was that the injury occurred earlier in the day while the defendant was playing with the infant on the living room floor; that the defendant \u201cflipped the [infant] while holding his hands and that [the infant] accidentally slipped and landed on the\" floor.\u201d It was important to the defense that Darlene\u2019s testimony be impeached, as it would have been if the jury had heard that the infant showed symptoms of head injury before the infant\u2019s mother left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201cThe defendant claims that the \u2018cold\u2019 symptoms observed by [the mother] and other witnesses were actually symptoms of a head injury. Therefore, the defendant argues, the issue of when [the infant\u2019s] \u2018cold\u2019 symptoms appeared was crucial to the defense.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 474. If the symptoms appeared before the mother left the apartment in the evening, that would suggest that the fatal incident did not occur when and as described by Darlene, but that it occurred earlier in the day in conformity with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">As the court notes, \u201cUnder cross-examination, [the mother] testified, consistent with her testimony on direct examination, that she did not see [the infant] on October 2, 1987, from the time she left for work in the morning until around dinner time. When she saw him, [the infant] appeared to have a runny nose but exhibited no other cold symptoms. Defense counsel asked [the mother] whether she remembered making a statement to the police shortly after [the infant\u2019s] death in which she stated that when she got home with Darlene in the afternoon the two of them looked in on [the infant] and that he appeared to have a cold, and that he was wheezing and gasping and sounded hoarse. [The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>mother] testified that, while she remembered making a statement to the police, she could not remember stating that she checked on [the infant] in the afternoon or that he appeared to have had a cold at that time. On being shown her written statement to police made following [the infant\u2019s] death, [the mother] repeated that she could not recall stating she had checked on [the infant] in the afternoon.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 474-475.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">At that juncture, the message to the jury was that the mother\u2019s testimony that she first saw the \u201chead injury\u201d symptoms in the evening, thus supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s case, was inconsistent with her October 7, 1987, statement to the police, when her memory was fresh and distortion of the truth was less likely. The October 7 statement tended to support the defense theory. In those circumstances, defense counsel had no need to refer to a second statement, similar to the first, which the mother gave to the police many months after the first statement was made. Counsel\u2019s point had been made. Counsel had no reason, as the defendant\u2019s representative, to explore with the mother possible explanations for her inconsistency. Furthermore, counsel was in no position to predict the explanation, if any, that would be elicited by the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination, or to pose appropriate anticipatory questions designed to test the validity of the yet-to-be-given explanation. Counsel had a right, in my view, to assume that, if an explanation were to be presented in the course of redirect examination, his exploration of that new matter would be available by recross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Indeed, on redirect examination, an explanation was forthcoming. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, the mother testified that on October 7, the day on which she gave her statement to the police, which was just one day after her baby was buried, she was upset. The obvious implication was that the statement was the product of that mental condition, that it was incorrect, and that her testimony, not the statement, should be credited by the jury. Then, for the first time, on recross-examination, defense counsel had a reason \u2014 a need \u2014 and therefore a realistic opportunity (if his questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>had been allowed) to ask the witness mother whether, at a later time, when she was not upset, she gave a statement not substantially different from her statement on October 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">As the court indicates, on the prosecutor\u2019s objection the \u201cjudge precluded defense counsel from asking [the mother] about the contents of the second statement, which was not in evidence, ruling that it did not address a new matter raised on redirect.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 475. The judge rejected defense counsel\u2019s sidebar argument that, since the prosecutor had attempted to rehabilitate the witness by bringing out her mental state when she gave the October 7 statement, defense counsel should be allowed \u201cto show that subsequent to that [she] had the exact same confusion, so that her explanation doesn\u2019t meet the problem.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s obvious point was that his client was entitled to have the jury know that the mother\u2019s second statement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was similar to the first one, from which the jury might infer that the first statement was not the product of an upset mind as claimed for the first time on redirect, but instead spoke the truth and revealed the falsity of the mother\u2019s testimony concerning the all-important question of when the \u201ccold\u201d symptoms first appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The court \u201cconclude [s] that the judge acted within his sound discretion in ruling that the matter on which the defendant sought to examine [the mother] was not a new matter raised for the first time on redirect examination of the witness. Therefore, the defendant had no right to recross-examine her on the statement as it was beyond the scope of redirect examination.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 475. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u201cThere are few subjects, perhaps, upon which [the Supreme] Court and other courts have been more nearly unanimous than in their expressions of belief that the right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caudle, </em>606 F.2d 451, 457 (4th Cir. 1979), quoting <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 405 (1965). As Wigmore states, cross-exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>nation \u201cis beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1367 (Chadbourne rev. ed. 1976), quoted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caudle, supra. </em>Its effectiveness in probing the truth and completeness of testimony is \u201cso well understood that the right of cross-examination is \u2018one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caudle, supra, </em>quoting <em>Alford </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 U.S. 687, 692 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"AbA\">All the reasons provided to support the right of cross-examination \u201capply with equal strength to recross-examination where new matter is brought out on redirect examination.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caudle, supra </em>at 457-458. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Riggi, </em>951 F.2d 1368, 1375 (3d Cir. 1991). Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>10 F.3d 1374, 1404-1405 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 330 (1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>33 F.3d 1507, 1518 (11th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2558 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pickles, </em>364 Mass. 395, 401 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>356 Mass. 598, 602 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In my view, it is abundantly clear that material new matters were brought out on redirect examination of the victim\u2019s mother, namely, that when she gave her statement to the police on October 7, which was inconsistent with her testimony concerning the important question as to when the infant\u2019s symptoms first appeared, she was upset by the very recent traumatic events. The implication was that the statement should be dismissed and the testimony should be credited. That mental state evidence was injected into the case for the first time on the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination of the witness. It was critical, and the defendant was constitutionally entitled to cross-examine with respect to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The court states, <em>ante </em>at 476-477, \u201cThe questions which defense counsel proposed to ask on recross-examination involved an entirely separate statement, a statement which was not brought out at any point on direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u201d The court misses the point. The material new matter which was brought out for the first time on redirect examination was not the mother\u2019s second statement, but was the witness mother\u2019s upset state of mind when she gave her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>first statement, brought out to reduce that statement\u2019s impact. Defense counsel\u2019s questions on recross-examination, asked at the earliest opportunity, were designed to counter the thrust of the new material that had just been introduced by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Efficiency and expedition in the conduct.of trials is desirable \u2014 but not at the expense of truth. Recross-examination as to new material matters is essential to the truth-finding process. It was disallowed in this case. The judgment should be set aside and the case should be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The mother\u2019s second statement was marked for identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
