The board decided that, in light of the limitations on State taxing power contained in 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 381 (1988) (codifying \u00a7 101 [a] of Pub. L. 86-272 [73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Stat. 555 (1959)]),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the commissioner lacked authority to levy a corporate excise tax on the intrastate activities of Kelly-Springfield, which consisted of the solicitation of sales of tires, solely because Kelly-Springfield had voluntarily qualified to do business in Massachusetts. We agree with the board and affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The case arose as follows. Kelly-Springfield, a Maryland corporation with a principal place of business in Cumberland, Maryland, manufactures and sells automotive and other tires. Kelly-Springfield was incorporated in Maryland on July 12, 1935, and qualified to do business in Massachusetts under G. L. c. 181, \u00a7 4 (1992 ed.), on August 22, 1935. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 4, Keily-Springfield has filed annual reports with the Secretary of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Keily-Springfield sold its tires in Massachusetts through employees known as \u201cField Service Representatives.\u201d During 1982, these representatives, traveling in automobiles owned or leased by Keily-Springfield and carrying calculators and promotional literature, regularly came to Massachusetts to solicit orders for the sale of tires. During 1982, Kelly-Springfield did not own or rent an office or any other business premises in the Commonwealth; it did not employ anyone who resided in Massachusetts; all orders for tires, whether solicited by representatives in Massachusetts or placed directly by Massachusetts customers, were accepted or rejected outside Massachusetts; and the tires were shipped to Massachusetts customers by means of common carrier from warehouses located in New Jersey, Ohio, and Maryland. Sales to Massachusetts customers for 1982 totalled $7,903,237, and payments due Keily-Springfield from these customers were made directly to a Philadelphia bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Keily-Springfield filed its 1982 Massachusetts corporation excise tax return in March, 1983. The amount of tax shown as due on the return was $228, the minimum excise under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39, plus a fourteen per cent surcharge. On August 9, 1985, the commissioner assessed a deficiency of $53,002.26 for tax year 1982.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Keily-Springfield paid the assessment in full and filed a timely application for an abatement which the commissioner denied. It then filed a petition with the board pursuant to the formal procedure, see G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 39, and G. L. c. 58A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u00a7 6 (1992 ed.), challenging the denial of the abatement and seeking the return of the deficiency with interest. The board, in a written decision, ordered an abatement of the full amount of the deficiency. This appeal by the commissioner followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Before examining the merits, it will be useful to furnish some legal background. Congress enacted 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 in 1959 in response to the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>358 U.S. 450 (1959), which called into question the previously settled view, see <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Carolina Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>409 U.S. 275, 279-280 (1972), that a State could not tax a foreign corporation on the basis solely of solicitation of orders for the sale of its products.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In 1975, \u00a7 39 of G. L. c. 63 was amended by St. 1975, c. 684, \u00a7 52, to make qualification to do business in Massachusetts an incident of taxation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the commissioner has taken the position, consistent with the language of \u00a7 39, that qualification automatically removes a foreign corporation from the protection of \u00a7 381. The 1975 amendment to \u00a7 39 appears to have been enacted in reliance upon the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Colonial Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Traigle, </em>421 U.S. 100 (1975). In that case, the Court upheld a fairly apportioned and nondiscriminatory Louisiana corporate franchise tax imposed on the qualification to do business against challenge under the commerce clause contained in art. I, \u00a7 8 of the United States Constitution. The <em>Colonial Pipeline </em>decision, however, did not involve \u00a7 39, or a tax on corporate net income. The case dealt with a corporation franchise tax based on a corporation\u2019s capital stock, surplus, undivided profits, and borrowed capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In 1992, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Wisconsin Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>v. <em>William Wrigley, Jr., Co., </em>505 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>U.S. 214 (1992), which clarified the phrase \u201csolicitation of orders\u201d contained in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381. In the <em>Wrigley </em>decision, the Court held that \u00a7 381 does not automatically authorize State taxation of a company engaged in limited instate business activities that are not ancillary to the \u201csolicitation of orders.\u201d If such in-State activities are de minimis, that is, if they establish only a trivial connection with the taxing State, \u00a7 381 continues to provide net corporate income tax immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 231-232.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In 1990, by St. 1990, \u00a7 383, the Legislature added a paragraph to \u00a7 39 of G. L. c. 63, to take into account the effect of Federal law on the State power to levy a corporate excise tax. Insofar as relevant here, the final paragraph of \u00a7 39 provides that \u201c[a] foreign corporation shall not be subject to tax under this chapter if the foreign corporation is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property and taxation of that foreign corporation under this chapter is precluded by the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . .\u201d See also 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.39.1(5)(a) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">With this legal background in mind, the commissioner and Kelly-Springfield stipulated before the board that \u201cduring the year in question only [1982], the activities of [Kelly-Springfield\u2019s] Field Service Representatives in the Commonwealth either (a) constituted sales or \u2018solicitation\u2019 within the meaning of [\u00a7 381]; or (b) were de minimis or entirely ancillary to such sales or solicitation.\u201d The stipulation removed any controversy over whether the activities met the \u201csolicitation of orders\u201d test in \u00a7 381, as clarified by the de minimis standard provided for in the <em>Wrigley </em>decision, and posed, as the sole question in the case, whether Kelly-Springfield\u2019s voluntary qualification to do business in Massachusetts removed the otherwise applicable tax protection afforded by \u00a7 381. No Massachusetts decision has resolved this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The commissioner seeks an affirmative answer to the question. The commissioner points out that, since a State cannot require a foreign corporation to qualify to do business, if the corporation\u2019s activities are limited solely to interstate busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ness, Kelly-Springfield\u2019s decision to so qualify is voluntary. See <em>Goodwin Bros. Leasing </em>v. <em>Nousis, </em>373 Mass. 169, 174 (1977). Section 381, the commissioner notes, protects only solicitation of orders for the sales of tangible personal property. Qualifying to do business, the commissioner argues, constitutes a separate and significant business practice which creates a closer relationship to the Commonwealth and provides important benefits under State law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the commissioner maintains, qualification to do business is not ancillary to the solicitation of orders (namely, it serves independent business functions apart from such solicitation), and qualification is not de minimis (namely, it establishes a nontrivial ' additional connection with the Commonwealth). The commissioner concludes that, in 1982, Kelly-Springfield was engaged in business activities other than the solicitation of orders which deny it the protection of \u00a7 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The difficulty with the commissioner\u2019s position is the unambiguous language of \u00a7 381, which is the principal source of insight into Congressional purpose, and is to be applied as written. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). Section 381 sets forth two requirements for a person to be entitled to its protection. First, the person\u2019s business activities in the taxing State must be either limited to the solicitation of orders for sales of tangible personal property or de minimis or ancillary to such solicitation. It is stipulated that Kelly-Springfield\u2019s activities, soliciting orders for sales of tires in 1982, met this standard. Second, the corporate entity may not be incorporated under the laws of the taxing State. Kelly-Springfield is not incorporated in Massachusetts. If Congress had intended to exclude foreign corporations which had only qualified to do business in the taxing State from the protection of \u00a7 381, it would have inserted language to that effect into the law. The absence of such language is dispositive because a court cannot change the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>meaning of \u00a7 381 to add a new basis for disqualification from its protection. Every taxing jurisdiction that has considered the issue has come to the same conclusion.
