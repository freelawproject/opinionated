Under the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in directing the sale of the marital residence <em>(see Blackman v Blackman, </em>131 AD2d 801 [1987]; <em>cf. McCoy v McCoy, </em>117 AD3d at 809; <em>Skinner v Skinner, </em>241 AD2d 544, 545-546 [1997]).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Furthermore, the Supreme Court did not err in determining that the cooperative apartment was marital property. \u201c \u2018Property acquired during the marriage is presumed to be marital property and the party seeking to overcome such presumption has the burden of proving that the property in dispute is separate property\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hymowitz v Hymowitz, </em>119 AD3d 736, 739 [2014], quoting <em>Judson v Judson, </em>255 AD2d 656, 657 [1998]; <em>see Steinberg v Steinberg, </em>59 AD3d 702, 704 [2009]; <em>D'Angelo v D'Angelo, </em>14 AD3d 476, 477 [2005]; <em>Farag v Farag, </em>4 AD3d 502, 503 [2004]). Here, although the defendant testified that the transfer of the cooperative apartment, which was made seven years after the parties\u2019 marriage, constituted a gift to her alone, she failed to adduce sufficient evidence to overcome the marital property presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contention is without merit.</p>\n<judges id=\"AMmI\">Mastro, J.P., Dickerson, Maltese and Barros, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
