Upon a hearing of said writ the relator was remanded to the custody of the Sheriff of Hendereson County, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">Relator was held under a bond of $3,000.00 to keep the peace for a year as provided by Articles 79 and 80, C. C. P., and upon such holding he was allowed bond in the sum of $1,000.00 to await the action of this appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">The statement of facts herein is in question and answer form, which is prohibited by statute, Art. 760, C.
