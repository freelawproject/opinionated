There is testimony that appellant was driving a \u201cpickup\u201d on East Washington Street in Erath County. This is as far as the testimony goes towards establishing the descriptive averments as to the year, model, and name of the motor vehicle so driven. There is no testimony that East Washington Street, where the witness saw appellant driving the \u201cpickup,\u201d was in the City of Stephenville, Texas, as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">There is perhaps no rule of law more firmly established in this State than that which requires the State to establish the descriptive averments contained in the State\u2019s pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Here, it would have been sufficient to have alleged merely that appellant, while intoxicated, drove and operated a motor vehicle upon a public highway in Erath County. This the State did not do but described, with unnecessary particularity, the motor vehicle, as also the place where same was alleged to have been driven, thereby assuming the burden of establishing, by proof, such descriptive averments. Not having sustained these descriptive averments by the testimony, the evidence fails to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
