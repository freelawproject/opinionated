This matter was called to the trial court\u2019s attention in the objections to the court\u2019s charge as well as by Bill of Exception No. 8; and again in Bill No. 10, but the court denied the request to give the same. This charge requested by appellant, under the record here presented, was more restrictive of his rights than the law prescribes. In order to allow the enforcement of the local option laws of one county for 400 yards into another adjoining county, the proof should show that such adjoining county was also a dry area under the local option laws. This proof is not found in the record relative to Panola County. See Owens v. State, 138 Tex. Cr. R. 297, 135 S .W. (2d) 997; Lancaster v. State, 141 Tex. Cr. R. 81, 147 S. W. (2d) 476. The court was in error in refusing to charge the jury- relative to the offense having been committed in the adjoining County of Panola.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">We suggest that if this cause be tried again, a further information should be filed showing the proper date of the holding of this election.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
