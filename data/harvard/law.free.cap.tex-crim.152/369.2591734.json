We see no reason why one accused of crime cannot waive the right of the presence of the witnesses if he so desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In Porter v. State, 137 Tex. Cr. R. 473, 131 S. W. (2d) 964, it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u201cA defendant can waive almost any right except the right of trial by jury in a capital case. Consequently, though he may have had the right to demand that he be sworn, still he could waive such right or refuse to make any reply to the inquiry of the trial court. Not having availed himself of his privilege, the presumption obtained that he waived whatever legal right he may have had. See Goldsmith v. State, 32 Tex. Cr. R. 112, 22 S. W. 405; Barnes v. State, 61 Tex. Cr. R. 37,133 S. W. 887; Dodd v. State, 44 Tex. Cr. R. 480, 72 S. W. 1015; Trammell v. Mount, 68 Tex. 210, 4 S. W. 377, 2 Am. St. Rep. 479; Texas &amp; P. R. R. Co. v. Reid, Tex. Civ. App. 74 S. W. 99; Vogt v. Lee, Tex. Civ. App. 32 S. W. (2d) 668; Stair v. Smith, Tex. Civ. App. 299 S. W. 660, 661; Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., Sec. 349, p. 199, and authorities cited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In the early case of Odell v. State, 44 Tex. Cr. R. 307, 70 S. W. 964, it was held:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u201cDefendant may waive his right to be confronted with the witnesses against him, as he can waive many other questions.***</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u201cThe Cline case (36 Tex. Cr. R. 320, 36 S. W. 1099, 37 S. W. 722, 61 Am. St. Rep. 850) only decided that the constitutional rule will be enforced when the defendant asserts his right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">See Arts. 10a, 11 and 12, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex. C. C. P. Vol. 1, and pocket parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">This appellant pleaded guilty to the offense before the judge and waived the personal appearance of the witnesses. To his signed statement no objection was offered, and same shows that he and others were acting together in the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
