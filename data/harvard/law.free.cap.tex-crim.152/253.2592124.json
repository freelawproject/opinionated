It is shown by the testimony that from a point about 30 feet directly behind this truck in the same line that it was traveling, a signal by hand could not be seen and was not visible. It is not thought that the Legislature would do or attempt to do a useless thing or demand from a citizen the performance of a duty impossible of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Again, this statute, which is denominated \u201cUniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways\u201d, consisting of 35 pages and 157 sections dealing with many problems arising by virtue of the large amount of traffic passing over our highways, has endeavored to meet every problem that is presented by such congestion. We think that a fair interpretation of the phrase \u201cvisible both to the front and rear of such vehicle\u201d, taking the whole Act into consideration, means such as can be seen by one in the ordinarily used and accepted position of one traveling on such highways under ordinary weather conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>We think that the visibility of such hand signals as are herein shown was a matter to be determined by the trier of the facts. Under the facts herein, it is shown that in a car directly about 30 feet behind the center of this truck, no visible sign by hand could be seen. We, therefore, think that the trial court was correct in its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">No error being shown herein, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
