A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AyA\">This is an appeal by the State, pursuant to leave granted, from an order of Judge Eulop, sitting in the Union County Court, suppressing evidence seized by the police in defendant\u2019s home under a search warrant. The warrant had been issued by another County Court judge based on the affidavit of Detective Robert Ward of the county prosecutor\u2019s staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The search warrant was issued on May 24, 1966. On the following day police officers, acting under authority of the warrant, entered defendant\u2019s home at 614 Jefferson Avenue, Elizabeth, New Jersey. They seized $3,800 discovered in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>vanity in the master bedroom, $277 found on defendant\u2019s person, three sheets of paper with horserace bets written thereon, and other personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Defendant was arrested and subsequently indicted for bookmaking in violation of A. <em>J. 8. </em>2A:112 \u2014 3. Thereafter he moved to suppress the evidence obtained by the police on the ground that the search warrant was legally insufficient, not being based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d His motion was granted and the State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Detective Ward\u2019s affidavit, which was the sole basis for issuance of the search warrant, stated as follows: On May 20, 1966 he was assigned to investigate a report that defendant\u2019s telephone was being used for the purpose of bookmaking. His superior officer gave him a letter dated May 16 sent to the Elizabeth chief of police by John E. Walsh, a deputy police commissioner of New York City. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201cConfidential information lias boon obtained by tills department that telephone area Code 201 351-2904 is being used for illegal gambling purposes (bookmaking \u2014 horses). This phone ia listed to: Joseph Ehisabucfei, 614 Jefferson Avenue, Elizabeth, Yew Jersey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Ward had County Investigator Pisane contact the telephone company, which confirmed that two telephones bearing the same number1 were listed in Kasabucki\u2019s name in his one-family residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">On the same day, at about 1:50 p. m. Ward called telephone number 351-2904 and a male voice answered. Ward said the following conversation took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">\u201cWard : Hoy Case. This is Bob. X want a two-four reverse in tbe fifth and sixth at Acqueduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">Voice : Bob who ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-11\">Ward : Bob Wilson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-12\">Voice: X don\u2019t know no Bob Wilson. Who told you to call me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-13\">Ward : Willie, Little Willie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-14\">Voice : Where do you know him from ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-15\">Ward : From the place. You know, the saloon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-16\">Voice : What place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-17\">Ward: Garby's.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-18\">Voice : Well, put him on then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Ward : I\u2019m not there now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">Voice: How come he told you to call me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">Ward : I saw him at lunch. I told him I had a good one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">Voice: What did you say your name was again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">Ward: Bob Wilson. Do you want to take this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">Voice : No. I don\u2019t know you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">Ward: Well, I got to call a guy in Newark then. I wanted to get connected locally. You don\u2019t want it then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">Voice : No. I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Ward said that based on his experience in gambling law-enforcement the conversation indicated to him that the person who answered the telephone was a bookmaker, who did not accept the bet because Ward was unknown to him or was unable to offer the proper credentials, <em>i. e., </em>code-name or password. Ward further stated he believed that probable cause existed for the issuance of a search warrant to search defendant\u2019s home and any persons found therein, that a search would reveal betting slips and other gambling paraphernalia, and that the bookmaking statute was being violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">In granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, Judge Eulop pointed out that the affidavit made no reference to the reliability of the undisclosed source of the information provided by the New York police. He said it showed no surveillance, no other investigation, and no checking of the \u201cconfidential source\u201d by local authorities following receipt of such information. Beferring to the affiant\u2019s opinion that the telephone conversation with an unidentified person indicated bookmaking was being carried on in defendant\u2019s home, Judge Eulop concluded that it was \u201cno more than wishful thinking.\u201d He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">\u201cAnyone called on the telephone with such a proposition who had never taken a bet might well say the same things this voice said. He might well be mystified by such a call and seek to get the caller identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-14\">But assuming that the \u2018Voice\u2019 knew about placing bets, the question is not whether he was a professional bookmaker, but whether he was at that time in that place taking bets. The refusal to take the bet, the assertion T don\u2019t know you\u2019 is no basis for a \u2018well-grounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>suspicion' that the unknown speaker, even less the defendant, did take bids.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Judge Eulop held that the finding of probable cause by the judge who issued the warrant was not based on facts or circumstances presented under oath and ordered that the evidence be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The State alleges the court\u2019s ruling was erroneous. It contends the information received by letter from the New York police should be considered in determining whether there was probable cause to'believe defendant\u2019s telephone was being used for bookmaking \u2014 even though the letter and Ward\u2019s affidavit contained no representation that the information was obtained from a reliable source. It argues that; the telephone conversation, standing alone, was sufficient to' establish probable cause, and that Ward\u2019s conclusion that, bookmaking was being carried on must be considered in the' light of the detective\u2019s experience in gambling cases. It; further argues that when one judge passes upon the issuance of a search warrant by another judge, the judgment of the issuing judge is conclusive \u2014 unless there was clearly no justification for the issning judge\u2019s conclusion that the affidavit showed probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The guidelines for issuance of a search warrant are laid down in <em>State v. Macri, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>250 (1963), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">\u201cUnder its terms the search warrant is not to issue except upon, probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation. The crucial determination is to be made not by the police officer but by a neutral issuing judge. Before the judge is in a position to make his determination for issuance, he must properly be made aware of the-underlying facts or circumstances which would warrant a prudent man in believing that the law was being violated. See <em>Dumbra v. United States, </em>268 <em>U. S. </em>435, 441, 45 <em>S. Ct. </em>546, 548, 69 <em>L. Ed. </em>1032, 1036 (1925). Legal proof sufficient to establish guilt is, of course, not required; but suspicion and good faith on the officer\u2019s-part, without more, will not suffice. See <em>Henry v. United States, </em>361 U. <em>S. 98, </em>102, 80 <em>S. Ct. </em>168, 171, 4 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>134, 138 (1959) As the Supreme Court succinctly put it in <em>Nathanson v. United </em>States, 290 U. <em>S. </em>41, 47, 54 <em>S. Ct. </em>11, 13, 78 <em>L. Ed. </em>159, 162 (1933), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>search warrant may not issue unless the issuing magistrate can find probable cause from the facts or circumstances presented to him under oath or affirmation' \u2014 \u2018Mere affirmance of belief or suspicion is not enough.\u2019 [citations omitted]\u201d (at <em>pp. </em>256-257)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"> In the instant case Ward\u2019s affidavit did not satisfy the tests set forth in <em>Maori. </em>First, the letter from the New York police department was hearsay based upon hearsay. It referred to \u201cconfidential information\u201d obtained by the department without stating the source of such information or any representation that the informant was reliable. Although an affidavit will not be held invalid solely because the reasons to believe illegal activity is being carried on are based upon mere hearsay, see <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 <em>U. S. </em>257, 80 <em>S. Ct. </em>725, 4 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>697, 708 (1960), it must satisfy the requirement that the information was supplied by a reliable informer. <em>State v. </em>Ratushny, 82 <em>N. J. Super. </em>499, 503-504 <em>(App. Div. </em>1964), and see Annotation, 10 <em>A. L. R. 3d </em>361, 370 (1966). Failure to do so eliminates any probative value which might otherwise be given to such information. Secondly, the letter stated a mere conclusion that defendant\u2019s telephone was being used for an illegal purpose. It failed to reveal any <em>facts </em>upon which a judge could decide that probable cause existed. See <em>Giordenello v. United </em>States, 357 <em>U. S. </em>480, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>1245, 2 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>1503, 1509 (1958), and <em>State v. </em>Moriarty, 39 <em>N. J. </em>502, 503 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We look next to the telephone conversation between Detective Ward and an unidentified person. The State relies heavily on <em>Smith v. </em>State, 191 <em>Md. </em>329, 62 <em>A. 2d </em>287, 5 <em>A. L. B. \u25a02d </em>386 <em>(Gt. App. </em>1948), where a police officer had a telephone conversation with a suspected bookmaker. The case is inapposite. In <em>Smith </em>the accused accepted the telephone bet and there was evidence that his premises had been under a continuous and revealing surveillance for several days before the telephone call was made. Here, the affidavit set forth no facts showing independent personal knowledge or suspicion by the local police authorities that defendant was engaged in book<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>making. The premises were never placed under surveillance. The voice at the other end of the telephone did not accept the bet and was never identified as being the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"> The telephone conversation itself reveals little. One possible inference is that the person who answered the telephone was mystified by the call and was seeking identification of the caller. However, even though his response may support an inference that the speaker was a bookmaker, it cannot support the further inference that bookmaking was <em>then </em>taking place at <em>that </em>place. Such further inference is absolutely essential to a finding of probable cause for issuance of a search warrant because the issuing judge must be convinced that the fruits and means of the crime would probably be found in defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The State contends that while it may be argued that the telephone conversation by itself was insufficient to establish probable cause, the question for determination is what constituted probable cause in the eyes of a reasonable, cautious police officer citing <em>State v. Tanzola, </em>83 <em>N. J. Super. </em>40, 44 <em>(App. Div. </em>1964). However, Detective Ward\u2019s conclusion that the telephone conversation indicated that the person with whom he talked was a bookmaker was not enough to justify issuance of a warrant. If that were so the issuing judge would be granting a warrant on the officer\u2019s conclusion alone, and then the officer\u2019s suspicions rather than the judge\u2019s determination would be the controlling factor. As stated in <em>State v. Burrachio, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>272 (1963), that would defeat the very purpose of the constitutional guarantee which was designed to make certain that search warrants would not issue except upon determinations made by neutral judges and based on verified showings of probable cause (at <em>p. </em>276). Suspicion and good faith on the part of Detective Ward are not, without more, probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. <em>Ibid, </em>and see <em>State v. Macri, supra, </em>39 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>256.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> We agree with the State\u2019s contention that when one judge passes upon the issuance of a search warrant by another jndge, the judgment of the issuing judge is conclusive, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>there was clearly no justification for the issuing judge\u2019s con\u2022clusion that the affidavit upon which the warrant was based showed probable cause. <em>State v. Tanzola, supra, </em>83 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>43. However, in the instant case, as Judge Eulop \u2022concluded, it is obvious that the finding of probable cause upon which the search warrant issued was based on hearsay statements with no substantial basis for crediting the hearsay and conclusory statements without adequate supporting facts. There was no justification for the issuing judge\u2019s finding that the affidavit upon which the warrant was based established probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The order suppressing evidence is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
