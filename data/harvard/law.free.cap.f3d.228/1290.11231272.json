The district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Boz\u2019s petition. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">1. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">Boz, a Bahamian native, entered the United States without inspection in 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Boz was convicted in Florida state court in 1995 and again in 1997 of various car theft offenses; the 1997 convictions resulted in a 120-day prison sentence. After Boz served this sentence, the INS took him into custody and began deportation proceedings against him because he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) (2000). The Immigration Judge ordered Boz removed from the country, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that order on April 27, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">Boz has remained in custody since some tim\u00e9 in 1997 and has been awaiting his removal from the United States since April 1998. In June 1999, more than a year after his removal order had become final, Boz filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In his petition, Boz challenges not the order to remove him from the United States, but rather his indefinite, continued incarceration in the United States. The district court dismissed Boz\u2019s petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and Boz appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-17\">The sole question on appeal is whether the District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to consider Boz\u2019s habeas corpus petition. Although the United States did not contest jurisdiction, the district court concluded that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g), which limits judicial review of the removal of aliens, foreclosed habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-18\">Understanding the nature of Boz\u2019s petition is essential to our analysis. The district court repeatedly referred to a review of the Petitioner\u2019s deportation order,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but that is not the relief Boz seeks. Boz ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>cepts the order of removal and petitions only for release from incarceration pending that removal. The INS has not removed Boz in the two years since the order became final, and Boz fears his detention could continue indefinitely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">Congress dramatically amended the law governing judicial review of immigration matters in 1996 through both the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub.L. .No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Pub.L. No. 104-208, Div. C., 110 Stat. 3009-546 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d). IIRIRA established transitional provisions applicable to aliens if their removal proceedings began before April 1, 1997, and more complex permanent provisions applicable if removal proceedings began after that date. <em>See Mayers v. United States Dep\u2019t Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>175 F.3d 1289, 1293 n. 4 (11th Cir.1999). The INS claims in its brief that it initiated proceedings against Boz in August 1997, <em>see </em>Br. for Appellee at 6, but the record itself is silent on when in 1997 the removal proceedings began. Nonetheless, regardless of whether IIRIRA\u2019s transitional or permanent provisions apply, we hold that the district court had jurisdiction to consider Boz\u2019s habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">The only statutory provision introduced by IIRIRA that is applicable during the transitional period and that could have limited the availability of habeas jurisdiction was 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g), the provision relied on by the district court in dismissing Boz\u2019s petition. This court has held already that aliens can file habeas petitions in district court under the transitional rules, at least as <em>long </em>as the aliens\u2019 claims affect \u201csubstantive rights that traditionally have been reviewed by courts even in the most restrictive immigration schemes, and where petitioners have no other avenue for relief.\u201d <em>Mayers, </em>175 F.3d at 1301 n. 17. Boz\u2019s constitutional claims pertaining to his continued detention satisfy these criteria. In addition, the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 1252(g) limits judicial review of only \u201cthree discrete actions that the Attorney General may take: her decision or action\u2019 to \u2018commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em>525 U.S. 471, 482, 119 S.Ct. 936, 943, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) (emphasis removed). Boz\u2019s petition does not challenge any of those \u201cthree discrete actions\u201d and thus falls outside the purview of \u00a7 1252(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">In order to determine the scope of judicial review available under IIRIRA\u2019s permanent provisions, we must consider <em>all </em>of \u00a7 1252, not just \u00a7 1252(g). Following the <em>American-Arab </em>decision, this court held that, under IIRIRA\u2019s permanent provisions, \u00a7 1252(g) does not preclude an alien from challenging his detention by the INS. <em>See Richardson v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 120 S.Ct. 1529, 146 L.Ed.2d 345 (2000). The court concluded, however, that the overall judicial review scheme enacted through \u00a7 1252, and the \u201czipper clause\u201d in \u00a7 1252(b)(9) in particular, prevented an alien from collaterally challenging his detention before removal proceedings had become final.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"AAsh\">The <em>Richardson </em>court based its decision in large part on its interpretation of \u00a7 1252\u2019s overall purpose, and the petitioner\u2019s ability to raise his claims in an appeal of his final removal order assuaged concerns that the court\u2019s holding was too re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>strictive. <em>See id. </em>As we recognized in <em>Richardson, </em>section 1252 streamlines the judicial review of removal matters. Some portions of \u00a7 1252 limit the judicial review available to specific categories of aliens and from specific decisions by the Attorney General. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2) &amp; 1252(e). Section 1252(b) establishes procedural rules for an appeal of final removal orders to the United States Courts of Appeal, and \u00a7 1252(b)(9) makes that appeal the .exclusive avenue for obtaining review of \u201call questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States.\u201d As interpreted by the <em>Richardson </em>court, \u00a7 1252(b)(9) covers challenges to detention while removal proceedings are underway, because detention is often \u201cthe first step in the removal process.\u201d 180 F.3d at 1318. The <em>Richardson </em>court determined that Congress did not unconstitutionally suspend the writ of ha-beas corpus because \u00a7 1252 still provided for adequate judicial review of an alien\u2019s claims through an appeal of the final removal order. <em>See </em>180 F.3d at 1315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Although the issue in <em>Richardson </em>was whether an alien could bring a habeas petition to challenge his detention or removal proceedings while those proceedings were still underway, there is some language in the decision that might suggest aliens could never challenge their continued detention through a habeas petition. <em>See id. </em>at 1315 (stating that \u00a7 1252 provides \u201ca sufficiently broad and general limitation on federal jurisdiction to preclude \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction over challenges to removal orders, removal proceedings, and detention pending removal\u201d). The logic of <em>Richardson </em>and the statutory provisions it interprets, however, would not support such a reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">In his habeas petition, Boz does not raise any issues relating to the removal proceedings against him, and he does not challenge the final order of removal. Rather, he questions his continued incarceration long after his removal order became final. This type of claim cannot be consolidated with an appeal immediately following the removal proceedings because it does not arise until much later. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(1) (\u201cThe petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal\u201d). Thus, the streamlining intended by \u00a7 1252 has no application in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">Furthermore, because Boz\u2019s claim does not arise until after the opportunity for a direct appeal of the removal order, \u00a7 1252 provides no judicial forum for his claim. The Supreme Court has noted that a \u201cserious constitutional question ... would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.\u201d <em>Webster v. Doe, </em>486 U.S. 592, 603, 108 S.Ct. 2047, 2053, 100 L.Ed.2d 632 (1988). More specifically, because the Constitution forbids the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, courts, including our own circuit, have acknowledged that foreclosing all judicial review for aliens challenging their detention before removal would raise constitutional concerns. <em>See, e.g., Richardson, </em>180 F.3d at 1315; <em>Nguyen v. Fasano, </em>84 F.Supp.2d 1099, 1105-06 (S.D.Cal.2000). Our interpretation of IIR-IRA preserves the jurisdiction of the federal courts to consider constitutional claims and avoids the difficult Suspension Clause issue altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">Other circuits that have addressed the issue before us have agreed that IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules do not eliminate district court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to consider habeas petitions from aliens challenging their continued detention after a removal order has become final. <em>See Ma v. Reno, </em>208 F.3d 815, 818-19 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 297 (2000); <em>Ho v. Greene, </em>204 F.3d 1045, 1050-52 (10th Cir.2000); <em>Zadvydas v. Underdown, </em>185 F.3d 279, 285-86 (5th Cir.1999), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 297 (2000); <em>cf. Parra v. Perryman, </em>172 F.3d 954, 956-57 (7th Cir.1999) (district courts have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>validity of statute authorizing detention of alien, even when removal proceedings are still underway). Unfortunately, analysis of the merits of aliens\u2019 detention claims is not as consistent. Moreover, the record contains no information about the reasons for Boz\u2019s continued detention, whether and to what extent the INS periodically has reviewed Boz\u2019s case, or the details and reasonableness of the bail. Because the district court has yet to consider the merits of Boz\u2019s constitutional claims, and because the record is so limited, we will remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AjF\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s holding that it lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to consider Boz\u2019s habeas corpus petition, and we REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">. This review of the facts is taken from the briefs because no factual record was presented to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1299-19\"><em>. See </em>Order at 2, <em>in </em>R., Tab 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">. The government claims that it recently authorized Boz's parole upon the posting of a $5,000 bond, and that, because it has granted the relief Boz seeks, his petition is moot. Boz\u2019s petition requested <em>release </em>from detention, however, not just the option of posting a bond, and the government acknowledges that Boz remains incarcerated. At the very least, we would not deem Boz\u2019s petition moot before analyzing the reasonableness of the bail. Because the record on appeal is so limited, we would be unable to perform that analysis even if it were appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1300-16\">.
