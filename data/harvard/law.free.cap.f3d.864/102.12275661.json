CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b129-19\">In 2015, the United States Government indicted Sheldon Silver, the former Speaker of the New York -State Assembly, on charges of honest services fraud, Hobbs Act extortion, and money laundering. The Government alleged that Silver abused his public position by engaging in two <em>quid pro quo </em>schemes in which he performed official acts -in exchange for bribes and kickbacks, and that he laundered the proceeds of his schemes into private investment vehicles. After a jury trial of nearly one month in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Valerie E. Caproni,. <em>Judge), </em>a jury found him guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-20\">After Silver had been convicted and sentenced, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>McDonnell v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which clarified the definition of an \u201cofficial act\u201d in honest services fraud and extortion charges. The Supreme Court, vacating the conviction of former Governor Robert McDonnell of Virginia, held that \u201can \u2018official act\u2019 is a decision or action on a \u2018question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u2019 \u201d involving \u201ca formal exercise of governmental power.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Silver now appeals from his judgment of conviction and argues, primarily, that the District Court\u2019s jury instructions defining an official act as \u201cany action taken or to be taken under color of official authority\u201d was erroneous under <em>McDonnell.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He additionally challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on all counts of conviction, arguing, among other things, that his money laundering conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957 required the Government to trace \u201cdirty\u201d funds comingled with \u201cclean\u201d funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Though we reject Silver\u2019s sufficiency challenges, we hold that the District Court\u2019s instructions on honest services fraud and extortion do not comport with <em>McDonnell </em>and are therefore in error. We further hold that this error was not harmless because it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have reached the same conclusion if properly instructed, as is required by law for a verdict to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Accordingly, we VACATE the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction on all counts and REMAND the cause to the District Court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">I. Offense Conduct<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Silver was elected to the New York State Assembly (the \u201cAssembly\u201d) in 1976, representing an Assembly District comprising much of lower Manhattan. In 1994, he was elected Speaker of the Assembly (\u201cSpeaker\u201d)\u2014a position he would hold for more than twenty years until his resignation in 2015. As Speaker, Silver was one of the most powerful public officials in the State of New York, exercising significant control over the Assembly and state legislative matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The Government\u2019s charges against Silver involve his part-time work as a practicing lawyer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Government sought to prove that Silver orchestrated two criminal schemes that abused his official positions for unlawful personal gain. Each of these alleged schemes had the same premise: in exchange for official actions, Silver received bribes and kickbacks in the form of referral fees from third-party law firms. In one scheme, Silver performed favors for a doctor in exchange for the doctor\u2019s referral of mesothelioma patients to Silver\u2019s law firm (the \u201cMesothelioma Scheme\u201d). In the other, Silver performed favors for two real estate developers who had hired, at Silver\u2019s request, a law firm that was paying referral fees to Silver (the \u201cReal Estate Scheme\u201d). Jointly, these alleged schemes produced roughly $4 million in referral fees for Silver. The Government also charged that Silver engaged in money laundering by investing the proceeds of the Mesothelioma and Real Estate Schemes into various private investment vehicles (the \u201cMoney Laundering Scheme\u201d). We describe the key aspects of each scheme in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">A. The Mesothelioma Scheme<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">In the fall of 2002, Silver became \u201cof counsel\u201d to the law firm Weitz &amp; Luxen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>berg (\u201cW&amp;L\u201d), which maintained an active personal injury practice. Lawsuits for mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, were particularly lucrative for W&amp;L.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">While he was not expected to and did not perform any legal work for W&amp;L\u2019s clients, Silver received a fixed salary for lending his name to W&amp;L, as well as referral fees for any case he brought into the firm. Silver\u2019s referral fee was a set percentage of the fees earned by W&amp;L on any case that he referred to the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Dr. Robert Taub, an acquaintance of Silver, was a physician and researcher at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital who specialized in mesothelioma. In the fall of 2003, Dr. Taub encountered Silver at an event and asked him to encourage W&amp;L to donate money to mesothelioma research.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Silver, without consulting anyone at the firm, responded that he .could not get W&amp;L to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Within two weeks, however, Silver asked Dr. Taub to refer mesothelioma cases to W&amp;L through him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Responding to that request in November of 2003, Dr. Taub started referring mesothelioma patients to Silver for legal representation. He also provided Silver with names and contact information of unrepresented mesothelio-ma patients seeking counsel. Dr. Taub sought to develop a relationship with Silver that would help him receive research funding, much of which came from state and federal appropriations. Although unaware of the specifics of the financial arrangement between Silver and W&amp;L, Dr. Taub testified that he believed Silver would benefit personally from the meso-thelioma leads. And indeed, Silver conveyed to Dr. Taub that he was \u201cpleased with the referrals that he was getting.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">Dr. Taub was soon informed that Silver was considering providing him with state funding for his mesothelioma research. Shortly thereafter, in early January 2004, Dr. Taub sent a letter to Silver requesting state funding. While this grant was under consideration, Dr. Taub continued to send Silver mesothelioma leads. And over a year later, in March of 2005, Silver received his first referral fee check from W&amp;L in the amount of $176,048.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">Silver soon secured two $250,000 state grants for Columbia University to support Dr. Taub\u2019s research. These grants originated from the New York Health-Care Reform Act (\u201cHCRA\u201d) Assembly Pool, a pool of discretionary funds that Silver alone controlled as Speaker. Silver approved the first grant in July of 2005, a few months after receiving his first referral check.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Silver approved the second grant more than a year later, in August of 2006.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Silver did not publicly disclose the grants or his interactions with Dr. Taub, nor did he ever inquire about the progress of Dr. Taub\u2019s research. Dr. Taub assumed that his mesothelioma referrals were a factor in Silver\u2019s decision to approve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>grants, and sought to receive additional grant money on an annual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In 2007, New York law changed to require public disclosure of HCRA grants, and disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest between legislators and recipients of legislative grants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Responding to this change, Silver informed Dr. Taub that any further requests for state grants would not be approved.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Dr. Taub continued to send mesothelioma client leads to Silver to maintain their relationship and keep Silver \u201cincentivized.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Silver continued to help Dr. Taub during this time with two other actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u2022 In January of 2007, Silver had his office staff call a state trial judge to ask him to hire Dr. Taub\u2019s daughter, a student at Fordham University Law School, as an unpaid intern. '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u2022 In May of 2008, Silver awarded $25,000 in state grant funding to the Shalom Task Force, a non-profit entity devoted to helping victims of domestic violence, of which Dr. Taub\u2019s \u25a0wife was a board member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In 2010, Dr. Taub started sending meso-thelioma leads to another law firm that had started funding his research. In response, on May 25, 2010, Silver went to Dr. Taub\u2019s office to complain that he was receiving fewer referrals. Their conversation prompted Dr. Taub to continue to send referrals to Silver in order to maintain a .relationship with him that would possibly lead to future funding for his mesothelioma research. As he noted in an e-mail, to a colleague.on the day of his meeting with Silver, \u201cI will keep giving cases to Shelly [Silver] because I may need him in the future\u2014he is the most powerful man in New York State.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">In fact, Silver would not approve any more grants for Dr. Taub (and he had not done so since August of 2006). Silver did do three additional favors for Dr. Taub, however.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">\u2022 In May of 2011, Silver had his staff prepare an Assembly resolution with an official proclamation commending Dr. Taub, Silver sponsored the resolution on the floor of the Assembly and presented it to Dr. Taub at a public event. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-15\">\u2022 In the fall-of 2011, Silver agreed to help Dr. Taub \u201cnavigate\u201d the process of securing permits for a proposed New York City charity race in Silver\u2019s district to benefit mesothelioma research. Dr. Taub thought at the time that Silver would likely want referrals in return for his help. Ultimately, the law firm working with Dr. Taub to organize the race decided not tp pursue the event, and the race never took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-16\">\u2022 In 2012, at the request of Dr. Taub, Silver helped Dr. Taub\u2019s son obtain a job with OHEL Children\u2019s Home &amp; Family Services (\u201cOHEL\u201d), a nonprofit organization devoted primarily to providing social services to Jewish populations,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that received millions in discretionary state funding controlled solely by Silver, To help Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Taub\u2019s son, Silver called. OHEL\u2019s chief executive officer twice and sent him a letter on Assembly letterhead. Silver had not previously asked, nor did he subsequently ask, OHEL to hire anyone else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Dr. Taub continued to provide mesothe-lioma leads to Silver through at least 2013. In total, over the course of ten years, Silver received roughly $3 million in referral fees for cases referred to W&amp;L by Dr. Taub.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">B. The Real Estate Scheme<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Silver\u2019s second alleged scheme involved two major New York real estate developers: Glenwood Management (\u201cGlenwood\u201d) and the Witkoff Group (\u201cWitkoff\u2019) (jointly, the \u201cDevelopers\u201d). Of course, like other real estate interests, both companies depended heavily on favorable state legislation, including rent regulation and tax abatement legislation. The Developers also depended on tax-exempt financing, which must be approved by the Public Authorities Control Board (\u201cPACB\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Silver held considerable control over legislation covering these issues and over PACB approvals. As Speaker, he had <em>de facto </em>veto power over all legislation since he could prevent any legislation that he opposed from coming to a vote. Also, as a voting member on the PACB, Silver had the power to unilaterally prevent the PACB from approving applications for state financing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">As with the Mesothelioma Scheme, Silver allegedly sought to enrich himself through referral fees from a law firm. In this scheme, however, that law firm was Goldberg &amp; Iryami (\u201cG&amp;I\u201d), the firm of Jay Arthur Goldberg, a former staffer and friend of. Silver. Goldberg specialized in tax certiorari work, which involves challenges to property owners\u2019 real estate tax assessments. The Developers pursued tax certio-rari cases to reduce the property taxes of their buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">To enrich himself, Silver allegedly induced the Developers to hire Goldberg, who had agreed to pay Silver a percentage of the resulting legal fees. In 1997, at a 'time when important real estate legislation was due for renewal, Silver referred Glen-wood to Goldberg. In 2005, Silver did the same for Witkoff, stating that his friend Goldberg needed business. In response, Glenwood and Witkoff moved some of their tax certiorari work from other law firms to G&amp;I, which they continued to do over time. Of the fees G&amp;I earned from its Glenwood and Witkoff matters, Silver received a referral fee\u2014twenty-five percent of what G&amp;I earned from Glenwood matters and fifteen percent of what G&amp;I earned from Witkoff matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">The Developers did not know of Silver\u2019s financial arrangement with Goldberg at the time. Neither company, however, wanted to alienate Silver, given their need for Silver\u2019s approval of favorable legislation. Both testified that they gave tax certiorari work to Goldberg to influence Silver\u2019s legislative work concerning real estate. Wit-koff also wanted access to Silver to discuss pending legislation that affected its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">In return for these alleged kickbacks, Silver took a number of actions to benefit the Developers':</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u2022 Through a proxy, Silver repeatedly voted as one of three members of the PACB to approve Glenwood\u2019s requests for tax-exempt financing for many of its projects. These votes occurred repeatedly over the course of Silver\u2019s tenure as Speaker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-3\">\u2022 Silver regularly approved and voted for rent and tax abatement legislation sought by Glenwood. In particular, in June of 2011, Silver met with Glenwood lobbyists in advance of negotiating pending real estate legislation to ensure that Glenwood was satisfied with the terms of the legislation. He then supported and voted in favor of the Rent Act of 2011 and tax abatement renewal legislation later that month, both of which benefited Glenwood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">\u2022 Later in 2011, Silver publicly opposed the relocation of a methadone clinic that was to be located near one of Glenwood\u2019s rental buildings in Silver\u2019s district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In a late 2011 phone call, Silver informed a Glenwood lobbyist of his fee-sharing arrangement with Goldberg. This disclosure was prompted by G&amp;I\u2019s decision to send new retainer agreements to Glen-wood that referenced Silver. Silver told the Glenwood lobbyist that he wanted his fee-sharing arrangement with Goldberg to continue, and that the ari-angement was not problematic since the fees came from a Glenwood limited liability company. Glen-wood, despite its reservations, executed a confidential \u201cside letter\u201d agreement with G&amp;I\u2014separate from the firm\u2019s retainer agreement\u2014consenting to the fee arrangement. This letter was kept secret from the public and from Glenwood\u2019s own chief financial officer,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Witkoff learned of the fee-sharing arrangement in June of 2014 on a call with Goldberg, who had received a grand jury subpoena in connection with the Government\u2019s investigation of Silver.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">In total, over a period of about 18 years, Silver received approximately $835,000 in fees from G&amp;I for his referral of the Developers.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">C. The Money Laundering Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Silver allegedly laundered the proceeds of the Mesothelioma and Real Estate Schemes by investing them in high-yield, private investment vehicles with the help of Jordan Levy, a private investor.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> At one point, Silver instructed Levy to place one half of an investment in his wife\u2019s name to avoid publicly disclosing the full amount of the investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"A6G\">A. Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">In February of 2015, Silver was indicted for engaging in schemes \u201cto deprive the \u2022citizens of [New York State] of his honest services as an elected legislator and as Speaker of the Assembly by using the power and influence of his official position to obtain for himself millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks... .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The charges against him consisted of four counts of honest service fraud, two counts of Hobbs Act extortion, and one count of money laundering.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The Government\u2019s theory underlying its honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges was that Silver had accepted bribes and kickbacks in exchange for official acts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> To succeed on a bribery theory of honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion, the Government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of a <em>quid pro quo </em>agreement\u2014that the defendant received, or intended to receive, something of value in exchange for an official act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">B. Trial and Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Before trial, Silver and the Government presented proposed jury instructions to the District Court on how to define an \u201cofficial act.\u201d Silver\u2019s initial proposed instructions sought to define \u201cofficial act\u201d by quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a)(3), the federal bribery statute: \u201c[a]n \u2018official- act\u2019 means any decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official\u2019s official capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s proposed instruction, in contrast, sought to define an official act more broadly as \u201cany act taken under color of official authority.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Silver\u2019s trial began on November 2, 2015, and lasted nearly a month. At the charge conference on November 19, 2015, the parties once again addressed the definition of an \u201cofficial act\u201d in the jury instructions. This time, Silver proposed a new \u201cofficial act\u201d instruction: \u201cTo prove an \u2018official act,\u2019 the government must prove the exercise of actual governmental power, the threat to exercise such power, or pressure imposed on others to exercise actual government power.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Government urged a broader instruction\u2014that \u201c[o]ffi-cial action includes <em>any action </em>taken or to be taken under color of official authority.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The District Court declined to include Silver\u2019s proposed instructions and ultimately adopted the Government\u2019s official act language in its final jury charge.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>District Court instructed the jury .that to prove honest services fraud, the Government must \u201cprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, ,.. that Silver, received bribes, or kickbacks as part of a scheme to defraud.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The District Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">To satisfy this element, the Government must prove that there was a <em>quid pro quo. Quid pro quo </em>is Latin, and it means \u201cthis for that\u201d or \u201cthese for those.\u201d The Government must prove that a bribe or kickback was sought or received by Mr. Silver, directly or indirectly, in exchange for the promise or performance of official action. Official action includes <em>any .action taken or to be taken under color of official authority </em>.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apf\">In its Hobbs Act extortion instructions, the District Court also instructed that the Government must prove a <em>quid pro </em>qUo\u2014 specifically, that \u201cproperty was sought or received by Mr. Silver, directly or indirectly, in exchange for the promise or performance of official action,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The District Court did not redefine official action in its extortion charge, but did explicitly reference the earlier honest services fraud charge when setting forth the <em>quid pro quo </em>requirement as an element of extortion.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The District. Court also provided the following charge regarding the five-year statute of limitations for honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion:<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABZ\">The statute of limitations for each of the charged crimes is five years. If you find that Mr. Silver engaged in a scheme to commit honest services fraud, extortion or money\" laundering, but no aspect of the particular scheme occurred after February 19, 2010, then you must acquit on that charge because it is barred by the statute of limitations. If, on the other hand, you find that any aspect of the crime you are considering continued on or after February 19, 2010, then the statute of limitations as' to that charge has been complied with.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">After three days of deliberation, on November 30\u215d 2015, the jury found Silver guilty on all seven counts. Silver timely moved for adjudgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, a new'trial pursuant to Rules 29 and 33 of the\" Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The District Court denied those motions in a written opinion on May 3, 201'6.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">,C. Sentencing and Post-Sentencing Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">On May 4, 20\u00cd6, the District Court sentenced Silver to twelve years of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>supervised release. It also imposed $5.4 million in forfeiture, and a $1.75 million f\u00edne. The court entered its final judgment on May 10,2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">On May 13, 2016, Silver moved to continue bail and stay the financial penalties pending appeal. Silver relied largely on arguments raised in <em>McDonnell, </em>which was then pending before the Supreme Court and would address the definition of an. \u201cofficial act\u201d for honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion violations.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> On June 27,.2016, the Supreme Court decided <em>McDonnell. </em>Soon thereafter, on August 25, 2016, the District Court granted Silver\u2019s motion. for bail pending appeal.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In a thoughtful opinion, the District Court concluded that while Silver\u2019s case is \u201cfactually almost nothing like <em>McDonnelll,] </em>... there is a substantial question whether, in light of <em>McDonnell, </em>the [jury], charge was in error and, if so, whether the error was harmless.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> ,</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">On appeal, in addition to various arguments challenging the sufficiency of the evidence against him, Silver primarily argues that the District Court\u2019s jury instructions on the definition of an \u201cofficial act\u201d in its honest service fraud and extortion charges were erroneous under <em>McDonnell.</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He thus contends that we should vacate and remand the honest services fraud and extortion counts against him for a new trial. Silver also argues that if we vacate those counts, we necessarily must vacate the money laundering count against him.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>challenges to the sufficiency of evidence, but must uphold the conviction if <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> To conduct this review, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government\u2019s favor, and deferring to the jury\u2019s assessment of witness credibility and. its assessment of the weight of the evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Silver raises three challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence against him, none of which have merit. -</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">A. Hobbs Act Extortion</p>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">First, Silver claims that the Government failed to prove Hobbs Act extortion because there was no evidence that that he deprived anyone of property. This argument is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">The Hobbs Act defines extortion, as applicable here, as \u201cobtaining ... property from another, with his consent, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>duced ... under color of official right.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The \u201cproperty\u201d at issue in a Hobbs Act extortion violation must be \u201csomething of value from the victim that can be exercised, transferred, or sold.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Here, the evidence supports a deprivation of property as to both schemes.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Specifically, both the mesothelioma leads and the tax certio-rari business from which Silver profited were valuable and transferable property (albeit intangible property). By engaging in the alleged schemes, Silver is said to have deprived Dr. Taub, the Developers, and other law firms of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">B. Honest Services Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Second, Silver argues that he engaged in mere \u201cundisclosed self-dealing,\u201d and that, accordingly, the Government failed to prove a \u201cparadigmatic bribe or kickback\u201d for its honest services fraud charges, as required by <em>Skilling v. United States.</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This argument is likewise contradicted by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In <em>Skilling, </em>the Supreme Court in 2010 clarified that honest services fraud \u201cdoes not encompass conduct more wide-ranging than the paradigmatic cases of bribes and kickbacks,\u201d and includes instances where a defendant \u201csolicited or accepted side payments from a third party.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Here, both the mesothelioma leads and tax certiorari business indisputably came from Dr. Taub and the Developers, which resulted in payments to Silver from other third parties, W&amp;L and G&amp;I. These payments, solicited by Silver, were thus bribes or kickbacks within the meaning of <em>Skilling, </em>not mere \u201cundisclosed self-dealing by a public official\u201d as Silver argues.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">C. Money Laundering</p>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">Lastly, Silver argues that the Government failed to prove its money laundering count because the proceeds of his two schemes had been commingled into an account with untainted funds. To convict Silver of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957, the Government was required to prove that Silver \u201cknowingly engage[d] or attempt[ed] to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000,\u201d and that the property was \u201cderived from specified unlawful activity.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Silver thus argues that because he deposited the proceeds of his schemes into an account with legitimate funds, the Government could not prove that the funds at issue were criminally derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-15\">We have not yet addressed whether the Government must trace \u201cdirty\u201d funds co-mingled with \u201cclean\u201d funds in order to prove money laundering under Section 1957. Silver relies on the view of the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, which both require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Government to trace criminally derived proceeds when they have been commingled with funds from legitimate sources to prove money laundering under Section 1957.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> This view, however, is a minority one.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We, on the other hand, adopt the majority view of our sister Circuits\u2014that the Government is not required to trace criminal funds that are comingled with legitimate funds to prove a violation of Section 1957. Because money is fungible, once funds obtained from illegal activity are combined with funds from lawful activity in a single account, the \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d funds cannot be distinguished from each other.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> As such, \u201c[a] requirement that the government trace each dollar of the transaction to the criminal, as opposed to the non-criminal activity, would allow individuals effectively to defeat prosecution for money laundering by simply commingling legitimate funds with criminal proceeds.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject Silver\u2019s sufficiency challenge to his money laundering conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">II. <em>McDonnell v. United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Having determined that the evidence was sufficient to prove the counts of conviction against Silver, we now turn to Silver\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s jury instructions under <em>McDonnell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">The Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell </em>addressed what qualifies as an \u201cofficial act\u201d in an honest services fraud or Hobbs Act extortion <em>quid pro quo. </em>Robert McDonnell, the former Governor of Virginia, was charged with, among other things, honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> While McDonnell was in office, he and his wife accepted $175,000 in loans, gifts, and other benefits from businessman Jonnie Williams, who was the chief executive officer of Star Scientific, a Virginia-based company that developed a nutritional supplement made from antabine, a compound found in tobacco.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Williams sought to have Virginia\u2019s public universities conduct research on the nutritional supplement, and sought McDonnell\u2019s help to make these studies happen.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> At trial and on appeal, the Government argued that McDonnell performed certain official acts to help Williams in exchange for William\u2019s loans and gifts.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> These official acts included arranging meetings with state government officials to discuss the supplement, hosting and attending events at the Governor\u2019s Mansion for Star Scientific, and contacting other government officials to encourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>antibine studies at Virginia state universities.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The parties, in <em>McDonnell </em>agreed that the jury charge should define an \u201cofficial act\u201d by quoting the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C \u00a7 201(a)(3), which defines an official act gs \u201cany decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official\u2019s official capacity, or in such official\u2019s place of trust or profit.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The <em>McDonnell </em>district court defined \u201cofficial act\u201d accordingly for the jury,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and further instructed it that official acts \u201cencompassed acts that a public official customarily performs, including acts in furtherance of longer-term goals or in a series of steps to exercise influence or achieve an end.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The jury convicted McDonnell of honest services fraud and extortion, and the U.S, Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Supreme Court, however, unanimously vacated the Fourth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remanded the case.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The Court 'ruled that the jury was incorrectly instructed on the meaning of an \u201cofficial act,\u201d and that this error was not harmless because it may have convicted McDonnell for conduct that is not unlawful.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">Relying on the federal bribery statute\u2019s definition of \u201cofficial act,\u201d the Court held that \u201can \u2018official act\u2019 is a decision or action on a \u2018question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The Court set forth a- two-part test to meet this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">First, \u201c[t]he \u2018question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u2019 must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before \u00e1 court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The Court further clarified that this question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy \u201cmust also be something specific and focused that is \u2018pending\u2019 or \u2018may by law be brought\u2019 before a public official.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Second, \u201cto qualify as an \u2018official act/ the public official must make a decision or take an action. on that \u2018question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy/ or agree to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Such, an action or decision \u201cmay include using [an] official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an \u2018official act/ or to advise another official, knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an \u2018official act\u2019 by another official.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Without more, \u201csetting up a meeting, talking-to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so),\u201d are not official acts.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The Supreme Court emphasized that the Government\u2019s \u201cexpansive interpretation of \u2018official act\u2019 would raise significant constitutional concerns.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Those concerns included the criminalization of virtually all actions taken on behalf of constituents, subjecting public officials to prosecution without fair notice due to the vagueness of the Government\u2019s definition, and setting standards of good government for local and state official in contravention of federalism principles.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Applying these principles to McDonnell\u2019s case, the Supreme Court found that the district court\u2019s jury charge did not \u25a0include three instructions that should have been given. Specifically, the Court held that the district court should have instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u2022 that it \u201cmust identify a \u2018question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy5 involving the formal exercise of governmental power\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark>;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">\u2022 that \u201cthe pertinent \u2018question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u2019 must be something specific and focused that is \u2018pending\u2019 or \u2018may by law be brought before any public official\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark>; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-18\">\u2022 that \u201cmerely arranging a meeting or hosting an event to discuss a matter does not count as a decision or action on that matter.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">III. Honest Services Fraud and Hobbs Act Extortion Counts under <em>McDonnell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-20\">Based on <em>McDonnell, </em>Silver now challenges the District Court\u2019s jury instructions on the definition of \u201cofficial act\u201d in its honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges. Where a defendant has timely objected, as Silver did below, \u201cwe review a district court\u2019s jury charge <em>de novo, </em>and will vacate a conviction for an erroneous charge unless the error was -harmless.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> It is well settled that \u201c[a]n erroneous instruction, unless harmless, requires a new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-21\">We first consider whether the instructions were indeed in error, before turning to whether the Government met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that any such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>A. The Jury Instruction under <em>McDonnell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We consider a jury instruction erroneous \u201cif it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> When conducting this review, \u201cwe examine the charges as a whole to see if the entire charge delivered a correct interpretation of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Upon review of the jury charge in this case, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s jury instruction defining an official action in its honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges was erroneous under <em>McDonnell. </em>The District Court\u2019s charge, encompassing <em>\u201cany action </em>taken or to be taken under color of official authority,\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> was overbroad. Like the improper instruction in <em>McDonnell, </em>the plain language of the instruction at Silver\u2019s trial captured lawful conduct, such as arranging meetings or hosting events with constituents. Further, the District Court\u2019s charge did not contain any of the three instructions specified in <em>McDonnell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">It bears recalling that the purpose of a proper charge is to give the jury guideposts as to what would qualify as criminal wrongdoing under the law. Here, the instructions did not convey to the jury that an official action must be a decision or action on a matter involving the formal exercise of government power akin to a lawsuit, healing, or agency determination. Nor did the instructions prevent the jury from concluding that meetings or events with a public official to discuss a given matter were official acts by that public official. The Government\u2019s own summation confirms that the jury instructions conveyed an erroneous understanding of the law as clarified by <em>McDonnell. </em>The Government expressly urged the jury to convict because an official act <em>\u201cis not limited to </em>voting on a bill, making a speech, passing legislation, <em>it is not limited to that,\u201d </em>but rather, includes <em>\u201cany action </em>taken or to be taken under color of official authority.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The Government thus directly argued that the District Court\u2019s \u25a0 instruction defining an official act was broader than the formal exercise of government power described in <em>McDonnell. </em>Accordingly, the jury could not have received a correct interpretation of the law.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">The Government argues that the District Court\u2019s charge, taken as a whole, was consistent with Silver\u2019s proposed additional instructions and with <em>McDonnell. </em>To salvage the District Court\u2019s instructions, the Government points to language requiring that Silver \u201cintended] to be influenced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the performance of his public duties\u201d; \u201cwas expected to exercise official influence or make official decisions\u201d as a result of bribes or kickbacks; and \u201cintended to do so as specific opportunities arose.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the terms \u201cpublic duties,\u201d \u201cofficial influence,\u201d and \u201cofficial decisions\u201d convey the requisite specificity that, to qualify as an \u201cofficial act,\u201d the given \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d must involve the <em>formal exercise </em>of governmental power; nor do these terms specify that the \u201cquestion, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\u201d must be specific and focused like a hearing or lawsuit.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Moreover, whatever limiting effect this language may have had was undone by the District Court\u2019s broad instruction that an official action included <em>\u201cany action </em>taken under color of official authority.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Though we conclude that the jury instructions at Silver\u2019s trial were erroneous, we do not ascribe fault to the District Court or to the Government. The instructions at the trial, given prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McDonnell, </em>were consistent with our precedent at the time.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Indeed, we commend the District Court\u2019s forthrightness in acknowledging, after <em>McDonnell </em>was decided, that its instructions might have been in error.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">B. Harmlessness</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">The Government contends that even if the jury instructions were in error under <em>McDonnell, </em>the error was harmless. We will find an erroneous jury instruction harmless \u201conly if it is \u2018clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The Government bears the burden of establishing harmlessness.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">As explained below, we cannot conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a rational jury would have found Silver guilty if it had been properly instructed on the definition of an official act. While the Government presented evidence of acts that remain \u201cofficial\u201d under <em>McDonnell, </em>the jury may have convicted Silver for conduct that is not unlawful, and a properly instructed jury might have reached a different conclusion.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">1. Mesothelioma Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">With a <em>McDonnell </em>instruction, it is possible that a rational jury would not find that Silver engaged in a <em>quid pro quo </em>to exchange official acts for Dr. Taub\u2019s referrals.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">In this case, the statute of limitations is critical to our analysis. As previously noted, both honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charges have a five-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>statute of limitations.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Here it only captures conduct occurring after February 19, 2010, five years before the indictment against Silver.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Only three acts proven; by the Government fall within the statute of limitations: obtaining an Assembly resolution honoring Dr, Taub, agreeing to assist Dr. Taub with acquiring permits for a charity race, and helping Dr, Taub\u2019s son secure a job with a non-profit receiving state funding.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Of those acts, only the Assembly resolution clearly remains an \u201cofficial act\u201d under <em>McDonnell, </em>As such, the jury may have convicted Silver by relying on acts within the statute of limitations period that are no longer \u201cofficial\u201d under <em>McDonnell. </em>And a rational jury might not have convicted had the charge more felly described an \u201cofficial act,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">First, a rational jury might have concluded' that Silver did not engage in an official act when he agreed to help Dr. Taub with permits for his charity race. The Government\u2019s evidence showed that Dr, Taub, along with others, met with Silver at Silver\u2019s New York City office regarding the race. Silver then sent Dr. Taub a letter on Assembly letterhead offering to \u201chelp navigate the process if needed.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> To. conclude that this act was \u201cofficial\u201d under the teachings of <em>McDonnell, </em>the jury would have to find that Silver sought to \u201cus[e] his official position to exert-pressure on another official to perform an \u2018official act\u2019\u201d\u2014in this case, to issue permits to Dr. Taub.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> We cannot conclude the jury would have done so. Indeed, a rational jury with a proper jury instruction could have found that Silver\u2019s letter offering general assistance with an event occurring in his district\u2014absent any actual \u201cexert[ion] [of] pressure\u201d on other officials regarding a particular matter under their consideration\u2014did not satisfy the standards for an official act as defined by <em>McDonnell.</em><footnotemark><em>98</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Similarly, a rational jury with .a proper <em>McDonnell </em>instruction might find that Silver\u2019s letter to OHEL on behalf of Dr. Taub\u2019s son did not rise to the level of an \u201cofficial act.\u201d In its summation, the Government emphasized that Silver recommended Dr. Taub\u2019s son \u201con official Assembly letterhead.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> But using government letterhead is not,- by itself, a formal exercise of government power on a matter similar to a hearing or lawsuit. Moreover, even assuming, as the Government contends, that Silver used his official position to \u201cexert, pressure\u201d on the chief, executive officer of OHEL, there is no evidence in the record that Silver or anyone else <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>threatened to withhold OHEL funding.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> To be sure, a rational juror might well believe, hiring should be based solely on \u201cthe merits\u201d rather than on the recommendations of successful, powerful, or informed figures, and thus view negatively recommendation letters of the sort here. But viewing something negatively is not the same as finding that the elements of a crime have been met. We cannot conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury would have found that Silver\u2019s actions with OHEL met the definition of \u201cofficial act\u201d as defined in <em>McDonnell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The only proven act remaining within the statute of limitations is thus the resolution and proclamation honoring Dr. Taub. The Government argues, and Silver concedes, that the resolution is an \u201cofficial act\u201d under <em>McDonnell.</em><footnotemark><em>101</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We agree, but it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found Silver guilty based on the resolution alone. The resolution honoring Dr. Taub was a clear formal exercise of government power on a specific matter: it was brought to the floor of the Assembly by Silver and subsequently passed by the Assembly. The .evidence at trial, however, established that these honorary resolutions and proclamations were routine, <em>pro forma </em>exercises rubber stamped by Assembly members.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Indeed, in the past year alone, the Assembly has passed hundreds of honorary resolutions that, among other things, congratulated newly designated Eagle Scouts,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> celebrated high school sports teams,<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> commended retirees,<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> and commemorated the \u201cretirement\u201d of a jersey worn by a Stony Brook University athlete,<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> A rational jury could thus conclude that, though certainly \u201cofficial,\u201d the prolific and perfunctory, nature of these resolution^ make them <em>de minimis quos </em>unworthy of a <em>quid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">The Government, citing the District Court\u2019s statute of limitations instruction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>primarily argues that it need not prove that Silver committed an official act within the statute of limitations period, only that some aspect of the <em>quid pro quo </em>scheme extended into the statute of limitations period.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> The Government accordingly contends that Silver took action in furtherance of the scheme within the statute of limitations period, including demanding additional referrals from Dr. Taub on May 25, 2010, continuing to receive mesothelio-ma leads from Dr. Taub, and engaging in various phone calls and mailings in furtherance of the scheme.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> The Government concludes that, even if the only official actions Silver ever took were the award of the HCRA grants and the Assembly resolution, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the scheme continued into the limitations period.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">We agree that the Government need not prove that an official act occurred within the statute of limitations period. The Government need only prove that some aspect of the particular <em>quid pro quo </em>scheme continued into the statute of limitations period.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Here, however, most of the acts relied upon by the Government may no longer be \u201cofficial.\u201d Thus, it is entirely conceivable that a properly instructed rational jury would have viewed the <em>quid pro quo </em>scheme as limited to the exchange of referrals <em>for HCRA grant money. </em>Assuming that is the case, it is possible that a rational jury could also find that this <em>quid pro quo </em>arrangement ended when Silver told Dr. Taub that he would no longer provide him with HCRA grants, which occurred well before the statute of limitations period began to run in 2010. Given this possibility, we cannot say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a rational jury would have convicted Silver if properly instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">2. Real Estate Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">For the Real Estate Scheme, the Government at trial contended that the following acts by Silver were \u201cofficial\u201d; his PACB proxy votes for bond approvals; his meeting with Glenwood lobbyists prior to the passage of the Rent Act of 2011; his approval of real estate legislation benefiting the Developers, including the Rent Act of 2011; and his opposition to a methadone clinic near a Glenwood property. It is not clear, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a properly instructed rational jury would have found an official act <em>quid pro quo </em>based on these acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Assuming the jury was properly instructed, it is possible that it would not have considered Silver\u2019s opposition to the methadone clinic an official act. The only action Silver took regarding the clinic was to draft a letter to be distributed publicly that expressed his strong opposition to the clinic. Taking a public position on an issue, by itself, is not a formal exercise of governmental power, and is therefore not an \u201cofficial act\u201d under <em>McDonnell. </em>The record does not establish that Silver formally used his power as Speaker of the Assembly to oppose the clinic and, accordingly, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>rational jury might not have found his opposition to be an \u201cofficial act.\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Similarly, because the District Court\u2019s charge did not specifically instruct the jury that a meeting on its own is not official action, it is possible that the jury improperly concluded that the meeting between Silver and Glenwood lobbyists was an official act. This possibility is certainly \u201creasonable,\u201d if not <em>probable, </em>in light of the Government\u2019s argument during its summation that this meeting, by itself, was an official action.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> Simply meeting to discuss the terms of the Rent Act of 2011, without more, does not qualify as a \u201cdecision\u201d or \u201caction\u201d under <em>McDonnell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The remaining acts proved by the Government\u2014Silver\u2019s PACB proxy votes\u2014 may not have been enough for a rational, properly instructed jury to conclude that there was a <em>quid pro quo. </em>Assuming, <em>ar-guendo, </em>that Silver\u2019s PACB and housing legislation votes qualify as \u201cofficial acts\u201d under McDonnell,<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> a rational jury might not view these acts as part of a <em>quo </em>exchanged for the Developers\u2019 tax certiorari business.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">First, a properly instructed rational jury might not have concluded that Silver\u2019s legislative votes were part of a <em>quid pro quo </em>scheme. There is little else linking Silver\u2019s passage of real estate legislation to the Developers\u2019 referral fees other than the 2011 meeting between Glenwood lobbyists and Silver. As the District Court rightly noted, the Glenwood meeting was \u201cthe most compelling evidence on which a rational jury could have relied to conclude that Silver understood and intended there to be a <em>quid pro </em>quo.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> But even if the jury viewed the Glenwood meeting as circumstantial evidence of a <em>quid pro quo, </em>we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that a properly instructed jury would have <em>found </em>a <em>quid pro quo </em>for legislative votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Further, a juror could reasonably conclude that the PACB approvals were too perfunctory to be regarded as a quo\u2014that is, not part of any fraudulent scheme. There was no evidence adduced that any of the PACB financing approvals were particularly controversial, and one Government witness even stated that, in his experience, the PACB approved <em>every </em>financing request.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Accordingly, a rational jury with proper instructions could conclude that Silver\u2019s PACB and real estate legislation votes were not part of any <em>quid pro quo </em>\u201cscheme.\u201d The Government characterizes this conclusion\u2014that a rational jury could have concluded that the official acts proven were not part of a <em>quid pro quo </em>arrangement\u2014as one necessarily based on sufficiency of the evidence. We disagree. The issue of whether the Government adduced sufficient evidence to support the convictions is distinct from whether it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>beyond a. reasonable doubt that a properly instructed jury would have convicted. We conclude only that, in the matter of- the Real .Estate Scheme counts against Silver, it is not clear beyond -a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have convicted Silver if given proper instructions under <em>McDonnell. ,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\">IV. Money Laundering Count</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Silver also argues that, were we to vacate his honest services fraud and extortion counts for a new trial, we would necessarily need to vacate his money laundering count as well, As noted above, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957 prohibits engaging in monetary transactions in property \u201cderived from specified unlawful activity.\u201d<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> Here, the specified unlawful activity charged in the indictment and proven at trial is the honest services fraud and extortion verdict that we now vacate. We therefore must also vacate the conviction of Silver \u00f3n the money laundering count.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We recognize that many .would view the facts adduced at Silver\u2019s trial with distaste. The question presented to us, however, is not how a jury would <em>likely </em>view the evidence presented by the Government. Rather, it is whether it is clear, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a rational jury, properly instructed, would have found Silver guilty. Given the teachings of the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell, </em>and the particular circumstances of this case, we simply cannot reach that conclusion. Accordingly, we are required to vacate the honest services fraud and extortion counts against Silver, as well as the money laundering count.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">To summarize, we hold as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">(1) the evidence presented by the Government was sufficient to prove the Hobbs Act extortion and honest services fraud counts of. conviction against Silver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">(2) the evidence presented by the Government was sufficient to prove the money laundering count of conviction against Silver because the Government was not required to trace criminal funds that were commingled with legitimate funds under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">(3) the District Court\u2019s jury instruction on its honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion charge, defining an official act as \u201cany action taken or to be taken under- color of official authority,\u201d was erroneous under <em>McDonnell-, \u25a0</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-13\">(4) a properly instructed rational jury may not have convicted Silver, and accordingly the District Court\u2019s error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-14\">(5) the verdict on the money laundering count against Silver was predicated on the verdicts rendered on Silver\u2019s honest services fraud and extortion counts and must fall with those verdicts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">Accordingly, we VACATE the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction on all counts and REMAND the cause to the District Court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-16\">ATTACHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b148-17\">ADDENDUM A: Mesothelioma Scheme Timeline<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">ATTACHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">ADDENDUM B: Real Estate Scheme Timeline<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Two Real Estate Scheme events occurred repeatedly both before and during the period of time captured by the statute of limitations period, The Government argues both are \u201cofficial acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u2022 Silver repeatedly votes, through a proxy, as one of three veto-wielding members of the PACB, to approve Glenwood\u2019s requests for tax-exempt financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">\u2022 Silver regularly approves and votes for rent and tax abatement legislation sought by, among others, Glenwood.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-21\">. \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2355, 195 L,Ed.2d 639 (2016).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-23\">. <em>Id. </em>at 2371-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\">.
