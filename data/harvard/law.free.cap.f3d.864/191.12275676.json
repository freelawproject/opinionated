He arbitrated a variety of claims arising out of his employment against Odeon and its principals, Mathew Van Al-styne and Evan Schwartzberg (collectively, \u201cOdeon\u201d). As is relevant to this appeal, the arbitrators awarded Ackerman $1,102,193.00 on his claim for unpaid wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-25\">Odeon brought a petition to vacate the award, alleging the arbitrators engaged in misconduct and acted in manifest disregard of the law. It then sought to amend its..petition to assert fraud as an additional ground for vacatur. Odeon alleged Acker-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>man committed perjury during the arbitration, and that the perjury so tainted the proceedings as to require vacatur. The district court disagreed, finding that even if Ackerman committed perjury, the perjury was not material to the arbitration panel\u2019s award. Odeon appeals from the April 25, 2016 opinion and order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Rakoff, <em>,7.) </em>denying its motion to amend, as well as its petition to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">We hold that to vacate an arbitration award on the ground that the award was fraudulently procured, the petitioner must demonstrate the fraud was material to the award. That is, there must be a nexus between the alleged fraud and the decision made by the arbitrators. The petitioner, however, need not demonstrate that the arbitrators would have reached a different result. In this case, Odeon failed to establish that Ackerman\u2019s alleged perjury had any impact on the arbitration award. The district court therefore correctly denied the petition to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The district court also denied Acker-man\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending the arbitration award, and Ackerman cross-appeals from that denial. We agree with Ackerman that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in denying his fees request. The district court based its denial on the ground that the petition to vacate was not unjustified, such that the court\u2019s invocation of its inherent powers to make a fees award was unwarranted. However, New York law provides statutory authority for Ackerman\u2019s fees request. Where, as here, an employee prevails against an employer on a claim for unpaid wages, New York law mandates that the employee recover \u201call reasonable attorney[s\u2019] fees.\u201d N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 198(l-a). We therefore vacate the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Ackerman worked as a bond trader for Odeon, pursuant to an employment agreement, from May 2011 until he was fired in March 2014. After losing his job, Acker-man filed a statement of claim with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), which governs the relationship between brokers and their employers, seeking arbitration. Ackerman asserted a variety of claims against Odeon, including failure to pay commissions owed, breach of his employment agreement, disability discrimination, retaliation arising out of an investigation into a trade he made in a February 2014, and filing of a false termination notice. He sought damages in excess of $5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">A three-person arbitration panel took testimony on Ackerman\u2019s claims during a six-day hearing in October 2015. Ackerman testified on his own behalf during the arbitration proceedings. During his testimony, Ackerman was asked about an on-the-record interview (\u201cOTR\u201d) request FINRA sent him in April 2014. The OTR sought to interview Ackerman regarding a variety of trades he made while working at Odeon in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Odeon alleges that Ackerman committed perjury at least twice during this portion of his testimony. First, Odeon\u2019s counsel asked whether the investigation that was the subject of the OTR was still pending, and Ackerman testified \u201cNo.\u201d App\u2019x at 983. Second, Ackerman testified that, during his OTR, he asked the FINRA investigators whether there was anything improper with the bond trade in February 2014 that formed the basis of his retaliation claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">Bret Ackerman:- I - had brought it up with their investigators asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>them about it. As they were asking about other trades from late 2011[,] 2012 and they told me\u2014I asked them is there anything improper with this and they said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing improper with it[.\"]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">[Arbitrator]: Just to be clear, FINRA took no action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">Bret Ackerman: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">App\u2019x at 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The arbitration panel rejected the bulk of Ackerman\u2019s claims. It found in Acker-man\u2019s favor only on his claim for unpaid wages, awarding him $1,102,193.00 of the roughly $5 million he originally sought, and ordered that negative information be expunged from his U-5 form. In addition, the arbitration award provided that \u201c[a]t-torneys\u2019 fees are awarded pursuant to New York Labor Law\u201d in the amount of $247,532, with an additional award of costs of $21,349.25. App\u2019x at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Odeon filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in New York State court in December 2015, which Ackerman thereafter removed to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Acker-man then filed a cross-motion to confirm the award. While the petition to vacate was pending, Ackerman had received a letter from FINRA requesting a second OTR regarding his 2011 trades to be held at its offices in Maryland. The FINRA letter came roughly one month after the arbitration ended. By then, Ackerman no longer worked as a trader and had moved to California. Ackerman declined to travel to Maryland for a second OTR, and instead accepted a ban from working as a securities trader. To that end, he entered into a letter of acceptance, waiver, and consent (\u201cAWC\u201d) with FINRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Odeon learned of the AWC in March 2016, and sought to amend its petition to vacate to add fraud as an additional ground for vacatur. Odeon argued that the second request for an OTR established that Ackerman committed perjury during the arbitration. Specifically, Odeon argued that Ackerman \u201cmisled the arbitration panel concerning the status and outcome of a FINRA regulatory investigation into his trading activity\u201d by falsely testifying that \u201c(i) FINRA affirmatively told him that there was \u2018nothing improper\u2019 about his trading activity, and (ii) the FINRA investigation into his activities was closed.\u201d App\u2019x at 1552. Ackerman opposed the motion, arguing his testimony before the arbitration panel was truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">The district court denied Odeon\u2019s motion to amend its petition, denied the motion to vacate, and granted the cross-motion to confirm. <em>Odeon Capital Grp., LLC v. Ackerman, </em>182 F.Supp.3d 119, 128 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). The district court also denied Acker-man\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">Despite challenging the arbitration award on multiple grounds before the district court, Odeon appeals only the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to amend to add fraud as an additional ground for vaca-tur. Ackerman cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">I. Materiality as a ground for vaca-tur</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion, unless the denial was based on an interpretation of law, such as futility, in which case we review the legal conclusion <em>de novo.\u201d Panther Partners Inc. v. Ikanos Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>681 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir. 2012). \u201cIt goes without saying that there should be great hesitation in upsetting an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Karppinen v. Karl Kiefer Mach. Co., </em>187 F.2d 32, 34 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>1951). However, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) permits a court to vacate an arbitration award \u201cwhere the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">A petitioner seeking to vacate an award on the ground of fraud must adequately plead that (1) respondent engaged in fraudulent activity; (2) even with the exercise of due diligence, petitioner could not have discovered the fraud prior to the award issuing; and (3) the fraud materially related to an issue in the arbitration. <em>See Karppinen, </em>187 F.2d at 34-35. The district court here did not address the first two factors, basing its denial on Odeon\u2019s failure to demonstrate that the fraud at issue\u2014 Ackerman\u2019s alleged perjury\u2014was material to the arbitration award. <em>Odeon Capital Grp., </em>182 F.Supp.3d at 128. As we did in <em>Karppinen, </em>\u201c[w]e will assume ... that an arbitration award may be set aside in a case of material perjured evidence furnished [to] the arbitrators by a prevailing party.\u201d 187 F.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Our review, then, necessarily focuses on the appropriate standard for evaluating whether the alleged fraud was material to the arbitration. For fraud to be material within the meaning of Section 10(a)(1) of the FAA, petitioner must demonstrate a nexus between the alleged fraud and the decision made by the arbitrators, although petitioner need not demonstrate that the arbitrators would have reached a different result. <em>See, e.g., Karaha Bodas Co., v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, </em>364 F.3d 274, 306 (5th Cir. 2004) (holding that the alleged fraud must be \u201cmaterially related to\u201d the basis for the panel\u2019s decision); <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 519 v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>335 F.3d 497, 503 (6th Cir. 2003) (same); <em>Forsythe Int\u2019l, S.A. v. Gibbs Oil Co. of Texas, </em>915 F.2d 1017, 1022 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that to vacate for fraud, there must be \u201ca nexus between the alleged fraud and the basis for the panel\u2019s decision\u201d); <em>Bonar v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>835 F.2d 1378, 1383 (11th Cir. 1988) (holding that the alleged fraud must be \u201cmaterially related to\u201d the basis for the arbital award); <em>see also Hakala v. Deutsche Bank AG, </em>No. 01 Civ. 3366, 2004 WL 1057788, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2004) (noting that party seeking vacatur must \u201cshow that the fraud was material to an issue in dispute during the arbitration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">This standard is consistent with the guidance provided by <em>Karppinen. </em>There, the parties arbitrated the issue of whether two buyers could rescind the purchase of an industrial canning machine that allegedly did not work properly. <em>Karppinen, </em>187 F.2d at 33. Before the arbitrators, the sellers argued that the buyers wanted to rescind, not because something was wrong with the canning machine, but \u201cbecause they wished to buy a cheaper machine of a lower productive capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The buyers refuted that theory through testimony averring that the buyers had already purchased another canning machine with greater capacity at a higher price, and submitted a purchase order for the new machine to the arbitrators. <em>Id. </em>The arbitrators granted the buyers\u2019 request to rescind. <em>Id. </em>The sellers then sought to vacate the award based on alleged perjury. Specifically, the sellers argued the testimony regarding the purchase of the alternate canning machine, was untrue and the purchase order false. <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The panel in <em>Karppinen </em>upheld the district court\u2019s decision to confirm the arbitration award, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU1\">the bearing of the price of the [replacement canning] machine on the issues before the arbitrators is extremely remote. ... The price paid by the purchasers for some other machine had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>bearing on the real issues before the arbitrators and cannot reasonably be thought to have affected their decision in determining any relevant questions before them. At most it could only bear on a possible impeachment of [the affi-ant] as to collateral matters, and he was subjected at the hearing below to an elaborate and inconclusive examination by appellant regarding the price of the [replacement' canning] machine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 35. <em>Karppinen </em>thus anticipates that a showing of materiality requires some nexus between the alleged perjury and the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Applying that standard here, we agree with the district court that Odeon cannot demonstrate Ackerman\u2019s alleged perjury was material to the arbitration award. While Ackerman brought a variety of. claims against Odeon, the arbitrators granted him relief only on his claim for unpaid wages. That claim alleged that Odeon failed to pay him wages that were due and owing under the terms of Acker-man\u2019s employment agreement. Neither party asked for a reasoned decision from the arbitration panel. Accordingly,, the award does not provide any sort of rationale or explanation for how the panel arrived at its damages award of $1,102,193.00, There is simply no basis in the record to find that Ackerman\u2019s testimony regarding the FINRA investigation played any role in the arbitrators\u2019 award op his unpaid wages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Nor are we persuaded by Odeon\u2019s argument that because Ackerman was the primary witness on the wage claim, any perjury he committed during his testimony taints the entirety of his testimony and undermines his credibility.- A holding that any untruth could serve as a basis for vacating the award regardless of its materiality is wholly inconsistent with the-language of the FAA, which allows vacatur only where the award was <em>\u201cprocured by </em>.,. fraud.\u201d 9 U.S.C, \u00a7 10(a)(1) (emphasis added). If the alleged fraud went only to a collateral issue, or to an issue that did not influence the arbitrators\u2019 findings, then that fraud cannot serve as a basis for vacating the award because the award was not \u201cprocured by\u201d fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Odeon relies on <em>Bonar v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>arguing that it stands for the proposition that perjury can so injury a witness\u2019s credibility as to taint the entire proceedings and require the resulting arbitration award be vacated. <em>See </em>835 F.2d at 1383. <em>Bonar </em>is distinguishable: There, the Eleventh Circuit vacated an award based on fraud after determining that plaintiffs expert witness lied about his credentials, faking multiple degrees and employment positions. <em>Id. </em>at 1384. In finding the perjury material, the Eleventh Circuit explained that the only issue before the arbitrators was whether to award damages, as defendant had conceded liability. <em>Id. </em>at 1384. The only evidence before the panel on the issue of punitive damages was the testimony offered, by the expert witness. <em>Id. </em>at 1384-85. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that if the expert \u201chad not committed perjury by falsifying his credentials, it is extremely doubtful that he would have been permitted to testify as an expert, and the arbitrators would have heard none of the ,.. testimony\u201d regarding punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 1385. Without the expert\u2019s testimony, then, there would have been no evidence in the record to support any award of punitive damages. \u201cThus, by establishing the foundation that allowed the panel to hear influential expert testimony on the central issue of negligent supervision, . the, fraud materially related to an issue in the arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Eleventh Circuit found that the expert\u2019s lies regarding his background established his bona fldes as an expert witness, and absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>those credentials, he would not have been able to testify as to punitive damages. Here, in contrast, the record does not suggest Ackerman\u2019s alleged perjury was so significant that it would have caused the arbitrators to disregard his testimony in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Equally unavailing is Odeon\u2019s reliance on <em>MidAmerican Energy Company v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 499, </em>345 <em>F.3d 616 (8th Cir. </em>2003). There, an employee charged with maintaining the security of a natural gas storage facility was fired after he abandoned his post. <em>Id. </em>at 618. He challenged his firing in an arbitration. During the arbitration, the employee testified that he left his post after his wife called and told him his son was missing. <em>Id. </em>The arbitrator ordered the employee be rehired, based in part on the arbitrator\u2019s assessment that the employee took full responsibility for his actions, cooperated with management\u2019s investigations, and \u201chas consistently owned up to what he did, indicating that he knew it to be wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623. After the arbitration award issued, the employer allegedly learned that the employee had actually left that night to cheat on his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 619. The Eighth Circuit found that if the employee did commit perjury, it was material to the arbitration because the arbitrator\u2019s award stressed the employee\u2019s honesty and truthfulness. <em>Id. </em>at 623. Here, however, nothing in the award indicates that the arbitrators relied heavily on Ack-erman\u2019s truthfulness in making its award. Indeed, given that Ackerman sought damages in excess of five million dollars and received roughly one-fifth of that amount, and that Ackerman prevailed on just one of his eleven claims, it appears the arbitrators took most of what Ackerman said with a grain of salt. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the alleged perjury was - immaterial to the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">II. Attorneys\u2019 fees</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\"> We review the district court\u2019s denial of a request for attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Scarangella v. Grp. Health Inc., </em>731 F.3d 146, 151 (2d Cir. 2013). \u201cA court necessarily abuses its discretion when it applies an incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u201cUnder the prevailing American rule, in a federal action, attorneys\u2019 fees cannot be recovered by the successful party in the absence of statutory authority for the award.\u201d <em>International Chemical Workers Union, Local No. 227 v. BASF Wyandotte Corp., </em>774 F.2d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 1985). But, we noted, \u201c[pjursuant to its inherent equitable powers ... a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees when the opposing counsel acts in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The <em>International Chemical </em>court denied fees because the statute at issue in the arbitration\u2014the Labor Management Relations Act\u2014did not provide for a fees award to a prevailing party in an action to vacate or confirm an arbitration award. The district court relied on <em>International Chemical </em>for the proposition that \u201c[a]s applied to suits for the confirmation and enforcement of arbitration awards, the guiding principle has been stated as follows: when a challenger refuses to abide by an arbitrator\u2019s decision without justification, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs may properly be awarded.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The district court misapprehended the basis for Ackerman\u2019s request. Acker-man sought fees pursuant to the district court\u2019s statutory powers under New York Labor Law, not its equitable powers. New York Labor Law \u00a7 198(l-a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n any action instituted in the courts upon a wage claim by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>employee ... in which the employee prevails, the court shall allow such employee to recover ... all reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d The arbitrators specified Acker-man\u2019s award was for \u201ccompensatory damages based on unpaid wages\u201d and attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cpursuant to New York Labor Law.\u201d App\u2019x at 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Odeon argues that because Section 198(1-a) does not specifically state that that fees are due in an action to confirm or enforce an arbitration award, it does not mandate fees here. We disagree. New York\u2019s Civil Practice Law and Rules define \u201caction\u201d to include a \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 105(b). Applications to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards are made through special proceedings. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7502(a), 7510, (confirmation), 7511 (vacating or modifying). It necessarily follows that the term \u201caction\u201d as used in Section 198(1-a) includes special proceedings to confirm or enforce an arbitration award. This is consistent with the purposes underlying Section 198(l-a), which explicitly serves as a fee-shifting statute to provide \u201cone more safeguard to assure employees of proper payment of wages under the law and [to act as] a deterrent against abuse and violations.\u201d <em>Gottlieb v. Kenneth D. Laub &amp; Co., </em>82 N.Y.2d 457, 464, 605 N.Y.S.2d 213, 626 N.E.2d 29 (1993) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">It is also consistent with how the courts have read similar language where a statute provides for fee shifting. For example, the Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) provides that the prevailing party in an action to recover unpaid contributions to a benefit fund is entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(2)(D). The district court in <em>Supreme Oil Co. v. Abondolo </em>relied on that provision to award attorneys\u2019 fees in an action to confirm an arbitration award. 568 F.Supp.2d 401, 409 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). The court noted that \u201c[a]n action to confirm an arbitrator\u2019s award of such payments [under ERISA] is considered to be an action to recover unpaid contributions,\u201d allowing for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to Section 1132(g)(2)(D). <em>Id. </em>(collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Similarly, here an action to confirm an arbitrator\u2019s award for unpaid wages is an action to recover unpaid wages. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees, and remand for the district court to calculate the proper fees award. To the extent Acker-man seeks fees for defending this appeal, he must first direct his request to the district court. While appellate courts may determine appellate fees, district courts are generally best suited to undertake such tasks in the first instance. <em>Porzig v. Dresdner, Kleinwort, Benson, N. Am. LLC, </em>497 F.3d 133, 144 (2d Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Dague v. City of Burlington, </em>976 F.2d 801, 804-05 (2d Cir. 1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court\u2019s denial of Odeon\u2019s motion to amend its petition to vacate is affirmed. The district court\u2019s denial of Ackerman\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees is vacated, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
