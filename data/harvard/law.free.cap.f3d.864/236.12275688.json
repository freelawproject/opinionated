On appeal, we ask whether federal pleading standards, when applied to New York law, require a plaintiff asserting a defamation claim to allege facts demonstrating that the defendant made a false statement. We then consider whether Tan-nerite\u2019s defamation complaint alleged that defendant NBCUniversal News Group (\u201cNBC\u201d) made false statements regarding Tannerite exploding rifle targets (\u201cTanner-ite targets\u201d or \u201ctargets\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Because we answer the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and its entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ava\">I. The Broadcast</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u201cRight how, I ani basically holding-\u00e1 bomb in my hand,\u201d proclaimed television reporter Jeff Rossen, speaking against backdrop images of high-powered firearms and flame-engulfed cars. App\u2019x at 89. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll never believe where I got this,\u201d he continued. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA sporting goods store, no questions asked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the television camera zoomed in, he added that \u201cthe key ingredient here that causes the explosion has been used by terrorists to kill Americans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lifting two white containers for viewers to see, Rossen declared that \u201c[t]his morning, you\u2019re about to see what happens when this gets in the wrong hands.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">So began' a report on NBC\u2019s Today Show considering the dangers of Tannerite exploding rifle targets. Tannerite\u2019s \u201ctargets\u201d consist of separately packaged chemicals\u2014-ammonium nitrate and pyrotechnic grade aluminum powder\u2014that detonate when mixed together and then shot with a high-velocity bullet. The targets enhance long-range recreational shooting, as the explosion provides an exciting acknowledgment that the target has been hit. Or, as Tannerite\u2019s 2\u00d314 Product Guide states, \u201c[sjtrike your target and the gratification is instant.\u201d App\u2019x at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">. Unfortunately, but somewhat obviously* the targets pose dangers if misused. Tan-nerite\u2019s own product guide recommends that the targets be detonated \u201caway from populated areas,\u201d and notes that improper use of the targets \u201cmay start fires, may be less safe to handle, and [may cause] erratic performance.\u201d App\u2019x at 25. And, because the targets contain. ingredients that explode, they can be used to-do harm rather than enhance recreation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The Today Show\u2019s report emphasized these risks, to put things mildly. When Rossen\u2019s introduction concluded,' the scene changed abruptly to a small building in a country setting. Following a moment of serenity, the building exploded in a column of fire. A voice-over noted the presence of \u201cdangerous and powerful explosives.\u201d App\u2019x'at 89. Viewers saw a montage of structures and cars bursting into flame.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">After\u2019 displaying more destruction, Ros-sen turned his focus to \u201c[t]he lead manufacturer\u201d of the targets: Tannerite. <em>Id. </em>He described Tannerite targets\u2019 \u201ckey ingredient,\u201d ammonium nitrate, as \u201ca favorite of terrorists^] used in the Oklahoma City bombing, and to kill U.S.\u2019 troops in Afghanistan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He noted that \u201c[t]he FBI even issu[ed]- [an] intelligence bulletin in 2013,\u201d stating that \u201cit has potential use as [an] explosive[] in IEDs by criminals and'ex:-tremists.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">NBC\u2019s broadcast emphasized the easy accessibility of Tannerite targets. It noted their presence at' \u201cmost sporting goods stores\u201d, and online. <em>Id. </em>Rossen stated that he \u201cwent shopping and bought it by the cartload,\u201d and his \u201cproducer bought forty pounds\u2019 worth online, enough to blow up a house.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Next came an interview with -Travis Bond, a firearms expert. Bond stated that Tannerite is \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d and the \u201cequivalent of buying explosives off the shelf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A voice-over relayed Bond\u2019s view that \u201cTannerite is getting around the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>law on a technicality, separating the two [chemical] ingredients, even though they\u2019re sold together.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The video showed Bond cutting open separately-wrapped packets of chemicals contained within a package of Tannerite and mixing them together in a single container. After Bond mixed the chemicals, he stated, \u201c[t]his is now classified by ATF as an explosive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The report bemoaned the product\u2019s minimal regulatory supervision. Rossen interviewed Senator Richard Blumenthal, who argued that the products should be regulated more rigorously. Rossen then read Tannerite\u2019s response: that the product is safe when used properly and that \u201c[o]nly girly-men want to regulate Tannerite rifle targets.\u201d App\u2019x at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Back in the studio, Rossen, holding two cartons of Tannerite targets, turned to the Today Show anchors and noted that, \u201cafter buying all of these products, we are handing it over to experts,\u201d but assured them that \u2022 it is \u201cnot dangerous being in the studio right now. Of course, I wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He added, \u201c[a]nd you need the catalyst. But it is incredibly dangerous when you think about it ,.. and how this is used overseas by terrorists,\u201d <em>Id. </em>An anchor added, \u201c[a]nd in some cases here as well, by the way.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">II. The Article</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">An NBC internet article called \u201cBombs for sale: Targets containing dangerous explosive being sold legally\u201d provided a similar account. App\u2019x at 37. The article discussed injuries caused- by the \u201cexploding targets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It stated that the \u201ckey ingredient\u201d of the targets \u201cis ammonium nitrate, the same substance used in the Oklahoma City bombing ... and in IEDs ... used against U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\u201d App\u2019x at 38. It noted that \u201c[g]un enthusiasts biiy it for target practice because it explodes when you shoot it, letting you know you\u2019ve made the shot.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The article again noted Bond\u2019s view that \u201cTannerite is getting around the law on a technicality by separating the two ingredients in its explosive\u2014ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder\u2014even though the two are sold together,\u201d and quoted Bond as saying that \u201conce it\u2019s mixed, it\u2019s classified as an explosive.\u201d <em>let. </em>Like the video report, the article discussed Senator Blu-menthal\u2019s views embracing greater regulation, and printed Tannerite\u2019s response that additional regulation would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">III. Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"AHh\">Tannerite sued NBC for defamation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that NBC defamed Tannerite in both the article and video by stating or suggesting, among other things, that the \u201ctargets are dangerous bombs as sold on store shelves,\u201d which was false because \u201c[plaintiffs rifle targets are not bombs,\u201d and, in any case, \u201care inert as sold in stores\u201d and therefore not dangerous in that setting. App\u2019x at 17-19.</p>\n<p id=\"ABJ\">NBC moved to dismiss, and .the district court granted the motion. <em>Tannerite Sports, LLC v. NBCUniversal Media LLC, </em>135 F.Supp.3d 219, 236 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). The district court stated that a plaintiff wishing to recover under New York defamation law must allege, among other things, that the defendant made \u201ca false statement about the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232. The court explained that \u201c[t]ruth or falsity is determined by the common law standard of substantial truth,\u201d and that \u201c[a] statement is substantially true and not actionable if the published statement could have produced no worse an effect on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>mind of a reader than the truth pertinent to the allegation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The district court ruled that Tannerite had not alleged that NBC made false statements. The court stated that \u201c[t]here is no question that \u2018Tannerite-brand binary <em>exploding </em>rifle targets\u2019 explode. That is their purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235 (emphasis in original). Consequently, even if NBC\u2019s \u201cuses of the word \u2018bomb\u2019 [did not] me[et] the precise definition of the word.... the gist or substance ... [was] true in light of the many meanings that reasonable audiences associate with the word.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The court also wrote that neither publication \u201csuggested that Tannerite\u2019s exploding rifle targets are dangerous before the component ingredients are mixed, or that proper use of the products causes destruction or injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. The court noted that the video demonstrated how the product\u2019s ingredients must be mixed, and both the video and article stated that the product does not become an explosive until its ingredients are mixed together. <em>Id. </em>The court also concluded that NBC\u2019s reports clearly described dangers from misuse, as opposed to proper use, of the products. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In the same order, the court also denied Tannerite\u2019s motion for leave to amend. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Tannerite appealed the district court\u2019s order granting NBC\u2019s motion to dismiss and denying the motion to amend, as well as the judgment order that followed soon after.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss. <em>Williams v. Priatno, </em>829 F.3d 118, 121 (2d Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">I. Consideration of Substantial Truth at the Motion-to-Dismiss Stage</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Tannerite first argues that the \u201csubstantial truth\u201d of a defendant\u2019s statement is not a proper basis for dismissal of a defamation complaint, inasmuch as \u201csubstantial truth\u201d is an affirmative defense that must await summary judgment. We consider this argument before addressing whether NBC\u2019s statements were, as the district court ruled, substantially true.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">A. Substantial Truth</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">\u201cSubstantial truth\u201d is the standard by which New York law, and the law of most other jurisdictions, determines an allegedly defamatory statement to be true or false. <em>See Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 496, 516, 111 S.Ct. 2419, 115 L.Ed.2d 447 (1991) (\u201cThe common law of libel takes but one approach to the question of falsity, regardless of the form of the communication. It overlooks minor inaccuracies and concentrates upon substantial truth.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also Franklin v. Daily Holdings, Inc., </em>135 A.D.3d 87, 21 N.Y.S.3d 6, 12 (1st Dep\u2019t 2015). In <em>Franklin, </em>the Appellate Division explained that \u201c[t]o satisfy the falsity element of a defamation claim, plaintiff must allege that the complained of statement is \u2018substantially false.\u2019\u201d 21 N.Y.S.3d at 12. Thus, \u201c[i]f an allegedly defamatory statement is \u2018substantially true,\u2019 a claim of libel is legally insufficient and ... should [be] dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted; ellipsis and second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Biro v. Conde Nast, </em>883 F.Supp.2d 441, 458 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">\u201c[A] statement is substantially true if the statement would not have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Biro, </em>883 F.Supp.2d at 458); <em>see also Fleckenstein v. Friedman, </em>266 N.Y. 19, 23, 193 N.E. 537 (1934). \u201cWhen the truth is so near to the facts as published that fine and shaded distinctions must be drawn and words pressed out of their ordinary usage to sustain a charge of libel, no legal harm has been done.\u201d <em>Fleckenstein, </em>266 N.Y. at 23, 193 N.E. 537 (quoting <em>Cafferty v. S. Tier Pub. Co., </em>226 N.Y. 87, 93, 123 N.E. 76 (1919)). When a court interprets a publication in an action for defamation, \u201c[t]he entire publication, as well as the circumstances of its issuance, must be considered in terms of its effect upon the ordinary reader.\u201d <em>Silsdorf v. Levine, </em>59 N.Y.2d 8, 13, 462 N.Y.S.2d 822, 449 N.E.2d 716 (1983); <em>see also Aronson v. Wiersma, </em>65 N.Y.2d 592, 594, 493 N.Y.S.2d 1006, 483 N.E.2d 1138 (1985); <em>Stepanov v. Dow Jones &amp; Co., </em>120 A.D.3d 28, 34, 987 N.Y.S.2d 37 (1st Dep\u2019t 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The \u201csubstantial truth\u201d standard finds basis in the realities and purposes of defamation law. In <em>Tolbert v. Smith, </em>we explained that \u201ca statement need not be <em>completely </em>true, but can be <em>substantially </em>true\u201d because fact and fiction may not be crisply delineated categories in defamation cases. 790 F.3d 427, 440 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Chau v. Lewis, </em>771 F.3d 118, 129 (2d Cir. 2014)). And the New York Court of Appeals has justified the standard by reference to underlying purposes of defamation law, explaining that \u201c[t]he libel law is not a system of technicalities, but reasonable regulations whereby the public may be furnished news and information, but not false stories about any one.\u201d <em>Cafferty, </em>226 N.Y. at 93, 123 N.E. 76. This system of \u201creasonable regulation\u201d would be damaged by an overly technical or exacting conception of truth in publication. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">B. Falsity Required to Plead Defamation Under Contemporary New York Law</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">If this case were governed by traditional common-law rules, Tannerite would be correct in describing \u201csubstantial truth,\u201d or simply \u201ctruth,\u201d as an affirmative defense. \u201cAt common law the majority position [was] that ... the plaintiff must allege falsity in his complaint,\u201d but that, if the plaintiff so alleges, \u201cthe falsity of a defamatory communication is presumed\u201d and that \u201ctruth is an affirmative defense which must be raised by the defendant and on which he has the burden of proof.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>statement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 581A cmt. b (Am. Law Inst. 2017). But \u201c[m]any contemporary cases have announced ... nontraditional requirements [that] are now necessary to sustain a libel claim,\u201d and one of the new requirements is that \u201cthe plaintiff must prove .., [that] the publication was false.\u201d Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden &amp; Ellen M. Bublick, The Law of Torts \u00a7 519 (2d ed. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">New York is one jurisdiction embracing such a rule. Falsity is an element of defamation under contemporary New York law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In summarizing the tort, some New York courts present the more-traditional formulation that \u201c[m]aking a false statement that tends to expose a person to public contempt, hatred, ridicule, aversion or disgrace constitutes defamation.\u201d <em>Thomas H. v. Paul B., </em>18 N.Y.3d 580, 584, 942 N.Y.S.2d 437, 965 N.E.2d 939 (2012) (citing <em>Geraci v. Probst, </em>15 N.Y.3d 336, 344, 912 N.Y.S.2d 484, 938 N.E.2d 917 (2010); <em>Foster v. Churchill, </em>87 N.Y.2d 744, 751, 642 N.Y.S.2d 583, 665 N.E.2d 153 (1996)). Oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u2022er opinions; such as that in <em>Stepanov, </em>provide a contemporary description that delineates very specifically the acts and effects to be proven:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">To prove a claim for defamation, a plaintiff must show: (1) a <em>false statement </em>that is (2) published' to a third party (3) without privilege or authorization, and that (4) causes harm, unless the -statement is one of the types of publications actionable regardless of harm. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">120 A.D.3d at 34, 987 N.Y.S.2d 37 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Dillon v. City of N.Y., </em>261 A.D.2d 34, 38, 704 N.Y.S.2d 1 (1st Dep\u2019t. 1999)). Regardless of the precise formulation,.these opinions, and others addressing the issue, include falsity as an element of defamation. <em>See, e.g., Town of Massena v. Healthcare Underwriters Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 N.Y.2d 435, 444, 749 N.Y.S.2d 456, 779 N.E.2d 167 (2002) (noting that \u201c[a] party alleging defamation must allege that the statement is false\u201d); <em>Brian v. Richardson, </em>87 N.Y.2d 46, 50-51, 637 N.Y.S.2d 347, 660 N.E.2d 1126 (1995) (\u201cThe essence of the tort of libel is. the publication of a statement about an individual that is both false and defamatory.\u201d); <em>Immuno AG. v. Moor-Jankowski, </em>77 N.Y.2d 235, 245, 566 N.Y.S.2d 906, 567 N.E.2d 1270 (1991) (\u201c[A] libel plaintiff has the burden of showing the falsity of factual assertions.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Numerous cases illustrate that falsity is an element of a New York defamation claim, -and that a plaintiff in New York courts generally must identify how the defendant\u2019s statement was false to survive a motion to dismiss. .</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In <em>Silsdorf v. Levine, </em>the plaintiff, a former mayor of his town who lost his reelection bid, sued the publishers of a letter that had disparaged Kim during the campaign. 59 N.Y.2d 8, 462 N.Y.S.2d 822, 449 N.E.2d 716 (1983). In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the New York Court of Appeals considered the defendants\u2019 argument that \u201cplaintiff has not: challenged the \u2022accuracy of the letter\u2019s factual statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 462 N.Y.S.2d 822, 449 N.E.2d 716. Had the defendants been correct on that- point, the court noted, \u201cthe opinions complained of could not form the basis for a defamation cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But the court concluded that the plaintiffs \u201caffidavit in opposition to the motion'to dismiss assails virtually every statement of fact contained in the letter as either a \u2018gross distortion\u2019 or \u2018misrepresentation of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then gave a list, of specific examples of the, plaintiffs allegations of falsity. A sampling is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACH\">Defendants\u2019 letter characterizes plaintiffs administration -as \u201cone-man rule\u201d, brought about by plaintiffs disregard of the board\u2019s authority and unilateral actions taken in violation'of village ordinance, and board directive. In response to these statements, plaintiff alleges-that he did not, as stated in the letter, relieve board members of their.responsibilities, thus thwarting the democratic process; rather, following a dispute, he merely withdrew authority he had previously delegated to board members and immediately delegated that authority to others .... Further, defendants\u2019 statement that plaintiff permitted a ferry to dock in violation of a board directive is alleged to be entirely untrue, inasmuch as plaintiff never authorized or permitted such landings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 462 N.Y.S.2d 822, 449, N.E.2d 716. In view of .these explanations as to why particular statements were false, the court ruled that the action could be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Similarly, in <em>Fleischer v. NYP Holdings, Inc., </em>the Appellate, Division affirmed the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim because it did not allege falsity. 104 A.D.3d 536, 961 N.Y.S.2d 393 (1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Dep\u2019t 2013). The plaintiff contended that a newspaper article falsely stated \u201cthat a popular Soho restaurant was closed because of her regular complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. The court observed, however, that the fact \u201cthat the inspections\u201d leading to the restaurant\u2019s closure \u201cresulted from plaintiffs complaints ... is an inference well supported by the record, including plaintiffs own allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She had thus failed to allege falsity, and her complaint failed to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In <em>Kraus v. Brandstetter, </em>the Appellate Division dismissed a defamation claim as legally insufficient under similar circumstances. 167 A.D.2d 445, 562 N.Y.S.2d 127 (2d Dep\u2019t 1990). The plaintiff, Kraus, a hospital administrator who had been fired, alleged that staff members under her control had been told that \u201cyour boss is going to get fired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129. The court explained that \u201cin order to be actionable in defamation, a statement must be both false and defamatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130. And \u201c[s]ince [the defendant] stated that Kraus was going to be fired in the future, and Kraus was subsequently fired ..., the challenged statement was substantially true, and therefore, not defamatory.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Plaintiff disputes the principles discussed above, arguing instead that \u201csubstantial truth\u201d is an affirmative defense that must await summary judgment. The argument relies on <em>Garcia v. Puccio, </em>17 A.D.3d 199, 793 N.Y.S.2d 382 (1st Dep\u2019t 2005). In <em>Garcia, </em>a school\u2019s principal told the parent of a student that a particular teacher had been accused of using corporal punishment in the past. <em>Id. </em>at 383. The teacher sued the principal for defamation. The principal moved to dismiss, arguing that the statement was substantially true, because the fact of previous accusations was \u201cundisputed,\u201d and \u201cplaintiff has the burden of showing the falsity of factual assertions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, and the Appellate Division affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 383-84. The Appellate Division stated that \u201cdefendants\u2019 reliance upon the apparent truth of [the disputed] statement is premature at this point inasmuch as a claim of truth or substantial truth, like a claim of qualified privilege, is an affirmative defense to be raised in defendants\u2019 answer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court noted that \u201c[i]t would be error to give conclusive effect to defendants\u2019 position of truthfulness before any affirmative defense to that effect has been raised in their answer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\"><em>Garcia </em>fails to show, however, that truth may only be raised as an affirmative defense. In <em>Garcia, </em>the defendant\u2019s statement of past accusations, though \u201ctechnically\u201d true, allegedly omitted necessary context\u2014which was that the accusations were expunged after review. <em>Id. </em>at 383-84. Consequently, the court in <em>Garcia </em>faced a situation like that in <em>Franklin: </em>a statement technically true, but shorn of context, created a false impression of the plaintiff, while a report of the statement with its context perhaps would not have done so. <em>See Franklin, </em>21 N.Y.S.3d at 12-13. In both cases, the plaintiff alleged that a statement would have had \u201ca different effect on the mind of the average reader\u201d had it been supplemented with certain context. <em>See id. </em>at 12. That is, of course, equivalent to alleging that the statements were not substantially true. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[A] statement is substantially true if the statement would not have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such a pleading suffices to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Although the opinion in <em>Garcia </em>stated that \u201ctruth or substantial truth ... is an affirmative' defense to be raised in defendants\u2019 answer,\u201d that language is best understood as referring only to cases where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the truth or falsity of the defendant\u2019s statement depends on material outside the complaint. In such a situation, the outside material may be presented by the defendant at summary judgment so the court may determine whether a legitimate question exists as to its truth or falsity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In sum, despite the language of <em>Garcia, </em>falsity is an element of a defamation claim under New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">C, Federal Pleading Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Having established that falsity\u2014or lack of substantial truth\u2014is an element of a New York defamation claim, it follows that a plaintiff must plead facts demonstrating falsity to prevail on a motion to dismiss the complaint in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">To survive a motion to dismiss in federal court, a complaint must contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). \u201cThese federal pleading rules and standards, ineluding the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Rule 8, prevail in all civil actions, including diversity litigation.\u201d <em>Biro v. Conde Nast, </em>807 F.3d 541, 544 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Consequently, a federal court sitting in diversity must test state-law claims against the standard in <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal. See, e.g., Cnty. of Erie v. Colgan Air, Inc., </em>711 F.3d 147, 149-50 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Consistent with these principles, when falsity is an element of a state defamation claim, federal courts have required plaintiffs to plead facts that, if proven, would allow a reasonable person to consider the statement false. <em>Swindol v. Aurora Flight Scis. Corp., </em>832 F.3d 492, 494-95 (5th Cir. 2016); <em>Clark v. Viacom Int\u2019l Inc., </em>617 Fed.Appx. 495, 509-10 (6th Cir. 2015); Price <em>v. Stossel, </em>620 F.3d 992, 1000, 1003 (9th Cir. 2010). In particular, several courts of appeals have affirmed dismissals of defamation claims because the material in the complaint cannot be reasonably understood except as being true or substantially true. <em>See Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. v. Kansas Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>810 F.3d 1161, 1185 (10th Cir. 2016); <em>Turkish Coal. of Am., Inc. v. Bruininks, </em>678 F.3d 617, 626 (8th Cir. 2012). At least one court issued such a ruling even under earlier, less-stringent pleading standards. <em>Quinn v. Ocwen Fed. Bank FSB, </em>470 F.3d 1240, 1244, 1246 (8th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Because falsity is an element of New York\u2019s defamation tort, and \u201cfalsity\u201d refers to material not substantially true, the complaint in this case must plead facts that, if proven, would establish that the defendant\u2019s statements were not substantially true.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In determining the sufficiency of Tannerite\u2019s complaint, we may consider documents attached to it, such as the text of the article posted to NBC\u2019s website and the video and transcript of the television report. <em>See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d. Cir. 2002) (\u201c[T]he complaint is deemed to in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>elude any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">II. Substantial Truth of NBC\u2019s Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Tannerite argues that its complaint adequately pled several ways in which NBC\u2019s report was not substantially true. We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">A. Tannerite Targets are not \u201cBombs\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Plaintiff first notes that NBC\u2019s publications repeat\u00e9dly compare Tannerite targets to \u201cbombs.\u201d Rossen stated, when first describing Tannerite targets, that he was \u201cbasically holding a bomb in [his] hand.\u201d App\u2019x at 91. Travis. Bond, the firearms expert interviewed by NBC, opined that Tannerite is \u201cextremely dangerous, like a bomb for sale on the shelf.\u201d App\u2019x at 38. Other comparisons of the targets to bombs abound within NBC\u2019s two publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Tannerite\u2019s complaint states. that \u201c[p]laintiff s rifle targets are not bombs.\u201d App\u2019x at 18. In briefing this appeal, Tan-nerite opposes the district court\u2019s view of what constitutes a \u201cbomb,\u201d contending that the court appeared to believe that a \u201cbomb\u201d is' any \u201cobject with an explosive nature under certain conditions.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 24-25. Tannerite disputes what it understood to be the court\u2019s capacious view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">The district court does not have to accept Appellant\u2019s definition of \u201cbomb\u201d but should not substitute its own, when its own would encompass anything that could explode, including a firecracker, a champagne bottle, an oxygen tank, a battery, or potato in a microwave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayj-dedup-0\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 25,</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Given its discussion of oxygen tanks, batteries, and potatoes, Tannerite appears not to grasp a distinction the district court clearly recognized and employed: the difference between objects that merely <em>happen </em>to explode, and those <em>designed </em>or <em>intended </em>to explode. Only the latter are designated as \u201cbombs.\u201d Credible definitions of the term \u201cbomb\u201d capture this distinction. <em>See United States v. Graziano, </em>616 F.Supp.2d 350, 359-60 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (ruling, based on dictionary definitions, that under 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 921(a)(4)(A), \u201can incendiary bomb\u201d is \u201csimply any container or device that contains an incendiary material that is <em>designed </em>to be dispersed in a violent or rapid manner upon ignition, impact, and/or detonation, including in the form of heat or fire.\u201d) (emphasis added), <em>aff'd, </em>391 Fed.Appx. 965 (2d Cir. 2010); <em>see also Bomb, </em>Oxford English Dictionary (2016) (defining \u201cbomb,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>as \u201ca case <em>filled </em>with explosive, inflammable material, poison gas, or smoke, etc., <em>fired </em>from a gun, dropped from, aircraft, or <em>thrown or deposited </em>by hand\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Bomb, </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (2017) (defining \u201cbomb\u201d as \u201ca projectile or other device carrying.an, explosive charge <em>fused </em>to detonate under certain conditions ... and that is ... <em>set into position &amp;t </em>a given point (such as dynamite) with varying effects (such as concussion, or fire-flinging, or the release of gases)....\u201d) (emphasis added). These authorities either explicitly state that a bomb must be \u201cintended\u201d or \u201cset\u201d to explode, or clarify that bombs only come about through conditions that must be created intentionally by humans, such as \u201ca case filled with explosive, inflammable material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">As the district court recognized, the primary purpose, of a Tannerite exploding rifle target is to explode. <em>See Tannerite Sports, </em>135 F.Supp.3d at 235. Tannerite\u2019s product guide explains the intended use of the targets:!</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Tannerite brand binary targets have changed the sport and practice of long-range shooting. Now, even at hundreds of yards, the experience of a hit seems close and personal.. Audibly, a well placed bullet produces a thunderous report that underlines your accuracy. Visually, the plume of a direct strike-circles like a round of high fives among friends. And all this sound, fury, reward\u2014and fun\u2014while improving your game,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">App\u2019x at 24. The guide also clarifies that the'targets are \u201cintended for use with high powered center-fire rifles,\u201d and explains how to detonate the targets properly. App\u2019x at 25. Neith\u00e9r the product guide, nor the remainder of the complaint, explains any other purpose of the targets beyond their use for explosion in target practice. The target\u2019s singularity of explosive purpose\u2014the fact that it is \u201cis designed to be dispersed in a violent or rapid manner upon ... detonation,\u201d <em>Graziano, </em>616 F.Supp.2d at 360\u2014marks it as a kind of bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Unlike Tannerite targets, most other items listed in plaintiffs\u2019 brief do not explode by design or purpose. Oxygen tanks and batteries primarily serve the non-explosive purposes of providing oxygen and electricity, respectively. It is unlikely that a potato\u2019s-purpose is explosion, given that potatoes usually reside underground and seldom explode absent human prompting. As plaintiffs brief suggests, potatoes typically explode only during microwave cooking\u2014a process intended to allow consumption of the potato rather than creation of explosions in the microwave.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aau-dedup-0\">To be sure, the items Tannerite lists could be described as \u201cbombs\u201d if, in a perversion of their ordinary uses, someone intended to use them to cause explosions. But Tannerite-targets- stand out from potatoes, oxygen tanks, and batteries in that the targets\u2019 <em>primary </em>purpose is explosion. For that reason, the district court- correctly ruled that NBC\u2019s description of the product as a \u201cbomb\u201d was, at the least, substantially true.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">B, Tannerite Targets are not \u201cBomb[s] on a Shelf\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Tannerite\u2019s most emphatic argument is that, even if its targets are sometimes \u201cbombs,\u201d they cannot accurately be called \u201cbomb[s] on a shelf,\u201d which is how NBC\u2019s publications described them. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 24-27. Tannerite argues that this characterization ignores the product\u2019s \u201cbinary\u201d packaging, which keeps its two ingredients separately wrapped \u201cwhile they are on the shelf,\u201d thus preventing the targets from reaching their \u201cactive state.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26. Tannerite explains that \u201c[t]he main reason to create a binary target is ... so it <em>cannot explode </em>on a store shelf.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26, Tanner-ite worries that \u201ca reasonable viewer could conclude,\u201d from NBC\u2019s statement that the product is a \u201cbomb on a shelf,\u201d that \u201cit would not be safe to shop at a store that stocked it, for fear of being hurt if it were to explode,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26. And, given that no such risk exists, Tannerite argues -that the publications are not substantially true.'</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Tannerite\u2019s argument fails because each of NBC\u2019s publications made clear that the target\u2019s ingredients must be removed from the packaging, mixed, and shot before they explode. As noted, the court considers \u201c[t]he entire publication, as well as the circumstances of its issuance,\u201d to interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>its meaning. <em>Silsdorf, </em>59 N.Y.2d at 13, 462 N.Y.S.2d 822, 449 N.E.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">NBC\u2019s written article states that Tan-nerite is an \u201cexploding <em>target[ </em>],\u201d App\u2019x at 38 (emphasis added), and that it \u201cexplodes when you shoot it,\u201d <em>id. </em>It explains that Tannerite \u201cseparat[es] the two ingredients in its explosive,\u201d and quotes Bond, the firearms expert, as saying that \u201conce it\u2019s mixed, it\u2019s classified as an explosive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The article never mentions any detonation of the product in a store.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Similarly, the video states that consumers \u201cuse it for target practice,\u201d and \u201cwhen you shoot it, it explodes.\u201d App\u2019x at 89. It shows Bond mixing the ingredients of the target, after which he states, \u201c[t]his is <em>now </em>classified ... as an explosive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The video shows the. product exploding repeatedly in outdoor settings, either stating or implying that it has been shot, and never shows any explosion in a store. Finally, at the end of the video segment, Rossen holds the product and states that it is \u201cnot dangerous being in the studio right now,\u201d and that \u201cyou need the catalyst\u201d before the targets become explosive. <em>Id. </em>Given these statements, no reasonable viewer could have understood either publication, taken as a whole, to mean that Tannerite targets could explode within a retail outlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">C. Gun-Rights Enthusiasts Oppose Sale of Tannerite Targets</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Tannerite also argues that NBC\u2019s report was not substantially true to the extent it stated that \u201cgun-rights enthusiasts oppose\u201d the targets. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 33. This argument appears to refer to the interview of Bond, who stated that, although he is \u201ca huge supporter of the Second Amendment,\u201d he believes the targets are \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d and the \u201cequivalent of buying explosives off the shelf.\u201d App\u2019x at 89. Tannerite may also have in mind NBC\u2019s publication of Bond\u2019s view that \u201cTannerite is getting around the law on a technicality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The complaint states that NBC\u2019s assertion that \u201cBond[] opposes the sale of Tannerite-brand targets ... is false\u201d because \u201cBond himself owns a gun store that sells Tannerite-brand targets.\u201d App\u2019x at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Tannerite does not explain why someone\u2019s willingness to sell a product means that he must believe the product to be safe or otherwise commendable. Even if it were true (although it has certainly not been established at this stage) that Bond actually sells the product, and that he takes no precautions to protect the public from it, that does not mean he lied about holding a negative view of the product\u2019s safety. Among other possibilities, the need to make a living, or the possession of inconsistent beliefs, could account for any apparent conflict between Bond\u2019s views and his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Nor does the balance of either of NBC\u2019s publications suggest that \u201cgun-rights enthusiasts oppose\u201d Tannerite targets. The beginning of the video report, for example, states that \u201c[g]un enthusiasts say they use [Tannerite] for target practice.\u201d App\u2019x at 89. In short, the facts alleged in the complaint would not, even if proven, establish that NBC published a false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">D. Tannerite is Not Associated with Terrorists</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">Tannerite contends that the district court failed to address an additional basis of its defamation claim: NBC\u2019s suggestion that terrorists were associated with the company or had used the targets.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">Tannerite contends that it properly pled this basis of its defamation claim in the proceedings below. Tannerite first highlights the following paragraph in the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>[NBC\u2019s] report and video ... contained one or more written false statements that were intended to impugn Plaintiffs rifle targets and Plaintiffs reputation in the sporting industry. A true and exact copy of screenshots of an Internet article describing falsities in the [NBC] report is attached as Exhibit E.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">App\u2019x at 18. In Tannerite\u2019s view, the complaint alleged that any association of the targets with terrorists was false because Exhibit E, the cited article, suggested as much. Tannerite also points to a passage in the district court\u2019s opinion noting a sentence in Tannerite\u2019s memorandum opposing the motion to dismiss, which stated that NBC \u201cfalsely implied] that TAN-NERITE SPORTS is in cahoots with overseas terrorists.\u201d App\u2019x at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">These scattered, cryptic references do not amount to proper pleading. First, attaching the internet article to the complaint does not substitute for making a specific allegation that NBC falsely associated Tannerite with terrorists. It is true that parties may sometimes incorporate facts from outside documents into pleadings. <em>See Chambers, </em>282 F.3d at 152-53. But that allowance does not permit vague, general references to documents outside the complaint in place of specific allegations putting the court and the defendant on notice of the particular claims asserted. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (\u201cA pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a <em>short and plain </em>statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief....\u201d) (emphasis added). Vagueness as to the complained-of conduct is particularly inappropriate when pleading a defamation claim. Our defamation jurisprudence has emphasized that \u201cthe complaint [must] afford defendant sufficient notice of the communications complained of to enable him to defend himself.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Schmidberger, </em>806 F.2d 44, 46 (2d Cir. 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). As a practical matter, this rule requires the plaintiff to identify not only the publication, but also the respect in which it was allegedly false. A publication of even brief length often includes thousands of direct statements and implied messages whose veracity could be questioned by a defamation plaintiff. Some specificity is necessary so defendants and courts may address themselves to the parts of a communication alleged to be false and defamatory instead of those not objected to.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Tannerite\u2019s complaint failed to identify NBC\u2019s statements regarding terrorism or explain why those statements were false. Instead, the complaint referred generally to an article that presented a scattershot collection of nearly a dozen objections to NBC\u2019s publications. From that reference, a defendant and the court could not reasonably have understood that Tannerite wished to allege, in particular, that NBC\u2019s discussion of the product\u2019s links to terrorism were defamatory. The theory was thus not pled properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Tannerite is not saved by the brief remark in its memorandum opposing dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>missal. The statement did not .point to any facts in the complaint showing that NBC\u2019s claims regarding connections to \u201coverseas terrorists\u201d were false. Additionally, Exhibit E to the complaint, the article on which Tannerite relies for the factual basis of its terrorism argument, included, no specific factual statement bearing on whether Tan-nerite was \u201cin cahoots with overseas terrorists.\u201d Its arguments regarding NBC\u2019s references to terrorism largely considered statements about <em>domestic </em>terrorism, and made general comments about the use of ammonium nitrate for non-explosive, non-terroristic purposes. App\u2019x at 43-45. Although the article briefly opined that Tan-nerite would not be \u201cuseful\u201d as a component of IEDs, because \u201ceasier and more reliable options\u201d existed for \u201ceven the dumbest and most desperate terrorist,\u201d App\u2019x at 47, these comments do not sufficiently explain why any particular statement in NBC\u2019s publications was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Neither the complaint nor the memorandum suffices to show that Tannerite pled this theory of liability below. The district court\u2019s decision not to address it was thus appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">III. Tannerite\u2019s Motion to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Tannerite also complains that the district court improperly denied its motion to amend, and that granting the motion would have allowed Tannerite to plead additional theories of defamation;</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">A. Tannerite\u2019s Motion Below</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Tannerite\u2019s motion appeared in the last sentence of its brief in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. It reads, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">If the Court is inclined to grant NBC\u2019s motion, then Tannerite Sports respectfully seeks leave to file an amended complaint to correct any defects identified by the Court[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">App\u2019x at 193. The motion thus identified no particular facts that would be introduced into an amended complaint. The district court denied this request, ruling that, \u201c[b]ased on Tannerite\u2019s failure to ... present-proof of falsity with respect to [NBC\u2019s] statements ..., it would be futile to permit Tannerite to further amend its Complaint.\u201d <em>Tannerite Sports, </em>135 F.Supp.3d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u201cProposed amendments are futile,\u201d and thus must be denied, \u201cif they would fail to cure prior deficiencies or to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Thea v. Kleinhandler, </em>807 F.3d 492, 496-97 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, Tannerite simply stated that an amendment would \u201ccorrect any defects identified by the Court.\u201d App\u2019x at 193. That request made no specific argument as to how an amended complaint would \u201ccure prior deficiencies\u201d or pass muster under Rule 12(b)(6). It was properly denied as futile,'</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">B. Tannerite\u2019s Proposals for Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Tannerite argues that it could have amended its complaint to allege that NBC made false claims regarding its connections to terrorists, to allege that NBC falsely claimed that its targets were \u201cflammable,\u201d to add a product disparagement claim, and to include \u201cfurther emphasis on certain aspects of the video to create a more rigorous showing of defamation by implication,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 41; Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 29-31. In Tannerite\u2019s view, these amendments would have cured the legal deficiencies identified by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">We reject Tannerite\u2019s proposed amendments, all of which are newly raised on appeal. \u201cIt is a, well-established general rule that an appellate court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Bogle-Assegai v. Connecticut, </em>470 F.3d 498, 504 (2d Cir. 2006) (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Greene v. United States, </em>13 F.3d 577, 586 (2d Cir. 1994)). Although \u201cwe have discretion to consider [such] arguments ... the circumstances normally do not militate in favor of an exercise of discretion\u201d to do so \u201cwhere those arguments were available to the parties b\u00e9low and they proffer no reason for their failure to raise the arguments below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, citations, arid brackets omitted). None of Tan-nerite\u2019s new theories of liability were put before the district court in the brief motion to amend. Nor did Tannerite offer the district court a full account of its plans to amend by moving to alter or amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, which would have allowed the district court to \u201ctake into account the nature of the proposed amendment in deciding whether to vacate the previously entered judgment.\u201d <em>Nat'l Petrochem. Co. of Iran v. M/T Stolt Sheaf, </em>930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991). Tannerite provides no good reason for its failure to have requested below the relief it now seeks here, particularly given that the new arguments rely only on facts that Tannerite knew when the operative complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-2\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">We have reviewed Tannerite\u2019s other arguments and have determined that they are meritless. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">. \"IED\u201d stands for \"improvised explosive device.\" <em>IED, </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (2017).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\">. Tannerite also sued one of NBC\u2019s affiliates, but that party\u2019s dismissal from the suit is not appealed, and the allegations against the affiliate are not relevant to the case against NBC,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b267-5\">. Traditional New York law appears to have applied a similar, but not identical, rule. There was no requirement that falsity be alleged in the complaint. <em>See </em>Ernest P. Seelman, The Law of Libel and Slander in the State of New York \u00a7 392 (1964 ed.); <em>see also Gutkes v. N.Y. Produce Exch., </em>46 Misc. 133, 93 N.Y.S. 254, 256 (Sup. Ct. 1905); <em>Hunt v. Bennett, </em>19 N.Y. 173, 176 (1859). Although truth was an absolute defense to defamation, <em>see Stuart v. Press Pub. Co., </em>83 A.D. 467, 82 N.Y.S. 401, 409 (1st Dep\u2019t 1903), a statement claimed to be defamatory would be \"presume[d] ... to be false,\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>19 N.Y. at 176, and it was the defendant's burden to rebut the presumption of falsity. <em>See Rinaldi v. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, Inc., </em>42 N.Y.2d 369, 379-80, 397 N.Y.S.2d 943, 366 N.E.2d 1299 (1977) (\u201cAt common law, the libelous statement was presumed to be false and the defendant carried the burden of pleading and proving, in defense, that the statement was true.\u201d). Additionally, malice\u2014an element of defamation\u2014was often supported by the presumption that a statement was false; a defendant\u2019s proof of a statement\u2019s truth could thus also defeat a defamation claim by showing that malice was lacking. <em>See Root v. King, 7 </em>Cow. 613, 625 (N.Y. 1827) (\"It is the settled law of this state, that, to support an action [for defamation], malice is essential; and whether there is malice in the publication, belongs to the jury to decide as matter of fact.... But how is malice to be proved? In few cases will it be declared. It must be inferred from the libellous nature of the publication, and (unless in certain excepted cases) falsehood, added to the character of the publication, must be considered, <em>prima facie, </em>evidence of malice.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b268-5\">. Even if falsity were not an element of a New York defamation claim, Tannerite would likely be required to plead it in this case. In <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, </em>the United States Supreme Court held, based on First Amendment principles, that \u201cwhere a newspaper publishes speech of public concern, a private-figure plaintiff cannot recover damages without also showing that the statements at issue are false.\" 475 U.S. 767, 768-69, 106 S.Ct. 1558, 89 L.Ed.2d 783 (1986). NBC\u2019s report, appears to have discussed a matter of public concern inasmuch as it profiled a product it viewed as dangerous to the public and considered the government\u2019s efforts to regulate the product. The broadcast featured an interview with a sitting United States Senator and discussion of actions taken by federal agencies, It also provided Tan-nerite an opportunity to weigh in on the debate, which it did by asserting that \"only girly-men\u201d would seek to increase regulation of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Although the Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled that falsity must be alleged in a defamation <em>complaint </em>to comport with <em>Hepps, </em>it is difficult to see how the rule could be otherwise. A complaint must \"contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). If a plaintiff must ultimately show falsity to win, a defamation claim described in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint would not be \"plausible\u201d absent an allegation that the defendant\u2019s statements were false. In other words, \u201c[a] defamation case does not \u2022putter along as a state law case in its earliest stages, only to suddenly acquire First Amendment implications upon the tender of an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Hatfill v. New York Times Co., </em>427 F.3d 253, 254-55 (4th Cir. 2005) (Wilkinson, <em>J., </em>dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"aia-dedup-0\">Indeed, it appears that New York courts have recognized falsity as a necessary element in all defamation actions at least partly in response to First Amendment cases such as <em>Hepps </em>and <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), <em>See Rinaldi, </em>42 N.Y.2d at 380, 397 N.Y.S.2d 943, 366 N.E.2d 1299 (\"Although there has been doubt, the burden is now on the libel plaintiff to establish the falsity of the libel. This requirement follows naturally from the actual malice standard [articulated in <em>Sullivan </em>for cases brought by public-figure plaintiffs].\u201d); <em>Immuno AG. v. Moor-Jankowski, </em>77 N.Y.2d 235, 245, 566 N.Y.S.2d 906, 567 N.E.2d 1270 (1991) (citing Hepps, among other sources, for the proposition that \"a libel plaintiff has the burden of showing .,. falsity\u201d). Evidently, such an evolution in state law has not been atypical, although it is unclear at this stage that Supreme Court precedent requires falsity as an element in all cases. <em>See </em>Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden &amp; Ellen M. Bublick, The Law of Torts \u00a7 519 (2d ed. 2016) (\u201cThese added elements[, including falsity,] came about as courts attempted to integrate federal Constitutional rules of free-speech into the common law of libel.... A later Supreme Court decision, however, suggests that the Constitution does not require these added elements where the defendant defames a purely private person on. an issue that is not of public concern. Nevertheless, states apparently continue to state these added elements of proof for all cases, not merely those involving public figures or issues of public concern.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\">. It is also noteworthy that the court in <em>Garcia </em>cited no authority suggesting that truth or substantial truth must always be presented as an affirmative defense. The court did, however, cite significant authority demonstrating that <em>privilege, </em>another argument raised by the defendants in that case, must be a defense. <em>See Garcia, </em>793 N.Y.S.2d at 384.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b271-12\">. The test is one of legal sufficiency, not journalistic competence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\">. Certain items on Tannerite\u2019s list, including firecrackers,\u2019 could perhaps qualify as \"bombs,\u201d given that they are created with explosion (or at least ignition) in mind. As for Champagne, the pop is incidental rather than intentional, .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\">. New York state law requires that, \u201c[i]n an action for libel or slander, the <em>particular </em>words complained of shall be set forth in the complaint,\u201d <em>Nowak v. EGW Home Care, Inc., </em>82 F.Supp.2d 101, 113 (W.D.N.Y. 2000) (emphasis added) (quoting N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 3016(a)). Although federal pleading standards, not state standards, govern this matter, <em>see Kelly, </em>806 F.2d at 46, the strictness of New York\u2019s law reflects the importance of giving defendants notice of why any alleged statements were defamatory. Similarly, we note that stricter rules for defamation pleading prevailed under earlier pleading regimes, <em>see, e.g., Foltz v. Moore McCormack Lines, Inc., </em>189 F.2d 537, 539 (2d Cir. 1951), and although we do not suggest a return to those standards, they underline the importance of receiving proper notice of a defamation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
