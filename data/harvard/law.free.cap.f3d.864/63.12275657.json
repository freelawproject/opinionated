CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b90-24\">This case\u2014the first criminal appeal related to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) to reach this (or any) Court of Appeals\u2014presents the question, among others, whether testimony given by an individual involuntarily under the legal compulsion of a foreign power may be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>against that individual in a criminal case in an American court. As employees in the London office of Co\u00f3peratieve C\u00e9ntrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. (\u201cRabo-bank\u201d) in the 2000s, defendants-appellants Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti (\u201cDefendants\u201d) played roles in that bank\u2019s LIBOR submission process during the now-well-documented heyday of the rate\u2019s manipulation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Allen and Conti were, for unrelated reasons, no longer employed at Rabobank by 2008 and 2009, respectively. By 2013, they were among the persons being investigated by enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) and the United States for their roles in setting LIBOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The U.K. enforcement agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> interviewed Allen and Conti (each a U.K. citizen and resident) that year, along with several of their coworkers. At these interviews, Allen and Conti were compelled to testify and given \u201cdirect use\u201d\u2014but not \u201cderivative use\u201d\u2014immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In accordance with U.K. law, refusal to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>could result in imprisonment. The FCA subsequently decided to initiate an enforcement action against one of Defendants\u2019 coworkers, Paul Robson, and, following its normal procedures, the FCA disclosed to Robson the relevant evidence against him, including the compelled testimony of Allen and Conti. Robson closely reviewed that testimony, annotating it and taking several pages of handwritten notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">For reasons not apparent in the record, the FCA shortly thereafter dropped its case against Robson, and the Fraud Section of the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) promptly took it up.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Robson soon pleaded guilty and became an important cooperator, substantially assisting the DOJ with developing its case. Ultimately, Robson was the sole source of certain material information supplied to the grand jury that indicted Allen and Conti and, after being called as a trial witness by the Government, Robson provided significant testimony to the petit jury that convicted Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In October 2014, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Defendants with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349, as well as several counts of wire fraud, in violation 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following a trial held in October 2015 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Jed S. Rakoff, <em>Judge), </em>a jury convicted on all counts. The District Court sentenced Allen principally to two years\u2019 imprisonment and Conti to a year-and-a-da/s imprisonment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Agreeing that Defendants had raised a \u201csubstantial issue\u201d for appeal, the District Court granted bail pending appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">In their appeal, Allen and Conti challenge their convictions on several grounds. We address only their Fifth Amendment challenge, however, and conclude as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">First, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on the use of compelled testimony in American criminal proceedings applies even when a foreign sovereign has compelled the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Second, when the government makes use of a witness who has had substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>exposure to defendant\u2019s compelled testimony, it is required under <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), to prove, at a minimum, that the witness\u2019s review of the compelled testimony did not shape, alter, or affect the evidence used by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Third, a bare, generalized denial of taint from a witness who has materially altered his or her testimony after being substantially exposed to a defendant\u2019s compelled testimony is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Fourth, in this prosecution, Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony was \u201cused\u201d against them, and this impermissible use before the petit and grand juries was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Accordingly, We REVERSE: the judgments of conviction and hereby DISMISS the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">A. LIBOR</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Some journalists and bankers have called LIBOR the world\u2019s most important number.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is a \u201cbenchmark\u201d and \u201creference\u201d interest rate meant to reflect the available borrowing rates on any given day in the \u201cinterbank market\u201d\u2014-in which banks borrow money from other banks. The so-called LIBOR fixed rates, as published daily, are regularly incorporated into the terms of financial transactions entered into across the globe, and the overall value of these LIBOR-tied transactions reaches (measured in U.S. dollars) into th\u00e9 hundreds of trillions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Throughout the time period relevant to this case, LIBOR rates were administered by a private trade group, the British Bankers\u2019 Association (\u201cBBA\u201d). As summarized by a New York Federal Reserve staff report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>LIBOR\u2019s origination has been credited to a Greek banker by the name of Minos Zombanakis, who in 1969 arranged an $80 million syndicated loan from Manufacturer\u2019s Hanover to the Shah of Iran based on the reported funding costs of a set of reference banks. In addition to providing loans at rates tied to LIBOR, banks whose submissions determined the fixing had also begun to borrow heavily using LIBOR-based contracts by the mid-1980s, creating an incentive to underreport funding costs. As a result, the [BBA] took control of the rate in 1986 to formalize the data collection and governance process. InHhat year, LIBOR fixings were calculated for the U.S. dollar, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. Over time, the inclusion of additional currencies and integration of existing ones into the euro left the BBA with oversight of fixings over ten currencies as of 2012.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">During that period of time, there was no direct governmental regulation of LIBOR submissions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">For each of the world\u2019s major currencies, the BBA assembled a panel of banks\u2014typically established institutions that were active in the interbank market in that currency and had a large presence in London. The LIBOR panels for the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) and Japanese Yen (\u201cJPY\u201d) consisted of 16 banks, including Rabobank, a Dutch bank.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As explained below, these panel banks submitted the figures that the BBA used to calculate a currency\u2019s official LIBOR rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">According to the LIBOR \u201cdefinition\u201d on the BBA\u2019s website during the relevant time period, each panel bank, every day at around 11 a.m. London time, was to \u201ccontribute the rate at which it could borrow funds, were it to do so by asking for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>then accepting inter-bank offers in reasonable market size just prior to 1100.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Each panel bank typically designated a particular employee to be principally responsible for submitting that bank\u2019s LIBOR contributions generally or for a particular currency or set of currencies. That employee, a so-called LIBOR submitter, would submit multiple rates within each currency that varied based on the hypothetical loan\u2019s \u201ctenor,\u201d or duration (pursuant to the basic proposition that the interest rate of a loan will vary based, among other things, on the loan\u2019s duration). There were fifteen tenors ranging from overnight to one <em>year\u2014e.g., </em>one month (or \u201c1M\u201d), three months (or \u201c3M\u201d), and so forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">After receiving submissions from each panel bank, the BBA would, within each tenor of each currency, sort the submissions from lowest to highest, disregard the lower and upper quartiles, and average the remaining submissions. The resulting number became the LIBOR fixed rate and was released to the public daily (through Thomson Reuters, acting as the BBA\u2019s agent).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, for sixteen-bank panels like the USD and the JPY panels, each day, and with respect to each tenor, the BBA would disregard the highest four and lowest four submissions from the panel, and then average the remaining eight submissions to produce that day\u2019s LIBOR fixed rate in each tenor of USD and JPY\u2014 <em>e.g., </em>the 1M USD LIBOR rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">As noted, LIBOR fixed rates, as published every day shortly after 11 a.m. London time, are incorporated into the terms of financial transactions\u2014such as so-called \u201cinterest rate swaps\u201d\u2014throughout the world.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> An interest rate swap, to take one example of a LIBOR-based financial instrument, is an agreement between two parties in which one agrees to pay a fixed interest rate on some agreed-upon notional amount, while the other party agrees to pay a floating rate (usually tied to the LIBOR) on that same amount. The two sides agree to exchange payments on agreed-upon dates over the course of an agreed-upon time period. The date on which the floating rate is set (or reset) is often called the \u201cfixing\u201d or \u201cfixing date.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the floating rate references LIBOR, the relevant LIBOR rate on a fixing date determines how much or how little that party pays. Put simply, one party bets that interest rates (using LIBOR as the reference) will increase, and the other bets that interests rates (again, based on LIBOR) will decrease.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>In effect, and in short, money changes hands as LIBOR rates change. And the panel banks, the joint controllers of LI-BOR rates, themselves entered and were parties to large-volume LIBOR-tied transactions as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">B. LIBOR Submissions, and Their Manipulation, at Rabobank</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">As relevant here, Rabobank was a contributor panel bank for USD LIBOR and JPY LIBOR. Allen joined Rabobank in 1998 as a cash trader and was the bank\u2019s USD LIBOR submitter until 2005, when he became Rabobank\u2019s Global Head of Liquidity and Finance. In that new role, which he held until being laid off when Rabobank closed its London branch in late 2008, he was responsible for supervising other cash traders. One of those cash traders was Conti, who assumed primary responsibility for USD LIBOR submissions starting in 2005 and continuing through 2009, when he quit shortly after his job was moved to Utrecht.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Another cash trader, Paul Robson (whose testimony is central to the issue before us), was primarily responsible for Rabobank\u2019s JPY LI-BOR submissions during the relevant time period. Others, including Allen himself, would sometimes submit USD LIBOR rates or JPY LIBOR rates when Conti or Robson were unavailable. According to the \u201cFinal Notice\u201d issued to Rabobank by the FCA. for its LIBOR-related misconduct, \u201cRabobank did not explicitly have a policy in place to. address LIBOR submissions procedures until 30 March 2011, and certain LIBOR-related compliance risks were not addressed until August 2012.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">In addition to LIBOR submitters, Rabo-bank also, employed derivatives traders who would regularly enter into interest rate swap. agreements. It was a routine practice of these derivatives traders to submit requests to Conti and Robson (or, at times, their stand-ins) for higher or lower LIBOR submissions. The Govem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ment\u2019s theory of the case was that these trader requests were dictated by the traders\u2019 (and thus Rabobank\u2019s) interest in having LIBOR be higher or lower on particular dates based on the transactions that the trader had entered or positions they held. Allen and Conti, the Government alleged, honored those requests in lieu of making good-faith estimates of Rabo-bank\u2019s projected borrowing rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">One USD derivatives trader, Lee Stewart (nicknamed the \u201cAmbassador\u201d), sat in the same line of desks at Rabobank\u2019s London office as did Allen and the cash traders\u2014including Conti, the principal USD LIBOR submitter. Stewart testified at trial that he offered LIBOR requests, \u201cout loud,\u201d \u201cin front of everyone,\u201d and never used \u201ccode\u201d or \u201ctr[ied] to hide what [he] was talking about.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Robson testified that every morning before 11 a.m,, Conti led, and Allen participated in, a \u201cgather[ing]\u201d and \u201cdiscussion]\u201d of the best way to influence LIBOR, prefaced by the shout, \u201cright, LIBOR times[!]\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">By contrast, those derivatives traders located in other offices, like USD derivatives trader Christian Schluep (located in New York) or JPY derivatives trader Ta-kayuki Yagami (located in Tokyo), would more often submit their LIBOR requests in writing. Thus there are numerous arguably incriminating written exchanges between the latter traders and the LIBOR submitters. Schluep and Conti had several exchanges regarding the setting of USD LIBOR<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>\u2014for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">\u2022 On July 17, 2006, Schluep asked Conti, \u201cIF ANY CHANCE, A HIGH 3MTH TODAY PL!\u201d Conti replied, \u201c[o]k matey ... high one today.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">\u2022 On October 31, 2006, Schluep sent Conti a message discussing market activity and then stated, \u201cSMALL FAVOUR AS USUAL, LOW 2S HIGH 3S IF POSSIBLE MATEY,\u201d meaning he wanted a low two-month LIBOR and a high three-month LI-BOR. Conti responded to the earlier parts of Schluep\u2019s message and added, \u201c[w]ill do matey on the libors.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-15\">\u2022 On August 13, 2007, Schluep sent a message to Conti, requesting \u201cHIGH 3S AND 6S PLS TODAY MATE (ESP 6MNTHS\u00dc) IF U WOULD BE .SO KIND .. [sic] GOTTA MAKE '.MONEY SOMEHOW!\u201d Conti responded simply, \u201ccool,\u201d to which Schluep replied, \u201cCHEERS TC.. [sic] EVERY LITTLE HELPS!\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">Schluep also had exchanges with Allen<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>\u2014 for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-19\">\u2022 Op October 6, 2006, Schluep sent a message to Allen .stating, \u201cHELLO SKIPPER, CAN U PUT 3S AT 37 FOR ME TOMORROW PLS... MANY THANKS.\u201d Allen replied, \u201cNEVER IN DOUBT!\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-20\">\u2022 On November 29, 20\u00d36, Schluep sent a message to Allen asking for a \u201cLOW IS HIGH 3S tlBOR PLS!!!\u201d Allen replied \u201cOK MATE, WILL DO MY BEST ... SPEAK LATER.\u201d Schluep later thanked Allen, because the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>missions were \u201cBANG ON THE MONEY!\u201d Allen replied, \u201cNO WORRIES\u201d and joked that he \u201cHAD TO WORK MY WAY OUT OF AN AM-BASS HEADLOCK TO GET THOSE IN!\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">\u2022 On December 1, 2006, Schluep sent a message to Allen stating, \u201cAPPRECIATE 3S GO DOWN, BUT A HIGH 3S TODAY WOULD BE NICE.\u201d Allen responded, \u201cI AM FAST TURNING INTO YOUR LIBOR BITCH!!!!\u201d Schluep replied, \u201cJUST FRIENDLY ENCOURAGEMENT THAT\u2019S ALL, APPRECIATE THE HELP\u201d Allen replied, \u201cNO WORRIES MATE, GLAD TO HELP[.]\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">There were similar, if perhaps more explicit and thus arguably more incriminating, exchanges between Yagami and Robson regarding the setting of JPY LIBOR\u2014for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">\u2022 On September 21, 2007, Robson told Yagami that market information supported a submission of 0.85 for the one-month JPY LIBOR. Yagami asked for a higher rate, specifically 0.90. Robson agreed, even though he would \u201cprobably get a few phone calls,\u201d telling Yagami that there were \u201cbigger crooks in the market than us guys!\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\u2022 On March 19, 2008, Yagami told Robson \u201c[w]e have loads of 6mth fixings today\u201d and\u2014conveying a request from another trader\u2014asked Robson to submit 1.10 for the six-month yen LI-BOR. Robson responded that market information supported a 1.03 submission for the six-month LIBOR but that he would submit 1.10 as asked, even though it would likely prompt \u201ca phone call.\u201d Robson added that it \u201cwill be quite funny to see the reaction\u201d to his submission at Yagami\u2019s requested rate.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">Whether Allen and Conti did, in fact, accommodate trader requests by adjusting their LIBOR submissions was an issue that Defendants contested at trial. Although Allen and Conti claim they ignored the trader requests, the Government presented evidence at trial purporting to show that these trader requests were accommodated. For instance, on August 13, 2007, Schleup e-mailed Conti and said: GONNA NEED A FRICKIN HIGH 6 MTH FIX TOMORROW IF OK WITH U ... 5.42?\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The next day, Schluep sent a reminder and Allen informed another trader that the six-month LIBOR submission would be 5.42 because \u201ci think thats [sic] what [C]hristian [Schluep] needs.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Rabobank submission for six-month USD LIBOR that day was 5.42.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">To be clear, Defendants did not argue at trial that it was <em>permissible </em>to accommodate such requests. Allen and Conti agreed with the Government that making submissions based on the interests of Rabobank\u2019s traders was not permitted.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> And Defendants and the Government further agreed\u2014putting aside whether, in the end, Allen and Conti honored or ignored trader requests\u2014that the process for submitting LIBOR involved collecting \u201cmarket infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>mation\u201d in the morning, typically from brokers who would canvass the rates that might be on offer in the market. There was further agreement that, as \u201cestimates,\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> LIBOR submissions were necessarily imprecise even when there was decent market information, such that, at any given time, there existed a \u201crange\u201d of reasonable LIBOR submissions.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This imprecision was exacerbated during periods of illiquidity in the interbank market, such as the financial crisis in 2007-2008. In a September 26, 2008 phone call, for example, the BBA\u2019s LIBOR Manager, John Ewan, told Allen that LIBOR is \u201cjust a line in the sand. What\u2019s it based on? Nothing.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> At the same time, however, the Government presented evidence that Defendants understood that it was improper to take Rabo-bank\u2019s traders\u2019 interests into account in determining their submissions, and that their proper role was to give an honest estimate of Rabobank\u2019s borrowing costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Where Defendants and the Government parted ways on the facts was whether the traders\u2019 requests were honored. While Conti did not take the stand at trial, Allen testified that he never actually accommodated such requests.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> On direct examination by the Government, by contrast, Robson\u2014Rabobank\u2019s JPY LIBOR submitter\u2014 explained that LIBOR\u2019s lack of precision allowed him to accommodate trader requests without raising eyebrows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">[Robson]. I would ask the broker where he felt the LIBORs would be. They would then give us\u2014for example, three months they would give us a number of submissions or possible rates where the three months could be depending on credit rates and stuff like that. So there would be kind of a range of two or three numbers where LIBOR could possibly be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">Q. Before I ask about trader positions, let\u2019s say no trader request was made. What would you do with that information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">[Robson]. I would go straight down the middle as much as I could. So, for example, if the broker came on and said, three months I think I\u2019m hearing might be 80, might be 85, might be 90, but probably 75, I would go down the middle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">Q. Now, let\u2019s say you, in fact, had a trader request where a trader wanted you to submit a LIBOR to favor their position. What would you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">[Robson]. So given those circumstances, if one of the traders had contacted and said three months, if I needed a higher three months, I would have moved it higher at his request. I would have moved it towards the 90 level or set 90.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">Q. Was that permissible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-15\">[Robson]. No, it wasn\u2019t.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">Moreover, Robson proffered to the Government that Conti likewise accommodated trading positions when making LIBOR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>submissions.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> And Robson was the sole source of trial and grand jury testimony that Allen specifically directed and instructed others in this scheme.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The scheme was established by May 2006 and continued through early 2011; as noted previously, however, Allen and Conti left Rabobank in 2008 and 2009, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">C. Investigation and Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">By 2013, the British and American authorities had commenced LIBOR-related investigations into Rabobank and other institutions. As part of their investigations, the U.K FCA and the U.S. DOJ began conducting interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The FCA\u2019s interviews were compulsory; they were conducted under a grant of direct (but not derivative) use immunity,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and a witness\u2019s failure to testify under such terms could result in imprisonment.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In order to avoid potential problems under <em>Kastigar, </em>the DOJ took care to conduct their interviews wholly independently of the FCA\u2019s interviews and their fruits. Specifically, the FCA agreed to procedures to maintain a \u201cwall\u201d between its investigation and the DOJ\u2019s investigation, including a \u201cday one/day two\u201d interview procedure in which the DOJ interviewed witnesses prior to the FCA. In accordance with that protocol, the FCA interviewed Robson (on January 17, 2013), Conti (on January 25, 2013), and Allen (on June 20 and 21, 2013), among others. Robson, in his compelled testimony to the FCA, denied any improper conduct at Rabobank.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">In November 2013,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the FCA initiated an enforcement action against Robson and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>following its normal procedure, disclosed to Robson the relevant evidence against him, including the compelled testimony of Allen and Conti. Robson\u2019s attorney instructed him to review the materials sent by the FCA in preparation for a meeting between Robson and his attorney. Robson \u201creviewed the materials over the course' of two to three successive or nearly successive days sometime in or about November and/or December of 2013.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> During this review, Robson underlined, annotated, and circled certain passages of both Allen\u2019s and Conti\u2019s compelled testimony.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Robson also took roughly five pages of handwritten notes. Before Robson had the chance to discuss this material with his attorney, however, the FCA stayed its regulatory proceeding in favor of a criminal prosecution of Robson by the DOJ. On instruction from his lawyer, Robson placed the FCA materials in a box, put them in his attic, and did not review them further.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">On April 28, 2014, a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York returned an indictment charging Robson (Rabobank\u2019s JPY submitter)' and two JPY derivatives traders, Paul Thompson and Tetsuya Mo-tomura, -with, <em>inter alia, </em>wire fraud. The Government had not requested that the grand .jury indict Conti or Allen.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aic\">In mid-July 2014, the DOJ first interviewed Robson at a so-called proffer session.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> On August 5, 2014, Robson signed a cooperation agreement and shortly thereafter pleaded guilty. At Robson\u2019s plea hearing, the prosecutor informed the District Court that \u201cthere is ... a chance that we would seek a superseding indictment in light of information that has come to light from our two cooperators\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>that there was \u201ca distinct possibility\u201d the new indictment would \u201cinvolve[ ] other individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">So it did. On October 16,2014, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging two new individuals\u2014Allen and Conti\u2014with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud as well as several counts of wire fraud. It is not disputed that the Government\u2019s presentation of evidence to the grand jury that indicted Defendants relied on evidence that Robson had provided.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> While Robson did not himself testify, the new information he gave was relayed to the grand jury through FBI Special Agent Jeffrey Weeks, who did testify.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> And Weeks\u2019s testimony to the grand jury on certain matters derived exclusively from Robson.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In particular, Robson was the only source for Weeks\u2019s testimony that Allen \u201cinstructed, specifically instructed, LIBOR submitters in London to consider the positions and the requests of Rabobank traders and adjust their submissions for LIBOR and various currencies based on the means of those traders,\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and that \u201cMr. Robson said that sitting near Mr. Conti he was aware that Mr. Conti set U.S. dollar LI-BOR rates in which he considered his own positions as appropriate reason or justification for setting the rates.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">D. Trial and Post-Trial <em>Kastigar </em>Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">Allen and Conti each waived his right to contest extradition from the U.K. and appeared voluntarily. Prior to trial, they moved under <em>Kastigar </em>to dismiss the indictment or suppress Robson\u2019s testimony, but the District Court opted to address any <em>Kastigar </em>issues after trial \u201cin accordance with prevailing practice in the Second Circuit.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Trial thus commenced on October 14,2015, and lasted approximately three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">At trial, the Government\u2019s case-in-chief consisted of documentary evidence <em>(e.g., </em>emails, \u201cinstant chats,\u201d and phone calls involving Allen, Conti, or their alleged co-conspirators) and testimony from eight witnesses, including three eooperators: Stewart, Yagami, and Robson.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In addition to cross-examination of the Government\u2019s witnesses, Allen and Conti each offered an expert witness,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and Allen testified in his own defense. On November 5, 2015, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts (nineteen counts, in total, for Allen and nine for Conti).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Defendants\u2019 <em>Kastigar </em>challenge remained pending, however.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Beginning on December 16, 2015, the District Court held a two-day hearing on <em>Kastigar </em>issues at which Robson and Agent Weeks testified. During this hearing it came to light that Robson had not only read but also marked up, and drafted notes regarding, Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony, and that material parts of Agent Weeks\u2019s testimony to the grand jury derived solely from Robson.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Following subsequent <em>Kastigar </em>briefing from the parties, the District Court denied Defendants\u2019 motion by written opinion. The District Court held that, assuming <em>Kastigar </em>applies to testimony compelled by a .foreign power, there had been no <em>Kastigar </em>violation.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In its ruling, the District Court explicitly declined to apply case law of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\u201cD.C. Circuit\u201d) on the legal standards applicable when a government witness has previously reviewed a defendant\u2019s compelled testimony.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Looking to Second Circuit precedent, the District Court concluded that Robson\u2019s review of Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony did not taint the evidence he later provided, because the Government had shown an independent source for such evidence, \u201cto wit, [Robson\u2019s] personal experience and observations.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Although Defendants raise a number of substantial issues on appeal, we reach only their <em>Kastigar </em>challenge. Defendants contend that the Government violated their Fifth Amendment rights when it used\u2014in the form of tainted evidence from Robson\u2014their own compelled testimony against them. Specifically, they argue that the District Court applied the wrong legal standard in assessing whether the evidence provided by Robson was tainted by his review of their compelled testimony. They also assert that, properly assessed, the Government cannot meet its burden of showing that' Robson\u2019s evidence was <em>not </em>tainted, and that the prosecution\u2019s use of tainted evidence from Robson was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">The Government takes a different view. It submits, as a threshold argument, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>testimony compelled by a foreign sovereign and used in a U.S. criminal prosecution \u201cdo[es] not implicate the Fifth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> In -the - event that the Fifth Amendment does apply, the Government argues that the District Court employed the correct legal standard to determine, properly, that evidence provided by Robson was untainted. In the alternative; the Government argues that any use of tainted evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants prevail on each point.,</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">A. Applicability of the Fifth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In arguing that Fifth Amendment protections apply in this case, Defendants rely on our cases pertaining to foreign and cross-border law enforcement, which have consistently held that \u201cin order to be admitted in our courts, inculpatory statements obtained overseas by foreign officials must have been made voluntarily.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In so holding, we joined our sister circuits that have considered the issue.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Defendants contend that these cases are sufficient to resolve the present dispute regarding whether compulsion by a foreign power implicates the Fifth Amendment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">1. The Requirement of Voluntariness</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">The Supreme Court has \u201crecognized two constitutional bases for the requirement that a confession be voluntary to be admitted into evidence: the Fifth Amendment right \u2018 against self-incrimination and the D\u00fae Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Of these two potential \u201cconstitutional bases,\u201d our precedents applying such a requirement to confessions procured by foreign law enforcement have been grounded in the Self-Incrimination Clause and <em>Bram v. United States, </em>168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>U.S. 532, 18 S.Ct. 183, 42 L.Ed. 568 (1897).<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> This constitutional footing is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The freedom from self-incrimination guaranteed by ,the Fifth Amendment is a personal trial right of the accused in any American \u201ccriminal case.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> To that end, \u201ca violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s right against self-incrimination occurs <em>only </em>when <em>a </em>compelled statement is offered at trial against the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Whatever may occur prior to trial, the right not to testify against oneself <em>at trial </em>is \u201cabsolute.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Even a negative comment by a judge or prosecutor on a defendant\u2019s silence violates that defendant\u2019s constitutional right.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">These features of the Self-Incrimination Clause distinguish it from the exclusionary rules attached to unreasonable searches and seizures and to otherwise-valid confessions given without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As the Supreme Court has explained, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule \u201cis a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> So too with the exclusionary rule buttressing <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which \u201cwere primarily designed to prevent United States police officers from relying upon improper interrogation techniques.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Such exclusionary rules \u201chave little, if any, deterrent effect upon <em>foreign </em>police officers.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not apply the strictures of our Fourth Amendment and <em>Miranda </em>jurisprudence to foreign authorities.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The Supreme Court has taken care, however, to.distinguish extraterrito<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>rial applications of the Fourth Amendment from those of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The Fourth Amendment \u201cprohibits unreasonable searches and seizures <em>whether or not </em>the evidence is sought to be used in a criminal trial,\u201d such that \u201ca violation of the Amendment is fully accomplished at the time of an unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> By contrast, in the case of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause, \u201ca constitutional violation occurs <em>only at trial,\u201d </em>even if \u201cconduct by law enforcement officials prior to trial may ultimately impair that right.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> In light of that distinction, \u201cit naturally follows that, regardless of the <em>origin\u2014ie., </em>domestic or foreign\u2014of a statement, it cannot be admitted at trial in the United States if the statement was \u2018compelled.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Thus, the Self-Incrimination Clause\u2019s prohibition of the use of compelled testimony arises from the text of the Constitution itself, and directly addresses what happens in American courtrooms, in contrast to the exclusionary rules that are crafted as remedies to deter unconstitutional actions by officers in the field.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Its protections therefore apply in American courtrooms even when the defendant\u2019s testimony was compelled by foreign officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Moreover, for much the same reasons, the Clause applies in American courtrooms even where, as here, the defendant\u2019s testimony was compelled by foreign officials lawfully\u2014that is, pursuant to foreign legal process\u2014in a manner that does not shock the conscience or violate fundamental fairness. The Clause flatly prohibits the use of compelled testimony and is not based on any matter of misconduct or illegality on the part of the agency applying the compulsion..</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">In short, compelled testimony cannot be used to secure a conviction in an American court. This is so even when the testimony was compelled by a foreign government in full accordance with its own law.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">It is true that, with respect to statements taken abroad by foreign agents, we have often referred to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against illicit use as encompassing \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d rather than \u201ccompelled,\u201d statements. But this semantic distinction does not bear significant, much less dispositive, weight.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Accordingly,'we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>agree with Defendants that our cases applying a voluntariness test in the context of physical coercion extend to the present context of lawful compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">2. The Government\u2019s Counterarguments</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Government\u2019s three principal counterarguments are unpersuasive. The Government first questions the validity of our precedents on the basis of <em>Colorado v. </em>Connelly<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and subsequent cases involving foreign and cross-border law enforcement that have relied on <em>Connelly, </em>That case concerned a mentally ill defendant who sought out police and confessed to a murder. Despite the absence of any law enforcement misconduct, the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the suppression from evidence of Connelly\u2019s statements because they were \u201c \u2018involuntary\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, not \u201c \u2018the product of a rational intellect and a free will.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> In reversing, the Supreme Court held \u201cthat coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary1 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">We are not persuaded that <em>Connelly </em>requires reconsideration of our precedents. For one thing, <em>Connelly </em>is explicitly a Due Process Clause case, whereas the precedents we rely on today were grounded in the Self-Incrimination Clause\u2014which, by its terms, is an exclusionary rule grounded in the very text of the Constitution and designed to protect a defendant at trial.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> For another, <em>Connelly </em>did not concern cross-border investigations or foreign government conduct (and accordingly, the majority did not even mention <em>Bram).</em><footnotemark><em>89</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And the final reason we do not believe <em>Connelly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>renders our precedents invalid stems from an important acknowledgment the Government makes on appeal. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\">. Specifically, the' Government submits\u2014 in a footnote pregnant with meaning\u2014that \u201cthere may be some other constitutional doctrine apart from the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination that would require exclusion of a confession coerced by foreign officials, such as a due process violation based on conduct that \u2018shocks the judicial conscience,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> That could only be so, however, if the Due Process Clause applied in some degree to the conduct of foreign officials\u2014the very proposition that the Government otherwise contends <em>Con-nelly </em>rejected. By dangling a \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d test in this footnote, the Government implies that it takes issue not with <em>whether </em>confessions procured by foreign-officials can be excluded from American trials based on our Constitution, but with the <em>standard </em>our courts should apply in evaluating admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The Government\u2019s second counterargument extends from the premise that foreign governments are on the same footing as private employers when it comes to compelled testimony. In particular, the Government points to the fact that <em>private </em>employers may question an employee under threat of discharge without Fifth Amendment consequence,<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> whereas in certain circumstances courts have found that the same threat by an American <em>government </em>employer rendered an employee\u2019s testimony \u201ccompelled\u201d and excludable under the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> \u201cFor purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>of the Fifth Amendment,\u201d the Government submits, \u201cthe .British government is on the same footing as- a private entity such as the New York Stock Exchange.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Only sovereign power exposes \u201c \u2018those suspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Only the U.K. <em>government </em>could have immunized Defendants (neither of whom were employed by Rabobank at the time), compelling them to testify or go to jail. To the extent there may be an \u201cofficial/private action spectrum,\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> when foreign authorities compel testimony they are acting in the quintessence of their sovereign authority, not in their capacity \u00e1s a mere employer, and thus their compulsion is cognizable by the Fifth Amendment (when testimony so compelled is used in a U.S. trial), The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Garrity v. New </em>Jersey\u2014like <em>Con-</em>nelly\u2014does not foreclose constitutional review of a foreign sovereign\u2019s threats to deprive, an individual of his liberty. If our Constitution is to prohibit the- use. in American trials of confessions coerced or compelled by a foreign sovereign under <em>some </em>circumstances, as the Government suggests \u201cmay be\u201d the case, it cannot be the case that compulsion by a foreign authority <em>ipso facto </em>ends the constitutional inquiry.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> \u2022 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">Finally, the Government\u2019s third counterargument is that testimony is only \u201ccompelled\u201d for purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause if the compelling sovereign is bound by the Fifth Amendment. Here, too, we disagree. The Government\u2019s argument relies on the so-called \u201csame-sovereign\u201d principle, under which Fifth Amendment protections apply only if the same sovereign (or, at least, a Fifth\u2014 Amendmentr-bound sovereign) both compelled and used testimony.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> This \u201csame-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>sovereign\u201d principle has never been fully abandoned; it still applies, for example, where the- prosecuting sovereign is not bound by the Fifth Amendment <em>(i.e., </em>where the prosecuting authority is a foreign government).<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> But where, as here, the prosecuting sovereign <em>is </em>bound by the Fifth Amendment, the \u201csame-sovereign\u201d principle no longer has force. As already explained, it is now clear that the Fifth Amendment is a personal <em>trial </em>right\u2014one violated only at the time of \u201cuse\u201d rather than at the time of \u201ccompulsion.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Government\u2019s reliance on the \u201csame-sovereign\u201d principle in the circumstances of this case is unavailing.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>3. The Consequences of Our Holding</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The Government also asserts that a prohibition on its use in U.S. courts of testimony compelled by a foreign authority \u201ccould seriously hamper the prosecution of criminal conduct that crosses international borders.\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> In particular, the Government submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">A foreign government could inadvertently scuttle prosecutions in the U.S. by compelling testimony and then making the testimony available to potential witnesses or the public. Worse yet, a hostile government bent on frustrating prosecution of a defendant would have to do no more than compel [that defendant<footnotemark>102</footnotemark>] to testify and then publicize the substance of that testimony, unilaterally putting the United States to its heavy <em>Kastigar </em>burden.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The Government\u2019s first concern\u2014that foreign powers could inadvertently or negligently obstruct federal prosecutions\u2014 fails to account for the fact that this risk already exists within our own constitutional structure. In our system\u2014composed of \u201cState and National Governments,\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> with the latter government further divided into separate co-equal branches\u2014the DOJ does not control the granting or handling of witness immunity by the States or by the U.S. Congress.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> Similarly, and \u201c[f]or better or for worse, we live in a world of nation-states in which our Government must be able to \u2018function effectively in the company of sovereign nations.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">We are confident the Government is able to do so. Indeed, in a March 2016 address that specifically discussed the immunity issue in this case, Leslie Caldwell, then-Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1G\">as we and our [foreign] counterparts work together more frequently and better understand our respective systems, we are having ... conversations [about double jeopardy and Fifth Amendment protections] earlier, so that individuals are much less likely to be caught in the middle of last minute turf battles over where and by whom a prosecution should be brought.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">In the present case, the Government was plainly aware from the outset\u2014well before the FCA transmitted the Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony to Robson\u2014of the need for close coordination of its efforts with those of the U.K. authorities. The practical outcome of our holding today is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>risk of error in coordination falls on the U.S. Government (should it seek to prosecute foreign individuals), rather than on the subjects and targets of cross-border investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">As to the Government\u2019s concerns that a hostile foreign government. might hypothetically endeavor to sabotage U.S. prosecutions by immunizing a suspect and publicizing his or her testimony\u2014that, of course, is not this case.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> <em>This </em>case raises no questions regarding the legitimacy or regularity of the procedures employed by the U.K. government or the U.K, government\u2019s investigation more generally. We thus need only say, here that should U.S. prosecutors or judges face the situation suggested by the Government, our holding today would not necessarily prevent prosecution in the United States. That is true not only if the U.S. prosecution navigated any resulting <em>Kastigar </em>issues by meeting its burden or by not using exposed witnesses. It is true for another reason as well. Specifically, should the circumstances in a particular case indicate that .a foreign defendant had faced no real threat of sanctions by his foreign government for not testifying, then that defendant\u2019s testimony might well not be considered involuntary.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> In short, the situation hypothesized by the Government \u215b not before us today, and our resolution of this- case on the facts that are before u's leaves open the issue of foreign efforts to sabotage a U.S. prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">On the other hand, the Government nowhere responds to the troubling consequences of accepting its argument. As conceded' at oral argument, the Government's rule would remove any bar to introducing compelled testimony directly in U.S. prosecutions similar to this one\u2014as in, \u201cYour honor, we offer Government Exhibit 1, the defendant\u2019s compelled testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> To be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>sure, the Government did not introduce Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony directly and appears to have generally sought in good faith to respect the principles underlying the- Fifth Amendment. But it is well established .that a defendant\u2019s \"preserva-: tion of his rights\u201d does not turn \u201cupon the integrity and good faith of the prosecuting authorities.\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> We cannot entertain a rule that discards the most basic Fifth Amendment right simply because prosecutors can be expected to respect its objectives generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The concerns that we express here are not idle. However unusual this particular prosecution may prove to be, so-called cross-border prosecutions have become more common.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> Such prosecutions, necessarily entail intimate coordination between the United States and foreign authorities. As then-Assistant Attorney General Caldwell put it in the address to which we referred earlier, \u201c[cjollaboration and coordination among multiple regulators in cross-border matters is the future of major white collar criminal enforcement.\u2019.\u2019<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Perhaps the most striking development in cooperative conduct is the embedding of U.S. prosecutors in foreign law enforcement. According to Caldwell,, the DOJ \u201crecently placed Criminal Division prosecutors'with Eurojust in-The Hague and INTERPOL in France\u201d and was \u201cexploring the possibility .of- embedding prosecutors with other foreign law enforcement as well.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> In a more recent address, Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Trevor N. McFadden announced that DOJ will be detailing one of its anti-corruption prosecutors to work at the U.K. FCA\u2014\u201cthe first time the Criminal Division .,, will detail -a -prosecutor to work in a foreign regulatory agency on white collar crime issues.\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>One area <em>in </em>particular where intimate cooperation and coordination will be needed between U.S. prosecutors and foreign authorities (or, perhaps, between U.S. prosecutors and U.S. prosecutors on detail to foreign authorities) is the securing of witness testimony. As the Government explained in a letter to the District Court in this case, \u201clarge scale economic crime conspiracies that harm U.S. markets, such as LIBOR rigging and the manipulation of the foreign exchange spot; often occur, in large part, overseas and <em>successful prosecutions of these matters frequently rely on evidence provided by witnesses who live in foreign countries.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>116</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And as this case illustrates, foreign authorities may conduct compulsory witness interviews, including interviews of those who end up being\u2014or are already\u2014the targets of U.S. prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We do not presume to know exactly what this brave new world of international criminal enforcement will entail. Yet we are certain that these developments abroad need not affect the fairness of our trials at home.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> If as a consequence of joint investigations with foreign nations we are to hale foreign men and women into the courts of the United States to fend for their liberty we should not do so while denying them the full protection of a <em>\u201ctrial </em>right\u201d<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> we regard as \u201cfundamental\u201d<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> and \u201cabsolute.\u201d<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Accordingly, we adhere to our precedent in assessing the voluntariness of inculpato-ry testimony compelled abroad by foreign governments. In the instant appeal, there is no question that the Defendants\u2019 testimony was compelled and, thus, involuntary. We therefore conclude in this case that the Fifth Amendment prohibited the Government from using Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">B. Whether Defendants\u2019 Rights Were Violated</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">We thus turn to the parties\u2019 arguments under the doctrines of the Fifth Amendment and the seminal case of <em>Kastigar.</em><footnotemark><em>121</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself .... <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>122</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Like the privilege itself, the lawful compulsion of testimony under a grant of immunity has \u201chistorical roots deep in Anglo-American jurisprudence.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> In <em>Kastigar, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of compelling testimony in exchange for \u201cuse and derivative use\u201d immunity under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002, because the scope of the protection afforded was \u201ccoextensive with the scope of the [Fifth Amendment] privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Thus, the scope of the constitutional privilege and use and derivative use immunity are two sides of the same coin, and we therefore seek guidance from cases interpreting either.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In its holding, the <em>Kastigar </em>Court emphasized the breadth of use and derivative use protection. Such protection bars \u201cuse of compelled testimony, as well as evidence derived directly and indirectly therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> And it \u201cprohibits the prose-cutorial authorities from using the compelled testimony in <em>any </em>respect, ... therefore insuring] that the testimony cannot lead to the infliction of criminal penalties on the witness.\u201d<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> As the <em>Kastigar </em>Court observed, \u201c[t]his total prohibition on use provides a comprehensive safeguard, barring the use of compelled testimony as an investigatory lead, and also barring the use of any evidence obtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Because this \u201cvery substantial protection[] [is] commensurate with that resulting from invoking the privilege itself,\u201d it \u201cleaves the witness and the prosecutorial authorities in substantially the same position as if the witness had claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\"><em>Kastigar </em>also established a doctrine to enforce this protection. When a witness has been compelled to testify relating to matters for which he is later prosecuted, the government bears \u201cthe heavy burden of proving that all of the evidence it proposes to use was derived from legitimate independent sources.\u201d<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> This burden is \u201cnot limited to a negation of taint; rather, it imposes on the prosecution the affirmative duty to prove that the evidence it proposes to use is derived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>We interpreted the teaching of <em>Kastigar </em>a. mere four years after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhN\">[w]hile this formulation repeats rather than defines the word \u2018derived,\u2019 it places a significant gloss upon it by putting the burden firmly on the prosecution to demonstrate that an indictment [and/or conviction] is the product of legitimate rather than tainted evidence, and by insisting that legitimate evidence\" be from a source <em>wholly </em>independent of the compelled testimony.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In <em>United States v. Hubbell, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the government\u2019s attempt to shift this burden because doing so would \u201crepudiat[e] the basis for ... <em>Kastigar \u201d</em><footnotemark><em>132</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Government must prove it has met this heavy, albeit not insurmountable, burden by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">1. Was Evidence from Robson Tainted?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">With the . foregoing principles in mind, we consider whether any evidence from Robson used, in Defendants\u2019 prosecution was tainted. To be clear, there is no dispute that the Government \u201cused\u201d evidence from Robson: he was a key cooperator and a prominent trial witness. The less straightforward question is whether any evidence supplied by Robson-(to the government, to the grand jury, or at trial) was tainted by his earlier review of the testimony of Defendants compelled in the United Kingdom under U.K. law.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">Our Court apparently has never encountered the circumstance in which a government trial witness had, prior to testifying, reviewed a defendant\u2019s compelled testimony. The D.C. Circuit, - however, has addressed the applicable legal standards in a pair of high-profile cases arising out of the Iran-Contra affair.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> In those cases, that Court held that \u201cthe use of immunized testimony by witnesses to refresh their memories, or otherwise to focus their thoughts, organize their testimony, or alter their prior or contemporaneous statements, constitutes\u201d an impermissible use of the defendants\u2019 compelled testimony.<footnotemark>135</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">Despite briefing from both parties that cited the standards used by the D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Circuit, the 'District Court in this case relegated any mention of those precedents to a footnote that indicated that it would look only to Second Circuit precedent, of which there is none directly on point. As a result, it is unclear precisely what standards the District Court applied to determine whether the evidence supplied by Robson was tainted by his study of the Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony. What <em>is </em>clear, however, is that the District Court impermissibly lowered the bar when' it determined that'the'Government had satisfied its heavy <em>Kastigar </em>burden based on the mere fact that Robson himself asserted that his testimony was not tainted by his review of Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony and the fact that there was corroborating evidence .for Robson\u2019s trial testimony.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In apparent agreement with both parties on appeal,<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> we! conclude that the legal standards set forth by the D.C. Circuit in <em>North I </em>are helpful here. W\u00e9 need not, in this case, decide whether the Government is required to demonstrate that Robson\u2019s review of Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony did not in any manner subtly \u201crefresh his memory, focus or organize his thoughts,\u201d or in some other traceless way influence his state of mind. At a minimum, however, we agree-with the D.C. Circuit that the Government is required to prove that his exposure to the compelled testimony did not shape, alter, or affect the information that he provided and that the Government used.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The most effective way to demonstrate that a witness\u2019s testimony was untainted by exposure to a defendant\u2019s immunized testimony is by demonstrating that his or her testimony was unchanged from comparable testimony given before the exposure.. Thus, typically, the prosecution can meet its burden by memorializing (or \u201ccanning\u201d) the witness\u2019s testimony pri- or to his or her exposure.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">In the present case, Robson did testify to' the FCA regarding Rabobank\u2019s submission and alleged manipulation of LI-BOR rates, as well as the roles of Allen and Conti, <em>prior to </em>Robson\u2019s exposure to Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony. But what Robson\u2019s \u201ccanned\u201d testimony preserved is toxic to the Government\u2019s case; it omits or contradicts in material'parts the testimony Robson later provided indirectly to the grand jury and directly to the petit jury. At the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing held by the District Court, Robson agreed that \u201cthe testimony that [he] gave to the [FCA] and the testimony that [he] gave before the j,ury in this trial were very different.\u201d<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> For instance, Robson testified to the jury about an altercation between Stewart and Damon Robbins, an .alternate submitter for USD LIBOR, on Rabobank\u2019s London desk. But Robson did not testify about this to the FCA, and the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing raised questions about whether he had even seen the incident at all or merely read about it in the compelled testimony.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> Far from rebutting the presumption that Robson\u2019s trial testimony was tainted, his pre-exposure testimony actually <em>evidences </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>such taint through its material differences with Robson\u2019s post-exposure trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">As Robson\u2019s FCA testimony hurts rather than helps its cause, the Government appears to contend on appeal that it satisfied its burden solely through Robson\u2019s \u201c\u2018persuasivet]\u2019\u201d testimony at the <em>Kasti-gar </em>hearing.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that Robson\u2019s testimony at the hearing falls far short of satisfying the demands of <em>Kasti-gar. </em>As explained below, the Government adduced, at bottom, nothing more than bare, self-serving denials from Robson to meet its heavy burden. We hold that such conclusory denials are insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof under <em>Kastigar </em>in the face of materially inconsistent pre-exposure testimony.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">By the Government\u2019s own count, 27 of the 58 topics discussed by Robson during his trial testimony had an antecedent in Allen\u2019s compelled testimony, and 18 of those 58 topics had an antecedent in Con-ti\u2019s compelled testimony.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> Yet at no time during the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing did Robson claim that he could \u201csegregate the effects of his exposure\u201d with respect to each, or <em>any, </em>of those topics.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> Notably, the Government never asked Robson whether his memory was, or might have been, substantially refreshed by his review of Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony\u2014or, to put a finer point on the inquiry, whether Robson could testify under oath at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing that his memory had <em>not </em>been refreshed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Robson <em>was </em>asked by the Government several times in various generalized, leading ways whether his review of the compelled testimony \u201cinform[ed] ... in any way\u201d his cooperation or testimony and he responded, without qualification, \u201cno.\u201d<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> Despite Robson\u2019s unqualified assertions in response to those leading questions, we are mindful that memory remains \u201ca mysterious thing,\u201d<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> and its mysteries were on full display at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing in the District Court. Perhaps most mysterious was what, exactly, Robson remembered of the compelled testimony of Allen and Conti that he had reviewed. For instance, Robson was asked if he had \u201cany specific recollection of the materials that [he] had reviewed,\u201d and he answered \u201c[n]o, not specifically.\u201d<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> But sometimes Robson <em>did </em>have specific recollections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">Q. But when you read Mr. Conti\u2019s F[C]A transcript, you saw that he acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>edged that Lee Stewart made requests that were intended to benefit his derivative positions. Do you recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">A. Yes, I do.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Similarly, the Government asked Robson if he \u201clearn[ed] any new facts from reviewing those materials,\u201d to which he answered \u201c[n]o, I didn\u2019t.\u201d<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> But it later became apparent that he had learned, through reviewing the compelled testimony of Allen and Conti, of specific communications in which he had not been an original participant\u2014and that Robson had discussed such communications with the DOJ when he began cooperating.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> This particular inconsistency eventually led to the following colloquy between Robson and the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">THE COURT: I just want to be sure I am clear on the chronology. You reviewed [Allen\u2019s and Conti\u2019s FCA testimony] when?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">THE WITNESS: Towards the end of November 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">THE COURT: That was before you had begun cooperating with the government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">THE WITNESS: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">THE COURT: Some of the things you saw in this transcript were references to conversations that you had not been a party to yourself, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">THE WITNESS: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">THE COURT: And they were conversations that you did not know about until reading the transcripts, true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-14\">THE WITNESS: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-16\">THE COURT: So when you said, in answer to government counsel\u2019s question, that you were already familiar with various things, you weren\u2019t referring to these conversations, you were referring to some of the other things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-17\">THE WITNESS: Sorry, your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A18\">THE COURT: A few minutes ago you said that you hadn\u2019t underlined or circled things that you didn\u2019t already know, or words to that effect, if I remember correctly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-18\">THE WITNESS: I underlined and circled things that I believe were things that I knew from my personal experiences at Rabobank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-19\">THE COURT: But not the specific conversations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-20\">THE WITNESS: No, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-21\">THE COURT: Is it your testimony that you did not bring any of those conversations to the attention of the government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4h\">THE WITNESS: No, I didn\u2019t, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-22\">THE COURT: Now, you testified yesterday that in preparation for your testimony, the government, after you began cooperating, showed you some of the emails involving conversations between two third-parties that you were not a party to, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-23\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-24\">THE COURT: But you knew about them because you had seen references to them in the transcripts of Mr. Allen or Mr. Conti, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-25\">THE WITNESS: Some of them I had, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>THE COURT: When they showed them to you, did you say to the government, I have seen that before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">THE WITNESS: I don\u2019t recall, sir, -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amk\">THE COURT: Did you say, I haven\u2019t seen them before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">THE WITNESS: I think there were a couple I hadn\u2019t seen, which I might have mentioned I hadn\u2019t seen.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Even Robson\u2019s more generalized recollection of the transcripts appeared to wax and wane depending on the month (or even the day) in which he was asked. At one point during the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing, defense counsel directed Robson\u2019s attention to an August 5, 2015 declaration\u2014in which Robson had declared, \u201cI recall that I did not agree with or believe everything reflected in transcripts of Messrs. Allen and Conti \u201d<footnotemark>152</footnotemark>\u2014ancj the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Q. So did you recall when you signed this on August 5, 2015[,] not agreeing or believing with everything in Mr. Conti\u2019s transcript?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">Q. Do you recall <em>now </em>[on December 16, 2015,] not agreeing at the time that you read \u00a1the transcript with everything Mr. Conti said?.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-17\">A. I don\u2019t recall.\" Sorry.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">Adding another wrinkle, Robson would, during the next day of testimony at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing, explain his various purposes for annotating, underlining, or circling various passages of the compelled testimony of Allen and Conti, as including the \u201ccircl[ing of] anything that I felt was untrue.\u201d<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">Even putting aside such mnemonic curi-ositi\u00e9s, Robson\u2019s testimony at the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing with respect to his ability to \u201csegregate the effects of his exposure\u201d amounts to nothing more than simply replying \u201cno\u201d in a conclusory fashion to generalized leading questions from the Government.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> We have found the sorts of bare, self-serving denials given'by Robson, when given by a prosecutor (ie., an officer of the court), to be insufficient to satisfy the demands of Kastigar,<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> and the Government supplies no convincing reason why the same rule should not apply here.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> In light of the foregoing discussion, moreover, it seems clear to us that the same rule <em>should </em>apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that a bare, generalized denial of taint from a witness who has materially altered his testimony'after being substantially exposed to a defendant\u2019s compelled testimony is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof under <em>Kastigar </em>that that witness\u2019s testimony was derived from a wholly independent source.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">- In view of our holdings, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecution had met its heavy burden under <em>Kast-igar </em>to show that the evidence supplied'by Robson was untainted cannot stand. Moreover, a remand for a further factual hearing on the question of taint would be futile. For one thing, Robson was -again shown, and he again reviewed, critical portions of Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony during the Kastigar-hearing,<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> And what Robson did repeatedly claim at the hearing\u2014an inability to recall clearly much of anything\u2014establishes that he lacked the ability \u201cto separate the wheat of [his] unspoiled memory from the chaff of [Defendants\u2019] immunized testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Notably, the Government does not even request a remand on this question or otherwise suggest it has some plausible alternative means of sustaining its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In sum, the Government did not, and cannot, meet its burden under <em>Kastigar, </em>We therefore conclude that the Government\u2019s use of evidence provided by Robson violated the Defendants\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">2. Was the \u201cUse\u201d Harmless?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Even where a prosecution runs afoul of <em>Kastigar1 </em>s strict standards, we will not vacate or reverse a conviction where the error was harmless.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> We thus turn to whether the admission of Robson\u2019s tainted testimony constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">a. Use at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">When tainted evidence is presented at trial, we will deem the error harmless if we are \u201cpersuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have reached the same verdict even without consideration of the tainted evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>161</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">Upon review' of the' trial record, we have no trouble concluding that this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable'doubt. While two other cooperating witn\u00e9ss\u00e9s testified, Robson was the unique source of particularly significant and incriminating evidence. Robson was the only LIBOR <em>submitter </em>to testify on behalf of the government, and he testified\u2014contrary to the Defendants\u2019 central argument for acquittal\u2014-that, pursuant to a scheme at Rabobank, he in fact took trading positions into account when making submissions.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> And Robson was also the. <em>only </em>witness the Government 'ever interviewed who said that Allen \u201cdirected\u201d Rabobank\u2019s submitters to account for trading positions when, setting LIBOR,<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> Indeed, absent Robson\u2019s testimony that Allen issued \u201cinstructions\u201d to him,<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> Allen likely would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>have been charged, much less convicted, of the nine counts relating to specific JPY LIBOR submissions, because Allen never submitted LIBOR estimates for that currency.<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> Well aware of the substantial litigation risk under <em>Kastigar </em>of using a witness who not only had been exposed to Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony but who dramatically changed his own story after such exposure, the Government nevertheless chose to call Robson to the witness stand, underscoring the significance of his testimony to the Government\u2019s case.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the admission of Robson\u2019s trial testimony was not harmless. This error requires that Defendants\u2019 convictions be vacated and that they be awarded a new trial wherein any tainted statements are suppressed.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> Defendants also argue, however, that the use of Robson\u2019s tainted evidence, conveyed to the grand jury through Agent Weeks\u2019s testimony, requires dismissal of the indictment. We thus turn to that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">b. Use in the Grand Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Our precedents establish that an indictment is subject to dismissal if it was procured on the basis of tainted evidence. In <em>United States v. </em>Hinton,<footnotemark>168</footnotemark> the same grand jury that had heard a witness\u2019s immunized testimony later returned an indictment against that witness. We dismissed the indictment, explaining in part that \u201cthe fact that none of Hinton\u2019s immunized testimony was introduced at the trial does not resolve the question, for [the federal immunity statute] speaks to any use of the immunized testimony against the witness in any criminal case, and so prohibits its use not merely at trial, but in the grand jury proceedings as well.\u201d<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> Our holding in <em>United States v. Tantalo </em>was to the same effect,<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> and in <em>United States v. Nanni </em>we explained that \u201cif the government has presented immunized testimony to the grand jury, the indictment should be dismissed unless the government establishes that the grand jury would have indicted even ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>sent that testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>171</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The Government\u2019s reliance on our 1990 decision in <em>United States v. </em>Rivieccio<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> is misplaced. To whatever extent <em>Rivieccio </em>may have accurately described the law in our Circuit, at the time it was decided,<footnotemark>173</footnotemark> it has been overtaken by the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Hubbell.</em><footnotemark><em>174</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant in <em>Hub-bell </em>had been forced to produce documents to the grand jury, which, the Supreme Court held, violated his Fifth Amendment right pursuant to the act-of-production doctrine.<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> The Supreme Court further held that dismissal of the indictment was required despite the fact that it \u201cassume[d] that the Government is ... entirely correct in its submission that it would not have to advert to respondent\u2019s act of production in order to prove the existence, authenticity, or custody of any documents that it might offer in evidence at a criminal trial.\u201d<footnotemark>176</footnotemark> In fact, the Government had \u201cdis-elaim[ed] any need to introduce any of the documents produced by respondent into evidence in order to prove the charges against him.\u201d<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that the government had made use of compelled testimony and that dismissal of the indictment was required.<footnotemark>178</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Accordingly, in view of <em>Hub-bell, </em>our precedents, and the general principle that harmless error review applies to violations of non-struetural constitutional rights,<footnotemark>179</footnotemark> \u201cif the government has presented immunized testimony to the grand jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the indictment should be dismissed unless the government establishes that the grand jury would have indicted even absent that testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> \u201c[Exploration of the question of taint can be made ... by review of the prosecution's evidence and of the grand jury transcript.\u201d<footnotemark>181</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Upon review of the evidence and testimony presented to the grand jury in this case, we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the grand jury would have indicted Allen and Conti without the evidence supplied by Robson. As the District Court itself acknowledged, \u201cmaterial parts of [Agent Weeks\u2019s] grand jury testimony derived exclusively from Mr. Robson.\u201d<footnotemark>182</footnotemark> Specifically, when Agent Weeks testified that Allen was the scheme\u2019s leader who had \u201cinstructed, specifically instructed, LI-BOR submitters in London to consider the positions and the requests of Rabobank traders and adjust, their submissions for LIBOR,\u201d his testimony derived exclusively from Robson\u2019s proffer.<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> And when Agent Weeks testified that Mr. Conti \u201cadjusted his U.S. dollar LIBOR rates ... for his own benefit and the benefit of the other traders,\u201d<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> he based his testimony exclusively upon Mr. Robson\u2019s proffer, telling, the grand jury that \u201cMr. Robson said that sitting near Mr. Conti he was aware that Mr, Conti set U.S. dollar LIBOR rates in which he considered his own positions as appropriate reason or justification for setting the rates.\u201d<footnotemark>185</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">These statements were not merely \u201cmaterial.\u201d They were essential\u2014especially (as already noted) with respect.to the JPY-related charges against Allen.<footnotemark>186</footnotemark> More broadly, they provided the grand, jury with definitive, clear-cut testimony that Allen and Conti had directly participated in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Seeking to downplay the importance of the evidence supplied by Robson, the Government emphasizes the extent of its documentary evidence. But all of this documentary evidence was available prior to Robson\u2019s cooperation and the Government did not attempt to indict Allen and Conti on the basis of it. Said differently, the fact that the Government did not charge Allen and Conti until Robson became a cooperator (\u201cflipped,\u201d in the argot of law enforcement) further signifies the importance of his evidence to the indictment. Indeed, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Robson\u2019s plea hearing, the Government informed the District Court explicitly that \u201cthere is .. .\u25a0 a chance that we would seek a superseding indictment <em>in light of information that, has come to light from our two cooperators\u201d </em>and that there was- \u201ca distinct possibility\u201d the new indictment would \u201cinvolve[ ] other individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> We cannot discount as unreasonable the possibility that, without the evidence supplied by Robson and conveyed to the grand jury by Agent Weeks, the grand jury would not have returned an indictment charging Allen and Conti.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Neither did the District Court suggest that the evidence conveyed from Robson, through Agent Weeks, to the grand jury, was harmless; instead, the District Court concluded that the Government had met its burden to prove Robson\u2019s evidence was untainted.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> As explained above, that conclusion was in error;' Because we cannot conclude that the <em>Kastigar </em>errors before the grand jury were harmless, the indictment must be dismissed. '</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">To summarize:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKU\">(1)The Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on the use of compelled testimony in American criminal proceedings applies even when: a foreign, sovereign has compelled the testimony. To be clear, we do not purport to prescribe what the U.K. authorities (of any foreign authority) may do in 'their witness interviews or their criminal trials. We merely hold that the Self-Incrimination Clause prohibits the use and derivative use of compelled testimony in an Am\u00e9rican criminal case against the defendant who provided that testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">(2) When the government uses a witness who has been substantially exposed to a defendant\u2019s compelled testimony, it is required under <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S, 441 [92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212] (1972), to prove, at a minimum,. that the witness\u2019s review of the compelled testimony did not shape, alter, or affect the evidence used by the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av5\">(3) Where, as here, the witness\u2019s account of events before exposure was significantly different, and less incriminating, than the testimony ultimately used against the defendants, the witness\u2019s bare, generalized denial of taint\u2014here, the witness\u2019s conclusory responses to the Government\u2019s, leading questions during the <em>Kastigar </em>hearing\u2014is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">(4) In this prosecution, Defendants\u2019 compelled testimony was \u201cused\u201d against them through evidence provided by a tainted witness, a key cooperator and prominent witness both at trial and (via a hearsay presentation) before the grand jury. This tainted testimony was significant both at trial and in the grand jury, because it provided the only firsthand eyewitness account that refuted the Defendants\u2019 central argument for acquittal, and was therefore not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">For' the foregoing reasons,' we REVERSE the judgments \u00f3f conviction and hereby DISMISS the indictment.'</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-5\">.Problems with LIBOR were noted at least as early as a decade ago. \u201cBeginning in 2007, regulators and market observers noted that LIBOR had failed to behave in line with expectations given other market prices and rates.\u201d David Hou &amp; David Skeie, <em>LIBOR: Origins, Economics, Crisis, Scandal, and Reform, </em>Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 667, at 1 (Mar. 2014); <em>see </em>Michael S.

A benchmark rate reflects a relative performance measure, oftentimes for investment returns or funding costs. LIBOR serves as the primary reference rate for short-term floating rate financial contracts like swaps and futures. At its peak, estimates placed the value of such contracts at upwards of $300 trillion. Variable rate loans, primarily adjustable rate mortgages [] and private student loans, are also often tied to LIBOR.

Justice Harlan argued that the exercise of the Court\u2019s \" \u2018supervisory power\u2019 over the administration of justice in federal courts,\u201d rather than the Fifth Amendment itself, was a proper basis for the exclusion from a federal criminal trial of testimony compelled by state agents. <em>Id. </em>at 80-81, 84 S.Ct. 1594 (Harlan, J., concurring) (relying on <em>Elkins v.

Justice Harlan\u2019s perspective is entirely consistent with the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in <em>Balsys </em>and accords with its subsequent case law emphasizing that the core of the Fifth Amendment is a trial right violated only when compelled testimony is <em>used </em>in an American tribunal. We believe that Justice Harlan's views apply with equivalent force to the current case and the interaction between the U.S. and the U.K. authorities, and thus conclude that the application of the supervisory power of the federal courts over the administration of criminal justice would likewise compel the outcome here: .the exclusion of Defendants' compelled statements from use against them at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"100\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">.To be clear, we do not hold or suggest that the Clause applies where the prosecuting authority is not bound by the Fifth Amendment <em>{i.e., </em>where the prosecuting authority is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>a foreign government).
