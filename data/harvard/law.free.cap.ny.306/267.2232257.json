(Double parking) \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The facts are not in dispute. The police officer who issued the summons to defendant was the only one to testify. He stated that on May 6, 1952, at about 12:35 p.m. defendant \u201c drove up and double parked [his Mack truck] in front of 132-06 Crossbay Boulevard.\u201d On the defendant\u2019s offer of proof the court found that the space available for defendant\u2019s truck alongside the curb, during the time defendant was engaged in unloading, was not sufficiently long for him to occupy, even though a space had been created by a vehicle which had been parked at the curb and had moved away while defendant was delivering his merchandise. It was conceded that the defendant had not received permission from the police officer to place his truck at an angle to the curb in the limited space available. The police officer testified, however, that defendant was, at the time he was given the summons, \u2018 \u2018 unloading his truck \u2019 \u2019 in the course of making a delivery and, further, that \u201c traffic continued to move along the boulevard \u201d while defendant\u2019s truck was in the position described by him. There was no charge here of traffic obstruction (N. Y. City Traffic Regulations, art. 9, \u00a7 121) and consequently we are not concerned with and do not consider that problem. The sole issue presented is whether, on the undisputed facts herein, defendant was properly convicted of violating subdivision (o) of section 10 of article 2 of the regulations which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>\u201cArticle 2 </em>\u2014 <em>Parking</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Section 10. No person shall park a vehicle: * * * (o) On the roadway side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge or curb of a street. (Double parking.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In order to determine whether that article has been transgressed it is necessary to ascertain what meaning has been ascribed to the word <em>\u201c </em>park \u201d as it appears therein. No definition is to be found in article 2 itself. However, paragraph (a) of subdivision 17 of section 1 of article 1 \u2014 which is entitled \u201c Definitions \u201d\u2014 declares:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u201c The following terms when used in these regulations unless otherwise expressly stated, or unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires, shall be deemed to mean and include: * * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u201c17. \u2018 Park, parking, or parked \u2019 shall mean the stopping or standing of a vehicle, whether occupied or not, except as follows: (a) When actually and expeditiously engaged in loading or unloading merchandise \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">It is not questioned that defendant was actually and expeditiously engaged in unloading merchandise. Therefore, he was without the operation of the regulation prohibiting double parking unless it can be said that there has been demonstrated an intent to confer upon the word \u201c park \u201d as used in subdivision (o) of section 10 of article 2 a different meaning than that given to it in paragraph (a) of subdivision 17 of section 1 of article 1 quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">It has not been expressly declared that either the term \u201c park \u201d or \u201c parking \u201d as used in subdivision (o) of section 10 of article 2 is to include a vehicle which is stopped or standing even though actually and expeditiously engaged in loading or unloading merchandise. Does the context or subject matter of subdivision (o) of section 10 of article 2 require us to conclude that it was so intended? That is, does the word <em>\u201c </em>double \u201d change entirely the meaning of the word \u201c parking \u201d which it modifies? We find nothing in subdivision (o) of section 10 of article 2 to justify such a conclusion. Article 2 is entitled simply \u201c Parking \u201d. There is no reference to \u201c Double Parking \u201d in the heading. Section 10 thereof enumerates situations under which a person shall not \u201c <em>park </em>a vehicle.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Subdivision (o), with which we are concerned, provides that \u201cNo person shall park a vehicle * * * On the roadway side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge or curb of a street.\u201d Following those words there appear in parentheses the words \u201c Double parking.\u201d That is the only place in the article where that phrase is found. Certainly unless there is \u201c parking \u201d there cannot be \u201c double parking \u201d. It may well be that the single word \u201c park \u201d implies the setting at rest of a vehicle either parallel to or diagonally against the curb whereas \u201cdouble park \u201d is generally understood to refer to a vehicle set at rest alongside another standing vehicle. But, that does not change the fact that the word \u201c parking \u201d is contained within the phrase \u201c double parking\u201d. The regulation has been drawn to define in the clearest of terms the words \u201c park \u201d, \u201c parked \u201d and \u201c parking \u201d and excludes the vehicles of persons actually and expeditiously engaged in loading or unloading merchandise. It seems a matter of logic to say that if one\u2019s vehicle is not \u201c parked \u201d, as that term has been defined in the regulation, one\u2019s vehicle is not \u201c double parked \u201d. There is no question but that by the terms of article 1 of the Traffic Regulations defendant\u2019s vehicle was not \u201c parked \u201d and thus it was not \u201c double parked \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The District Attorney\u2019s fear that a holding that this defendant was not double parked will enable persons legally to triple park or even park in the center of the street and thereby effectively tie up all traffic is without substance since there is a Traffic Regulation prohibiting traffic obstruction (art. 9, \u00a7 121).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The judgments should be reversed, the information dismissed and the fine remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b312-8\">Lewis, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV7\">(dissenting). The single question presented by this appeal is whether the provision contained in Article 1, \u00a7 1, subd. 17(a) of the Traffic Regulations of the City of New York \u2014 which section defines the words \u201c park, parking or parked \u201d and expressly excludes from such definition a vehicle <em>11 </em>when actually and expeditiously engaged in loading or unloading merchandise\u201d \u2014 also excludes vehicles, so engaged, from the prohibition of Article 2, \u00a7 10(o) against \u201c double parking.\u201d As those two provisions of the regulations \u2014 quoted in full in the majority opinion \u2014 are inconsistent, our problem is one of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>I find it difficult to agree with the view of the majority that the regulatory authorization, mentioned above, which grants to persons loading or unloading merchandise expeditiously the right to <em>park </em>where others may not park \u2014 viz., where signs prohibit parking in front of driveways, or within fifteen feet of a crosswalk or safety zone (see art. 2, \u00a7 10, subds. [e], [f], [g] and [i]), or for more than the alloted time <em>(id. </em>subds. [a], [b] and [c]) \u2014 also serves to permit such person to \u201cdouble park.\u201d While it is obvious that the word \u201cpark \u201d is a component part of the phrase \u201c double park\u201d, it is my view that the contextual use to which the word \u201c double \u201d is put in that phrase changes entirely the meaning of the word <em>\u201c </em>park \u201d which it modifies. Thus the clear implications attaching to the single word \u201c park\u201d do not apply to the phrase \u201c double park.\u201d In its normal connotation, the single word \u201cparked,\u201d as found in the context of each of the regulations with which we are here concerned, refers to a vehicle when at rest parallel to and close to the right curb (art. 2, \u00a7 10, subd. [d]). Different is the reference to a \u201c double parked \u201d car which is expressly stated to be a vehicle set at rest <em>\u201c On the roadway side of any vehicle </em>stopped or parked at the edge or curb of a street \u201d (art. 2, \u00a7 10, subd. [o]).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">While Article 1, \u00a7 1, subd. 17(a) authorizes a vehicle, actually engaged in loading or unloading merchandise, to park (i.e. to be set at rest parallel or at an angle to the curb) in locations where, or at hours of the day when, other vehicles may not lawfully do so, it does not, in my opinion, authorize a vehicle to \u201c double park \u201d (i.e. to park, <em>not </em>next to the curb, but on the roadway side of another vehicle already parked).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">It is suggested that if defendant\u2019s vehicle was double parked in such a position as to block traffic, then the operator could have been convicted of a violation of section 121 of article 9 of the regulations, which prohibits a vehicle from obstructing traffic. However, the present case furnishes precisely the answer to that suggestion: Defendant concededly was not, at the time he was served with summons, obstructing traffic and therefore was not violating section 121 of article 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The ban against double parking was obviously interposed as a measure to prevent obstruction of traffic, violation of that provision <em>(id. </em>art. 9, \u00a7 121) being in itself an offense. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>other words, when obstruction of traffic occurs, section 121 of article 9 is violated; likewise a car parked on the roadway side of any vehicle which is parked at the edge or curb of a street is in violation of the <em>\u201c </em>double parking \u201d ban (art. 2, \u00a7 10, subd. [o]). The two offenses are not necessarily merged, and defendant was properly convicted for violating the double parking ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Concluding, as I do, that the Traffic Regulations involved have received proper interpretation by the courts below, I dissent and would affirm the judgment under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Fuld, Froessel and Van Voorhis, JJ., concur with Conway, J.; Lewis, Ch. J., dissents in opinion in which Desmond and Dye, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Judgments reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
