Before filing any responsive pleading, appellant attorney deposed an agent or officer of Centennial. The deposition was terminated prior to completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-17\">Thereafter, appellant sought production of documents. After production of legible documents, appellant was able to ascertain that there was a contractual provision for arbitration. Soon thereafter, Aries filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>its Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Abate seeking to enforce the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\">The Trial Court denied the motions finding that Aries\u2019 waived its right to arbitration by its \u201c. . . participation in litigation by having taken the deposition of Centennial Construction Company,\u201d from which appellant takes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Appellant filed no responsive pleading or other pleading directed to the merits or seeking affirmative relief, except its Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">It cannot be said, therefore, that Appellant\u2019s participation was inconsistent with the right to arbitration such as would constitute a waiver of that right. <em>Coral </em>97 <em>Associates, Ltd. v Chino Electric, Inc., </em>501 So.2d 69 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Reversed and remanded with directions to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
