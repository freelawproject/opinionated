John &amp; William Dawson.</parties>\n\n\n<summary id=\"b415-11\">In Charleston, May Term, 1809, the plaintiff obtained a judgment against the defendant, and sued out a writ of <em>fieri </em>facias, returnable to the next succeeding term, which was lodged in the Sheriff\u2019s office, but no other proceedings were had thereon. The <em>fi. fa. </em>was regularly renewed, from term to term, up to May Term, 1815, after which no renewal, or other proceedings were had thereon, until after the expiration of about sixteen months, at which time, the Clerk of the Court, for Charleston district, where the judgment was obtained, on an application to him for that purpose, signed an execution, which operated as a renewal or revival of the preceding <em>execution; </em>and this was an application to the Court to set aside that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>'execution, as having been irregularly issued, and after a period at which it could not have issued until the judg\u00bb ment was revived by <em>sci.fa.</em></summary>\n\n\n\n\n\n<judges id=\"b417-4\">All the judges concurred,</judges>\n<opinion><p id=\"b415-9\">Before the Act of 1815, a plaintiff could not issue an execution after a year and day from the signing\u2019of the judgment; but by that act, he is allowed three years; and after he has once issued his execution, he must proceed with the same diligence as before the passing of the Act.</p><p id=\"b415-10\">The plaintiff must sue on the judgment or retuve it by <em>scire facias, . </em>after the period of three years giveii by the' Act, for issuing his execution.</p><p id=\"b416-3\">The Circuit Court refused the application, and it was now renewed by appeal from that decision.</p><p id=\"b416-4\">This case was tried at Charleston, before Mr. Justice Johnson, who now delivered the opinion of the Court.</p><p id=\"b416-5\">Before the act of 16th December, 1815, page 40, there is no question that the plaintiff would have been out of Court, and could pot have proceeded torenew his execution, after the expiration of a year \u00e1nd day from the re.turn of the last preceding execution; and it only remains to be enquired, whether that authorized the renewal of this execution, under the circumstances ? The act provides, \u201c that it shall and may be lawful to issue execution on any judgment or decree of any Court of Law or Equity in this State, within three years after the signing or enrolment thereof, without any renewal of the same.\u201d The case was decided in the Circuit Court on a mistaken view of the facts, arising, probably, from \u2018 my own misapprehension. It was thought, that the execution had been renewed within three years after the signing of the judgment, which was anterior to the act, and that the only question was, whether the act included judgments signed before its adoption ? On this view of the facts, I am quit\u00e9 satisfied, that the decision was correct; but, from what appears to be the true state- of -the facts, I am as well satisfied that it was erroneous. The evil which'existed and which-the act- was intended to remedy;, was, that a plaintiff, who was disposed to indulge a defendant, after judgment, was compelled to renew his execution from ter-m to term, as long as the indulgence continued, or he could \u2022s?,ot proceed against him after a \u25a0 year and day, but by -renewing the judgment <em>by sci.fa. </em>thereby augmenting the \u25a0 \u00abrocts and protracting the- recovery ; and the remedy pro-rLtlecl is,- that the plaintiff may issue execution at any time <em>roi'hio \u00a1kr:c years next after the signing </em>of the judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The act is so explicit, that it appeal's to me, there is noth-\u00bb ipg left to construction. The plaintiff may issue execution at any time within three years after the signing of judgment, (a term, I think, quite long enough,) but after that.period, he must proceed with the same diligence as before the passing of' the act. In this case there had been no proceedings for more than a year and day, and more than seven years, from the time of signing the judgment had elapsed before the execution was renewed.</p><p id=\"b417-3\">The motion ought therefore to be granted.</p><p id=\"AKq\"><em>Ford </em>&amp;?
