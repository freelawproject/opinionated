The declaration contained five counts. The first charged that Cronin, a servant in the employ of defendant, while performing the work of defendant and in the due course of said Cronin\u2019s employment by defendant, negligently discharged a revolver toward plaintiff and wounded him. The second charged that Cronin shot plaintiff while Cronin, a servant in the employ of defendant, was performing the duties incident to his said employment and engaged in the work for which he was employed. The third charged that Cronin, a servant of defendant acting in the course of his employment by defendant and acting for defendant as its agent, servant and employe, shot plaintiff. The fourth charged that the defendant, through Cronin, then and there the agent, servant and employe of defendant, and acting under its control and supervision, shot plaintiff. The fifth charged that defendant, by unknown servants in its service and under its control and acting in the course of their employment and as defendant\u2019s representatives, shot plaintiff. Each count but the fifth charged that plaintiff was lawfully on the right of way of defendant when he was shot. Defendant pleaded not guilty, and filed two special pleas to the effect that plaintiff first assaulted Cronin, and that what Cronin did was in necessary self-defense. There was a trial and a verdict for plaintiff for $1,000. A motion by defendant for a new trial was overruled and judgment rendered on the verdict. Defendant seeks a reversal of the judgment.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\" pgmap=\"91(104) 92(18)\">The proof shows that in the early morning of March 30, 1897, plaintiff and three companions arrived in Kankakee from Indianapolis, on the railroad called by the witnesses \u201c The Big Four,\u201d having rode upon said train \u201c between the storm doors,\u201d without paying their fare. At Kankakee depot they got off and walked ahead of the train. When it started they got upon one end of the baggage car and rode till the train stopped at the Illinois Central tracks. A trainman then put them off, and they passed around to the other side, intending to get on again as the train started and continue their ride without paying their fares. They had no money wi,th which they could pay fares.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\" pgmap=\"92\">Shortly north of the point where this train reached the Illinois Central tracks, were the junction yards of the latter road. Cronin was night watchman in those yards. It was his duty to take a record of the seals of all freight cars coming into these yards during the night, from the Illinois Central, the Kankakee and Seneca, the \u201c Three I \u201d and \u201c The Big Four\u201d railroads; card .all freight cars received in said yards from connecting lines, keep all suspicious characters out of the yards, and keep the yards clear of all people who. had no business there. There was a conflict of evidence as to whether the junction yards and Cronin\u2019s jurisdiction extended so far south as the place where \u201c The Big Four \u201d train stood and the shooting occurred. It was about 5:30 a. m., and Cronin had his dinner basket in his hand, as if he had ceased his night\u2019s work and was going home. When \u25a0 Cronin saw these men attempting or preparing to get on this \u201c Big Four \u201d train again as it started, he got into an altercation with them. According to evidence produced by plaintiff, Cronin assaulted them and shot plaintiff without \u25a0 any of them having made any resistance or used any violence. According to evidence produced by defendant, Cronin pulled one of the men off the train after he jumped on, and they (including plaintiff) struck Cronin several times in the face and back, and kicked him in the back, and plaintiff was in the act of picking up a stone, with which to hit Cronin, \u25a0when the latter drew his revolver from his pocket and fired, hitting plaintiff.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-6\" pgmap=\"92\">William R.

Something more is needed. It must pertain to the particular duties of that employment. Keith v. Lynch, 19 Ill. App. 574; 2 Rorer on Railroads, Sec. 1191.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\" pgmap=\"93\">Even if the servant is engaged in the performance of his duty to his master, yet if he personally, and wholly for a purpose of his own, steps aside and does an act not connected with the business of such master and not intended by him to further the objects of his employment, the master is not liable for any injury thereby occasioned. C., B. &amp; Q. v. Epperson, 26 Ill. App. 72.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-6\" pgmap=\"93\">To make the master liable, the act must be within the scope of the servant\u2019s employment. To hold the master liable for a trespass committed by his servant three conditions must concur: (1.) The act must be within the scope of his employment. (2.) It must be in good faith. (3.) It must be in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business. The act might be in the line of his employment and while he was employed, but not in the furtherance of the object for which he was employed. Arasmith v. Temple, 11 Ill.

Steinmeyer v. People, 95 Ill. 383; Campbell v. People, 16 Ill. 17.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-5\" pgmap=\"94\">The law of self-defense justifies an act done in the honest and reasonable belief of great danger. It is sufficient if the danger which the defendant seeks to avert is apparently imminent, and the same rule of immunity extends to civil as to criminal cases; and if the party who actually causes the injury is free from civil and criminal liability therefor, his employer is also entitled to like immunity. New Orleans &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. Jope, 142 U. S. 18.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\" pgmap=\"94\">.If the act done by the servant be within the scope of his employment and done' in good faith to further the objects of his employment, the mast'er would be liable, even though the servant employed means contrary to the express orders of the master. But in all cases the act must be done in good faith in furtherance of the object for which he was employed. Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co. v.

Where the master gives general directions to his servant, trusting to the discretion of the latter, he may become liable for his action; but when the directions are specific and the servant transcends the directions, the master does not become liable.

Peter, 28 Ill. 434.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-10\" pgmap=\"94(21) 95(18)\">The tortious act must be actually within the scope of the servant\u2019s employment, and done in good faith in the interest and for the benefit of the master.

C., R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Brackman, \u2014 Ill. App. \u2014 opinion filed this day.</p> <p id=\"b95-9\" pgmap=\"95(151) 96(60)\">We find no evidence in this record to establish this necessary part of plaintiff\u2019s case. Cronin was not attempting to prevent plaintiff and his companions from getting on a train of the Illinois Central Railroad Company. He was , assisting the trainmen of the \u201c Big Four \u201d railroad in keeping the men from stealing a ride on a \u201c Big Four \u201d passenger train. There, is no proof to show why said train was on or at the Illinois Central tracks, nor that the Illinois Central \u25a0 Railroad Company had any duty to perform with reference to said passenger train. If the Illinois Central Railroad Company had no duty to perform concerning said \u201c Big Four \u201d train Cronin could not have been acting in the course of his employment by the Illinois Central Railroad Company in what he did. So far as this record shows Cronin was voluntarily assisting the trainmen of another railroad, and not performing any duty he owed his own company or which his own company owed the \u201c Big Four \u201d company. In this necessary particular, therefore, the proof does not support the declaration, and it does not show that the Illinois Central Railroad Company is responsible for what Cronin did.</p> <p id=\"b96-5\" pgmap=\"96\">The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
