A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A7B\">Appellant Jack Ungar was held in contempt for asking a prosecution witness, Linda Banks, an improper question on cross-examination. The form of the question suggested that the prosecutor had assured Miss Banks immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony. When appellant conceded that he was mistaken in his belief that such a promise had been made, his conduct was deemed to offend <em>DR </em>7-106(0). Section 1 of this disciplinary rule forbids an attorney from stating or alluding to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">* * *\u25a0 any matter that he has no basis to believe is relevant to the ease or that will not be supported by admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">On this appeal Ungar contends that he had a reasonable basis for putting the question to the witness and that his conviction for contempt was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The incident occurred during a jury trial in which Ungar was defending Norman Seruby on a manslaughter charge. The charge emanated from Seruby\u2019s sale of heroin to a friend who died after using the drug. The State sought to prove that the sale, use and death took place on May 16, 1975 in an apartment which Miss Banks shared with Seruby.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Miss Banks gave the police a statement on May 17 which exculpated Seruby. However, Seruby\u2019s relationship with Miss Banks began to disintegrate not long thereafter. Miss Banks testified that Seruby moved out of the apartment around August of that year, although he left his clothes there and \u201che still had a key to come back and forth as he pleased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">On September 33, 1975 the police raided Miss Banks\u2019 apartment pursuant to a search warrant and seized narcotics paraphernalia located on a night-table beside the bed. Both Seruby and Miss Banks were charged with unlawful possession. Several days thereafter, on September 36, Miss Banks gave the police a statement which implicated Seruby in the death of his friend and contradicted her statement of May 17. Thereafter, Seruby was tried in the Ocean Township <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Municipal Court for possession of narcotics paraphernalia. Miss Banks testified against him and he was convicted. On October 10, 1975 Miss Banks gave the police an additional statement implicating Seruby in his friend\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">This set the stage for the incident at the manslaughter trial which led to Ungar\u2019s difficulties. Banks was the State\u2019s principal witness. Ungar confronted her on cross-examination with inconsistencies in her three statements, focusing on the May 17 statement which she later repudiated. Ungar sought to show that her testimony and the September statement, given shortly after the raid on her apartment, were inspired by a motive to cooperate with the police in exchange for immunity. Ungar\u2019s cross-examination concluded with the question that precipitated the contempt charge. The transcript reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">Q About that \u2018phone call, isn\u2019t it true that just prior to your changing your story in statement number two which you implicate Norman Seruby, the September 26th statement, that just prior to that the Ocean Township Police Department raided your apartment and seized therein a quantity of narcotics paraphernalia and charged you with possession of that naroctics paraphernalia and then made a deal with you that you would not be punished, you would not have to go to trial for it if you would give a statement implicating Norman Seruby, is that not true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">A It\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">Q Absolutely not true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">Prosecuting Attorney: I object, I hope he\u2019s going to establish evidence to predicate the question he put to the Witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">THE COURT: I hope so, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">MR. UNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. I have no further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">THE COURT: Anything else, Mr. Mullaney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">Prosecuting Attorney: Nothing further of this Witness, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-13\">THE COURT: Okay, you may step down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-14\">(Witness excused.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">That night Ungar spoke to an investigating officer, Detective Miller, who told him that he recalled that no deal had been made with the Ocean Township Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Department \u201cand, in fact, that she [Miss Banks] was on trial as well as Mr. Seruby * * On that basis, before the manslaughter trial resumed the next day, Ungar reported this new information to the trial judge and asked him to instruct the jury to disregard his last question and Miss Banks\u2019 answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The trial judge asked Ungar to state the basis of his question. Ungar replied that Seruby had told him that only he and not Miss Banks had been tried in the Ocean Township Municipal Court regarding the narcotics paraphernalia seized at Miss Banks\u2019 apartment. Ungar stated further that he called the municipal court clerk who confirmed that the charges against Miss Banks \u201chad been dropped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">After further discussion the trial judge read the provisions of <em>DR </em>7 \u2014 106(C) into the record and called upon Ungar then and there to show cause why he should not be held in contempt since he \u201chad no basis in fact\u201d for the assertion contained in the question put to Miss Banks. Expressing surprise, Ungar mentioned a third source for his belief. Another person who was present in the municipal court when the charges against Seruby and Miss Banks were to be heard confirmed that the charges against Miss Banks had been dropped. Ungar asserted that he had acted in good faith and felt \u201cthere was sufficient basis for believing a deal had been made.\u201d He offered to state to the jury that he was in error and urged that a curative charge be given or a mistrial declared. He also apologized to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The prosecuting attorney stated that it was his understanding that both Seruby and Banks had been tried on charges related to the narcotics paraphernalia seized on September 22, and \u201cthat Linda Banks took the stand, testified on her own behalf and * * * was acquitted by the Magistrate * * He represented that no deal had been made. The trial judge then found that there was no basis for Ungar\u2019s \u201cstatement\u201d contained in his question. He termed Ungar\u2019s conduct \u201ca flagrant disregard of the authority and dignity of the Court and so prejudicial to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>parties and the administration of justice as to justify the exercise of the power of contempt * * He imposed a fine of $100, payable to the Monmouth County Court. All of this took place on March 30, 1976, during a recess in the manslaughter trial of Norman Seruby. The fine was paid immediately and the trial against Seruby continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">On April 2, 1976 a written order of contempt was entered memorializing the summary adjudication of appellant for his contempt of court based upon the question which he had put to Linda Banks The order recited that \u201cappellant had no reason to believe that the said charges [alluded to in his question] were true * * By asking the question it was found that appellant violated <em>DR </em>7-106 (C) (1), (2) and (7) and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:10-1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">On May 13, 1976<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant moved to vacate the contempt order. His supporting affidavit recited that the records of the Ocean Township Municipal Court showed that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>against Miss Banks was dismissed on motion <em>of </em>the prosecutor for lack of evidence. (The prosecutor stated that heroin paraphernalia was found on the night-table on Seruby\u2019s side of the bed and the night-table on Miss Bank\u2019s side \u201chad her credentials but not heroin.\u201d) Further investigation satisfied appellant that there was \u201cno formal deal\u201d for the dismissal of the charges but that there was a \u201ctacit understanding\u201d that cooperation of Miss Banks would be rewarded by favorable treatment. This inference was fortified by his conversation with the attorney who represented Miss Banks on the charge in the Municipal Court. He told appellant that Miss Banks had been asked in late September or early October to give the county prosecutor a statement regarding the death of Seruby\u2019s friend. Miss Banks\u2019 attorney was assured by county detectives that they had no intention of bringing charges against Miss Banks. On that \u201cunderstanding\u201d the attorney agreed to let his client give the October 10 statement. There was no \u201cformal deal\u201d regarding the municipal court charges. However, at the municipal court hearing Miss Banks\u2019 attorney told the detective in charge of the ease that Miss Banks was innocent of the charge and he would not let her testify if the charges against her were pursued. Thereafter the prosecutor moved to dismiss the charges and only the ease against Seruby was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Belying on <em>R. </em>3:18-2, although expressing doubt as to which rule governed, the trial judge dismissed TJngar\u2019s motion as out of time. <em>R. </em>3 :18-2 establishes a ten-day time limit for a motion for acquittal notwithstanding a guilty verdict returned by a jury and in cases where a jury is discharged without reaching a verdict. This rule does not apply to the case at hand. <em>B. </em>3:20-l, which governs motions for a new trial and motions to vacate a judgment in nonjury cases, is pertinent. <em>R. </em>3 :20 \u2014 2 provides no time limit when the motion is based on newly discovered evidence, but a motion for a new trial on other grounds must be made within ten days \u201cor within such further time as the court fixes during the 10-day period.\u201d These time limitations may not be enlarged. <em>R. </em>1:3-4(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Ungar\u2019s motion was based on evidence that might be deemed \u201cnewly discovered\u201d since the summary contempt proceeding afforded Ungar no opportunity to fully discover all the evidence bearing on his guilt. But we need not consider whether the motion was timely. Without the additional information presented on that motion we have concluded that there was insufficient basis for holding him in contempt in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">A contempt committed in the presence of a judge \u201cmay be adjudged summarily by the judge without notice or order to show cause\u201d <em>R. </em>1:10 \u2014 1. Summary contempt convictions are reviewable on the facts as well as the law on appeal. <em>R. </em>2:10-4; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:10-3; <em>In re Clawans, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>373, 378 (App. Div. 1961), certif. den. 36 <em>N. J. </em>296, <em>cert. </em>den. 370 <em>U. S. </em>905, 82 <em>S. Ct. </em>1250, 8 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 401 (1962). The power to punish summarily for con-tempts committed in the face of the court, although \u201cliable to abuse,' is absolutely essential to the protection of the courts in the discharge of their functions.\u201d <em>Ex Parte Terry, </em>128 <em>U. S. </em>289, 313, 9 <em>S. Ct. </em>77, 83, 32 <em>L. Ed. </em>405, 412 (1888). See <em>Weehawken Tp. Bd. of Health v. New York Central R. Co., </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>284, 290 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Not only disobedience to orders of the court, but any misbehavior which tends to impede the administration of justice may constitute a contempt. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:10-1; <em>In re Clawans, supra, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 381; 17 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Contempt, </em>\u00a7 33 at 6 (1964). This includes conduct of an attorney which tends to obstruct justice. <em>In re Logan, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>475 (1968); <em>In re Kozlov, </em>156 <em>N. J. Super. </em>316, 325-326 (App. Div. 1978); <em>In re Clawans, supra; </em>see <em>In re Carton, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>9, 21 (1966). We have no doubt that an attorney may be held in contempt for asking a question when ordered not to do so,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or when the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>is designed to mislead the jury and to unfairly prejudice an adverse party and, thus, is calculated to impede, obstruct or distort the administration of justice. <em>Offutt v. United States, </em>93 <em>U. S. App. D. C. </em>148, 149, 208 <em>F. </em>2d 842, 843 (D. C. Cir. 1953), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 348 <em>U. S. </em>11, 75 <em>S. Ct. </em>11, 99 <em>L. Ed. </em>11 (1954) (misconduct included asking questions which were highly prejudicial to the witness and for which th-ere was no foundation); <em>Hallinan v. United States, </em>182 <em>F. </em>2d 880, 886 (9 Cir. 1950), <em>cert. </em>den. 341 <em>U. S. </em>952, 71 <em>S. Ct. </em>1010, 95 <em>L. Ed. </em>1375 (1951) (persistent improper cross-examination despite rulings of the court); <em>Hawk v. Superior Court, </em>42 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 108, 128, 116 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>713, 726 (D. Ct. App. 1974), <em>cert. </em>den. 421 <em>U. S. </em>1012, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>2417, 44 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 680 (1975) (improper impeachment of witness by attempting to show he was in jail); see <em>People v. Fusaro, </em>18 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 877, 886-887, 96 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>368, 373 (D. Ct. App. 1971), <em>cert. </em>den. 407 <em>U. S. </em>912, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>2445, 32 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 686 (1972) (deliberately asking questions calling for inadmissible and prejudicial answers).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">As noted above, in putting questions to witnesses it is improper and unprofessional for an attorney to allude to prejudicial irrelevancies and matters which he has no reason to believe will be supported by admissible evidence. <em>DR </em>7-106(C) (1); 6 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev. ed. 1976), \u00a7 1803 (2) at 371; <em>A. B. A. Standards, the Prosecution Function, </em>\u00a7 5.7(d) and <em>The Defense Function, </em>\u00a7 7.6(d). On the facts of this case, however, we \u00f1nd no basis for holding Ungar in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\"> It is proper to probe a witness\u2019 bias or motive in testifying as it may affect credibility. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 <em>U. S. </em>308, 316, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>1105, 1110, 39 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 347, 354 (1974); <em>State v. Vaccaro, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. </em>167, 176 (App. Div.), certif. den. 71 <em>N. J. </em>518 (1976). This includes the right to prove that there was an arrangement made by the State for favorable treatment of the witness or merely the hope for favorable treatment. <em>Id. </em>Although here the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>question referred to a specific \u201cdeal\u201d for immunity, Ungar had enough information to suspect such an arrangement and he was justified in pursuing it on cross-examination. An attorney should be afforded reasonable latitude in cross-examining a key witness as long as the general area of inquiry is appropriate. See <em>Sprinkle v. Davis, </em>111 <em>F. </em>2d 925, 930 (4 Cir. 1940), <em>cert. </em>den. 314 <em>U. S. </em>647, 62 <em>S. Ct. </em>90, 86 <em>L. Ed. </em>519 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Ungar relied on information received from three sources, his client, his client\u2019s friend \u2014 both of whom were present in the Municipal Court \u2014 and the clerk of that court. Opposed to this was the absence of any memorandum in the prosecutor\u2019s file stating promises were made to Miss Banks. In addition, the prosecuting attorney made representations to the court that were apparently based upon information received from Detective Miller who was present during the contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Not having Miller\u2019s version when he asked the question, it is evident that Ungar asked the question in good faith. Moreover, in view of the conflicting reports as to what transpired, it cannot be said that Ungar\u2019s misbehavior was established 'beyond a reasonable doubt. We are concerned here with a criminal contempt whose purpose is \u201cto punish an offender for his affront to government.\u201d <em>In re Carton, supra, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>at 20-22. As such, the contemnor is entitled to the presumption of innocence, and his guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Buehrer, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>501, 515-516 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It is essential that a judge have the power to punish offensive behavior and obstructions to justice committed in the presence of the court. <em>In re Carton, supra, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>at 21. The need to control the proceedings may impel swift action. <em>Id. </em>The judge may act upon his own knowledge of the facts, but the contemnor\u2019s right to be heard includes the right to present \u201cproof of material facts, if any, of which the court may be unaware.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the right to be heard is a due process right of constitutional dimension. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 <em>U. S. </em>488, 496-500, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>2697, 2702-2704, 41 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d. 897, 906-908 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It is often useful to postpone disposition of a contempt charge against an attorney arising during trial until the primary trial itself has ended. <em>Sacher v. United States, </em>343 <em>U. S. </em>1, 8-10, 72 <em>S. Ct. </em>451, 454-456, 96 <em>L. Ed. </em>717, 723-724 (1952); see <em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 <em>U. S. </em>488, 498-500, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>2697, 2703-2704, 41 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 897, 907-908 (1974); <em>cf. State v. Zoppi, </em>72 <em>N. J. Super. </em>432, 436-437 (App. Div. 1962). When, as here, the misconduct is not likely to repeat itself, withholding immediate action has much in its favor. <em>Sacher v. United States, supra. </em>A deliberate course encourages a more dispassionate evaluation of the incident. <em>State v. Zoppi, supra. </em>Also, it is less likely to interfere with the attorney\u2019s first obligation, the assiduous representation of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We do not condemn the trial judge for proceeding summarily in this case since IJngar was willing to concede the accuracy of Miller\u2019s report despite the contradictory information IJngar had received. However, a factual issue was raised by the contradictions. Even without resolving it by reference to the actual records of the Municipal Court, enough had been shown to dispel any hint of bad faith on Ungar\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Reversed and remanded solely for the purpose of entering an order vacating the April 2, 1976 order of contempt and imposition of a fine.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The pertinent portions of <em>DR </em>7-106(C) are:</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">(C) In appearing in Ms professional capacity before a tribunal, a lawyer shall not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">(1) State or allude to any matter that he has no basis to believe is relevant to the case or that will not be supported by admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">(2) Ask any question that he has no basis to believe is relevant to the case and that is intended to degrade a witness or other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">\u00a1h#**** * *\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">(7) Intentionally violate any established rule of procedure or of evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-12\"><em>N.
