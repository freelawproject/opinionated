J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">Plaintiff, a not-for-profit New Jersey corporation co2nposed of over <em>500 </em>licensed optometrists (hereafter, Association), brought suit in the Chancery Division alleging that three corporations and several individuals engaged in the optometry business (hereafter, the nonpublic defendants) violated the Optometry Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-1 <em>et seq., </em>the Optician Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52-.17B-41.1 <em>et seq., </em>and the New Jersey Antitrust Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:9-1 <em>et seq., </em>and further charging unfair competition and conspiracy. Plaintiff also alleged that the New Jersey Board of Optometrists (hereafter, the board) and the Attorney General of New Jersey (sometimes jointly referred to as the public defendants) failed to perform their duties. The complaint sought to compel the public defendants to institute proceedings against the nonpublic defendants on the charges cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The trial judge, in an opinion reported at 144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>411 (Ch. Div. 1976), accurately summarized the substance of the complaint. As to the nonpublic defendants, he noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">The complaint is drafted in 13 counts. The basic thrust of the complaint as it relates to the individual defendants and corporte defendants is that they have entered into a commercial relationship which is in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. 45:12 </em>\u2014 1 <em>et seq. </em>and <em>N. J. A. O. </em>13 :38-l <em>et seq. </em>and the Association and its membership is injured thereby. More specifically, the Association charges that this relationship and the activities pursuant thereto violate <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-11, 19, 19.1. It is contended that these alleged illegal acts constitute a fraud on the public, denigrate the professional standards of the practice of optometry in New Jersey, are tortious as against the Association and its membership, cause unjust enrichment and also violate the New Jersey Antitrust Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>56:9-1 <em>et seq. </em>[at 415; footnotes omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">And as to the public defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">Count five of the complaint alleges that the Board has arbitrarily rejected numerous requests of the Association for the Board to take the necessary and proper steps provided by statute to halt the illegal and improper activities of the individual and corporate defendants. The Association wants the court to direct the Board to institute proceedings on the Association\u2019s complaints pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">The sixth count is directed against the Attorney General. If basically iterates the relief requested in the fifth count because of the fact that the office of the Attorney General is the counsel to the Board and brings all necessary judicial proceedings on behalf of the Board, [at 415-416; footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The trial judge dismissed the complaint and plaintiff now appeals. We shall consider separately the allegations against the two classes of defendants \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>,(I) the nonpublic defendants, and (II) the public defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">As will be seen, we aifirm the decision dismissing the complaint against the nonpublic defendants on the ground that plaintiff has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. As to the public defendants, we affirm on the ground that their actions constituted a proper exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">As <em>to the nonpublic defendants (corporate defendants and individual optometrists)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In the complaint against these defendants plaintiff seeks two kinds of relief: (a) remedies not involving money damages (an injunction against continuance of the allegedly illegal actions of defendants, a declaration that certain contracts and agreements of defendants are null and void, and an order directing them to move from their present locations), and ,(b) money damages (for an accounting, damages for interference with business profits, for violation of the Yew Jersey Antitrust Act, for unfair competition and malicious tort).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Since each class of remedy invokes different principles of law they will be considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\n<em>Relief (a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\n<em>Remedies other than money damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">This type of relief is sought in all counts of the complaint against the nonpublic defendants. In support of its right to such relief, plaintiff has invoked the alleged violations of the Optometry Act set forth in the complaint. However, these alleged violations are properly cognizable in the first instance by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Enforcement of the provisions of the act is vested in the Board. By <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-11 the Board is empowered to, and indeed must, revoke or suspend the license of any optometrist who may be in violation of any of the provisions in that section. Among the violations warranting such action is \u201c[a]ny violation of rule or regulation duly promulgated by the board hereunder <em>or of any provision of this chapter.\u201d N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-ll(s) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Pursuant to its granted powers, when charges are preferred the Board, or a majority thereof, is to conduct hearings thereon. It has the power to issue subpoenas and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>compel the attendance of witnesses. The charges are to be served on the accused, who also is given the power of subpoena. He has the right to cross-examine witnesses against him, to produce witnesses in his own defense and to appear personally or by counsel. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-12. After such hearing the Board must reduce its findings to writing, and if the Board unanimously finds that the charges, or any of them, are sustained, it may, in its direction, revoke or suspend the certificate of registration. And no person shall practice optometry whose certificate has been revoked or suspended. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-13. If plaintiff had filed charges with the Board, plaintiff would thus have an effective remedy to prevent the acts which it seeks to suppress by its complaint herein. Finally, all rulings of the Board in refusing to issue or refusing to renew, or suspending or revoking a certificate, shall be reviewable in the Superior Court \u201cby a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writ.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-14. Thus, only after the decision of the Board does the court function begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Nonetheless, plaintiff argues that its action was equivalent to the former prerogative writ of <em>mandamus. </em>But <em>R. </em>4:69-5, governing such actions, specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">Except where it is manifest that the interest of justice requires otherwise, actions under <em>R. </em>4:69 shall not be maintainable as long as there is available a right of review before an administrative agency which has not been exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In <em>Brunetti v. New </em>Milford, 68 <em>N. J. </em>516 (1975), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">This Court has recognized that the exhaustion o\u00ed remedies requirement is a rule of practice designed to allow administrative bodies to perform their statutory functions in an orderly manner without preliminary interference from the courts. <em>Ward v. Keenan, supra, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>at 302. Therefore, while it is neither a jurisdictional nor an absolute requirement, there is nonetheless a strong presumption favoring\" the requirement of exhaustion of remedies. <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Kingsley, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>136, 139 (1962); <em>East Brunswick Tp. Bd. of Education v. East Brunswick Tp. Coun., </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>94, 102 (1966); <em>Pleasantville Taxpayers v. City of Pleasantville, </em>115 <em>N. J. Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>85, </em>88 (App. Div. 1971), certif. den. 59 <em>N. J. </em>268 (1971); <em>Patrolman\u2019s Benev. Assoc. v. Montclair, </em>128 <em>N. J. Super. </em>59, 64 (Ch. Div. 1974), aff\u2019d 131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>505 (App. Div. 1974); for a general review of authorities see <em>Central R. Co. v. Neeld, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>172, 178-81 (1958), <em>cert. </em>den. 357 <em>U. S. </em>928, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>1372, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1371 (1958).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">Admittedly, the exhaustion requirement will be waived where \u201cthe interest of justice so requires.\u201d <em>Ward v. Keenan, supra, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>at 308; <em>Waldor v. Untermann, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>188 (App. Div. 1950). This has been held to mean that exhaustion of remedies will not be required where administrative review will be futile, where there is a need for prompt decision in the public interest, where the issues do not involve administrative expertise or discretion and only a question of law is involved and where irreparable harm will otherwise result from denial of immediate judicial relief. <em>See generally, </em>Pressler, <em>Current New Jersey Court Rules, Comment R. </em>4:69-5, at 748-49 (1975). [at 588-589; footnotes omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">None of the cited exceptions apply here. Indeed, administrative review by the Board will not be futile and it is manifest that the Board, whose members are licensed optometrists, possesses the relevant expertise which is peculiarly suited to determine the issues here projected.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The policy of the Supreme Court rule not to entertain a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writs before exhaustion of administrative remedies will be adhered to except when the question is solely one of law raising an important question of statutory construction. <em>Deaney v. Linen Thread Co., </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>578, 581 (1955). That is not the situation here. As said by then Judge (later Justice) Hall in <em>Kotlarich v. Ramsey, </em>51 <em>N. J. Super. </em>520 (App. Div. 1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">The exhaustion principle is not simply a technical one; it is founded on the sound policy that the judicial branch should exercise due restraint in interfering in the administrative field, where the Legislature has committed the matter for determination by an agency and prescribed the course to he followed therein, unless and until that course has been completed, and then only to the extent of the well recognized principles of the scope of judicial review, [at 540]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Further, the doctrine is applicable where the claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>and the court\u2019s role is essentially one of reviewing the agency\u2019s action only after the administrative action has run its course. <em>Daaleman v. Elizabethtown Gas Co., </em>150 <em>N. J. Super. </em>78, 83 (App. Div. 1977, certif. granted 75 <em>N. J. </em>537 (1977)), cross petition for certif. granted 75 <em>N. J. </em>590 (1977). Such is the circumstance here. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-14 purports to establish a procedure in the courts for review of the Board\u2019s action. We do not pass upon the question whether this section violates the principles established in <em>Winberry v. Salisbury, </em>5 <em>N. J. </em>240, <em>cert. </em>den. 340 <em>U. S. </em>877, 71 <em>S. Ct. </em>123, 95 <em>L. Ed. </em>638 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Plaintiff also argues that the trial judge erred in holding that it should have appealed to the Appellate Division rather than filing its complaint in the 'Chancery Division.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its reply brief plaintiff contends that \u201cabsent the holding of a proper hearing there can be no direct Appellate Division review.\u201d With that statement we agree, for it is only after such a hearing and the development of a proper record, with findings and conclusions, that this court can properly exercise its reviewing function \u2014 thus demonstrating the wisdom of the requirement of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. But the short answer to plaintiff\u2019s argument is that it, or any of its 555 members, could have obtained that hearing by filing charges with the Board pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-11, to be followed by the hearing mandated by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Plaintiff argues, however, that such procedure would be futile because, the Board and Attorney General have already said that they would not proceed further. That position was based on the informal presentation of information by plaintiff, the nature or scope of which we do not know \u2014 again because there was no hearing with sworn testimony or other development of a record which we might appraise. The fact that a proper record was not developed does not \u00e9xcuse plaintiff from following the clear procedure directed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">At oral argument, in response to the court\u2019s questions as to whether plaintiff had ever filed a charge against defendants with the Board, plaintiff\u2019s attorney asserted that many \u201ccomplaints\u201d were made against them. We were advised that those complaints were embodied in several letters sent by representatives of plaintiff to the Attorney General\u2019s office and in several informal conferences. We asked that copies of the letters be submitted to us, even though they are not part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We have received copies of such correspondence. We have also been supplied with transcripts of hearings before the Office of Consumer Affairs concerning alleged wrongful acts of opticians, and purported transcripts of informal conversations apparently by telephone between some interested parties. We consider that the transcripts of tapes are not worthy of comment on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Counsel for plaintiff asserts that the letters and other documents submitted \u201cdo not constitute a formal record; they do not involve an administrative adversary hearing; they are submitted now to demonstrate that, in fact, complaints and charges were brought to the attention of the State Board and the Attorney General; that no action was taken thereon, and that consequently <em>mandamus </em>was the proper remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">We have examined the letters even though they are not part of the record. The letters do reveal that the Association was \u201ccomplaining\u201d about activities which it believed constituted violation of the Optometry Law; that plaintiff sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>mitted certain information to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the matter; that his office interviewed witnesses suggested by plaintiff, conducted its own investigation and finally came to the conclusion that \u201cthere is neither a proper basis in law or in the facts which we have reviewed upon which to bottom a complaint charging a violation of the optometry statute or to justify a \u2018rule-making\u2019 investigation by the Board of Optometrists.\u201d (Letter from the Assistant Attorney General to plaintiff\u2019s attorney dated April 9, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">It is also clear that, in his letter of April 18, 1975, plaintiff\u2019s attorney disputed the conclusions of the Assistant Attorney General and reiterated his opinion that he had demonstrated a violation of the Optometry Law. Finally, in his letter of October 31, 1975 the president of the Board expressed its concurrence with the Attorney General\u2019s office and stated that the Board \u201cwill not proceed regarding any alleged violations of the Optometry Law nor undertake any rule-making action as a result of the evidence which the Association presented to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">While the correspondence reveals that plaintiff was \u201ccomplaining\u201d of certain activities and evidences a difference of opinion between plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the office of the Attorney General as to whether in fact and law violations of the Optometry Act were demonstrated, they do not reveal any specific charge of a violation of the Optometry Act, or who might be guilty of any such violation. It is also noteworthy that the correspondence was only between plaintiff and its representatives, the Attorney General\u2019s office and the Board. The nonpublic defendants here had no notice of what was contained in the letters, were not served with them, or given the opportunity to have a hearing pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:12-12. The letters and other information supplied to us fall far short of a \u201ccharge\u201d which would invoke the administrative proceeding pursuant to that section. <em>N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>S. A. </em>45:12-11 provides that \u201cany person\u201d may file charges of violation of the Optometry act.\u201d Obviously the Association could have filed such charges. They did not do so. Patently, plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedy before invoking the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">For the reasons herein stated, dismissal of the complaint insofar as it seeks remedies other than money damages is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Belief </em>(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>Money damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Money damages are sought in Counts Three (charging unjust enrichment, unfair competition and interference with business opportunities of plaintiff and its members); Count Four (charging conspiracy and fraud); Count Seven and Count Eight (charging violation of the New Jersey Antitrust Law); Count Nine (charging unfair competition); Count Ten (charging conspiracy to effect \u201cillegal * * * and tortious objects\u201d); Count Eleven (charging defendants Kaplan and Noble with violations of the Optometry Act and Antitrust Law); Count Twelve (charging the corporate defendants with responsibility for the acts of the individual defendants), and Count Thirteen (alleging no specific cause of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The trial judge dismissed plaintiff\u2019s claims for money damages for the reason that plaintiff, a nonprofit corporation, is not engaged in business, none of its property rights have been invaded by defendants and therefore it suffered no damage. 144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 425-428. We agree and consider that no further discussion as to the money damage claims is necessary. For those reasons the dismissal of those counts of the complaint seeking such relief against the non-public defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>TI</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\n<em>As to the public defendants {Board of Optometry and the Attorney General)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In arguing that the trial judge was in error in holding that plaintiff should have appealed to the Appellate Division rather than suing in the trial division, plaintiff contends that the relief which it sought was by way of the former prerogative writ of <em>mandamus </em>and not that of certiorari, as would be called for in a \u201creview\u201d by the Appellate Division.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">We accept the complaint for what plaintiff says it is \u2014 one seeking relief formerly available through the prerogative writ of <em>mandamus. </em>Assuming this to be so, plaintiff ignores the function, scope and limitations of that writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The limitations upon the exercise of the ancient extraordinary remedy of <em>mandamus </em>were summarized by Justice Heher in <em>Switz v. Middletown Tp., </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>580 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">It is a coercive process that commands the performance of a specific ministerial act or duty, or compels the exercise of a discretionary function, but does not seek to interfere with or control the mode and manner of its exercise or to influence or direct a particular result. <em>Mandamus </em>lies to compel but not control the exercise of discretion. <em>Roberts v. Holsworth, </em>10 <em>N. J. L. 57 (Sup. Ct. </em>1828); <em>Benedict v. Howell, </em>39 <em>N. J. L. </em>221 <em>(Sup. Ct. 1877). </em>Unless the particular duty be peremptory, the fair exercise of judgment and discretion is the province of the functioning authority. The right of the relator and the public duty sought to be enforced must be both clear and certain. <em>Uszkay v. Dill, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>327 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1919); <em>Edward C. Jones Co. v. Town of Guttenberg, </em>66 <em>N. J. L. </em>58 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1901), affirmed <em>Id., </em>66 <em>N. J. L. </em>659 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1901); <em>Clark v. City of Elizabeth, </em>61 <em>N. J. L. </em>565 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1898). Mandamus issues \u201cto compel the performance, in a specified manner, of ministerial duties so plain in point of law and so clear in matter of fact that no element of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>cretion is left as to the precise mode of their performance, but as to all acts or duties depending upon a jurisdiction to decide questions of law or to ascertain matters of fact, on the part of the officer or body at whose hands their performance is required, <em>mandamus </em>will not lie.\u201d <em>Mooney v. Edwards, </em>51 <em>N. J. L. </em>479 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1889). [at 588-589]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Further, <em>\u201c* * * </em>mandamus will not lie if the duty to act is a discretionary one and the discretion has been exercised.\u201d <em>U. S. Trust Co. of New York v. State, </em>69 <em>N. J. </em>253, 259 (1976), rev. on other grounds 431 <em>U. S. </em>1, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>1505, 52 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 92 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">As we have said above, plaintiff submitted to the Board various letters and documents concerning the manner in which defendants were practicing optometry. Plaintiff claimed that defendant\u2019s actions constituted violations of the Optometry Act. Defendant Board examined the documents furnished by plaintiff and made its judgment (exercising its discretionary function) that the information did not establish violations of the act. True, plaintiff wanted the Board to conclude otherwise. As was said in <em>Switz v. Middletown Tp., supra, </em>the \u201cfair use of judgment and discretion is the province of the functioning authority.\u201d 23 <em>N. J. </em>at 588. Therefore, <em>mandamus </em>does not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We reach a similar conclusion as to the Attorney General. He too, exercised his judgment that the information supplied by plaintiff did not establish violations of the law. Again, in exercising his discretionary function, he rendered his judgment in a way contrary to that which plaintiff desired. Plaintiff may not use <em>mandamus </em>to compel a decision in a particular way \u2014 its way.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The duty of a prosecutor is summarized in 63 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Prosecuting Attorneys </em>\u00a7 26 at 354, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">A duty rests upon tbe prosecuting attorney to prosecute in his county or district, on behalf of the people, all public offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoZ\">As a general rule, however, this duty is not absolute, but qualified, requiring of the prosecuting attorney only the exercise of a sound discretion, which permits him to refrain from prosecuting whenever he-, in good faith and without corrupt motives or influences, thinks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that a prosecution would not serve the best interests of the state, or that, under the circumstances, a conviction could not be had, or that the guilt of the accused is doubtful or not capable of adequate proof. Thus, it has been held that mandamus will not lie to compel a prosecuting attorney to institute a criminal prosecution, since the acts of a prosecuting attorney are not purely ministerial acts, but involve in a large measure learning and the exercise, of discretion. But the fact that his duties rise to a dignity which permits him to exercise discretion will not excuse neglect of duty on his part. And the privilege of exercising his sound discretion does not permit, failure to prosecute in order to conform with the- general sentiments of the people living in his district. Nor does unlikelihood that the jury will return a verdict for conviction, because of popular prejudice existing against such prosecution, excuse the prosecuting attorney from performing his duties in regard to prosecuting, [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">To same effect, see <em>In re Investigation Regarding Ringwood Fact Finding Comm., </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>512 (1974); <em>State v. LeVien, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>323 (1965), and <em>State v. Winne, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>152 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>People v. Adams, </em>43 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 697, 117 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>905 (D. Ct. App. 1974), it was held there was no review by way o\u00ed ihe appellate process of a district attorney\u2019s exercise of his discretionary power to determine whether or not to prosecute in a particular situation, nor can a court control this power by <em>mandamus. </em>See also, <em>State\u2019s Attorney of Baltimore City v. Baltimore, </em>274 <em>Md. </em>597, 337 <em>A. </em>2d 92 (Ct. App. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">There is no showing here that the Attorney General in exercising his discretion did not act in good faith or for any other invidious reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In sum, plaintiff\u2019s theme is that the Board and the Attorney General did not act at all in furtherance of their respective duties and it therefore seeks to compel them to act in that respect. Not so. The duty of each was a discretionary one. They exercised their discretion, and, that being so, <em>mandamus </em>does not lie. <em>U. S. Trust Co. of New York State, supra, </em>69 <em>N. J. </em>at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">For the foregoing reasons the order dismissing the complaint is affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Assuming the action to be one in lieu of the prerogative writ of <em>mandamus, </em>it should have been filed in the Law Division. However, since the complaint was filed in the Chancery Division it could proceed to adjudicate the matter. <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a7 III, \u00b6 4. See <em>Archard v. Mesmer, </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>560, 561 (App. Div. 1970). We do not reach the question whether the refusal of the public defendants to act further is an \u201caction\u201d reviewable by this court. See <em>Central Railroad Co. v. Neeld, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>172, 184, <em>cert. </em>den. 357 <em>U. S. </em>958, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>1373, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1371 (1958), and the trial judge\u2019s opinion at 144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s arguments are reminiscent of the maze which existed among the prerogative writs before adoption of our <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a7 V, \u00b6 4, and whose unlamented passing has been thought to be irrevocably entombed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
