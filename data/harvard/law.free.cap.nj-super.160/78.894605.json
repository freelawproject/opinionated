J. S. A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>2A:98-1(f) and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:111-1. He applied for admission into the Union County Pretrial Intervention Program but was rejected on the recommendation of the Program Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Thereafter, the rejection was upheld after an <em>B. </em>3:28 hearing before a county court judge. He sought leave to appeal the denial but his application for leave was rejected by this court. He then entered a guilty plea to the Accusation and was sentenced to 1% to 2% years in State Prison; that sentence was suspended, however, and he was placed on probation for a period of 3 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">He now appeals, raising as his sole issue that the denial of his admission to the Pretrial Intervention Program was erroneous, principally because of the fact that a co-conspirator was admitted to the program and that the alleged ringleader was granted immunity by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We affirm solely on the ground that defendant\u2019s knowing and intelligent guilty plea constituted <em>\u201ca </em>break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process.\u201d <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 <em>U. S. </em>258, 267, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>1602, 1608, 36 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 235 (1973). The entry of the guilty plea precluded defendant from raising any nonjurisdictional claims as to deprivation of his constitutional rights before the entry of the plea. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 <em>U. S. </em>at 267, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>162. <em>A fortiori, </em>we conclude that his attack on events of a nonconstitutional dimension such as admission into a Pretrial Intervention Program, are also barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
