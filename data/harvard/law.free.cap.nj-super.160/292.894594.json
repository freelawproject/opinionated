A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A7W\">Defendant William H. Franklin sustained serious injuries as a result of an automobile accident with a vehicle owned by Carmine V. Capalbo. As a result of a settlement agreement Capalbo\u2019s liability insurance carrier paid Franklin the sum of $25,000 representing the total coverage of Capalbo\u2019s policy. Thereafter Franklin made a claim against his own carrier, New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Go., for the additional sum of $15,000 based on the uninsured motorist endorsement on his policy. He claimed that his injuries and losses were not fully compensated by the payment from Capalbo\u2019s carrier, and that Capalbo was therefore \u2014 \u201cuninsured\u201d to the extent that his policy was insufficient to pay for the injuries and losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Pursuant to the provision contained in the uninsured motorist endorsement, Franklin filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association which sought $15,000 from New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co. for personal injuries based on the uninsured motorist provision of his policy. The demand contained no special request for arbitration of any particular issues and was simply a printed form demanding arbitration under the uninsured motorist provision of the policy. The record does not reflect an answer or statement by New Jersey Manufacturers. In any event, an arbitrator was selected. However, pursuant to an agreement that the matter would be submitted on written memoranda, neither party appeared before the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Accordingly, counsel for the insurance company submitted to the arbitrator a \u201cMemorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Dismissal\u201d and a supplemental memorandum as well. In these memoranda he argued that the matter was not appropriately the subject of arbitration, citing <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. </em>Schulz, 136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>185 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>(App. Div. 1975), as authority for Ms position that the question of coverage is not arbitrable. He noted that since the scope ,of arbitration is limited to \u201cquestions of fault and damage\u201d which are not in dispute, nothing remains for the arbitrator to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In addition to the foregoing jurisdictional contention relevant to the application to dismiss, the memoranda also ventured into a discussion of the merits of the coverage question involved in the uninsured motorist claim. On July 20, 1976 the arbitrator filed what is entitled \u201cInterim Award of Arbitrator\u201d with the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">1. NEW JERSEY MANUFACTURERS INSURANCE CO. is liable to WILLIAM FRANKLIN for injuries received from the accident which occurred on January 19, 1973, under Policy No. FA 548825-9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">2. Jurisdiction is retained until August 29, 1976 for a determination as to damages should the parties be unable to agree on a mutually acceptable amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">On November 29, 1976 New Jersey Manufacturers filed a complaint in the Law Division for a declaratory judgment to determine that the arbitrator\u2019s interim ruling was beyond his jurisdiction, that the arbitration proceeding be dismissed, and that coverage does not exist for Franklin\u2019s claim under the New Jersey Manufacturers policy. Defendant took no steps to confirm the interim award and no final arbitrator\u2019s award was ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">However, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint. The trial judge converted the motion into a summary judgment motion, which he granted on the ground that New Jersey Manufacturers had waived its right to a judicial determination of the coverage question by its participation in the arbitration proceeding. He also added his opinion that the arbitrator not only had jurisdiction to decide the issue of coverage but had decided that issue on its merits in accord with controlling law, citing <em>Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N. J. </em>277 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeal from this determination presents the following questions for resolution: (1) Did the arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>have jurisdiction to decide the coverage question? (2) Did New Jersey Manufacturers waive its objection to the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction to determine that issue? (3) If the answer to both of these questions is in the negative, does the uninsured motorist provision of the policy afford coverage for Franklin\u2019s excess claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The standard uninsured motorist endorsement attached to the policy herein provides for arbitration only as to the liability of the uninsured motorist tortfeasor and the quantum of damages (Condition G). And since the scope of such arbitration is necessarily limited by the contract, the submission to the arbitrator by the demand for arbitration precluded consideration of any other issues. <em>Goerke Kirch Co. v. Goerke Kirch Holding Co., </em>118 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>1, 4 (E. &amp; A. 1935); <em>Moreina Constr. Co., Inc. v. Wayne Tp., </em>98 <em>N. J. Super. </em>570, 575-576 (App Div.), certif. den. 51 <em>N. J. </em>467 (1968); <em>Polshek v. Bergen Cty. Iron Works, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. </em>516, 521 (Ch. Div. 1976); <em>Leslie v. Leslie, </em>50 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>103, 107 (Ch. 1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\"> Hence it is well settled in this State that coverage questions are not arbitrable under the usual arbitration clause contained in an uninsured motorist endorsement. <em>GEICO v. Bovit, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. </em>268 (App. Div.), certif. den. 71 <em>N. J. </em>502 (1976); <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Schulz, supra, </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 187; <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Mongiovi, </em>135 <em>N. J. Super. </em>452 (App. Div. 1975); <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. v. Shara, </em>137 <em>N. J. Super. </em>142, 145-146 (Ch. Div. 1975). See also, Annotation, \u201cWhat issues are arbitrable under arbitration provision of uninsured motorist insurance?,\u201d 29 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 328 (1970); <em>Widiss, A Guide to Uninsured Motorist Coverage, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6.17 - 6.26 at 202-216 (1969). The issue of coverage is one for determination by a court, and in the absence of evidence of stipulation, waiver or estoppel, the arbitrator had no primary jurisdiction to determine that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>It follows therefore that the justification for the arbitrator\u2019s interim award holding New Jersey Manufacturers liable can only be premised on a finding that the company\u2019s participation in the arbitration proceeding constituted a waiver and submission to the power and jurisdiction of the arbitrator to decide the coverage question. Even in the absence of a contractual submission of an issue to arbitration, a party may by conduct or agreement waive his legal right to judicial determination. If such a waiver is established, objection to the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction is no longer viable. See <em>Grover v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>151 <em>N. J. Super. </em>403, 411 (App. Div. 1977); <em>Collingswood Hosiery Mills v. Amer. Fed. Hosiery Wkrs., </em>28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>605 (Ch. Div. 1953), rev\u2019d on other grounds 31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>466 (App. Div. 1954); <em>Migneault v. United Services Automobile Ass\u2019n, </em>31 <em>Ariz. App. </em>397, 519 <em>P. </em>3d 1162 (Ct. App. 1974); Annotation, \u201cParticipation in arbitration proceedings as waiver of objections to arbitrability,\" 33 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 1242, 1245-1250 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">It is our considered opinion that the degree and nature of the participation in the arbitration proceeding by the carrier herein did not constitute an unequivocal and knowing waiver so as to vest jurisdiction in the arbitrator to decide the merits of the coverage question.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">When the claimant filed his demand for arbitration he submitted a <em>pro forma </em>document which did not specify the issues to he determined by the arbitrator. The tenor of the demand demonstrates a request for arbitration within the ambit of the uninsured motorist endorsement, thereby limiting the jurisdiction of the arbitration to the liability of the tortfeasor and damages. Paced with such a demand the company had a range of options. It could disregard the arbitration and not participate therein; it could immediately seek to restrain the arbitration pending a determination by a court of the coverage question; it could make a timely objection in the arbitration proceeding before the hearing on the merits, or it could participate fully before the arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>on the merits of all issues. See, generally, Stanton, \u201cProtection Against Uninsured Motorists in New Jersey,\u201d 3 <em>Seton Hall L. Rev. </em>19, 36-40 (1971). The determination whether there has or has not been a waiver is dependent upon the course elected by the company and the facts relating to the nature and degree of its participation in the arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In the context of the limitation of arbitrable issues contained in the insurance contract, the critical question is whether an agreement to arbitrate the coverage question was in fact made by thie carrier because of what it did in the arbitration proceeding. In <em>Battle v. General Cellulose Co., </em>23 N. <em>J. </em>538 (1957), the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">The one who denies the existence of the contract [to arbitrate] may-seek a judicial determination upon an application to stay the arbitration or upon a proceeding to enforce the award. <em>If he chooses to ignore the arbitration and await am, aetion upon the awamd, </em>he takes the risk of a determination that he was obligated to arbitrate and hence is bound by the award, [at 543-544; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In <em>Dist. </em>65, <em>R. W. D. S. U. v. Paramount Surg. Sup. Co., </em>117 <em>N. J. Super. </em>125 (App. Div. 1971), we summarized the holding in <em>Battle </em>in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\"><em>Battle </em>holds that when a party claims he has a contract with another calling for arbitration of disputes arising thereunder, and proceeds to invoke arbitration in the manner set forth in the alleged contract, there is no preliminary obligation on the demandant for arbitration first to go to court to compel the other party to participate. He may do so, but he is not compelled to. If he decides to proceed with the arbitration on the assumption that he has an agreement calling for it, then the opponent, who takes the position that there is no contract between them or that the dispute is not arbitrable, ignores notice of the arbitration proceeding at his peril of a later judicial determination that there was in fact a contract requiring arbitration of the dispute, and of being subjected to the award even though he did not participate in the proceeding, [at 127]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We then proceeded to outline the effect of participation in the arbitration upon a defendant\u2019s right to a judicial determination of his contractual obligation to arbitrate. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The foregoing does not mean that such a defendant waives his right to a judicial determination that he was under no contractual obligation to arbitrate. He may raise that issue in defense of an application by the demandant for entry of judgment on the award. But if he loses on that defense in court, he is obligated on the award. What he should have done if he wanted a judicial determination in advance of the arbitration, under the rationale of <em>Battle, </em>is to have moved in court to stay the arbitration proceedings at the outset and in <em>that </em>proceeding to have obtained a judicial decision on the question of contractual obligation to arbitrate, [at 127-128]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">See also, <em>Polshek v. Bergen Cty. Iron Works, supra, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 520-521.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">From the foregoing we find that the mere participation in the arbitration does not conclusively bar a party from seeking a judicial determination of arbitrability, even as late as the time of claimant\u2019s application to confirm the award. The flagging of the company\u2019s objection to the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction in the submitted memoranda represented an adequate reservation of the coverage issue for judicial determination, subject to the risk of the binding effect of the award on liability and damages in the event of ultimate lack of success on the question whether the coverage issue was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"> Although it may be preferable and more orderly for a party claiming that an issue is beyond the contractual scope of arbitrability to seek an injunction of the arbitration, it is not a mandatory requirement subject to the consequence of waiver. If the objection to the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction is made known, participation in the merits of the controversy does not dictate a finding of waiver. See <em>American Bakery and Confectionery Workers v. National Biscuit Co., </em>378 <em>F. </em>2d 918, 921-922, 33 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 1229, 1234-1235 (3 Cir. 1967); <em>contra, Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N. Y. v. Dennis, </em>229 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 541, 40 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>418 (D. Ct. App. 1964). And thus the mere alternative argument on the merits in the memoranda .of counsel for the' carrier submitted to the arbitrator does not serve to bar subsequent judicial determination of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Under the circumstances herein there is absent such evidence relating to actions of New Jersey Manufacturers which would support a finding of waiver, <em>i.e., </em>the intentional relinquishment of a known right. See <em>West Jersey Title Co. v. Industrial Trust Co., 27 N. J. </em>144, 152-153 (1958). \u201cIt is requisite to waiver of a legal right that there be 'a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of the party showing such a purpose or acts amounting to an estoppel on his part.\u2019 \u201d 27 <em>N. J. </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Absence of waiver is particularly indicated herein where the demand for arbitration does not clearly point up the issue of coverage as a matter for the arbitrator\u2019s decision and the company noted its objection to the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction. The award contains no specific finding on that issue, and the award is only an interim or interlocutory one at best. Where the lack of arbitrability is clear on the face of the contract, as it is herein, proof of waiver must be so clear and unequivocal that it can be said that the defendant in arbitration has expressly or impliedly agreed that the additional issue be considered and decided by the arbitrator. The record herein does not support such a capitulation by the carrier in any actions or position taken during the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s application to the court by its complaint for declaratory judgment was both timely and appropriate to invoke the court\u2019s independent judgment on the merits of the coverage problem The court\u2019s finding of waiver was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Since the issue of coverage was not arbitrable under the controlling insurance contract, and in light of our conclusion that the carrier did not waive its right to a judicial determination of that issue, we next turn to the final issue \u2014the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The question of the right of recovery under the uninsured motorist endorsement where the assured has received payment equal to or in excess of $15,000 (minimum coverage under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:6B-1) from tortfeasor\u2019s liability ear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>rier was resolved in <em>Taft v. Sweeney, </em>149 <em>N. J. Super. </em>282 (App. Div. 1977). We held therein that <em>Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Phillips, supra, </em>66 <em>N. J. </em>277, and <em>Gorton v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>137 <em>N. J. Super. </em>558 (App. Div. 1975), certif. granted 70 <em>N. J. </em>273 (1976), are distinguishable on their facts. <em>Motor Club </em>held that a person injured by an uninsured motorist is entitled to uninsured motorist benefits under more than one policy affording the same. In <em>Gorton </em>we held that each of several injured plaintiffs could recover under his own uninsured motorist coverage the difference between the amounts received from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy and the statutory limit for bodily injury where the liability coverage had been exhausted by settlement with the several claimants. In other terms, an injured person is entitled to be protected for an injury claim to the extent of the mandatory minimum statutory requirement. And if the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage is insufficient to provide that minimum, he is deemed an uninsured to the extent of the difference between that coverage and the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">However, where the claimant seeking recovery under the uninsured motorist policy has insurance protection under the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy to the extent of the $15,000 minimum ($25,000 in this case), the intent of the legislative scheme has been satisfied and there is no basis for recovery under the uninsured motorist endorsement. See <em>Taft v. Sweeney, supra, </em>149 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 285-286. Under such circumstances there is no warrant for a determination that the tortfeasor is an uninsured motorist. The trial judge erred in reaching that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment entered in favor of defendant. Since the result of our determination is that plaintiff is not liable as a matter of law under the uninsured motorist endorsement, we exercise our original jurisdiction under <em>R. </em>2:10 \u2014 5 and direct the entry of a judgment in favor of plaintiff vacating the arbitration and the arbitrator\u2019s interim award, and declaring that plaintiff\u2019s uninsured motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ist endorsement does not afford coverage to defendant for the claimed injuries and damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
