O\u2019Brien and Marguerite E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>O\u2019Brien. The plaintiff has obtained a judgment against Jeremiah O\u2019Brien that remains unpaid. It claims that the court improperly refused to impose a constructive trust on certain assets of Marguerite O\u2019Brien that allegedly are owned equitably and beneficially by Jeremiah O\u2019Brien. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The following evidence was presented to the court. In the 1980s, Marguerite O\u2019Brien worked as an investment banking saleswoman, and Jeremiah O\u2019Brien worked as a salesman for a large securities brokerage firm in New York. They both earned substantial salaries. On December 28, 1985, the defendants were married, and in 1987 they purchased a cooperative apartment in Manhattan. During their period of ownership, Marguerite O\u2019Brien paid for substantial renovations to the property. She retained approximately $200,000 when the apartment was sold in 1988, which represented the equity in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Between 1983 and 1986, before moving to Connecticut, Jeremiah O\u2019Brien was a money investor in a number of real estate transactions with his brother, Kevin C. O\u2019Brien. All of the real estate was in Hartford. Jeremiah O\u2019Brien provided the funds, and his brother managed the properties. In late 1988, Jeremiah O\u2019Brien left his employment to become involved on a full-time basis with his brother\u2019s real estate business, O\u2019Brien Realty, which managed properties and provided brokerage services. In addition to being an investor, Jeremiah O\u2019Brien wanted to learn the business and participate in the purchase of and renovations to the properties. O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc., a corporation owned by the brothers, was created in 1988 to purchase several apartment complexes in the greater Hartford area. O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc., owned the properties, and O\u2019Brien Realty managed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>In September, 1989, the defendants purchased their home in Avon, as joint tenants, for $547,000. A mortgage of $412,000 was placed on the property at the time of purchase. There is a discrepancy in the evidence as to the cash amount contributed by each defendant toward the down payment. Shortly after the purchase, Marguerite O\u2019Brien contributed approximately $200,000 toward the renovation of the house. Because of her substantial investment, the defendants decided that she should hold title in her name alone. Her husband conveyed his interest in the Avon property to her in June, 1990. When the defendants refinanced their mortgage loan in 1992, Marguerite O\u2019Brien conveyed title to the house to herself and her husband. On the same day, after the execution of the loan documents, Jeremiah O\u2019Brien transferred his interest back to his wife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She was the record owner of the Avon property at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The real estate market in the Hartford area sharply declined in the early 1990s. O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc., lost all of the properties it acquired in the late 1980s through foreclosure proceedings. The plaintiffs judgment against Jeremiah O\u2019Brien, which the plaintiff now seeks to satisfy with assets held by his wife, involved one of those properties. O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc., purchased two apartment buildings located on Grafton Street in Hartford with moneys loaned by The Bank of Hartford. The note was secured by a mortgage on the Grafton Street property and was personally guaranteed by the O\u2019Brien brothers. Although the original balloon maturity date was October 1, 1991, the bank extended that date to October 1, 1993. Subsequently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed as the receiver for The Bank of Hartford. When O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc., and the O\u2019Brien brothers failed to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the note, the FDIC commenced an action in 1996, seeking, inter alia, a foreclosure of the mortgage. In June, 1997, a deficiency judgment was rendered against O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc., and Jeremiah O\u2019Brien in the amount of $717,160.36.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The FDIC assigned the deficiency judgment to Stomawaye Properties, Inc. (Stomawaye), in December, 1998. The present action was commenced by Stomawaye against the defendants in 2001. Stomawaye assigned the deficiency judgment to the plaintiff in February, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In addition to Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s interest in the Avon property, the evidence indicated that she acquired interests in four apartment buildings in the 1990s. The complexes, purchased between 1993 and 1997, were known as Eastbrook Towers in East Hartford, the Congress Street Apartments in Hartford, Westbrook Towers in West Haven and the Regency Apartments in New Britain.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kevin O\u2019Brien discovered those properties, which were being sold at prices that Marguerite O\u2019Brien and the other investors in the properties believed to be below market value. The properties were purchased, in part, with purchase money mortgages and, in part, by cash contributions made by Marguerite O\u2019Brien and the investors. She and the investors provided the capital; Kevin O\u2019Brien provided the expertise and renovated and managed the properties. Jeremiah O\u2019Brien obtained the investors, who were his former coworkers and acquaintances.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Although the amount of Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s investments varied from property to property, the agreements between Marguerite O\u2019Brien and the investors essentially were identical as to the return of the capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>invested and the distribution of profits. After the investors, including Marguerite O\u2019Brien, received the return of their investments, Marguerite O\u2019Brien would receive 50 percent of the net earnings as the general partner or managing member (manager\u2019s return), and all of the investors received the remaining 50 percent pro rata. The agreement for the Regency Apartments was slightly different because both Kevin O\u2019Brien and Marguerite O\u2019Brien were \u201coriginating members\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, therefore, shared equally in the 50 percent manager\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The plaintiff, in order to satisfy its judgment against Jeremiah O\u2019Brien, sought to have a constructive trust imposed on Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s interests in the four apartment complexes acquired in the 1990s and on one half of her interest in the Avon property. The claim is that the property interests are equitably and beneficially owned by Jeremiah O\u2019Brien, but held in his wife\u2019s name, and that equity and good conscience require that they be subject to the rights of the plaintiff as Jeremiah O\u2019Brien\u2019s creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cA court\u2019s determination of whether to impose a constructive trust must stand unless it is clearly erroneous or involves an abuse of discretion. . . . This limited scope of review is consistent with the general proposition that equitable determinations that depend on the balancing of many factors are committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Menard </em>v. <em>Gaskell, </em>92 Conn. App. 551, 555, 885 A.2d 1254 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cA constructive trust arises contrary to intention and in invitum, against one who, by fraud, actual or constructive, by duress or abuse of confidence, by commission of wrong, or by any form of unconscionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means, or who in any way against equity and good conscience, either has obtained or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, hold and enjoy. ... A constructive trust arises whenever another\u2019s property has been wrongfully appropriated and converted into a different form . . . [or] when a person who holds title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that he would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Gabel, </em>69 Conn. App. 279, 288, 794 A.2d 1029 (2002). \u201cThe issue raised by a claim for a constructive trust is, in essence, whether a party has committed actual or constructive fraud or whether he or she has been unjustly enriched.\u201d Id., 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The plaintiff claims that the defendants are unjustly enriched because Marguerite O\u2019Brien receives a 50 percent manager\u2019s return and a pro rata share of the remaining 50 percent of the net earnings. As previously noted, the partnership and limited liability company agreements provided that after all of the investors were repaid the amount of their capital contributions, the profits were to be distributed 50 percent to Marguerite O\u2019Brien or, in the case of the Regency Apartments, 25 percent to her and 25 percent to Kevin O\u2019Brien, and the remaining 50 percent was to be distributed pro rata to all of the investors in accordance with the amount of their investments. The plaintiff argues that the court should have imposed a constructive trust on her manager\u2019s return and on her partnership and membership interests in the apartment owning entities. In support of that argument, the plaintiff claims that the court (1) ignored the evidence that the O\u2019Brien brothers were the only individuals involved in the day-to-day management of the apartment complexes, (2) credited certain testimony regarding Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s participation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>in key decision-making matters without any supporting documentation, (3) credited certain testimony that Marguerite O\u2019Brien personally guaranteed loans and provided other important information to lending institutions without any supporting documentation and (4) improperly found that Marguerite O\u2019Brien acquired the interests in the four apartment complexes with her own funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the defendants are unjustly enriched because Marguerite O\u2019Brien holds title to the family home in Avon. The plaintiff, noting that the defendants purchased the property as joint tenants in 1989, claims that Jeremiah O\u2019Brien subsequently transferred his interest to his wife without consideration for the purpose of avoiding his creditors. The plaintiff argues that the court, in refusing to impose a constructive trust on one half of Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s interest in the Avon property, improperly credited the testimony that Marguerite O\u2019Brien paid a substantial portion of the purchase price and paid for substantial renovations to the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The plaintiff is challenging the court\u2019s findings of fact. With respect to Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s entitlement to the manager\u2019s return, the court specifically found that she \u201cparticipated in the decisions as to whether or not to sell the properties\u201d and that \u201cshe was personally liable for the debts of the partnership.\u201d Moreover, the court found that \u201cMarguerite O\u2019Brien signed the loan documents for all of the properties and guaranteed loans for each of the properties, creating a total potential personal liability of $1.3 million. When the properties needed additional moneys for renovations, Marguerite O\u2019Brien provided it. When the income from a property was insufficient to pay all of the investors the promised rate of return, Marguerite O\u2019Brien deferred her own distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>With respect to Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s investments in the properties, the court found that she invested $248,000 as a limited partner and $2000 as a general partner in Eastbrook Towers, $100,000 for her interest in the Congress Apartments, $145,000 for her interest in Westbrook Towers and $275,000 for her interest in the Regency Apartments. The court found that \u201cMarguerite O\u2019Brien did contribute substantial sums to pinchase her interests in these entities, and Jeremiah O\u2019Brien contributed no moneys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">With respect to Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s interest in the family home in Avon, the court found that although there was a conflict in the evidence as to the amount of cash that the defendants contributed to purchase the home, the evidence was clear that she paid a substantial portion of the purchase price and all of the $200,000 needed to renovate the property. Further, the court noted that Jeremiah O\u2019Brien transferred his interest to his wife in 1990, at the time she paid for the renovations, which was several years before the FDIC obtained the judgment against Jeremiah O\u2019Brien that was subsequently assigned to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">On the basis of those findings of fact, the court concluded that a constructive trust should not be imposed on Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s interests in the apartment complexes because \u201cMarguerite O\u2019Brien is the rightful owner of the interest in these entities by virtue of her cash contributions, her services and her personal assumption of liabilities,\u201d and because the \u201cplaintiff failed to prove the elements of a constructive trust with respect to [the] Avon property.\u201d A court\u2019s findings of fact are binding on this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record. <em>Cavolick </em>v. <em>DeSimone, </em>88 Conn. App. 638, 646, 870 A.2d 1147, cert. denied, 274 Conn. 906, 876 A.2d 1198 (2005). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Additionally, to the extent that the court\u2019s findings of fact are dependent on its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, we will not second-guess those findings. The sifting and weighing of evidence is peculiarly the function of the trier. [N]othing in our law is more elementary than that the trier is the final judge of the credibility of witnesses and of the weight to be accorded their testimony. . . . The trier is free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony offered by either party.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Menard </em>v. <em>Gaskell, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 556-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Because the court\u2019s findings of fact have ample support in the evidence, we conclude that those findings are not clearly erroneous. Except for the Regency Apartments, in which Kevin O\u2019Brien also invested $275,000, the testimony of all three O\u2019Briens indicated that Marguerite O\u2019Brien alone invested the aforementioned funds to acquire those apartment complexes in the 1990s. There was no testimony or documentary evidence presented to the court that Jeremiah O\u2019Brien contributed any moneys when those properties were purchased or renovated. To the contrary, the testimony indicated that he lost all of his savings and investments when the Hartford real estate market declined in the early 1990s. The record indicates that he found investors to participate in those real estate transactions; the record does not provide any support for the plaintiffs contention that he managed the properties and was entitled to the manager\u2019s return. All of the testimony indicated that Marguerite O\u2019Brien made key decisions, assumed personal liability for loans and took the risks associated with the ownership of those distressed properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The plaintiff argues that Marguerite O\u2019Brien did not have the funds to invest in the properties and that the testimony at trial provided by all three O\u2019Briens is not supported by any written documentation. According to the plaintiff, their testimony is not to be believed because it was all self-serving. There is no requirement that oral testimony be supported by written documentation in order to be credible, and the plaintiff has provided no authority to support that position. The testimony was extensive and consistent as to the amounts invested by Marguerite O\u2019Brien in the apartment complexes. Although the plaintiff claims that Marguerite O\u2019Brien did not have the funds to invest, there is evidence in the record that she had considerable cash assets at the time of her marriage, that she retained almost $200,000 from the sale of the Manhattan apartment in 1988, that she earned a substantial salary and bonus compensation from Citicorp Securities in 1986 and 1987, that she cashed out her savings incentive program at Citicorp Securities sometime around 1988 and that she received interest income on a yearly basis. Significantly, nothing in the record indicates that the funds for the investments could have come from her husband. He had no assets and received a limited income from O\u2019Brien Realty for services performed. The plaintiffs conclusory statement that Marguerite O\u2019Brien could not have had the moneys to invest, relying on an unsigned financial statement purportedly given by the defendants to a lending institution in 1990, was not persuasive at the time of trial and is not persuasive on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">With respect to the family home in Avon, the plaintiff argues that the court based its decision solely on the testimony that Marguerite O\u2019Brien contributed a substantial portion of the purchase price and that she paid all of the $200,000 needed for the renovations to the home. The plaintiff does not claim that the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>devoid of such evidence. The plaintiff claims, instead, that the court\u2019s findings with respect to the Avon property are clearly erroneous because they were based on the self-serving testimony of the defendants, without any support from documentary evidence. Again, there is no requirement that oral testimony be supported by written documentation in order to be found credible by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The court credited the testimony of the defendants. We will not retry the case. As indicated, there is ample evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s findings of fact. The court\u2019s findings of fact provided the basis for its ultimate conclusion that the requirements for a constructive trust were not established. On the basis of our review of the record and the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, we conclude that the court acted well within its discretion in refusing to impose a constructive trust on Marguerite O\u2019Brien\u2019s assets in order for the plaintiff to satisfy its judgment against her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-12\"> The substitute plaintiff replaced the named plaintiff, Stomawaye Properties, Inc., during trial. We refer in this opinion to the substitute plaintiff as the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\"> The first count of the operative complaint alleged that Jeremiah O\u2019Brien\u2019s transfer of the home to his wife was a fraudulent conveyance. The plaintiff has abandoned that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\"> The deficiency judgment was not rendered against Kevin O\u2019Brien because he filed a petition in bankruptcy, and his debts were discharged in 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> The entities formed to purchase those properties were Eastbrook Limited Partnership, Congress II, LLC, Westbrook Towers, LLC, and 55 Spring Street, LLC, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\"> According to the operating agreement of 55 Spring Street, LLC, Kevin O\u2019Brien is described as the sole managing member, and Marguerite O\u2019Brien is identified, along with Kevin O\u2019Brien, as an \u201coriginating member.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
