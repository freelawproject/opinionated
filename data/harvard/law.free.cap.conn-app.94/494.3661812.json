On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) abused its discretion when it determined that a certain child witness was competent to testify, (2) improperly held that there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35 and (3) abused its discretion when it excused a juror over the defendant\u2019s objection. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim, C,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cohabited<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in an apartment with their daughter, H, and C\u2019s daughter, Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">On June 3, 2001, the defendant told an acquaintance, Lee Hardy, that he believed that C was \u201cmessing around on him.\u201d That evening, the defendant went to the apartment. When the defendant arrived, C was in the living room with H, and her elder daughter Q was in a bathroom taking a shower. After entering the apartment, the defendant asked C who she was \u201cmessing with.\u201d According to H, who was present at the time, when C did not respond, the defendant shot C and told H to go upstairs. H testified that when she went upstairs, she heard gunshots and heard her mother screaming. H then jumped from the window of an upstairs bedroom into the arms of neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Q testified that she heard \u201cloud bangs\u201d while in the shower and heard her mother screaming. She stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>that when she ran downstairs, she saw the defendant standing in front of C, pointing a revolver. C was unarmed and lying in blood on the kitchen floor, screaming and rocking back and forth. Q testified that she saw the defendant fire two gunshots into the ceiling and that as she ran from the apartment, she heard the sound of two more gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">A neighbor, Romana Obaez, testified that she also heard a gunshot and saw H crying as she was opening an upstairs window in the apartment, saying: \u201cMy father [is] killing my . . . mother.\u201d Another neighbor, Louis Tucker, who ran toward the apartment because he heard sounds that he believed to be gunshots, saw the defendant emerge from the residence, speaking on a cellular telephone, uninjured and without any signs of blood on his person. Tucker testified that when he asked the defendant, \u201cWhy did you do this, man?\u201d the defendant stated, \u201cI had to do what I had to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">An acquaintance of the defendant, Andre Newton, testified that the defendant called him from a cellular telephone that evening and asked Newton to pick him up. Newton stated that when he arrived to pick up the defendant, the defendant initially refused the ride, but that later the defendant again called him. When he returned to pick up the defendant, he noticed that the defendant was limping and appeared to have been shot. Newton recalled that the defendant told him that he had killed C. Newton could not remember whether the defendant told him that C had shot him first. Newton stated that he noticed blood on the defendant\u2019s boots, but found no bloodstains in his car after giving the defendant a ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The police search of the murder scene in the apartment revealed a .357 magnum Smith &amp; Wesson revolver near the front door. The police also found copper jacketed projectiles in the kitchen and near the front door. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The state forensic laboratory determined that the projectiles had been fired from the Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson revolver recovered from the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">On June 4, 2001, an autopsy of C\u2019s body revealed that she died from a gunshot wound to the chest. Examination of the gunshot wound and its trajectory suggested that the shooter was three to seven feet away from her. The autopsy also revealed that the victim was shot three times below her right knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">When the defendant was apprehended in August, 2001, he was examined by Anthony J. Coppola, a physician, who testified at trial that the defendant\u2019s left thigh had been grazed by a bullet and that he had scars on his groin and behind his scrotum, consistent with entry and exit bullet wounds. Coppola testified that the wounds could have been inflicted in June, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion when it determined that H was competent to testify. Specifically, the defendant claims that the voir dire of H failed to establish that she could appreciate her duty to tell the truth or the difference between the truth and a lie. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The following additional facts aid our discussion of the defendant\u2019s claim. At trial, the defendant raised the affirmative defense of self-defense. As a consequence, the determination of whether the victim or the defendant was the initial aggressor was probative. As part of its case-in-chief, the state proffered the testimony of H to establish that the defendant murdered C and that the defendant was the initial aggressor. The only witness to the murder, H, was six years old at the time of the incident and eight years old when she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">At trial, the defense requested that the court voir dire H to determine if she was \u201cminimally capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>understanding the duty to tell the truth and communicating the events to which she\u2019ll testify.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During voir dire, H answered in the affirmative when asked if she knew that she must tell the truth while testifying and that the law required her to tell the truth. When asked what it meant to tell the truth she stated, \u201cIt means that you can\u2019t tell no lies.\u201d When asked if she attended church, she replied, \u201cSome of the times.\u201d When she was asked, \u201c[W]hat does it mean if you don\u2019t tell the truth?\u201d she responded, \u201cThings don\u2019t go right if you don\u2019t tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the truth.\u201d When asked if she knew it was important to tell the truth, she replied yes, but stated that she did not know why it was important. Thereafter, the judge held that H was competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">As our Supreme Court has stated, the trial court is in a unique position to determine the competency of a witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boulay, </em>189 Conn. 106, 108, 454 A.2d 724 (1983). On appeal, \u201c[w]e review the court\u2019s determination of competency under an abuse of discretion standard. ... In determining whether the trial court [has] abused its discretion, this court must make every reasonable presumption in favor of [the correctness of] its action. . . . Our review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of the legal discretion vested in it is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have reached the conclusion that it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>81 Conn. App. 294, 299-300, 838 A.2d 1064 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u201cIn determining the competency of a proposed witness the trial court should consider the capacity of the witness to receive correct sense impressions, to comprehend the facts to be developed, to recollect and narrate facts intelligently, and to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth. . . . Regarding the duty of truthfulness, [our Supreme Court] has explained, [t]he competent witness must possess some sense of moral responsibility and comprehend the purpose and character of an oath. ... An oath . . . signifies the undertaking of an obligation to speak the truth at a time when . . . testimony may deeply affect the rights and the character of individuals.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boulay, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 108-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">As to a child witness, our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 534-35, 442 A.2d 927 (1982), opined that age, alone, is not the decisive factor. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the court stated that \u201cthe trial court must consider the proposed witness\u2019 maturity to receive correct impressions by his senses, ability to recollect and narrate intelligently, and ability to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth. . . . The witness should also have an intelligent comprehension of the facts sought to be developed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">As to the measure of capacity, our Supreme Court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 243, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990), adopted the approach used by the federal courts, holding that \u201cwhere the competency of a witness is challenged, the threshold question to be answered by the court is whether the testimony of that witness is minimally credible.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[i]f the testimony of a witness passes the test of minimum credibility, and is otherwise relevant, the testimony is admissible and the weight to be accorded it, in light of the witness\u2019 incapacity, is a question for the trier of fact.\u201d Id., 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In sum, a trial judge must ensure that all witnesses, regardless of age (1) have the capacity to receive correct sense impressions, to comprehend the facts to be developed, to recollect and to narrate facts intelligently and (2) can appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 534-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Here, the defendant does not argue that H lacked the capacity to receive correct sensory impressions, comprehend the facts or narrate facts intelligently. Rather, he argues that the voir dire of H did not establish that H could appreciate her moral duty to tell the truth because it did not establish that she appreciated the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the record reflects that H comprehended not only the distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>between telling the truth and telling a lie, but she also understood the consequences of telling a he, that she was required to tell the truth while testifying and that if one did not tell the truth, \u201c[t]hings don\u2019t go right . . . .\u201d Although H\u2019s statement may not have reflected a developed sense of the penalty for lying under oath, we believe that her response adequately conveyed to the court an understanding that lying under oath has negative consequences. This answer, coupled with her other responses dining voir dire, provided the court with an adequate basis on which to exercise its discretion to permit H to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Our Supreme Court has upheld a court\u2019s finding of competency of a child witness to testify on arguably less compelling facts than the ones at hand. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 521, the court held that a ten year old boy was competent to testify even though he \u201cadmitted little understanding of [the] essential obligation [of an oath], that he admitted not knowing what it meant not to tell a lie . . . admitted that he did not know what it meant to tell the truth, that he indicated that his limited understanding of the oath was based upon instruction by the [s]tate\u2019s [a]ttomey and that he agreed that he was parroting what he had been told.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 534. The court noted, however, \u201cthat he indicated that telling a he would get him into trouble . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court acknowledged that a trial judge makes the decision of competency on the basis of \u201cthe whole situation, from facts and conduct observed during the examination, as well as from the questions propounded and which stand in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The defendant maintains that <em>Brigandi </em>is inapposite because, unlike the child witness in <em>Brigandi, </em>the court\u2019s voir dire of H did not establish that H acknowledged the \u201cconnection between a lie and . . . punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ment.\u201d Our Supreme Court has stated, however, that \u201c[knowledge of the consequences of perjury is not necessarily a prerequisite to competency . . . especially where the witness has demonstrated an understanding of a duty to tell the truth.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boulay, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 110. We believe that H\u2019s statements during the voir dire were sufficient to establish that she understood there would be consequences for not telling the truth and that she had a duty to tell the truth while testifying. Although H stated that she did not know why it was important to tell the truth, she did acknowledge that she had to tell the truth while testifying and that if she failed to tell the truth, \u201c[t]hings [would not] go right . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the court\u2019s finding of competency was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Next, the defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for carrying a pistol without a permit, in violation of \u00a7 29-35. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. On June 1, 2001, two days before the murder of C, the defendant took a loaded .357 magnum Smith &amp; Wesson revolver from his friend, Newton. A .357 magnum Smith &amp; Wesson revolver also was recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ered by the police on June 3, 2001, during the police search of the murder scene, and forensic testing revealed that five of the six discharged<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> cartridges at the murder scene had been fired from that revolver. Although Newton testified that the revolver recovered from the scene looked like the revolver the defendant took from him on June 1, 2001, he could not state with certainty that the revolver found at the scene was the same revolver the defendant had taken from him. No evidence introduced at trial, however, indicated that C owned a revolver or kept a revolver at the apartment. Furthermore, there was evidence at trial that no persons other than C and her two daughters lived in the apartment while the defendant lived there.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 29-35, it is a crime for a person to carry a pistol or revolver without a valid permit, except if the person is within his dwelling or place of business.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the court found that the defendant resided in the apartment, the court charged the jury that the state was required to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant carried a revolver upon his person while outside his dwelling house and that he did not have a permit to do so.\u201d The court stated, however, that \u201c[while] it is not a crime to have the weapon in the dwelling house under this statute, [one] may consider that ... as evidence as to whether [the defendant] brought it to [the apartment] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The defendant concedes that there was sufficient evidence at trial to establish that he possessed a revolver at some time on June 3,2001, in the apartment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>without a permit. The defendant claims, however, that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of a violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a) because there was no evidence to explain how he came into possession of a .357 magnum Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson revolver in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>75 Conn. App. 447, 450-51, 817 A.2d 122, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 919, 822 A.2d 244 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we believe that the jury\u2019s determination that the defendant carried a pistol, without a peimit, near or to the apartment was supported by the evidence at trial. The jury reasonably could have found that C did not have a revolver in her residence and reasonably could have inferred that the .357 magnum Smith &amp; Wesson revolver found at the murder scene was the same revolver the defendant had taken from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Newton some time before the murder. Additionally, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that after taking the revolver from Newton, the defendant carried it to the apartment, in violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a). Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for carrying a pistol without a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in dismissing a juror over the defendant\u2019s objection. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">At trial, the state introduced the testimony of Hardy, an acquaintance of the defendant. Hardy testified that while he was driving around with the defendant on the day of the murder, the defendant disclosed to him that he believed C was \u201cmessing around on him.\u201d After Hardy testified, one of the jurors, J,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> informed the court that he recognized Hardy because Hardy was his neighbor in the 1970s and 1980s.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> J stated that although he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>spoke with Hardy on occasion and played basketball <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>with him in a park, he was not close to him and did not socialize with him. He also stated that his mother knew Hardy\u2019s mother, but he had not seen Hardy in a long time. When asked, \u201cDo you think that knowing Mr. Hardy would influence you toward one side or another?\u201d J stated that he did not know how it would affect him and that it might not influence him. On further inquiry, however, J stated, \u201cProbably, certain things maybe I wouldn\u2019t believe him .... [J]ust as an example, say he borrowed money and he say he would give it back on a certain day. I wouldn\u2019t really look forward to getting it on the certain day.\u201d The court then asked J, \u201cDo you have any reason to think that the type of testimony he gave here today \u2014 that your knowledge of his history and as a neighbor fourteen or more years ago <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>would \u2014 would affect your decision?\u201d J replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Thereafter, the court, finding that J had formed a \u201clow opinion\u201d of the state\u2019s witness, due to previous interactions, dismissed juror J.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u201c[T]he trial court has wide latitude in fashioning the proper response to allegations of juror bias. . . . We [therefore] have limited our role, on appeal, to a consideration of whether the trial court\u2019s review of an alleged jury misconduct can fairly be characterized as an abuse of its discretion [and] have reserved the right to find an abuse of discretion in the highly unusual case in which such an abuse has occurred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>262 Conn. 718, 727, 817 A.2d 100 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The highly deferential standard we afford to a trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss a juror for bias was made evident by our Supreme Court in <em>Rokus </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>191 Conn. 62, 71, 463 A.2d 252 (1983). In <em>Rokus, </em>our Supreme Court concluded that a trial court properly excused a juror after the juror expressed concern only that he recognized a police officer who was going to testify. Id. Our Supreme Court upheld the decision of the trial court to dismiss the juror even though the juror stated that he did not know the officer very well, had not seen him in a couple of years and that he would not give any undue preference to the officer\u2019s testimony. Id., 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Here, J acknowledged that he recognized Hardy, but had not seen him in many years. Unlike in <em>Rokus, </em>however, the juror in this case expressed his concern that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>he may not believe everything Hardy had to say and did not know how his previous interactions with Hardy would influence his opinion of Hardy\u2019s testimony. As we have stated, \u201c[i]t is within a judge\u2019s discretion to dismiss a juror where . . . that juror possesses a specialized area of knowledge beyond the typical juror that may unduly influence jury deliberations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>57 Conn. App. 356, 364, 748 A.2d 891 (2000). Accordingly, the court\u2019s dismissal of the juror was a reasonable exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-9\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of children, we decline to identify the children of the victim or others through whom the children\u2019s identities may be ascertained. Hereinafter, the initial C shall refer to the victim. The initials H and Q shall refer to the victim\u2019s two daughters. H is also the daughter of the defendant. The father of Q shall be referred to by the initial T.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-10\"> The evidence at trial established that although the apartment was not the only place the defendant resided, he spent many nights there and kept clothing there. As such, the court found that it was his dwelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\"> Outside the presence of the jury, the follow colloquy ensued during the voir dire of H:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: . . .

The witness is quite competent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\"> The defendant also refers to inconsistencies in H\u2019s testimony to support his contention that the court improperly held that she was competent to testify. This claim lacks merit because \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s focus on the inconsistencies in the witness\u2019 testimony is in essence an attack on the witness\u2019 credibility. . . . Inconsistencies in testimony and witness credibility are matters that are within the exclusive purview of the [trier of fact] to resolve at trial. . . . inconsistencies . . . neither demonstrate that the witness does not have an intelligent comprehension of the facts, nor prevent the witness from meeting the minimum credibility requirement. . . . Inconsistencies do not render a witness\u2019 testimony incredible as a matter of law. . . . Furthermore, a failure to demonstrate an intelligible recollection of the facts at issue can later be rectified through the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gainer, </em>51 Conn.
