On appeal, the defendant claims that the court misinterpreted the language of the arbitration award. We hold that the court properly confirmed the award, but conclude that in doing so, the court improperly failed to consider the arbitrator\u2019s letter of clarification. We affirm the judgment of the trial court on alternate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">The following facts are relevant to this opinion. The parties entered into an asset purchase agreement in which the plaintiff was to purchase certain assets of the defendant\u2019s vending and food service business for the total price of $700,000. The agreement provided that the plaintiff would pay $554,000 of the purchase price at the closing and would execute a promissory note for the remaining $146,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 2 of the agreement, the promissory note would be subject to two postclosing adjustments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the sale was completed, a dispute arose between the parties as to the calculation of the postclosing adjustments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreement contained an arbitration provision under which the parties agreed to submit all claims arising under the agreement to binding arbitration in Hartford in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties submitted their dispute to arbitration in accordance with the agreement. On June 4, 2003, the arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>issued his award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiff sought payment from the defendant of $24,876.32 plus interest, the sum it believed it was owed under the award. The defendant objected to the plaintiffs interpretation of the award. He asserted that the award did not require him to pay $24,876.32 because that amount was discharged with the promissory note.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff notified the arbitrator by a letter dated November 26, 2003, that the parties were in disagreement over the award and asked him to clarify its meaning. The arbitrator responded with a letter addressed to both parties\u2019 counsel, dated December 3, 2003, which stated: \u201cThe Award rendered on this matter speaks for itself. I assume you wish to avoid entering the Award as a judgment in court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and have requested written clarification of the Award. Paragraph one of the Award directs [the defendant] to pay to [the plaintiff] the sum of $24,876.32 plus interest. The penultimate paragraph of the Award directs [the defendant] to pay to [the plaintiff] the sum of $400 and to pay to the [American Arbitration] Association the sum of $700. The paragraphs between the first paragraph and the penultimate paragraph make no monetary award to either party; the note held by [the defendant] is found to be discharged and satisfied in full and [the plaintiff] is found to be entitled to no compensation for the equipment not owned by [the defendant]. I hope this letter will assist you in avoiding litigation in the enforcement of the Award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Following the arbitrator\u2019s letter, the plaintiff again sought payment of the $24,876.32 from the defendant. The defendant objected to the arbitrator\u2019s authority to issue the letter and refused payment. On May 20, 2004, the plaintiff brought an action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417 to confirm the arbitration award. The defendant filed a response to the application to confirm on June 24, 2004, arguing that the court should confirm his interpretation of the original award without regard to the arbitrator\u2019s subsequent letter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">On August 5, 2004, the court issued a memorandum of decision confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award as interpreted by the plaintiff, requiring the defendant to pay $24,876.32 plus interest. The court based its decision on its determination that the defendant had failed to file any motion to vacate, modify or correct the award within thirty days pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-420. In its opinion, the court noted that both parties had consented to the clarification letter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>permitted reargument on the basis of the defendant\u2019s claim that he had never consented to the clarification. Following reargument, on September 9, 2004, the court issued a modified order upholding its previous decision, but noting that any evidence concerning the clarification had been disregarded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The defendant claims on appeal that the court misinterpreted the language of the arbitration award and thereby confirmed, essentially, the \u201cwrong\u201d award. The plaintiff contends that the court properly confirmed the award and that the arbitrator\u2019s letter of clarification substantiates the court\u2019s interpretation of the award. We agree with the plaintiff and hold that the court properly confirmed the award. We conclude, however, that the court improperly failed to consider the arbitrator\u2019s letter of clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">We first discuss the court\u2019s order confirming the award. The court granted the plaintiffs application to confirm the arbitration award on the basis of the defendant\u2019s failure to file a motion to vacate, modify or correct within thirty days pursuant to \u00a7 52-420 (b). General Statutes \u00a7 52-417 provides that when a party to an arbitration files a timely application for an order confirming an arbitration award, the court shall grant the order unless the award is vacated, modified or corrected.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Section 52-420 (b) requires that a motion to vacate, modify or correct be filed within thirty days of the notice of the award to the moving party.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We agree with the court that the plaintiff had filed a timely application to confirm the arbitration award and that, even construing the defendant\u2019s pleading entitled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Response to Application to Confirm Arbitration Award\u201d as a motion to vacate, modify or correct the award,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the defendant failed to file any such motion within thirty days as required by \u00a7 52-420 (b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because no motion to modify, vacate or correct was filed, the court was correct in concluding that the language of \u00a7 52-417 required it to confirm the award. We do not believe that \u00a7 52-417 fully resolves the issues on appeal, however, because the defendant does not contest the court\u2019s authority to confirm the award per se. He claims to object only to the court\u2019s interpretation of the language of the award confirmed. Accordingly, we address the defendant\u2019s argument in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Before we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court misconstrued the award, we are compelled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>confront what we believe is a superseding issue on appeal, namely, the propriety of the arbitrator\u2019s letter of clarification. Throughout the proceedings before the trial court, the defendant claimed that the arbitrator was without jurisdiction to clarify the award because the time period for rendering a final award had expired.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court amended its order to exclude consideration of the clarification based on the defendant\u2019s arguments. The plaintiff claims that the court\u2019s disregard of the clarification was improper. We agree and conclude that the arbitrator was acting within his authority when he rendered the clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The question of whether the arbitrator had the authority to issue a clarification of his final award, and thus, whether the court in confirming the award was bound to consider the clarification, is a matter of law that is subject to plenary review by this court. See <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Trotta, </em>7 Conn. App. 272, 274-75, 508 A.2d 799, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 806, 512 A.2d 229 (1986). Although the parties based their arguments regarding that issue solely on state law, we conclude that the contract between the parties is one involving commerce<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>accordingly, look to federal precedent for guidance in our analysis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Compare <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. Collective, </em>271 Conn. 474, 484 &amp; n.9, 857 A.2d 893 (2004) (when both federal and state law applied to arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>clause, court looked to federal doctrine of functus officio to determine court\u2019s authority to remand award to arbitrator for clarification), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 974, 125 S. Ct. 1826, 161 L. Ed. 2d 723 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Federal courts consistently have applied the common-law doctrine of functus officio to arbitration awards governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq. See, e.g., <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Omaha Indemnity Co., </em>943 F.2d 327, 331-33 (3d Cir. 1991). The doctrine provides that, as a general rule, once an arbitrator has issued a final award, having fulfilled his function, he is without authority to reexamine it. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ameritech Corp., </em>200 F.3d 967, 977 (6th Cir. 2000); <em>Hyle </em>v. <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., </em>198 F.3d 368, 370 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Omaha Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 331. The doctrine originated at a time when judges were hostile to arbitration and distrusted arbitrators\u2019 independence. See <em>Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics &amp; Allied Workers International Union </em>v. <em>Excelsior Foundry Co., </em>56 F.3d 844, 846-47 (7th Cir. 1995); <em>La Vale Plaza, Inc. </em>v. <em>R.S. Noonan, Inc., </em>378 F.2d 569, 572 (3d Cir. 1967). Exceptions to the doctrine of functus officio have developed over time as arbitration has become more favored as a means of efficient dispute resolution. Federal precedent is now clear that an arbitrator may revisit a final award \u201c[wjhere the award, although seemingly complete, leaves doubt whether the submission has been fully executed [such that] an ambiguity arises which the arbitrator is entitled to clarify.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. Collective, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 485. In examining arbitration awards, courts have noted that an award is ambiguous if it \u201cis susceptible to more than one interpretation.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ameritech Corp., </em>supra, 977; see also <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>v. <em>Silver State Disposal Service, Inc., </em>109 F.3d 1409, 1411 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The award at issue in the present case contained contradictory language about whether the defendant was required to pay the plaintiff $24,876.32 or whether the amount was discharged along with the promissory note. Because it did not indicate clearly what each party was required to do, the arbitrator was within his authority to issue a letter of clarification. Cf. <em>Barbier </em>v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., </em>948 F.2d 117 (2d Cir. 1991).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The arbitrator\u2019s judgment that a clarification was warranted is to be given deference by the court. See <em>Teamsters Local 312 </em>v. <em>Matlack, Inc., </em>118 F.3d 985, 994 (3d Cir. 1997) (\u201c[t]hat the arbitrator chose to use such a procedure to protect the integrity of the arbitration process should not be subject to judicial second guessing\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cBecause we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution. . . . [E]very reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the [arbitral] award and of the arbitrators\u2019 acts and proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Civil Service Employees Affiliates, Local 760, </em>88 Conn. App. 559, 566-67, 870 A.2d 473 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the arbitrator\u2019s letter did not modify any substantive content of the original award, but merely explained its meaning. \u201c[An arbitrator\u2019s] resolution of such an ambiguity is not within the policy which forbids an arbitrator to redetermine an issue which he has already decided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>for there is no opportunity for redetermination on the merits of what has already been decided. ... In such a circumstance, the [arbitrator] will act only to remove the cloud of doubt . . . and will in no way reopen the merits of the controversy.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. Collective, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 486. The clarification by the arbitrator in the present case served the practical purpose of resolving the parties\u2019 conflict without the need for additional litigation. Furthermore, case law is clear that when an exception to the doctrine of functus officio applies, an arbitrator may revisit an award even over the objection of one of the parties. <em>La Vale Plaza, Inc. </em>v. <em>R.S. Noonan, Inc., </em>supra, 378 F.2d 573. Courts have noted, in fact, that \u201c[t]o hold that a joint request is required before an arbitrator may clarify or complete an award would empower a party that would benefit from an error to prevent its correction.\u201d <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Silver State Disposal Service, Inc., </em>supra, 109 F.3d 1412. Indeed, permitting an arbitrator to issue a clarification unilaterally is consistent with the purpose of arbitration to serve as an efficient and cost effective means of dispute resolution. The court\u2019s decision to disregard the clarification in response to the defendant\u2019s claim that he never consented to it, therefore, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In light of our analysis in part II, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court misinterpreted the language of the original award when it granted the application to confirm. We hold that the court did not misconstrue the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The standard of review applied to the construction of an arbitration award is the same as that applied to the construction of a judgment. <em>See Phoenix Windows, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Viking Construction, Inc., </em>88 Conn. App. 74, 77, 868 A.2d 102, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 932, 873 A.2d 1001 (2005). The construction of an arbitration award, therefore, is a question of law subject to plenary review. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the court misconstrued the award implies that an ambiguity existed in the award\u2019s language that needed to be resolved. The defendant asks this court to resolve that ambiguity in his favor, yet he misses the crucial point that a court does not have the authority either to enforce an ambiguous award; see <em>Americas Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Seagull Compania Naviera, S.A., </em>774 F.2d 64, 67 (2d Cir. 1985) (\u201c[a]lthough judicial review of an arbitration award is very narrowly limited, a court should not attempt to enforce an award that is ambiguous or indefinite\u201d); <em>or </em>to resolve an ambiguity. <em>Bell Aerospace Co. Division of Textron, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), </em>500 F.2d 921, 924 (2d Cir. 1974) (\u201c[c]onstruing ambiguous provisions of an arbitration award is the proper province of the arbitrator, not the courts\u201d). Either action \u201cwould serve only to undermine the authority of arbitrators, and to entangle the courts in disputes which the parties originally had agreed to settle privately.\u201d <em>New York Bus Tours, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kheel, </em>864 F.2d 9, 13 (2d Cir. 1988); see also <em>U.S. Energy Corp. </em>v. <em>Nukem, Inc., </em>400 F.3d 822, 831 (10th Cir. 2005); <em>Teamsters Local 312 </em>v. <em>Matlack, Inc., </em>supra, 118 F.3d 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">When faced with an ambiguous award, a court usually will remand to the arbitrator for clarification. See, e.g., <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s &amp; Cos. Collective, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 486. In this instance, however, remand would be a pointless gesture because the arbitrator already had issued a sufficient clarification prior to the filing of the motion to confirm. See, e.g., <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255, 1264 (5th Cir. 1980), on appeal after remand, 695 F.2d 531 (11th Cir. 1983). The arbitrator, in a letter dated December 3, 2003, restated his original award in a way that clarified its terms for the parties. Because that clarification resolved any potential ambiguity in the award, the court was obligated to confirm the award as clarified by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-5\"> Postclosing adjustment I addressed the value of the inventory, cash and equipment transferred in the sale. The defendant represented to the plaintiff that the value of the inventory, cash and equipment was $84,000. Postclosing actjustment I required, inter alia, that the promissory note be decreased in the event that the actual value of the inventory, cash and equipment was less than $84,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Postclosing adjustment II corresponded to the defendant\u2019s projection of sales revenues that the plaintiff could expect to realize in the year following the agreement. The defendant represented that the business would likely achieve $1,207,209 in revenues in the year following the agreement. Postclosing adjustment II provided that the $146,000 promissory note would be reduced by an agreed on formula in the event that the defendant\u2019s estimate was overstated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\"> The plaintiff claimed that it accidentally had paid an additional $24,876.32 to the defendant for the value of the inventory, cash and equipment, where that amount was already included in the value of the promissory note. Furthermore, the plaintiff demanded that the promissory note be adjusted downward on the basis of the overvaluation of the inventory, cash and equipment as well as the projected revenues for the year following the sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\"> Section 17.11 of the agreement provides: \u201cArbitration. Any disputes, disagreements or claims arising hereunder, or with respect to the interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement, with express exception of any claims of Buyer arising under \u00a7 10, shall be promptly referred to arbitration in Hartford, Connecticut in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Seller and Buyer agree that the arbitrator(s) in any arbitration conducted under this \u00a7 17.11 may not award, and neither Buyer nor Seller may claim, punitive or extra-contractual damages or attorneys\u2019 fees. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be a conclusive determination of the matter, shall be binding upon the parties, and shall be enforceable by application to the federal or state courts of Connecticut. Seller and Buyer each shall pay one-half of the arbitration and arbitrators\u2019 fees and all of the respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b32-5\"> The award stated in relevant part: \u201cWith respect to [the plaintiffs] first claim, the payment of $24,876.32 paid by [the plaintiff] to [the defendant] subsequent to postclosing I, I find such payment was made in error. Accordingly, I award the sum of . . . $24,876.32 to [the plaintiff], plus interest</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u201cThe postclosing I adjustment was determined to be $24,876.32. However, [the defendant] asserts that the value of excess equipment was properly excluded. ... I find that the purchase agreement obligated [the plaintiff] to purchase the excess equipment; only the issue of its value was left to postclosing I. ... I find the value of the excess equipment to be zero. However, I also find the failure of [the plaintiff] to take the excess equipment (i.e., to remove it from [the defendant\u2019s] warehouse) to be a breach of the agreement. I find the damages for such breach to be $3000. Nevertheless, I also find the damages to be part of the postclosing I adjustment, increasing the amount from $24,876.32 to $27,876.32. Accordingly, the installment note of $146,000 must be reduced by $56,123.68 as required by \u00a7 2 (b) of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u201cThe installment note must be further reduced by the postclosing II adjustment because net sales were less than 100 percent of the total projected sales as of the end of the first twelve months. ... I find that the downward adjustment to the installment note required by postclosing II exceeded the face amount of the note. Accordingly, I award zero to [the defendant] with respect to the note and declare the note to be discharged in full.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\"> The defendant\u2019s attorney sent a letter dated July 28, 2003, to the plaintiff, which stated in relevant part: \u201cFrankly, we do not understand the basis for your demand.

Our case law is unclear as to whether a letter of clarification would reinstate the thirty day limitation period for motions to modify, vacate or confirm. See <em>Wu </em>v. <em>Chang, </em>264 Conn. 307, 312-13, 823 A.2d 1197 (2003); <em>Wolf v. Gould, </em>10 Conn.

We need not resolve that issue, however, because the defendant\u2019s objection to the clarification was not made known to the court until he filed his response to the plaintiffs application to confirm more than six months after the letter of clarification was issued. We further note that the defendant\u2019s letter to the plaintiff objecting to the arbitrator\u2019s letter of clarification was not a motion to modify, vacate or correct because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>it was never sent to either the trial court or to the arbitrator.

Accordingly, the contract was for a transaction involving interstate commerce under the arbitration act. See, e.g., <em>Creative Telecommunications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Breeden, </em>120 F. Sup. 2d 1225, 1231 (D. Haw. 1999) (sale of assets agreement between Hawaii corporation and Nevada corporation, when assets remained in Hawaii, involved \u201ccommerce\u201d as defined in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> Under Connecticut law, an arbitrator\u2019s authority to clarify an award is unclear. Nevertheless, we feel inclined to make the following observation. General Statutes \u00a7 52-417, which sets forth the court\u2019s authority under Connecticut law when ruling on an application to confirm an arbitration award, provides, inter alia, that after a timely application to confirm an arbitral award, \u201c[t]he court . . . <em>shall </em>grant such an order . . . unless the award is vacated, modified or corrected . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) A strict reading of \u00a7 52-417 would suggest that a court is bound to confirm an award in all instances when there has been no motion to vacate, modify or correct. While we are cognizant of the language of \u00a7 52-417, we do not see how it could be interpreted to require a court to confirm an award that contains an ambiguity just because a proper motion was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The federal courts consistently have upheld an arbitrator\u2019s authority to clarify an ambiguous award in cases controlled by the Federal Arbitration Act (arbitration act), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq., despite the absence of any such authority set forth in the arbitration act. See <em>Bell Aerospace Co. Division of Textron, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), </em>500 F.2d 921, 924 (2d Cir. 1974); see also <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Omaha Indemnity Co., </em>943 F.2d 327, 333-34 (3d Cir. 1991) (\u201c[although there is no explicit provision in the [arbitration act] for such a remand, courts have uniformly stated that a remand to the arbitration panel is appropriate in cases where the award is ambiguous\u201d). The language of the arbitration act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9, and General Statutes \u00a7 52-417 is virtually identical. On the basis of that comparison, we conclude that a similar result may apply to arbitration awards governed solely by Connecticut law and do not think that permitting an arbitrator to clarify an ambiguity would be contrary to \u00a7 52-417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> We see nothing in the rules of the American Arbitration Association that prohibits an arbitrator from issuing a clarification in this instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
