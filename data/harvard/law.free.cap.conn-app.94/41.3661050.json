The plaintiffs, Randolph Carford and Vidalina Carford, appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered after the granting of the motion filed by the defendant, Empire Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company, to strike both counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly granted the motion to strike because an injured plaintiff need not be a party to an insurance contract or be subrogated to the rights of the insured in order to bring a claim (1) for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing or (2) under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act (CUIPA), General Statutes \u00a7 38a-815 et seq. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The following allegations from the complaint are relevant to the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. On August 11, 2002, the plaintiffs were traveling in a motor home on Interstate 93 southbound in New Hampshire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The driver of a northbound tractor trailer fell asleep, crossed the median and struck the motor home, causing serious injuries to the plaintiffs. Four months prior to the accident, the defendant had issued an insurance policy to the employer of the tractor trailer driver, providing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>employer with liability insurance in the amount of $1 million per accident. The defendant was bound contractually to the driver and his employer under the terms of the insurance policy at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The complaint further alleged that the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 case exceeded the $1 million policy limit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the plaintiffs\u2019 insurance company claimed $99,008.25 for subrogation. Because the defendant had paid $4909.43 to an unknown entity, the plaintiffs and their insurance company reached an agreement in which the remaining $995,090.57 would be divided in order to keep the claims within the defendant\u2019s policy limits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant was informed of that offer by telephone and facsimile in June, 2003, but failed to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The plaintiffs filed their two count complaint on June 26, 2003, claiming in count one that the defendant had breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, contrary to its obligation to deal with the plaintiffs in a fair and reasonable manner, and in count two that the defendant had acted in violation of CUTPA and CUIPA by engaging in unfair acts or practices in the conduct of its business.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 11, 2003, the defendant responded by filing a motion to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in its entirety, asserting that there was no privity of contract between the parties to support the claims. On September 15, 2003, the court granted the motion to strike, stating that \u201cthe plaintiffs assert claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>based upon an insurance contract to which they are not a party and where no subrogation exists.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs did not amend the pleadings and, after the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike, the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant on April 5, 2004. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u201cThe standard of review in an appeal challenging a trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to strike is well established. A motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading, and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court\u2019s ruling is plenary. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. . . . Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jewish Home for the Elderly of Fairfield County, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cantore, </em>257 Conn. 531, 537-38, 778 A.2d 93 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The plaintiffs first argue that an injured plaintiff need not be a party to an insurance contract or be subrogated to the rights of the insured in order to assert a claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing before the liability of the insured has been established. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the . . . duty of good faith and fair dealing is a covenant implied into a contract or a contractual relationship. ... In other words, every contract carries an implied duty requiring that neither party do anything that will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. . . . The covenant of good faith and fair dealing presupposes that the terms and purpose of the contract are agreed upon by the parties and that what is in dispute is a party\u2019s discretionary application or interpretation of a contract term. ... To constitute a breach of [the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing], the acts by which a defendant allegedly impedes the plaintiffs right to receive benefits that he or she reasonably expected to receive under the contract must have been taken in bad faith.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>De La Concha of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>269 Conn. 424, 432-33, 849 A.2d 382 (2004); see also 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 205 (1981) (\u201c[e]veiy contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement\u201d). That requirement applies to insurance contracts: \u201cAn implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing has been applied by [our Supreme Court] in a variety of contractual relationships, including . . . insurance contracts . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buckman </em>v. <em>People Express, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 166, 170-71, 530 A.2d 596 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The plaintiffs do not claim that they are a party to the insurance contract; rather, they assert that a contractual relationship is not necessary for a claim of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Our established law does not support that claim. Connecticut courts repeatedly have held that <em>\u201cthe existence of a contract between the parties is a necessary antecedent to any claim of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Travelers Property &amp; Casualty Corp., </em>261 Conn. 620, 638, 804 A.2d 180 (2002), citing <em>Hoskins </em>v. <em>Titan Value Equities Group, Inc., </em>252 Conn. 789, 793, 749 A.2d 1144 (2000); see also <em>Forte </em>v. <em>Citicorp Mortgage, Inc., </em>90 Conn. App. 727, 733, 881 A.2d 386 (2005); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Guimaraes, </em>78 Conn. App. 760, 773, 829 A.2d 422 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">As our case law makes clear, no claim of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing will he for conduct that is outside of a contractual relationship. Notwithstanding that case law, the plaintiffs assert that because they offered to settle the case within the policy limits, the insurer\u2019s duty to the insured is transferred to the injured party. The plaintiffs offer no authority in support of that novel assertion. Rather, our authority recognizes a common-law duty of good faith and fair dealing between an insurer and its insured. See, e.g., <em>Buckman </em>v. <em>People Express, Inc., </em>supra, 205 Conn. 170 (insurer owes common-law duty of good faith to insured independent from applicable statute). That duty, however, does not extend to a third party. <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Travelers Property &amp; Casualty Corp., </em>supra, 261 Conn. 642 (in context of settling claims, insurer owes no fiduciary duty to third party claimant because \u201csuch a duty would interfere with the insurer\u2019s ability to act primarily for the benefit of <em>its </em>insured\u201d [emphasis in original]). A third party claimant is subrogated to the rights of the insured, and is entitled to bring an action against an insurance company, only <em>after </em>judgment. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because there was no contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>relationship between the parties, nor any judgment leading to subrogation, the defendant owed no duty of good faith and fair dealing to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs\u2019 first argument therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In their second argument, the plaintiffs assert that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the second count of the complaint because an injured party need not be a party to an insurance contract, or be subrogated to the rights of the insured, in order to assert CUTPA and CUIPA violations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">It is well established that CUTPA affords a private cause of action. See <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>238 Conn. 183, 212, 680 A.2d 1243 (1996) (\u201cCUTPA provides a private cause of action to \u2018[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a [prohibited] method, act or practice . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 42-HOg [a]\u201d). The Supreme Court applied that provision to CUIPA in <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 509 A.2d 11 (1986), affirming \u201cthe existence of a private cause of action under CUTPA to enforce alleged CUIPA violations.\u201d Id., 663. Thus, if the plaintiffs properly allege CUIPA violations, they may have a cause of action under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The plaintiffs specifically contend that the defendant acted in violation of CUIPA in that it (1) \u201cfailed to acknowledge and act with reasonable promptness upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies\u201d; (2) \u201cfailed to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear\u201d; (3) \u201ccompelled the insured to institute litigation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>recover amounts due under an insurance policy by refusing to make any offer in settlement of the claim\u201d; and (4) \u201cfailed to provide promptly a reasonable explanation for denial of the claim.\u201d Those allegations are based on subsections (b), (f), (g) and (n) of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6) of CUIPA, in which unfair claim settlement practices are defined.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The critical question with respect to the second count, then, is whether under CUTPA, a third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>claimant may, prior to obtaining a judgment against the tortfeasor, assert a CUIPA violation against the insurer alleging unfair claim settlement practices.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither this court nor our Supreme Court has resolved the issue of whether CUTPA allows third party claimants to assert a CUIPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">CUIPA is based on a legislative proposal in 1944 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (association), which Connecticut enacted in 1955. \u201cThe model act was amended in 1971 to include a section regulating unfair claim settlement practices, and this state enacted these new provisions in 1973. \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 659; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1973 Sess., pp. 46, 97; 16 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1973 Sess., p. 1214, remarks of Senator Edmund P. Power. The specific language of \u00a7 38a-816 (6) is not enlightening, and the legislative history of the statute is silent as to a third party\u2019s right to bring a claim against an insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Similar laws based on the association\u2019s proposal were enacted by a majority of the states, most of which have interpreted their law to preclude a private cause of action to <em>any </em>party and allowing only administrative enforcement. See, e.g., <em>A &amp; E Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Nationwide </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>798 F.2d 669, 675 (4th Cir. 1986) (\u201c [o]ur reading of Virginia law accords with the position of several state courts that the model unfair practices legislation proposed by the [association], as enacted in those states, does not create a private right of action\u201d), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1091, 107 S. Ct. 1302, 94 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1987); <em>Moradi-Shalal </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Cos., </em>46 Cal. 3d 287, 304, 758 P.2d 58, 250 Cal. Rptr. 116 (1988) (en banc) (\u201c[n]either [of the applicable sections of the California Insurance Code] was intended to create a private civil cause of action against an insurer that commits one of the various acts listed in [the unfair claims settlement provision of the Code]\u201d). Most of the states that have allowed a private cause of action have done so only for insureds or for third parties only after a judicial determination. See <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Zebrowski, </em>706 So. 2d 275, 277 (Fla. 1997) (stating that the applicable Florida statute \u201cauthorizes a third party to file a bad-faith claim directly against the liability insurer . . . upon obtaining a judgment in excess of the policy limits\u201d); <em>Hovet </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>135 N.M. 397, 401, 404, 89 P.3d 69 (2004) (noting that New Mexico legislature \u201cparted company with the majority [of other states] and created a private right of action for those injured by an insurer\u2019s unfair claims practices,\u201d but only after a \u201cjudicial determination of fault in favor of the third party and against the insured\u201d); cf. <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>23 Cal. 3d 880, 892, 592 P.2d 329, 153 Cal. Rptr. 842 (1979) (maintaining private cause of action to third parties, but only after \u201cthe conclusion of the action by the third party claimant against the insured\u201d), overruled by <em>Moradi-Shalal </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Cos., </em>supra, 304.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Only a distinct minority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of states have allowed a third party claimant a private cause of action against the insurer. See, e.g., <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. Reeder, 763 S.W.2d 116, 118 (Ky. 1988) (explicitly stating that, notwithstanding decisions of other states, court relies on Kentucky\u2019s interpretation of unfair claims settlement practices act in holding that \u201cprivate citizens are not specifically excluded by the statute from maintaining a private right of action against an insurer by third party claimants\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In 1990, the association expressly considered for the first time whether the model act should allow a private cause of action and rejected the idea. 14 G. Couch, Insurance (3d Ed. Rev. 2005) \u00a7 204:51, p. 204-68. The unequivocal rejection was accompanied by a drafting note, stating that \u201c[a] jurisdiction choosing to provide for a private cause of action should consider a different statutory scheme. This [claims settlement practices act] is inherently inconsistent with a private cause of action. This is merely a clarification of original intent and not indicative of any change in position.\u201d Id., p. 204-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">There is also an overwhelming number of Connecticut Superior Court cases that disallow third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>CUIPA claims through CUTPA when there is no subrogation or judicial determination in the third party\u2019s favor against the insured. See, e.g., <em>Asmus Electric, Inc. </em>v. <em>G.M.K. Contract, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 489527 (February 25, 2005); <em>Estate of Ridgaway </em>v. <em>Cowles &amp; Connell, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Middlesex, Docket No. 103516 (May 21, 2004); <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Kruk, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 468089 (April 29, 2003) (34 Conn.

L. Rptr. 325); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 308821 (May 15, 1987) (2 C.S.C.R. 648);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> see also <em>Hipsky </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>304 F. Sup. 2d 284, 292 &amp; n.13 (D. Conn. 2004), citing <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Travelers Property &amp; Casualty Corp., </em>supra, 261 Conn. 620, and Superior Court decisions in concluding that third party claimant has no private cause of action under CUTPA and CUIPA for alleged unfair settlement practices by insurer prior to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Because the plaintiffs here did not assert a separate cause of action solely under CUIPA, we do not decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>whether CUIPA allows a private cause of action. We do conclude that the right to assert a private cause of action for CUIPA violations through CUTPA does not extend to third parties absent subrogation or a judicial determination of the insured\u2019s liability. To hold otherwise would create confusion, increased and multiple litigation both generally and within specific cases, the potential coercion of settlements when the insured\u2019s liability has not been and may never be established, and an inherent conflict of interest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judicial creation of such a right would not further the policy underlying CUIPA and CUTPA. Rather, it is the province of the legislature to create new rights and remedies contained within the highly regulated industry of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\"> Randolph Carford was the owner and operator of the motor home, and Vidalina Carford was a passenger in the right front seat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\"><em> </em>Vidalina Carford\u2019s medical expenses were approximately $17,000, while Randolph Carford\u2019s medical expenses exceeded $200,000. The plaintiffs claimed that, combined with their future medical expenses, intense pain and suffering, extreme mental and emotional injury, reduced ability to pursue and enjoy life\u2019s activities, lost time at work, reduced earning capacity and loss of consortium, the value of their case was considerably more than the sum of the medical expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\"> The agreement provided that $49,500 would be paid to another insurer that was seeking subrogation, while the plaintiffs would receive the remaining $945,590.57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-9\"> Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged four specific violations in count two of the complaint.

Co. </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>supra, 763 S.W.2d 117, the jury had returned an $11,000 verdict, which had been satisfied prior to the appeal. In affirming that the statute entitled the third party plaintiff to a private cause of action, though, the Supreme Court of Kentucky did not discuss whether a prior judgment against the insured was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\"> We agree with the court in <em>Thompson </em>that \u201cCUIPA does not clearly create rights in the third party claimant against the insurer. . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 38a-816 (6) can properly be read to impose on the company claim settlement obligations in favor of the insured, or a claimant or beneficiary claiming under the policy. This interpretation is consistent with the nature of insurance policies to create contractual rights and duties between the insured and the insurer. That fundamental relationship would be distorted if the insurer also had a duty to third party claimants to settle claims. It is predictable that whenever the insurer declines to settle, the injured third party claimant will threaten the carrier with an independent lawsuit.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 2 C.S.C.R. 650.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b81-13\"> As we noted previously, our Supreme Court has stated in the context of settling claims that an insurer owes no fiduciary duty to a third party claimant because \u201csuch a duty would interfere with the insurer\u2019s ability to act primarily for the benefit of <em>its </em>insured.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Travelers Property &amp; Casualty Corp., </em>supra, 261 Conn. 642.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
