We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The basic question of law underlying the plaintiffs claims is whether the court determined the true and actual value of the property, for the purposes of \u00a7 12-117a, as required by the Common Interest Ownership Act (CIOA), General Statutes \u00a7 47-200 et seq., particularly General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-202<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>47-204 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cCIOA is a comprehensive legislative scheme that governs the creation, organization and management of all forms of common interest communities.\u201d <em>Fruin </em>v. <em>Colonnade One at Old Greenwich Ltd. Partnership, </em>237 Conn. 123, 130, 676 A.2d 369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The court agreed that CIOA applies and that \u00a7 47-204 (a) governs the valuation of a cooperative. The defendant does not argue that a cooperative is not a common interest community or that \u00a7 47-204 (a) is not applicable. Instead, the defendant limits its argument to the assertion that the court did not have to use a cost approach method of valuation, even if the property were a special purpose property,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but could use market sales as urged by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s basic argument is that the plaintiff is attempting to retry the case by insisting on its appraiser\u2019s method of appraisal, rather than accepting that the court could, on the basis of its assessment of the credibility of the two opposing appraisers, choose the method of valuation used by the defendant\u2019s appraiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We conclude that the court was correct, as a matter of law, in its determination that \u00a7 47-204 (a) controls the assessment involved in this appeal. We further conclude that, as a matter of law, the court\u2019s adoption of a comparable sales method of valuation, which uses the average individual unit value and multiplies it by the number of units of which the cooperative is comprised, to establish the value of the plaintiffs entire parcel of real estate, violates \u00a7 47-204 (a), and, therefore, the judgment of the court must be set aside and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-64 (a) provides that all nonexempt real estate \u201cshall be liable to taxation at a uniform percentage of its present true and actual valuation . . . to be determined by the assessors . . . .\u201d \u201cEach . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>municipality shall assess all property for purposes of the local property tax at a uniform rate of seventy per cent of present true and actual value, as determined under section 12-63.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-62a (b). \u201cThe present true and actual value of all . . . property, [other than farmland, forest land and open space land] shall be deemed by all assessors and boards of assessment appeals to be the fair market value thereof and not its value at a forced or auction sale.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">An understanding of real estate appraisal principles is essential to understanding the statutory obligation placed on municipalities assessing real property and the duty of Connecticut courts reviewing assessments. According to our Supreme Court, as well as real estate appraisers, the usual starting point for the analysis of a property\u2019s true and actual value is the property\u2019s highest and best use.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>262 Conn. 11, 25, 807 A.2d 955 (2002); see also J. Eaton, Real Estate Valuation in Litigation (2d Ed. 1995) pp. 103,129. \u201cThe highest and best use determination is inextricably intertwined with the marketplace because fair market value is defined as the price that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller based on the highest and best possible use of the land assuming, of course, that a market exists for such optimum use. . . . The highest and best use conclusion necessarily affects the rest of the valuation process because, as the major factor in determining the scope of the market for the property, it dictates which methods of valuation are applicable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>supra, 25-26. \u201cFor example, an extremely narrow highest and best use conclusion might result in a very small or even nonexistent market, thereby elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>nating the availability of market sales analysis as a useful valuation tool.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 26 n.22. In other instances, the highest and best use of property as a factor in valuation must be abandoned in favor of the particular present use of the property. E.g., <em>Rustici </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>174 Conn. 10, 13, 381 A.2d 532 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">\u201cThere are three accepted methods of valuation which may be used for the assessment of real property. They are the comparable sales approach,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the income [capitalization] approach<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> [and] the . . . cost approach.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Four </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>D\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mattera, </em>25 Conn.

At the de novo proceeding, the taxpayer bears the burden of establishing that the assessor has overassessed its property. . . . Once the taxpayer has demonstrated aggrievement by proving that its property was overassessed, the trial court [will] then undertake a further inquiry to determine the amount of the reassessment that would be just.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In this case, the court found that the plaintiff was aggrieved<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and then determined the value of the property, on the basis of the testimony and report of the defendant\u2019s appraiser. Ordinarily, a court\u2019s decision as to the value of the property is reviewed pursuant to the clearly erroneous standard. See <em>Grolier, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>82 Conn. App. 77, 78, 842 A.2d 621 (2004). In some cases, however, on the basis of the substance of the particular claims of a taxpayer, the standard of review is plenary because there is a question of law, such as the construction of a statute. See <em>Albahary </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>276 Conn. 426, 436, 886 A.2d 802 (2005); <em>Paul Dinto Electrical </em>Contractors, <em>Inc. </em>v. Waterbury, 266 Conn. 706, 714-15, 835 A.2d 33 (2003); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>189 Conn. 648, 652, 458 A.2d 355 (1983); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>61 Conn. App. 834, 842-43, 767 A.2d 1237 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The plaintiff in its complaint claims that its property assessment was \u201cgrossly excessive, disproportionate, and unlawful.\u201d The plaintiff not only claims that the assessment was excessive, but that it was invalid because the method used by the court found the average value of a unit in the plaintiff\u2019s campground, then multiplied that average by the number of units in the campground to reach a fair market value of the whole cooperative. The average value of each emit was found by the court based, in part, on \u201ccomparable sales\u201d of units in other campgrounds. The plaintiff argues that this valuation is in derogation of \u00a7 47-204 (a). Whether the method violated that statute is a question of law because it involves a statutory interpretation, namely, whether the court could consider the average value of the individual units, in order to find the market value of the whole cooperative. See <em>Paul Dinto Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 714-15. Whether this question of law, after plenary review, must be resolved in favor of the plaintiff depends on the language used in CIOA, particularly \u00a7\u00a7 47-202 (10) and (31), and 47-204 (a), and the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act Annotated<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on which Connecticut\u2019s law is largely modeled, the particular facts of this case and the declaration that created the plaintiffs common interest community.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>The plaintiff urges this court to conclude that the court improperly considered the comparable sales approach utilized by the defendant\u2019s appraiser because the unit of measure utilized by the appraiser was wrong as a matter of law. The resolution of this question rests on our inteipretation of \u00a7 47-204 (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 47-204 (a), \u201cthe real property constituting [a] cooperative shall be taxed and assessed as a whole and a unit owner\u2019s interest shall not be separately taxed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>269 Conn. 527, 534, 849 A.2d 777 (2004). \u201cIn other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.

The legislation involved in this case is \u00a7\u00a7 12-64 (a) and 47-200 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Section 12-64 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] 11 the following-mentioned property, not exempted, shall be set in the list of the town where it is situated and, except as otherwise provided by law, shall be hable to taxation at a uniform percentage of its present true and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>actual valuation ... to be determined by the assessors .... Any interest in real estate shall be set by the assessors in the list of the person in whose name the title to such interest stands on the land records. . . .\u201d Consistently, Connecticut courts have interpreted \u00a7 12-64 (a) to allow municipalities to tax those real property interests enumerated in \u00a7 12-64 (a), as well as real property interests of the same general character, and to list those interests in the name of the record owner. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>165 Conn. 211, 217-18, 332 A.2d 83 (1973). Pursuant to \u00a7 47-202 (10), a cooperative is a \u201ccommon interest community in which the real property is owned by an association . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, the association, as a whole, is the record owner of the real property held by the cooperative and liable to taxation under \u00a7 12-64 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Although \u00a7 12-64 (a) makes it clear that the plaintiff, the Sun Valley Camping Cooperative, Inc., is the record owner of the real property to be taxed, it is silent as to the method to be used to establish the amount of the tax due.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The question is whether the defendant, although it may tax and assess the plaintiffs property only as a whole, can legally, in accordance with \u00a7 47-204 (a), use the individual units of the camping cooperative as the unit of measurement to determine the true and actual value of the entire cooperative. The answer to that question lies within the words of \u00a7 47-204 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">CIO A, which governs the cooperative form of ownership, defines a cooperative as \u201ca common interest community in which the real property is owned by an association, each of whose members is entitled by virtue of his ownership interest in the association to exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>sive possession of a unit.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-202 (10). General Statutes \u00a7 47-204 (a) elaborates further that, in Connecticut, a cooperative member\u2019s interest in a unit and its allocated interests is a real property interest. An understanding of the meaning of this provision must take into account the reality that, prior to the enactment of CIOA, cooperative ownership was regarded as a legal hybrid. \u201cFor some purposes, the \u2018owner\u2019 of such [an interest] has legal title and an interest in real property, while for other purposes his rights as a tenant of the corporation and a holder of its stock more closely resemble an interest in personal property.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 654. Read in context, the first part of \u00a7 47-204 (a) denies the traditional hybrid status of cooperative ownership under Connecticut law and requires classification of the interest as real property. Furthermore, read together, \u00a7\u00a7 47-204 (a) and 47-202 (10) explain that by virtue of a cooperative member\u2019s ownership interest in the association, the member is vested with a possessory, real property interest in a unit within the real property owned by the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Although a cooperative member\u2019s interest is a real property interest, \u00a7 47-204 (a) contains an exception to the usual consequences of owning an interest in realty. That exception provides that \u201cthe real property constituting the cooperative shall be taxed and assessed as a whole and a unit owner\u2019s interest shall not be separately taxed.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-204 (a). The unit owners were not separately taxed by the defendant, and we are therefore concerned only with the words \u201cthe real property constituting the cooperative shall be taxed and assessed as a whole . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-204 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The language of \u00a7 47-204 (a) does more than merely prohibit a municipality from using its taxing power to levy a tax on a unit owner. The cooperative\u2019s real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>is not only \u201ctaxed\u201d as a whole, it is \u201cassessed\u201d as a whole. To \u201cassess\u201d is to list and value property for the purpose of taxation. An assessment is a listing and valuation of property as a basis on which taxes are to be collected. Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969). A tax is a charge assessed in accordance with a reasonable rate by a governmental entity upon property. Id. Thus, \u201cassessment\u201d must be distinguished from \u201ctaxation.\u201d The latter is based on the former, and both words must be accorded validity, as used in the statute. To interpret \u00a7 47-204 (a) merely to require municipalities to levy a tax against the cooperative as a whole, instead of the individual members of the cooperative, without requiring an assessment as a whole, would violate a canon of construction. We must construe statutes so that \u201cno clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Semerzakis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>274 Conn. 1, 18, 873 A.2d 911 (2005). Cooperative property must therefore be both assessed as a whole, without regard to the value of individual units, and taxed as a whole. We conclude that the text of \u00a7 47-204 (a) is susceptible to a single, reasonable interpretation. The plain language of \u00a7 47-204 (a) prohibits a municipality from using the true and actual value of the individual units as the basis of measurement to determine true and actual value of the cooperative as a whole for purposes of taxation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The procedural background of this case is not in dispute. The plaintiff first appealed to the Stafford board of assessment appeals, which denied the plaintiffs request for a reduction of the assessment of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>real property. Pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Superior Court, seeking review of the decision by the board of assessment appeals and claiming that the valuation of its real property was grossly excessive, disproportionate and unlawful.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The plaintiffs property, which consists of 56.84 acres, is divided into 303 campsites<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and is located at 51 Old Springfield Road in Stafford Springs. The property is not located on a public street and is accessed by an easement over the land of another property owner. On February 24, 1988, Robert N. Minor conveyed the property to Sun Valley Associates Limited Partnership by warranty deed. On the same date, Sun Valley Associates Limited Partnership conveyed the property to Sun Valley Camping Cooperative, Inc. Since that date, the property has been used as a cooperative campground. The property is improved with one lane gravel roadways, several communal bathroom shelters, with and without showers, and an enclosed gazebo. Each campsite is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>serviced with electricity and water. Beach rights for a limited number of years are afforded to unit owners. Any personalty on the land may be taxed to the unit owners as individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The public offering declaration, as amended, filed pursuant to \u00a7 47-202 (13), states that the ownership of a unit is an interest in the association and gives the owner the exclusive right to possession. A unit is not taxed individually for the value of the real estate, but the unit owner may be taxed for the value of the personalty on the campsite. The cooperative is \u201ctaxed and assessed as a whole . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-204 (a). Unit owners pay a proportionate share of common expenses. Paragraph twenty-two of the declaration provides that each unit owner must pay a rental fee for common areas and other expenses. The average area of a campsite is 3000 to 4000 square feet, and all the campsites are not of equal size. The declaration also provides that no portion of the campground may be transferred by a unit owner, and 100 percent of the unit owners must agree before ownership of the campground can be transferred. There was testimony at trial that 80 percent of the unit owners could effectuate a transfer of title to the property. Whether a sale could be effectuated by 100 percent or 80 percent of the unit owners, it is not likely that the property could be readily sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">These facts reinforce our conclusion, after a plenary review, that the valuation used by the court, which involved the average price of a unit, cannot stand and that the case must be remanded for a new trial. Because the parties have raised issues relating to the methodology that should be used in valuing this property, we discuss those claims to the extent that they may recur in any subsequent trial. These issues primarily relate to whether the plaintiffs property is a special purpose property and, if so, whether a particular method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>valuation is mandated in order to assess the plaintiffs property properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The appraiser for the defendant selected the comparable sales approach to arrive at the value of the property. The appraiser used the sale price per camping site as the primary unit of comparison, explaining that properties such as the plaintiffs are not typically sold as an entire campground. He determined that the average sale price per campsite was $11,000, and then multiplied it by 275, the number of campsites he believed the property contained, to reach its valuation of $3,025,000.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In arriving at a valuation of the plaintiffs property as of October 1, 2000, the plaintiffs appraiser utilized the cost approach, using sales of vacant, raw land because, in his opinion, use of the comparable sales approach was not feasible due to the lack of comparable sales of cooperative campgrounds as a whole. The report also detailed that the cost approach adds the depreciated value of improvements to the value of the land, as if it were vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The issue that will recur on retrial is contained within the plaintiffs argument that its real estate is a special purpose property for which no comparable sales exist, thereby requiring, as a matter of law, a valuation on the basis of the cost approach, as used by its expert. We are unaware of any Connecticut appellate case that specifically answers the question of whether a parcel of real estate, used as a cooperative campground, is necessarily a special purpose property and, if so, whether a particular method is required to arrive at its true and actual value for taxation and assessment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Cooperative ownership, to the extent it has been discussed by case law and treatises, is usually defined in terms of apartments.

App. 705, 708-709, 542 A.2d 756 (1988). A special purpose classification may cause an exception to the use of usual valuation methods. J. Youngman, \u201cDefining and Valuing the Base of Property Tax,\u201d 58 Wash. L. Rev. 713, 755 (1983). It has also been noted that a reproduction cost approach is \u201coften used when a special purpose property must be assessed . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, 4 </em>Conn.

No single method of valuation is controlling for the finding of fair market value for a special purpose property, at least in eminent domain cases.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Brothers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ansonia Redevelopment Agency, </em>158 Conn. 37, 45, 255 A.2d 836 (1969). This is so because the usual means of ascertaining market value, such as sales of like property, may not be appropriate when land is devoted to a special purpose. <em>Feigenbaum </em>v. <em>New Britain Housing Site Development Agency, </em>164 Conn. 254, 260, 320 A.2d 824 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">One Connecticut case, without any mention or specific finding of whether the valuation involved a special purpose property, utilized the property\u2019s current use, rather than the highest and best use of the land, in order to find its true and actual value. See <em>Rustici </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>supra, 174 Conn. 13. In <em>Rustici, </em>the assessment of a golf course was found by aggregating the value of the raw land per acre, as established by comparable sales of raw land, the cost per acre of improving the fairways and the cost of construction of the greens without consideration of the value of the underlying land. Id., 12. A valuation must sometimes involve more than one single theory or methodology of assessment because of the particular facts. <em>Heather Lyn Ltd.

It is for the court on remand to determine the appropriate method for a determination of the true and actual value for the property\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Because the court improperly applied the law, we set aside its judgment, as to the valuation of the property, and remand the case for a new trial to determine the trae and actual value of the plaintiffs property.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\"> On the grand list of October 1, 1999, the property had been assessed at $743,200.

If a unit in a cooperative is owned by a unit owner or is sold, conveyed, voluntarily or involuntarily encumbered or otherwise transferred by a unit owner, the interest in that unit which is owned, sold, conveyed, encumbered or otherwise transferred is the right to possession of that unit under a proprietary lease, coupled with the allocated interests of that unit, and the association\u2019s interest in that unit is not thereby affected. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"AKA\">\u201c(32) \u2018Unit owner\u2019 means a declarant or other person who owns a unit, or a lessee of a unit in a leasehold common interest community whose lease expires simultaneously with any lease the expiration or termination of which will remove the unit from the common interest community, but does not include a person having an interest in a unit solely as security for an obligation. In a condominium or planned community, the declarant is the owner of any unit created by the declaration.

J. Eaton, supra, p. 194. The process is based on the principle that the amount of net income a property can produce is related to its market value. Id. This approach only has utility where the property under appraisal is income producing in nature. Id. In this appeal, the parties agree that the income approach is inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\"> Under the cost approach, the appraiser estimates the current cost of replacing the subject property with adjustments for depreciation, the value of the underlying land and entrepreneurial profit.

The selection of an inappropriate method of appraisal is not an illegal or wrongful assessment. <em>Second Stone Ridge Cooperative Corp. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 343. This case was tried and decided as a \u00a7 12-117a, or excessive assessment case, and we need not decide whether \u00a7 12-119 could have been applicable.
