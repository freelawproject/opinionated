The offense took place in June, 1919, before the recent amendment to Article 16, Section 20, of the Constitution, became effective. The appellant entered a plea of guilty. The only question arising from the record is the legality of the statute upon which the prosecution is founded, which is Chapter 31 of the Acts of the Thirty-fifth Legislature, Fourth Called Session. The validity of this statute, so far as it denounced as unlawful the offense charged, has been upheld by the opinions of this court in the case of Ex parte Fulton, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 149; 215 S. W. Rep., 331; Harper v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 446, 217 S. W. Rep., 703. We deem it unnecessary to review the reasons upon which the validity of the law was sustained. '</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">There are no questions of practice raised.' The appellant having pleaded guilty and the lowest punishment assessed by the jury, the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the'conviction is not in question. Terretto v. State, 86 Texas Crim.
