He was adjudged in contempt of the District Court rendering the judgment, and from the restraint under the contempt procedings relief is sought. The relief will not be granted for the reason that the Supreme Court is by statute given authority to entertain applications for writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>in cases in which the restraint grows out of a civil ease. Revised Statutes, Art. 1529. In deference to this statute, and the reasons that impelled the Legislature to enact it as stated, in various decisions of this court, it has refrained from granting writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>in eases of contempt growdng out of the alleged disobedience of an order entered in a civil case.
