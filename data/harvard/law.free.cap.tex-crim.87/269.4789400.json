Appellant reserved certain exceptions to the charge of the court, one of them being to the court\u2019s failure to charge on circumstantial evidence, but in the absence of a statement of facts, it is impossible for us to know whether his complaint is well founded. The indictment is in proper form, and finding no fundamental error in the court\u2019s charge, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
