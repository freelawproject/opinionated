This conversation occurred some 'time after defendant had been arrested on the charge set forth in the indictment in this case; that the conversation was out of the presence of defendant and without his knowledge or consent. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>bill is full in its statements, and after the objections had been urged and overruled, the witness stated: \u201cThe defendant was not present when we had this talk. He (McLemore Dawson) told me that he together with George Davis and Hosey Davis went out to the Barnes Lease on the afternoon of the 26th of September, 1919, and secured two loads of six and five eighths inch casing and hauled it to the home of the defendant, and left it on the wagon till some 8 or 9 o\u2019clock in the evening and took it over and unloaded it at the jew\u2019s yard. The defendant and McLemore Dawson were, present when they unloaded it. He went out there at the request of his brother and drove his team, and that his brother paid him $5 per day to drive his team and haul this easing. He told me that he and George Davis and Henry Davis, brother-in-law of the defendant, and the defendant, hauled at different times five separate trips.\u201d Objection was again urged to the introduction of this conversation between McLemore Dawson and the witness Cook. This testimony was not admissible. The conspiracy, if any existed, had been consummated, and appellant had been arrested in the case at hand. Shifflett v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 530; Overstreet v. State, 67 Texas Crim. Rep., 565; Couch v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 505; Bouldin v. State, 222 S. W., 555. decided at the present term of the court. This was but the statement of Mc-Lemore Dawson to the witness Cook of things and matters connected with this alleged violation of the Law rind appellant\u2019s connection with it in appellant\u2019s absence and after the consummation of the transaction, and after appellant\u2019s arrest. Under these authorities this evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
