The only attempt at a judgment in the record is found in the following language: \u201cWe the jury find the defendant J. Hellman guilty and assess his punishment at $100 fine and costs. G. S. Gideon, Foreman. \u2019 \u2019 Then follows the order of the court adjudging him guilty of carrying a pistol as found by the jury, etc. It will be noticed that it fails to show that appellant entered any plea, or that a jury was empaneled, or any of those preliminary matters required by the statute which precedes the rendition of a verdict. C. C. P., Art. 853. This judgment as presented is not in accord with the statute. Without a judgment the jurisdiction of this court does not attach. We are, therefore, of opinion that the motion of the Assistant Attorney General is well taken and is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
