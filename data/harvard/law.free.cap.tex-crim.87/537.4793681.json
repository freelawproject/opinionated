It is urged that \u201cpistle\u201d is a word meaning a communication, and that the well known rules of <em>idem sonans </em>and bad spelling do not apply. Appellant\u2019s authority for asserting that \u201cpistle\u201d is the name of a communication, is the Century Dictionary. Reference thereto discloses that said work prints said word as obsolete, and quotes Mr. Chaucer, who wrote in old English some seven hundred years since, as using it. We do not think that the fact that an\" early English poet, in the exercise of his license, should have used this word in that sense, would necessarily give it any standing at this time, or would likely mislead a Brazoria County Mexican, defended by a pair of able lawyers, into the mistake, in preparing for trial upon a charge of. unlawfully carrying a \u201cpistle,\u201d of seriously thinking himself charged with unlawfully carrying a communication. The word \u201cpistle\u201d does not seem to be given in any of our other dictionaries, to which this Court has access, and we are inclined to hold the word, as used in the information and complaint therein, <em>idem sonans </em>with \u201cpistol,\u201d and that the rule of bad spelling will apply; and, further, that it is evident that the word \u201cpistol\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>was intended. The evidence that appellant had a pistol on his person in a public place, was uncontroverted..</p>\n<p id=\"AFH\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
