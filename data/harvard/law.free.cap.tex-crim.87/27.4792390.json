It shows the following proceedings occurred. This question was asked a witness for the State by the district attorney: \u201cWhat if anything was said by them about a suspended sentence <em>1 </em>\u2019\u2019 Defendants objected to the question as being suggestive and leading, and has nothing to do with the case, and as attempting to put in issue the character of the. defendants. \u201cThe Court: \u2018I don\u2019t know what it is.\u2019 \u201cDefendants: \u2018Object to anything about suspended sentence. I don\u2019t think it is proper, and I ask that the jury be withdrawn for the present. \u2019 The State: \u2018I will tell the court what it is.\u2019 \u201d The bill recites that the prosecuting attorney, out of the hearing of the jury, informed the court what he expected to prove, but it is not stated in the bill what the evidence was or expected to be. \u201cThe Court: \u2018If that is it,\u2014 if they told him that go ahead.\u201d Q. \u2018What was said <em>1 </em>\u2019 Defendants: \u2018Object to anything about a suspended sentence.\u2019 This was overruled and the following answer made: \u201cFor me to get the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the next day at Mr. Heidingsf elders, Rink Young, that fellow on the right there, said, \u2018Hell,\u2019 four years would kill him. to be in the penitentiary, and that Anderson said to me\u2014Q. What did he mean about four years? A. He said he already was on a two year suspended sentence. The Defense: Object to that as a conclusion of the witness. The Court: You have got your bill.\u201d This is the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The fact that Young was already under a two years suspended sentence was not a conclusion as contended by appellants in their objection to that answer. What the conversation was outside of that narrated is not shown by the bill of exceptions. The statement of facts, if we refer to the evidence, shows that after, the auto had been stolen these defendants approached the alleged owner and offered to pay him for the car if he would meet them the following morning at a specified hour at Mr. Heidingsfelder\u2019s office, and in that conversation one of them stated as his reason that he did not want to go to the penitentiary for an additional term to the suspended sentence, or for the two terms combined, whatever might be the conviction under this indictment. It was a part of the conversation and statement by one of the defendants which might be held as an admission of the auto theft and an offer to pay for the car in order to avoid going to the penitentiary. We are of opinion the manner in which it was presented, it being a part of the conversation brought about by the- defendants, that it was introducible; but the bill does not show any error with reference to the objection stated to the introduction of it as being a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The judgment we think ought to be affirmed and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
