J.</author>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Defendant and appellant Adam Arellano was charged with count I, first degree premeditated murder of Reynoldo Daniel \u201cWoody\u201d Abrego (Abrego) (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> count II, being a felon in possession of a firearm, based on the murder weapon (\u00a7 29800, subd. (a)(1)), and other felony offenses. After a lengthy trial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on counts I and H, the murder and possession charges, and the court declared a mistrial as to those counts. The jury convicted defendant of the other charged offenses: count III, possession of an assault weapon, based on a rifle found in the trunk of the car defendant drove to the scene and left there after the homicide (\u00a7 30605) and count IV, active participation in a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)). He was sentenced to 12 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">During jury selection, the People used peremptory challenges to excuse all three African-American women from the panel. Defendant objected pursuant to <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712] <em>(Batson) </em>and <em>People v. Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] <em>(Wheeler), </em>and argued the prosecutor was systematically excluding African-American women from the jury. The court found defendant made prima facie cases of racial discrimination as to all three prospective jurors and asked the prosecutor to state the reasons for the challenges. The prosecutor did so. Thereafter, the court found the prosecutor had stated race-neutral reasons and denied defendant\u2019s <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">On appeal, defendant contends the court should have granted his <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motion to discharge the jury because the prosecutor was systematically excluding African-American women from the jury, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>stated reasons were not supported by the record and were not race neutral. Defendant also contends there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession of the assault rifle found in the trunk of the car he drove to the homicide scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">As we will fully discuss in the published portion of this opinion, \u201conce the opponent of a peremptory challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination (step one), the burden of production shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a race neutral explanation (step two). If a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide (step three) whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.\u201d <em>(Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 765, 767 [131 L.Ed.2d 834, 115 S.Ct. 1769]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 345, 384 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 21 P.3d 769] <em>(Silva).) </em>The exclusion by peremptory challenge of a single juror on the basis of race, gender, or ethnicity is an error of constitutional magnitude requiring reversal. <em>(Silva, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at p. 386; <em>People v. Bonilla </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 313, 340-341 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 209, 160 P.3d 84] <em>(Bonilla).) </em>On review, <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>error is reversible per se, and the remedy is a new trial without any inquiry into harmless error. <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 283; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cisneros </em>(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 111, 120 [184 Cal.Rptr.3d 1]; see e.g., <em>Rivera v. Illinois </em>(2009) 556 U.S. 148, 161 [173 L.Ed.2d 320, 129 S.Ct. 1446]; <em>Winston v. Boatwright </em>(7th Cir. 2011) 649 F.3d 618, 628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">We find the record supports the court\u2019s ruling as to the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing two of the prospective African-American jurors. However, the prosecutor\u2019s stated reason for excusing the third prospective juror is not supported by the record and contrary to the evidence presented at voir dire. As a result, we are compelled to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions for count III, possession of an assault weapon, and count IV, active participation in a criminal street gang, because of <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">PARTI</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>PART II</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">JURY SELECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In this case, the court conducted lengthy voir dire proceedings on November 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22, 2013. As we will explain, defendant made two separate <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motions after the prosecution used peremptory challenges to remove three prospective jurors who were African-American women: V.B., V.K., and W.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">In response to defendant\u2019s objections, the court found prima facie cases were established and asked the prosecutor to explain the reasons for excusing each person. After hearing the prosecutor\u2019s explanations, the court denied defendant\u2019s <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">We turn to the chronological history of voir dire as relevant to these three prospective jurors. As we will explain, the court properly denied defendant\u2019s <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motions as to prospective jurors, V.B. and V.K., but it should have granted defendant\u2019s motion in response to the prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse prospective juror, W.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\"><em>Hardship stage </em>\u2014 Prospective <em>Juror V.B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">On the first day of jury selection, the court began with 75 prospective jurors and asked for hardship excuses for the approximately two- to three-week trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">W.W. was in the first group of prospective jurors, and she did not request a hardship excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">After the court granted numerous hardship excuses, it called in another large group of prospective jurors. The second group included V.B. and V.K., both of whom requested hardship excuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Prospective Juror V.B. requested a hardship medical excuse because she was diabetic, she had to regularly eat, and she had to frequently use the restroom. She also said her \u201ckids were accused of being in gangs\u201d in Kern County. Her son had been convicted of felony robbery, and another son was involved with a cousin who was a gang member. In response to the court\u2019s question, Prospective Juror V.B. stated that her family situation and health concerns would prevent her from giving her undivided attention to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">The prosecutor stipulated to Prospective Juror V.B.\u2019s hardship excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>Defense counsel declined to stipulate and asked Prospective Juror V.B. whether she could sit through the trial and use the restroom during breaks. She said yes, and explained she drove a bus, and she stopped and used the restroom when she needed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Defense counsel asked why her sons\u2019 situations would affect her ability to give defendant a fair trial. Prospective Juror V.B. replied; \u201cI didn\u2019t say that would affect me. I said similar, because they asked did you have a similar situation, and I said it\u2019s not quite, but it\u2019s kind of similar as far as the gang-related part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Defense counsel advised Prospective Juror V.B. that they were trying to find impartial jurors, and asked whether her sons\u2019 situations would affect how she would listen to the facts of the case. She replied: \u201cI can\u2019t say it won\u2019t, you know what I mean, because I don\u2019t know what the situation is, so I can\u2019t really answer that. You know what I mean? So I really can\u2019t answer that, if it would affect me or not, because I haven\u2019t heard anything and I don\u2019t know if his situation might come into play with his, but in a similar situation. That question I couldn\u2019t answer honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Defense counsel asked Prospective Juror V.B. if she would be biased upon learning the case involved something similar to her sons\u2019 situations. She replied: \u201cI couldn\u2019t answer that,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do.\u201d Defense counsel asked if she presumed defendant guilty. She replied that he could be not guilty because \u201c[d]on\u2019t nobody know anything, so how can you say he\u2019s guilty.\u201d She presumed defendant was innocent, and understood the People had the burden to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">After asking these questions, defense counsel declined to stipulate to Prospective Juror V.B.\u2019s hardship excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The prosecutor asked Prospective Juror V.B. if either of her sons were sent to prison. She said both went to prison. The prosecutor asked if she felt the system treated them fairly. She said no because \u201cbefore my son went up, one person went up. They were both similar. That one got off with probation. The other one got sent to jail. And I\u2019m like what the heck?\u201d She said it was the same case but \u201cdifferent D.A.s. One gets probation; one goes to jail.\u201d She also said it was \u201cracial\u201d because her son was Black and the other suspect was White. \u201cBut they pretty much did the same thing. That one got slapped on the wrist and my son went to jail . . . .\u201d She believed it was unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">The prosecutor asked Prospective Juror V.B. if she had \u201ca chip on [her] shoulder towards the District Attorney\u2019s Office?\u201d She said no, that it was \u201call dead and done with. That\u2019s all in the past,\u201d and it happened 10 or 15 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>ago. The prosecutor asked her if she was afraid of gangs, and she said no. He asked if her sons talked to her about gangs. She replied, \u201cNo. They tried to tell me a little about it, but I\u2019m like you can\u2019t wear this, you can\u2019t do this, you know. It don\u2019t bother me. I wear what I wanna wear and say what I wanna say.\u201d She did not have any problem saying defendant was guilty of murder if she thought the evidence showed that.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Prospective Juror Y.B. remained on the panel through the hardship stage.</p>\n<p id=\"AdWT\"><em>Hardship stage </em>\u2014 Prospective <em>Juror V.K.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">On the second day of jury selection, Prospective Juror V.K. requested a hardship financial excuse because she was a special needs social worker for Kern Regional Center, and her employer only paid for 15 days of leave. The court asked the attorneys whether the case could be resolved in 15 court days. Defense counsel said it would be really close, and the trial would probably take 20 to 25 calendar days because of upcoming holidays in November and December.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The court asked Prospective Juror V.K. if there were any other reasons. She said she had a medical test in two weeks and asked about the court\u2019s schedule. The court explained the trial and holiday calendars. She said she could schedule the test around those dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Prospective Juror V.K. was not given a hardship excuse and remained on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\"><em>The court\u2019s voir dire </em>\u2014 Prospective <em>Juror W.W.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">On November 21, 2013, the court completed the hardship stage and seated 12 people in the jury box for further voir dire and challenges. Prospective Jurors W.W. and V.K. were in this group, and responded to various questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">The court began voir dire with Prospective Juror W.W.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-12\">\u201cQ. [Yjour occupation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\">\u201cA. I\u2019m a field representative for the Department of Commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-14\">\u201cQ. All right. What do you do in that important capacity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>\u201cA. <em>I collect information for Congress and President and different organizations that distribute information back down to the cities and counties about work, the state of the nation, how people are doing </em>health-wise\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-4\">\u201cQ. How are you doing on Obama Care? [\u00b6] That\u2019s a two-way street, isn\u2019t it, for you? Pretty busy right \u2014 or do you handle that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The court asked Prospective Juror W.W. about her education and vocational background. She said she had two accounting degrees, and she had worked for the Department of Commerce in Kern County for 22 years in the same capacity. Her spouse worked for the City of Bakersfield; he was not in law enforcement, but she did not specify his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Prospective Juror W.W. said she had served on four prior juries.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-8\">\u201cQ. . . . What were those cases all about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-9\">\u201cA. One was a police situation in Shafter. There was a fight between some people at a school and police were fighting, and this person saw the fight and he came over to get into it and he charged \u2014 filed charges for police brutality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. So it was, I take it \u2014 unless it was an interference with one\u2019s Civil Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-12\">\u201cQ. It would have been a suit for, what, money damages, police brutality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-13\">\u201cA. Police brutality. It wasn\u2019t money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-14\">Prospective Juror W.W. believed it was a civil suit for reimbursement for medical care and not money damages, and the jury reached a verdict in that case. She also sat on a theft case that was prosecuted by the district attorney\u2019s office, but it settled. Another case was a misdemeanor suit for damages where there was an accident after a stop sign had been moved because of roadwork, and a verdict was reached. She could not remember the fourth trial because it was a long time ago, but knew the case settled out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">The court explained the different burdens of proof between civil and criminal trials, and Prospective Juror W.W. said she understood and did not have any problems with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>Prospective Juror W.W. did not know defendant or any of the witnesses and did not have any problem giving both sides a fair trial in this case. She had not been affected by any gang-related violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">The court asked Prospective Juror W.W. if she ever had a less than pleasurable experience with law enforcement, and she said yes. She said she was attacked on the comer of Chester and Truxton, near the courthouse, when she was working at the assessor\u2019s office. A woman attacked her and claimed \u201cI was messing with her husband, but I was not.\u201d The woman\u2019s husband \u201cwas telling her a bunch a lies. He was trying to talk to me and I wouldn\u2019t talk to him.\u201d Prospective Juror W.W. said she was walking to the bus stop, and the woman drove up and attacked her. A bystander broke up the incident, and someone called the police. \u201c[T]hey came over and I asked them to give me a ride home and they took off.\u201d Prospective Juror W.W. was injured a \u201clittle bit.\u201d The police did not offer to get her any medical care.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">\u201cQ. Would that affect your ability to be fair and impartial in this type of case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-6\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The court clarified the Bakersfield Police Department was not involved in this case, and asked if she had any experiences with the Arvin Police Department. She said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The court asked whether Prospective Juror W.W., her family, or close friends had been victims of a crime, or charged with committing a crime. She said no. She did not know anyone in the offices of the district attorney or public defender. She did not know about any pretrial publicity, and could not think of a reason that she could not be impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\"><em>The court\u2019s voir dire </em>\u2014 Prospective <em>Juror V.K.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">In response to the court\u2019s questions, Prospective Juror V.K. said she was a special needs social worker at Kern Regional Center. Her husband was a \u201c[s]enior pastor.\u201d She did not further define his position or where he was a pastor.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Prospective Juror V.K. said she did not have any religious or philosophical beliefs that would prevent her from serving as a juror. She did not have any problem with judging the facts and evidence to determine if the accused committed a crime. She had never served on a jury before.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">Prospective Juror V.K. said she did not have any close friends or relatives in law enforcement, and she did not know the defendant, the attorneys, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>potential witnesses. There was nothing about the nature of the case that would affect her ability to be impartial. She never had a less than pleasurable experience with law enforcement, she had never been a crime victim, and she did not have any friends or family who had been charged or convicted of a crime. She did not know about any pretrial publicity and did not know of any reason why she could not give both sides a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\"><em>Further voir dire </em>\u2014 Prospective <em>Jurors W.W. and V.K.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">After the prosecutor passed the panel for cause, defense counsel asked several jurors how they felt about sitting on a case involving gang violence, and whether they could presume defendant was innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Defense counsel asked Prospective Juror W.W. about sitting on a gang case. She replied: \u201cI\u2019ve never had any contact with any gangs. I don\u2019t know anything about them. I\u2019ve heard about that there were gangs in different parts of the country, but I don\u2019t have a problem feeling that someone is innocent before proven guilty. You have to show me what the reason is that they were guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Defense counsel asked Prospective Juror W.W. if the prosecutor\u2019s burden was lessened if she learned defendant was tied to a gang. She said no. Defense counsel asked how she felt if defendant had prior felony convictions. She said, \u201cBut that\u2019s something else. It\u2019s not pertaining to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">Defense counsel also asked Prospective Juror V.K. about sitting on a gang-related case. She replied: \u201cI feel the same, innocent until proven guilty. Just because you\u2019re a felon doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a murderer until you\u2019re proven to be a murderer. [\u00b6] And gangs are real. It\u2019s where we live. It\u2019s at our front door. It exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Defense counsel asked Prospective Juror V.K. if there was anything about defendant that made her already judge him as guilty. She replied: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know him. He just looks like a young man, well-groomed, in a nice suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Defense counsel advised Prospective Juror V.K. that she would probably see photographs of defendant which showed him throwing up gang signs and asked whether that would change her opinion. She replied, \u201cInnocent until proven guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">\n<em>Peremptory challenges/excuse of Prospective Juror V.K.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">After defense counsel passed the jury for cause, the court asked the prosecutor for his first peremptory challenge. The prosecutor excused Prospective Juror V.K. Defendant did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>The clerk called another prospective juror into the box and questioning continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Defense counsel made his first peremptory challenge on a prospective juror. The clerk called another prospective juror into the box, and questioning resumed. The prosecutor made his next peremptory challenge. The clerk then called Prospective Juror V.B. into the box.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">\n<em>Voir dire with Prospective Juror V.B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">In response to the court\u2019s questions, Prospective Juror V.B. said she was a bus driver, and she was fully compensated for jury duty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Her spouse was a foreman with a company that trimmed trees for PG&amp;E (Pacific Gas and Electric). She had never served on a jury. She did not have any relatives or close friends in law enforcement. She did not know defendant or any of the witnesses. There was nothing about the case which would prevent her from being impartial. She never had any bad experiences with law enforcement. She had never been charged with a crime. She did not know anyone in the offices of the public defender or district attorney. She did not know about any pretrial publicity, and she could give both sides a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The court asked Prospective Juror V.B. if she had heard all the questions already asked of the other prospective jurors. She said she tried to hear some of them. The court asked if those questions raised any issues she wanted to discuss with the court. She said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\"><em>Defendant\u2019s first </em>Batson/Wheeler <em>objection </em>\u2014 Prospective <em>Jurors V.K. and V.B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Both sides passed the panel for cause. Defense counsel excused another prospective juror, and the process continued. The prosecutor and defense counsel each used another peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">The prosecutor used his next peremptory challenge to excuse Prospective Juror V.B. Defense counsel immediately advised the court that he wanted to make an objection. The court excused the prospective jurors from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Defense counsel made a <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motion based on the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to excuse Prospective Juror V.K. first, and then excuse Prospective Juror V.B., who were both African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>The court thought Prospective Juror V.K. had a timing problem with the trial. Defense counsel said they agreed the trial would be completed in 15 court days.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Defense counsel did not see any reason to excuse Prospective Juror V.K. except for her being an African-American female. Defense counsel conceded there might be reasons to excuse Prospective Juror V.B. based on her past, \u201cbut when you put her in combination with [V.K.], which there was nothing whatsoever as to [V.K.] showing a bias one way, that that\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m doing this motion. Just because there\u2019s been two people excused in between [V.B. and V.K.], one being obviously one working for a defense attorney, doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s not systematically trying to get rid of an entire race.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">\n<em>Prima facie case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The court stated that it had to first determine if there was a prima facie showing of group bias. The court stated there were three African-Americans still in the box (Prospective Jurors Nos. 8, 9, and 2 (W.W.)). As to Prospective Juror W.W., the court was \u201cpretty sure\u201d she was African-American. Defense counsel concurred that she was African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The court did not see anything in Prospective Juror V.K.\u2019s presence, demeanor, or situation to support a peremptory challenge and found a prima facie case and possible discriminatory purpose as to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">\n<em>The court\u2019s request for justification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">The court asked the prosecutor to respond and explain if there were permissible, race-neutral justifications to excuse Prospective Jurors V.B. and V.K. The prosecutor replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\">\u201cThe Court having found a prima facie case as to <em>[V.K.], her spouse is a senior pastor, and I\u2019m always concerned with people from the clergy coming in because they have a lot of dealings and sympathy and that type of outreach.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-11\">\u201cAnd when [defense counsel] was questioning her and he was asking about what she thinks, she said he <em>looks </em>\u2014 she <em>said the defendant looks like a young man, groomed, in a nice suit, accurate observations, but it was the way she said it, and coming with the fact that her husband\u2019s a senior pastor, which to me means the head of a church, causes me great concern that she will increase my burden of proof and hold me to a higher standard </em>[or] <em>feel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number><em>sympathy for the defendant. </em>Even if she thinks she can do it \u2014 even if she thinks she can be fair, based on her answers, I don\u2019t think she can be.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">As for Prospective Juror V.B., the prosecutor stated it was \u201ca little bit more obvious\u201d because she had health issues, and she said her children \u201cwere accused of being in gangs and were convicted of crimes. One was like a robbery. And then she said she can\u2019t decide whether her sons\u2019 situations will affect her or not were her words. [\u00b6] And she said her sons weren\u2019t treated fair. She did say it was more than ten years ago, but still with those remarks I found \u2014 she was an obvious kick for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">While Prospective Juror W.W. was still on the jury panel, the prosecutor interjected that he was \u201cnot willing to concede\u201d that she was African-American. The prosecutor added, \u201cPossibly, but I can\u2019t tell based on\u2014 because she is very light-complected.\u201d The court said it initially believed she was Hispanic but concluded she was African-American. The prosecutor said he did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">\n<em>The court\u2019s denial of the motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">After hearing the prosecutor\u2019s reasons, the court denied defense counsel\u2019s <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motion based on Prospective Jurors V.K. and V.B.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-9\">\u201cI feel that the excusing of [V.B.] was for a race-neutral justification.

The prosecutor excused another prospective juror. After further questioning, defense counsel replied that he would accept the jury as it was constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">The court asked the prosecutor for his next challenge. He excused Prospective Juror W.W. Defense counsel immediately made another <em>Batson/Wheeler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>objection. The court excused the panel and asked the reporter to read back Prospective Juror W.W.\u2019s voir dire responses to clarify its notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Defense counsel argued that the prosecutor had dismissed all three African-American women who had been called to the box as potential jurors. The court replied that two African-American men were still in seats 8 and 9. Defense counsel argued: \u201cIt seems like [the prosecutor] is systematically throwing off African-Americans. I don\u2019t really see much of a reason. [\u00b6] I do say as to [V.B.], I think there was enough to which he could have thrown her off and I can see why he did so. [\u00b6] I did not see for [V.K.]. Even though he gave some excuse as to the husband being a senior pastor, I think it was just an excuse. [\u00b6] As to [W.W.], I definitely don\u2019t see anything whatsoever as to [W.W.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The court asked defense counsel about Prospective Juror W.W.\u2019s statements regarding the incident when she was attacked on the street, and law enforcement did not give her attention or refer her to medical care. Defense counsel replied the prosecutor failed to ask any follow-up questions about whether that incident \u201chad any draining effect on her whatsoever,\u201d and she told the court that she could be fair and impartial. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about her mannerisms or the way she spoke that led [me] to believe that she was going to hold any type of bias in this case whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The court asked the prosecutor whether he had anything to say before it decided whether a prima facie case had been made. The prosecutor again refused to concede that Prospective Juror W.W. was African-American. Defense counsel replied that the prosecutor was being \u201cdisingenuous to the Court\u201d to say that she was not African-American. The court again said it appeared she was African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">\n<em>Prima facie case and request for justification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The court stated that since Prospective Juror W.W. was the third African-American female excused, there was an inference \u201cthough very slight, of discriminatory purpose,\u201d and asked the prosecutor \u201cto offer permissible race-neutral justifications for the strike.\u201d The following exchange occurred;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: . . .

Defense counsel used two more challenges, and the prosecutor also used two more peremptory challenges. The prosecutor and defense counsel each challenged a prospective alternate juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>The record strongly implies the final composition of the jury included two African-American men (Jurors Nos. 8 and 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">I. <em>Denial of Defendant\u2019s </em>Batson/Wheeler <em>Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Defendant contends the court committed reversible error when it denied two <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motions to discharge the jury panel based on the prosecutor\u2019s alleged discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. Defendant, who is Hispanic, contends the prosecution violated his federal and state constitutional rights to equal protection and a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community by exercising peremptory challenges to excuse all three African-American women from the jury: Prospective Jurors V.B., V.K., and W.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">We have already set out the entirety of voir dire as it relates to these three prospective jurors. We now turn to the legal framework for <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motions, and review the prosecutor\u2019s justifications and the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">A. <em>Batson/Wheeler</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">\u201cBoth the state and federal Constitutions prohibit the use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors based on race or gender. [Citations.] Such a use of peremptories by the prosecution \u2018violates the right of a criminal defendant to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article I, section 16 of the California Constitution. [Citations.] Such a practice also violates the defendant\u2019s right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bonilla, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 341; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 630, 705 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 214, 299 P.3d 1185].)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">\u201cThere is a rebuttable presumption that a peremptory challenge is being exercised properly, and the burden is on the opposing party to demonstrate impermissible discrimination.\u201d <em>(Bonilla, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 341.)</p>\n<p id=\"pAV7\">\u201cThe now familiar <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>inquiry consists of three distinct steps. First, the opponent of the strike must make out a prima facie case by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Second, if the prima facie case has been made, the burden shifts to the proponent of the strike to explain adequately the basis for excusing the juror by offering permissible, nondiscriminatory justifications. Third, if the party has offered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>nondiscriminatory reason, the trial court must decide whether the opponent of the strike has proved the ultimate question of purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 363, 383 [188 Cal.Rptr.3d 328, 349 P.3d 1028] <em>(Scott).) </em>\u201cThe ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lenix </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 602, 612-613 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 98, 187 P.3d 946] <em>(Lenix).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">As noted above, the exclusion by peremptory challenge of a single juror on the basis of race, gender, or ethnicity is an error of constitutional magnitude requiring reversal. <em>(Silva, </em>supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 386; <em>Bonilla, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 340-341.) The California Supreme Court has held that African-American women are a cognizable group under <em>Wheeler. (People v.

The court requested the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for the peremptory challenges and ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination. Thus, the question of whether defendant established a prima facie case is moot. <em>(Lenix, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 613, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The burden shifted to the prosecutor to \u201cexplain adequately the basis for excusing the juror by offering permissible, nondiscriminatory justifications,\u201d and for the court to determine if the prosecutor offered a nondiscriminatory reason and whether \u201cthe opponent of the strike has proved the ultimate question of purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>(Scott, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 383.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">B. <em>The Prosecutor\u2019s Reasons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">We are thus concerned with the third step of a <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>analysis. <em>(People v.

[Citations.] Nevertheless, although a prosecutor may rely on any number of bases to select jurors, a legitimate reason is one that does not deny equal protection. [Citation.] Certainly a challenge based on racial prejudice would not be supported by a legitimate reason.\u201d <em>(Lenix, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 613.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">The basis for a peremptory challenge \u201cmay range from \u2018the virtually certain to the highly speculative\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(People v.

The challenge may be justified by \u201c \u2018a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried\u2019 \u201d or \u201cmay be based on employment [citation]\u201d so long as the reasons are not based on impermissible group bias. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">\u201cAt the third stage of the <em>Wheeler/Batson </em>inquiry, \u2018the issue comes down to whether the trial court finds the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations to be credible. Credibility can be measured by, among other factors, the prosecutor\u2019s demeanor; by how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by whether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.\u2019 [Citation.] In assessing credibility, the court draws upon its contemporaneous observations of the voir dire. It may also rely on the court\u2019s own experiences as a lawyer and bench officer in the community, and even the common practices of the advocate and the office that employs him or her.\u201d <em>(Lenix, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 613, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\u201cReview of a trial court\u2019s denial of a <em>Wheeler/Batson </em>is deferential, examining only whether substantial evidence supports its conclusions.

Defendant contends the prosecutor\u2019s discriminatory intent and an inference of impermissible bias are inherent simply from his use of a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges against a single racial group. The prosecutor used three of eight peremptory challenges to excuse all the African-American women. However, race-based discrimination is difficult to show from a small number of challenges. <em>In People v. Taylor </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 574 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 87, 229 P.3d 12], the court rejected a similar argument where the prosecutor used three of 10 challenges to excuse one Hispanic and two African-Americans. <em>Taylor </em>held that \u201c[s]uch evidence, without more\u201d was insufficient to create an inference of discrimination, especially where \u201cthe number of peremptory challenges at issue is so small.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Defendant also complains that the court failed to satisfy its duty under <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>because it merely accepted the prosecutor\u2019s stated justifications, stated its conclusions, and did not give detailed reasons for denying the <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objections. In evaluating the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, however, \u201cthe trial court is not required to make specific or detailed comments for the record to justify every instance in which a prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>reason for exercising a peremptory challenge is being accepted by the court as genuine.\u201d <em>(Reynoso, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 919.) Only when the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons are unsupported by the record, inherently implausible, or both must the court do more than make a \u201cglobal finding that the reasons appear sufficient.\u201d <em>(Silva, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at p. 386.) As we will explain below, the court\u2019s findings were sufficient as to Prospective Jurors V.B. and Y.K., but we are concerned about the court\u2019s reaction to\u2014or failure to explore \u2014 the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing Prospective Juror W.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Defendant also asserts the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges must be subject to comparative juror analysis. \u201c[EJvidence of comparative juror analysis must be considered in the trial court and even for the first time on appeal <em>if relied upon by defendant </em>and the record is adequate to permit the urged comparisons.\u201d <em>(Lenix, </em>supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 622, italics added.) \u201c[Comparative juror analysis is but one form of circumstantial evidence that is relevant, but not necessarily dispositive, on the issue of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe rationale for comparative juror analysis is that a side-by-side comparison [of the characteristics and voir dire responses] of a prospective juror struck by the prosecutor with a prospective juror accepted by the prosecutor may provide relevant circumstantial evidence of purposeful discrimination by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>DeHoyos </em>(2013) 57 Cal.4th 79, 109 [158 Cal.Rptr.3d 797, 303 P.3d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">\u201cAlthough we must consider comparative juror analysis evidence raised for the first time on appeal [citation], our focus is limited to the responses of stricken panelists and seated jurors <em>that have been identified by defendant in his claim of disparate treatment.\u201d (People v. Lomax </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 530, 572 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 96, 234 P.3d 377], italics added.) Defendant has raised this issue summarily without citing, addressing, or identifying responses from any other prospective or seated jurors as being comparable to the three people who were the subject of his <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objections. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Johnson, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at pp. 759-760; <em>Lenix, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 630; <em>People v. Chism, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1318; <em>People v. Riccardi </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 758, 787-788 [144 Cal.Rptr.3d 84, 281 P.3d 1].) We take defendant\u2019s failure to do so as a concession that he does not depend on a thorough comparative analysis in support of his argument. Moreover, as we will explain, we need not rely on circumstantial evidence to divine the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing the three prospective jurors, particularly any pretextual nature of his reasons for excusing W.W., given his express statements at the <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">We now turn to the prosecutor\u2019s justifications for removing the three African-American women from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>D. <em>Prospective Juror V.B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">While defendant focuses his appellate arguments on the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to excuse Prospective Jurors V.K. and W.W., he also cites to the removal of Prospective Juror V.B. as indicative of the prosecutor\u2019s intent to removal all African-American women from the jury. We thus begin with Prospective Juror V.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">When the prosecutor excused Prospective V.B., defense counsel did not object. As peremptory challenges continued, the prosecutor excused Prospective Juror V.K., and defendant then raised a <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objection as to both Prospective Jurors V.B. and V.K. The court found a prima facie case and asked the prosecutor for explanations.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">As to Prospective Juror V.B., the prosecutor cited her health issues, which she had relied on to ask to be excused for cause. The prosecutor also cited Prospective Juror V.B.\u2019s statements about her children \u2014 that they \u201cwere accused of being in gangs and were convicted of crimes. One was like a robbery. And then she said she can\u2019t decide whether her son\u2019s situation will affect her or not were her words. [\u00b6] And she said her sons weren\u2019t treated fair. She did say it was more than ten years ago, but still with those remarks I found \u2014 she was an obvious kick for me.\u201d The court found the prosecutor stated a race-neutral justification to excuse Prospective Juror V.B. based on \u201cher health issue, and then also the children charged with crimes or associated with those charged with crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">There is substantial evidence to support the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral justifications and the court\u2019s findings as to Prospective Juror V.B. As recounted above, Prospective Juror V.B. asked to be excused for cause because of her health concerns and her sons\u2019 alleged involvement with gangs in Kern County. She stated both sons had been sentenced to prison, and she felt one son had been treated unfairly by the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">The use of peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors who have had negative experiences with the criminal justice system, or have relatives or family members in prison, is not unconstitutional. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roldan </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 703 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 360, 110 P.3d 289], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v.

Morris </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 402, 409 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 872].) \u201c[T]he arrest or conviction of a juror\u2019s relative provides a legitimate, group-neutral basis for excluding a juror.\u201d <em>(People v. Turner </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 413, 419 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 138].) Indeed, defense counsel conceded during the <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>hearing that there were valid reasons to excuse Prospective Juror V.B. (See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Cornwell </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 50, 70 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 117 P.3d 622], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Doolin, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22 [\u201cThe juror\u2019s own remarks also clearly do not support an inference she was excused because of her race \u2014 on the contrary, despite her obvious intelligence and good faith, her voir dire disclosed a large number of reasons other than racial bias for <em>any </em>prosecutor to challenge her, including but not limited to her personal experience with an allegedly unfair homicide prosecution of a close relative and her express distrust of the criminal justice system and its treatment of African-American defendants . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">E. <em>Prospective Juror V.K.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Also in response to defendant\u2019s first <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objection, the court found a prima facie case and asked the prosecutor to state reasons for his removal of Prospective Juror V.K. The prosecutor replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-6\">\n<em>\u201c[H\\er spouse is a senior pastor, and Pm always concerned with people from the clergy coming in because they have a lot of dealings and sympathy and that type of outreach.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-7\">\u201cAnd when [defense counsel] was questioning her and he was asking about what she thinks, she said he <em>looks </em>\u2014 she <em>said the defendant looks like a young man, groomed, in a nice suit, accurate observations, but it was the way she said it, and coming with the fact that her husband\u2019s a senior pastor, which to me means the head of a church, causes me great concern that she will increase my burden of proof and hold me to a higher standard </em>[or] <em>feel sympathy for the defendant. </em>Even if she things she can do it \u2014 even if she thinks she can be fair, based on her answers, I don\u2019t think she can be.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">According to the voir dire transcript, Prospective Juror V.K. said she was a special needs social worker with Kern Regional Center.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Her husband was a \u201csenior pastor,\u201d and she did not further define his pastoral duties. She answered no to the entirety of the voir dire questions about prior contacts with law enforcement, whether she had been a crime victim, and exposure to pretrial publicity. Defense counsel asked if there was anything about defendant that made her already judge him as guilty. She replied: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know him. He just looks like a young man, well-groomed, in a nice suit.\u201d When asked if her opinion would change if she saw photographs of defendant throwing gang signs, she replied: \u201cInnocent until proven guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">The court denied defendant\u2019s <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motion as to Prospective Juror V.K. and found the prosecutor stated a race-neutral justification for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>striking her \u201cbased upon the senior pastoral duties of her spouse and her answers to your questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">On appeal, defendant argues the record undermines the prosecutor\u2019s stated justifications for removing Prospective Juror V.K. and the court\u2019s findings: her husband \u2014 and not Prospective Juror V.K. \u2014 was a pastor; she did not make any statements to indicate her husband\u2019s job would interfere with her ability to be an impartial juror; her statements were only made in response to the court\u2019s voir dire; the prosecutor failed to ask her any questions or engage in any meaningful examination; and the court merely found the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were valid without questioning the basis for his explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The occupation of a prospective juror\u2019s spouse may be a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for a peremptory challenge. <em>(People v. Rushing </em>(2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 801, 811-812 [129 Cal.Rptr.3d 26].) The prosecutor\u2019s failure to specially question Prospective Juror V.K. on his stated concerns, by itself, \u201cis of little or no consequence\u201d since she responded to numerous questions from the court and defense counsel. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 476 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 181 P.3d 947], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Black </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 912, 919-920 [169 Cal.Rptr.3d 363, 320 P.3d 800].)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">In addition, for purposes of <em>Batson/Wheeler, </em>\u201ca \u2018legitimate reason\u2019 is not a reason that makes sense, but a reason that does not deny equal protection.\u201d <em>(Burkett v. Elem, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 768-769; see <em>Reynoso, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 916.) For example, a peremptory challenge based on a prospective juror\u2019s experience in counseling or social services, and the prosecutor\u2019s concern that such a person might be too sympathetic to the defense, have been held as proper race-neutral reasons for excusal. <em>(People v. Clark </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 907-908 [131 Cal.Rptr.3d 225, 261 P.3d 243]; <em>People v. Trevino </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 396, 411-412 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 61]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Landry </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 785, 790-791 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 824]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 652, 677 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 208, 182 P.3d 543]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1315 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 299].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Mai </em>(2013) 57 Cal.4th 986 [161 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 305 P.3d 1175], the court held that a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cexpressed reservation about having social workers on the jury was race neutral. It also had \u2018 \u201c \u2018some basis in accepted trial strategy\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [citation] insofar as it stemmed from a concern about the general attitudes and philosophies persons in that profession might harbor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1053.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">In this case, there is substantial evidence to support the prosecutor\u2019s stated justification for excusing Prospective Juror V.K. She was a social worker, her husband was a pastor, and her description of defendant as \u201ca young man, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>well-groomed, in a nice suit\u201d raised the prosecutor\u2019s concerns that she would be overly sympathetic to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">F. <em>Prospective Juror W.W.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">We now turn to the prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse Prospective Juror W.W., which triggered defendant\u2019s second <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objection. The People assert the prosecutor stated a valid race-neutral reason to excuse Prospective Juror W.W. because she was not satisfied with how the police treated her when she was assaulted, and the prosecutor was concerned that she had been on a jury which heard a civil suit for \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">But the entirety of the prosecutor\u2019s statements about Prospective Juror W.W. raise serious questions about the credibility of any purported race-neutral reasons. As set forth above, Prospective Juror W.W. stated in voir dire she had been a field representative in Kern County for the Department of Commerce for 22 years, and she collected information \u201cfor Congress and President and different organizations that distribute information back down to the cities and counties about work, the state of the nation, how people are doing health-wise.\u201d She had two accounting degrees and her spouse worked for the city; he was not employed in law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">When defendant made his first <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objection as to Prospective Jurors V.B. and V.K., the court noted Prospective Juror W.W. and two other African-Americans were still on the panel. For some reason, the prosecutor vigorously objected to the court\u2019s statement that Prospective Juror W.W. was African-American, and an extended discussion ensued. The court stated that she appeared to be African-American, but the prosecutor refused to concede the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">When the prosecutor subsequently excused Prospective Juror W.W., defense counsel immediately made another <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objection. The prosecutor\u2019s initial response was to again say that Prospective Juror W.W. was not African-American. The court again rejected the prosecutor\u2019s statements and said that she was African-American. It found a prima facie case and asked the prosecutor to state his reasons. Here is the prosecutor\u2019s first reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-9\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: . . . Having found a prima facie case, [W.W.] is <em>a </em>\u2014 she <em>works for a liberal political organization where she provides information to the Democratic Party or Congress </em>\u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>Did you hear \u2018commerce\u2019 and \u2018Congress\u2019 at different </em>times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: I just heard \u2018Congress.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I only heard that of \u2018commerce.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did you hear \u2018commerce\u2019 too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I heard \u2018commerce.\u2019 I never heard\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Several times. [\u00b6] And I think the second thing [the reporter] had read did say \u2018Congress,\u2019 and I thought I heard her say \u2018Congress\u2019 too, but then she goes back to \u2018commerce.\u2019 [\u00b6] <em>Didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-9\">\u201c[THE PROSECUTOR]: <em>But she deals with these liberal organizations for what I heard was Congress and collects </em>\u2014 she <em>did say she collects information for the government and I don\u2019t know </em>\u2014 I <em>mean, she could have political motives or anything like that. I just don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t have all day to go into that.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">This exchange raises several concerns. A prospective juror\u2019s occupation may be a permissible, nondiscriminatory reason for exercising a peremptory challenge, and a prosecutor is entitled to believe that people involved in particular professions or with particular philosophical leanings are ill-suited to serve as jurors because they are not sympathetic to the prosecutor. <em>(People v. Chism, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1316; <em>Reynoso, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 924-925; <em>People </em>v. <em>Landry, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at pp. 790-791; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adanandus </em>(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 496, 507-508 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 25]; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Barber </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 378, 394 [245 Cal.Rptr. 895] [court noted peremptory challenges are often exercised against teachers by prosecutors on the belief they are deemed to be rather liberal]; <em>People v. Perez, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1315 [same; social services or caregiving fields]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 411 [same; prospective jurors or their spouses in health care or social services fields]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Granillo </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 110, 120-121, fn. 2 [242 Cal.Rptr. 639] [many prosecutors believe various professional people are too demanding or require certainty].)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">In this case, however, the factual premise for the prosecutor\u2019s reason for excusing Prospective Juror W.W. from the jury is unsubstantiated in the record. Indeed, there is no evidentiary basis for the prosecutor\u2019s declaration that Prospective Juror W.W. worked for \u201ca liberal political organization\u201d and could have \u201cpolitical motives.\u201d Prospective Juror W.W. stated she had worked as a field representative for the Department of Commerce and collected information about the county residents, which was reported to the President <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>and Congress. She had the same job for 22 years, which meant she worked throughout presidential administrations and congressional majorities from both political parties. She never said she was affiliated with a particular political party.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">It was only after the prosecutor stated his reason about Prospective Juror W.W.\u2019s alleged \u201cpolitical motives,\u201d and the court and defense counsel made halting attempts to point out his error, that he mentioned her prior experience with the police and jury service on a \u201cpolice brutality\u201d case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-5\">\u201c[S]he did have a problem with the police. She didn\u2019t like the way things were handled. And you think about what she wasn\u2019t happy with, she was unhappy that they didn\u2019t give her a ride home. Police aren\u2019t required to give her a ride home. So she\u2019s kind of holding them to a higher standard than they have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\">\u201cAnd before that, when talking about her jury service, <em>the first case she mentions is the police brutality suit. So I think even if she doesn\u2019t know it, she\u2019s got a little bit of a bias there. When talking about her prior jury service, the first thing that comes to mind is a police brutality case and then later on she talles about a problem with police.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\">\u201cSo I think she\u2019s got a bias against police and potentially some sort of political motives. Those are my justifications, your Honor.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The court summarily denied defendant\u2019s <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>objection and simply said that the prosecutor had \u201cprovided a race-neutral explanation. Defense has not proved any purposeful racial discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">\u201cAlthough we generally \u2018accord great deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling that a particular reason is genuine,\u2019 we do so only when the trial court has made a sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate each stated reason as applied to each challenged juror. [Citations.] When the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons are both inherently plausible and supported by the record, the trial court need not question the prosecutor or make detailed findings. But when the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons are either unsupported by the record, inherently implausible, or both, more is required of the trial court than a global finding that the reasons appear sufficient.\u201d <em>(Silva, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 385-386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">\u201c \u2018The trial court has a duty to determine the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s proferred explanations\u2019 [citation], and it should be suspicious when presented with reasons that are unsupported or otherwise implausible [citations].\u201d <em>(Silva, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 385.) \u201cAlthough an isolated mistake or misstatement that the trial court recognizes as such is generally insufficient to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>discriminatory intent [citation], it is another matter altogether when ... the record of voir dire provides no support for the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge and the trial court has failed to probe the issue [citations].\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">The prosecutor misstated the record when he asserted W.W. worked for a \u201cliberal political organization\u201d connected to the \u201cDemocratic Party or Congress.\u201d Upon hearing this reason, both the court and defense counsel initially tried to clarify whether W.W. said \u201cCommerce\u201d or \u201cCongress.\u201d However, the court did not attempt to pursue the matter. The prosecutor again asserted W.W. worked for and collected information for \u201cthese liberal organizations\u201d and \u201cshe could have political motives.\u201d The court summarily denied the motion without pursuing the prosecutor\u2019s obvious inaccuracy about W.W.\u2019s employment and the inference which he made from those erroneous assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We are also concerned about the prosecutor\u2019s expression of doubt that W.W. was African-American, which he initially raised when he excused Prospective Jurors V.B. and V.K. It is understandable that a prosecutor would not want to be accused of systematically removing minorities from a jury panel. In this case, however, the prosecutor\u2019s repeated assertions that Prospective Juror W.W. may not be African-American undermine his subsequent claim that he excused her because of the race-neutral reason of her prior interaction with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In <em>Reynoso, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 903, the court acknowledged <em>Silva\u2019s </em>concerns in cases where the prosecutor\u2019s stated justifications were contradicted by the record <em>(id. </em>at p. 922), and clarified that \u201c \u2018great deference\u2019 \u201d should be given to the trial court\u2019s findings under the following circumstances <em>(Reynoso </em>at p. 908). \u201cWhere ... the trial court is fully apprised of the nature of the defense challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of a particular peremptory challenge, <em>where the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing the juror are neither contradicted by the record nor inherently implausible </em>[citation], and where nothing in the record is in conflict with the usual presumptions to be drawn, i.e., that all peremptory challenges have been exercised in a constitutional manner, and that the trial court has properly made a sincere and reasoned evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for exercising his peremptory challenges, then those presumptions may be relied upon, and a <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>motion denied, notwithstanding that the record does not contain detailed findings regarding the reasons for the exercise of each such peremptory challenge.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 929, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">However, Reynoso\u2019s conclusion \u201cis inapplicable by its terms when . . . one of the stated reasons deemed by the trial court to be a \u2018legitimate\u2019 basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>excusing a prospective juror is contradicted by the record.\u201d <em>(People v. Long </em>(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 826, 847 [117 Cal.Rptr.3d 451].) \u201cDoubt may undermine deference . . . when the trial judge makes a general, global finding that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were all \u2018legitimate,\u2019 and at least one of those reasons is demonstrably false within the limitations of the appellate record.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 845.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">We are faced with the narrow exception anticipated by <em>Reynoso </em>and <em>Silva. </em>Even given deferential review, there is no evidence to support the prosecutor\u2019s reason for removing Prospective Juror W.W. The prosecutor\u2019s reason was inconsistent with and unsupported by the record. While the court initially questioned the prosecutor\u2019s account of the record, it quickly apologized for interrupting him. There is simply an absence of factual support for the prosecution\u2019s explanation, and the court failed to adequately determine the credibility of the proffered justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We note that the prosecutor\u2019s acceptance of a panel containing some African-American jurors \u201cstrongly suggests that race was not a motive\u201d in challenging other minorities on the panel. <em>(Lenix, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 629.) The record implies that two African-American jurors (Nos. 8 and 9) were still on the panel when Prospective Juror W.W. was excused, and they were ultimately seated on this jury. However, the exclusion by peremptory challenge of a single juror on the basis of race is an error of constitutional magnitude requiring reversal. <em>(People v. Chism, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1316; <em>Silva, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 386; <em>Bonilla, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 340-341.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">We acknowledge the prosecutor stated two race-neutral concerns about Prospective Juror W.W., based on her prior experience with police and service on a jury in a civil suit involving police brutality.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018We have repeatedly upheld peremptory challenges made on the basis of a prospective juror\u2019s negative experience with law enforcement.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lenix, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 628.) The apparent race-neutral reason of Prospective Juror W.W.\u2019s reaction to the police response when she was assaulted was \u201capparent from and \u2018clearly established\u2019 in the record.\u201d <em>(Scott, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 384; see <em>People v.

In <em>Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>231, the United States Supreme Court granted federal habeas corpus relief and held that the state court\u2019s reasons supporting the absence of racial discrimination in the capital inmate\u2019s jury selection process were not supported by clear and convincing evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 266.) <em>Miller-El </em>engaged in a comparative juror analysis which showed \u201cthat race was significant in determining who was challenged and who was not.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 252.) In further rejecting the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for striking a prospective African-American juror, <em>Miller-El </em>characterized as an afterthought the prosecutor\u2019s explanation \u2014 the prospective juror\u2019s brother had a prior conviction \u2014 because he provided it only after defense counsel had discredited an earlier stated reason as patently false. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 246.) As in Miller-El, we similarly find the prosecutor\u2019s reliance on Prospective Juror W.W.\u2019s interaction with the police was raised only after the court and defense counsel attempted to question his characterization of her employment and speculation about her political views.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">In evaluating the prosecutor\u2019s justifications for excusing a prospective juror, \u201cimplausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>(Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 768; see <em>Reynoso, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 916.) \u201cWhere the facts in the record are objectively contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s statements, serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecutor\u2019s reasons for exercising peremptory challenges are raised.\u201d <em>(McClain </em>v. <em>Prunty </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 217 F.3d 1209, 1221; see <em>People v. Boyette </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 471-472 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 58 P.3d 391]; <em>Castellanos v. Small </em>(9th Cir. 2014) 766 F.3d 1137, 1148; <em>Caldwell v. Maloney </em>(1st Cir. 1998) 159 F.3d 639, 651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We conclude the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination \u2014 that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving intentional discrimination as to the removal of Prospective Juror W.W. \u2014 is not supported by the record and unreasonable in light of the evidence of the voir dire proceedings and the court\u2019s failure to \u201ctake the next, necessary step of asking whether the asserted reasons actually applied to the particular juror[]\u201d being excused by the prosecutor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fuentes </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 707, 721 [286 Cal.Rptr. 792, 818 P.2d 75]; see <em>Silva, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 385.) Defendant\u2019s convictions therefore must be reversed. <em>(Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 110; <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 283; <em>People v.
