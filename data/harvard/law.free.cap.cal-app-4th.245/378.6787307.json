J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4k\">\u2014 In <em>Estate of Kevin </em>A. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 1241 [193 Cal.Rptr.3d 237], the trial court found a conservatee to be gravely disabled under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS Act). (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5000 et seq.) Prior to trial, the conservatee told the court he wanted a jury trial. The trial court, however, accepted the conservatee\u2019s attorney\u2019s waiver of a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">The Court of Appeal in <em>Estate of Kevin A. </em>reversed the trial court\u2019s order granting the petition filed by the county public conservator to reestablish a one-year conservatorship. The court accepted a jury waiver from the conser-vatee\u2019s attorney without determining whether the conservatee lacked the capacity to decide whether to proceed by jury trial. <em>(Estate of Kevin A., supra, </em>240 Cal.App.4th at p. 1251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Here we decide what is implicit in the holding in <em>Estate of Kevin A. </em>In conservatorship proceedings pursuant to the LPS Act, the trial court must obtain a personal waiver of a jury trial from the conservatee, even when the conservatee expresses no preference for a jury trial. Absent such a waiver, the court must accord the conservatee a jury trial unless the court finds the conservatee lacks the capacity to make such a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Heather W. appeals an order reappointing the San Luis Obispo County Public Guardian (Public Guardian) as her conservator under the LPS Act. The conservatorship order followed a court trial. We conclude, among other things, that the trial court erred by (1) not advising Heather W. of her right to a jury trial and (2) not obtaining Heather W.\u2019s on-the-record personal waiver of that right without a finding that she lacked the capacity to make a jury waiver. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In 2013, the Public Guardian petitioned to be appointed an LPS conservator for Heather W. because she was gravely disabled due to a mental disorder. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5008, subd. (h)(1)(A).) The trial court granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">In 2014, the Public Guardian petitioned to be reappointed an LPS conservator for Heather W, alleging she was still gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder. The trial court set the case for a court trial. Heather W.\u2019s counsel did not request a jury trial. The court advised Heather W. of her right to testify, but did not advise her that she had a right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">At trial, Dr. Rose Drago, a psychiatrist, testified that Heather W. has a \u201cschizoaffective disorder, which is characterized by periods of psychosis intermingled with mood instability. . . . [Heather W] has delusional content that is of a very paranoid nature. . . . She was homeless for quite a long time.\u201d Heather W. had four prior admissions to a \u201cpsychiatric health facility.\u201d She had been hospitalized seven times in San Luis Obispo County since 2011 because of her \u201cgrave disability\u201d and because she is a \u201cdanger to others.\u201d Heather W. has group therapy at her current treatment facility, but she does not benefit from it \u201cbecause of her paranoia.\u201d She is \u201cnot very participatory\u201d in treatment programs. She has \u201ca lack of ability to benefit from . . . resources\u201d in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Drago testified that Heather W. has a history of refusing to take her medications and she is not able to \u201ccompetently make the decision\u201d about taking medication. Heather W. lacks insight as to her illness and need for treatment. Her mental disorder is accompanied by symptoms that affect her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ability \u201cto provide herself with food or clothing or shelter.\u201d She was admitted into a psychiatric health facility in 2013 and considered \u201cgravely disabled and a danger to herself at that time.\u201d She had been wandering, was disoriented and unable to provide her name. In 2013, Heather W. was in a homeless shelter, but she was \u201cacting bizarrely, pacing, responding to hallucinations.\u201d She was not \u201cable to function in their facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Drago testified that, while on her own, Heather W. is not \u201cable to carry out a plan of self care.\u201d She said, \u201cGiven [Heather W.\u2019s] impulsivity and her tendency towards violence at times, ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for her to drive a car. I think it\u2019s a dangerous situation.\u201d Drago recommended that an appropriate level of placement would be in a locked facility: \u201cI think that the AWOL risk is quite high for her walking away from a facility that wasn\u2019t locked. I think she needs the structure and the support of one of those facilities for now. Hopefully, she\u2019ll stabilize more and be able to go to an unlocked facility, maybe a structured board and care at some point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Heather W. testified that if the LPS petition is denied, she would \u201cput [herself ] through college,\u201d work, and find \u201ca room or an apartment.\u201d She was participating in the groups offered at the treatment facility. She said, \u201cI am fully competent.... I\u2019m only at the hospital because I thought it was a safer place to be than where I was at the time.\u201d Heather W. testified that she receives $897 in benefits a month, is owed $13,000 \u201cin back pay,\u201d and \u201cthere should be no reason whatsoever that I could not care for myself.\u201d She said, \u201cI think I have mild schizophrenia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The trial court found Heather W. gravely disabled. The trial judge stated, \u201cI\u2019m very worried about [her] number of hospitalizations.\u201d The court appointed the Public Guardian as her conservator with the power to \u201c[d]etain and care\u201d for her and require placement \u201cin a suitable institution, facility, home or hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\n<em>Right to a Jury Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Heather W. contends the order appointing the Public Guardian as her LPS conservator must be reversed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">In <em>Conservatorship of Roulet </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 219, 235 [152 Cal.Rptr. 425, 590 P.2d 1], our Supreme Court held, \u201cThe due process clause of the California Constitution requires that proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>unanimous jury verdict be applied to conservatorship proceedings under the LPS Act.\u201d An LPS commitment order involves a loss of liberty by the conservatee. Consequently, it follows that a trial court must obtain a waiver of the right to a jury trial from the person who is subject to an LPS commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Blackburn </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 1113, 1130 [191 Cal.Rptr.3d 458, 354 P.3d 268], our Supreme Court held that in a mentally disordered offender (MDO) commitment proceeding, \u201cthe decision to waive a jury trial belongs to the defendant in the first instance, and the trial court <em>must elicit the waiver decision from the defendant on the record in a court </em>proceeding.\u201d (Italics added.) The court added, \u201cBut if the trial court finds substantial evidence that the defendant lacks the capacity to make a knowing and voluntary waiver, then control of the waiver decision belongs to counsel, and the defendant may not override counsel\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Tran </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 1160, 1167 [191 Cal.Rptr.3d 251, 354 P.3d 148], our Supreme Court held that for extension of hospital commitments for defendants who plead not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI) (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)), \u201cthe decision to waive a jury trial belongs to the NGI defendant in the first instance, and the trial court must elicit the waiver decision from the defendant on the record in a court proceeding.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel may make the decision to waive a jury trial only where the defendant \u201clacks the capacity to make a knowing and voluntary waiver.\u201d <em>(Tran, </em>at p. 1167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">MDO, NGI, and LPS proceedings have the same underlying goal\u2014 protecting the public and treating severely mentally ill persons. <em>(People v. Blackburn, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 1122; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tran, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 1168; <em>Conservatorship of John L. </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 131, 150 [105 Cal.Rptr.3d 424, 225 P.3d 554].) In the LPS context, \u201c \u2018[t]he destruction of an individual\u2019s personal freedoms effected by civil commitment is scarcely less total than that effected by confinement in a penitentiary.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Conservatorship of Roulet, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 224.) \u201c[T]he gravely disabled person for whom a conservatorship has been established faces the loss of many other liberties in addition to the loss of his or her freedom from physical restraint.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 227.) \u201cIndeed, a conservatee may be subjected to greater control of his or her life than one convicted of a crime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 228.) Consequently, the right to a jury trial to contest an LPS conservatorship is a right guaranteed by the California Constitution. <em>(Roulet, </em>at p. 235.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Similar to the circumstances in <em>Blackburn </em>and <em>Tran, </em>LPS commitment proceedings require the court to obtain a personal waiver of the right to a jury trial from the proposed conservatee. Probate Code section 1828, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(a)(6) provides: \u201c[BJefore the establishment of a conservatorship of the person - or estate, or both, <em>the court shall inform the proposed conservatee </em>of all of the following .... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] .. . The proposed conservatee has the right to oppose the proceeding, <em>to have the matter of the establishment of the conservatorship tried by jury </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Here the trial judge did not give such an advisement to Heather W. and obtain her personal waiver of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The Public Guardian cites <em>Conservatorship of Mary K. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 265 [285 Cal.Rptr. 618], and claims counsel may make the waiver for the proposed conservatee. But <em>Mary K. </em>was decided before <em>Blackburn </em>and <em>Tran, </em>and is distinguishable. In <em>Mary K, </em>\u201ccounsel stated he had spoken with his client and she wished to waive a-jury trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 271.) The Court of Appeal noted, \u201cAppellant does not contend her attorney was without actual authority to waive a jury.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">By contrast, the record here does not indicate that Heather W. was given the choice to have a jury trial. At trial, two months later, the court advised Heather W. that she had the right to testify, but it did not advise her of the right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">LPS conservatees, MDO\u2019s, and NGI\u2019s cannot categorically be prevented from making decisions about commitment proceedings simply because they suffer from mental illnesses. As the court said in <em>Blackburn, </em>\u201c[M]any persons who suffer from mental illness or related disorders can understand the nature of legal proceedings and determine their own best interests.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blackburn, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 1128.) \u201c \u2018The potentially transitory and treatable nature of mental illness and the potentially limited areas of functioning impaired by such illness preclude any categorical inference that an MDO defendant facing a commitment extension proceeding cannot competently decide whether to waive a jury trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1129.) <em>Kevin A. </em>concluded that the \u201csame reasoning is applicable to a commitment extension in an LPS proceeding.\u201d <em>(Conservatorship of Kevin A., supra, </em>240 Cal.App.4th at p. 1252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The Public Guardian suggests any error is harmless because substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s order of reappointment for an LPS conservatorship. We agree that Drago\u2019s testimony supports the finding that Heather W. is gravely disabled for the purpose of an LPS conservatorship order. <em>(Conservatorship of Guerrero </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 442, 446-447 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 541].) But the critical issue here is Heather W.\u2019s fundamental right to decide who hears the evidence to make that finding \u2014 a judge or a jury. The trial court\u2019s error is not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>In <em>Tran, </em>the court said, an \u201cerror \u2014 -resulting in a complete denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial on the entire cause <em>in a commitment proceeding </em>\u2014 is <em>not susceptible to ordinary harmless error analysis and automatically requires </em>reversal.\u201d <em>(People v. Tran, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 1169, italics added.) But, \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s acceptance of counsel\u2019s waiver without an explicit finding of substantial evidence that the NGI defendant lacked the capacity to make a knowing and voluntary waiver may be deemed harmless if the record affirmatively shows that there was substantial evidence that the defendant lacked that capacity at the time of defense counsel\u2019s waiver.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1170.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Consequently, a remand is required for the trial court to determine whether Heather W. \u201clacked the capacity to make a knowing and voluntary waiver at the time of counsel\u2019s waiver.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tran, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 1170.) The trial court may reinstate its order \u201cif it finds substantial evidence that [she] lacked the capacity to make\u201d such a waiver. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">[[/]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The order is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with <em>People v. Tran, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at page 1170 regarding a jury trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-9\">Yegan, J., and Perren, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 378.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
