With respect to the State defendants, plaintiffs have sought (1) a declaratory judgment that they have exclusive ownership of the portion of the beach between the high tide mark and the vegetation line, identified as \"the dry sand beach,\" (2) to quiet title in that portion of the beach, and (3) injunctive relief. Because we hold that the quiet title and injunctive relief claims are barred by sovereign immunity and that there is no justiciable controversy with respect to the declaratory judgment claim, we affirm the trial court's orders dismissing plaintiffs' claims against the State defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The beach community known as Whalehead Club is located in Currituck County near Corolla, North Carolina. Plaintiffs each own property at Whalehead. At the heart of plaintiffs' claims are their contentions regarding ownership of various parts of the beach that Whalehead borders. The beach adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean along North Carolina's Outer Banks is generally identified as having three \"zones.\" These zones are (1) the \"wet sand beach,\" which is the area \"subject to regular flooding by tides,\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 77-20(e) (2003); (2) the \"dry sand beach,\" which is the area \"subject to occasional flooding by tides, including wind tides other than those resulting from a hurricane or tropical storm,\"\n   <em>\n    id.;\n   </em>\n   and (3) the area landward of the dry sand beach. The debate in this case concerns the dry sand beach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 19 September 1997, several property owners in Whalehead filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against various defendants, among them Currituck County, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), and the North Carolina Board of Transportation (\"BOT\"). Although the record before this Court does not contain the federal court complaint, the record indicates the complaint alleged that the Whalehead beach was private property and that the County and DOT injured plaintiffs by encouraging public access to the ocean and beach areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DOT and BOT filed a motion to dismiss, based on (1) lack of diversity of citizenship, (2) failure to join the State of North Carolina and DENR as necessary parties, and (3) immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. In support of the motion, DOT and BOT filed the affidavit of Roger N. Schecter, then Director of the Division of Coastal Management, a division within DENR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the filing of defendants' motion to dismiss, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the federal lawsuit and filed this action in Currituck County Superior Court on 19 June 1998. Plaintiffs included as defendants the developer of Whalehead, general partners of the developer, the original owners of the undeveloped Outer Banks property that became Whalehead, and Currituck County. Plaintiffs also sued the State of North Carolina, DOT, BOT, DENR, the Coastal Resources Commission, the Division of Coastal Management, and Roger N. Schecter \"as Director of the Division of Coastal Management.\" The complaint identifies the latter defendants collectively as the \"State Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that plaintiffs purchased their property based on representations indicating that the Whalehead beach would be private, secluded, and remote. Plaintiffs also allege that they were told that the property lines for the oceanfront lots stretched to the mean high tide line. Restrictive covenants provided that the lots in the section where plaintiffs purchased their property could only be used for residential purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the complaint, the original developers conveyed to Currituck County several oceanfront lots in the \"residential purposes only\" section. After the County paved those lots, the developer assured Whalehead residents that the paved lots were for the exclusive use of Whalehead residents and their guests. In 1995, however, Currituck County erected signs that indicated the paved lots were for public parking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, the complaint alleges that access ramps or walkways stretching from a Whalehead road to the vegetation line on the beach were constructed on 10-foot-wide strips of land that were owned by the developer. Signs also appeared at intervals along the easternmost north-south road in Whalehead identifying these ramps and walkways as providing \"Public Beach Access.\" Plaintiffs allege \"upon information and belief\" that the ramps or walkways and the signs were constructed by the State defendants, the developer, or the County and that they were funded by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to the effect of the provision of public access, the complaint alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   104. As a result of the pedestrian boardwalks, including their failure to extend to the mean high-tide line, persons using the boardwalks have a greater incentive to stray across the adjacent private beachfront lots to reach the beach area between the mean high-tide line and the mean low-tide line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   105. Members of the general public, on a non-continuing and recurring basis, and mostly during the tourist season, use the [access areas] without authorization to trespass on the private property of the Plaintiffs owning beachfront lots and other beachfront lot owners, particularly on the Dry Sand Areas of such private property at which the pedestrian boardwalks terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs describe various negative conduct resulting from the public's use of the dry sand beach in front of their homes, including litter, noise, bonfires, relief of bodily functions, requests for use of the bathroom and the telephone, and unauthorized use of plaintiffs' outdoor showers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on the above allegations, plaintiffs asserted 22 claims for relief, including claims for breach of the restrictive covenants, deeds, and contracts; fraud; unfair and deceptive trade practices; and various claims relating to the maintenance of dumpsters, streets, and water supply facilities. With respect to \"the State defendants,\" the complaint included four claims for relief. Plaintiffs first sought a declaratory judgment that the State of North Carolina and/or the public have no rights as to the dry sand beach, which plaintiffs contend is under their private ownership. Second, plaintiffs asserted a cause of action to quiet title in the dry sand beach. Third, plaintiffs requested an injunction restraining the State defendants from \"interfering with these Plaintiffs' exclusive use and enjoyment of their real property, specifically the Dry Sand Areas.\" In the event title to the dry sand beach was not found to reside in plaintiffs, plaintiffs alternatively alleged that such a ruling would constitute a \"taking\" entitling plaintiffs to compensation for the\n   land itself and for the accompanying diminution in property values.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs subsequently obtained leave to amend their complaint to add a fifth claim against the State defendants asserting the unconstitutionality of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 77-20(d) &amp; (e) (2003), two provisions adopted after the filing of the federal action that codify the \"customary free use and enjoyment of the ocean beaches\" enjoyed by the people of the State of North Carolina \"from time immemorial.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 77-20(d). In both the State defendants' answer to the original complaint and their answer to the amendment, they included motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On 28 April 1999, upon motion by DENR, the Division of Coastal Management, and the Coastal Resources Commission, the trial court dismissed the quiet title, injunctive relief, and taking claims of those plaintiffs who did not own oceanfront property. Further, the court ruled that \"all claims for relief relating to ownership and use of the ocean beach, including the Eighth Claim for Relief alleging a judicial `taking', are DISMISSED with respect to all Plaintiffs as to lands situated seaward of the mean high water or mean high tide line of the Atlantic Ocean. This order is entered without prejudice to the . . . Defendants [sic] right to offer the same or similar arguments in support of any future motions. . . .\" Plaintiffs have not appealed this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On 24 July 2002, the State defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffs' taking claim and their claim that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 77-20(d) and (e) are unconstitutional. On 9 September 2002, the State defendants also moved to dismiss the quiet title, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity and the absence of a justiciable controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court entered two orders on 22 July 2003, one addressing each motion. At this point, because of voluntary dismissals, the only remaining plaintiffs were Marvin and Patricia Fabrikant and Arthur C. Smith, III. Two additional plaintiffs had been added: MPF Investment Co., L.P. and the Arthur C. Smith III Revocable Trust. The first order dismissed plaintiffs' quiet title, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief claims on the basis of sovereign immunity. The second order granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffs' remaining two claims. Both orders included a certification from the trial court, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, stating: \"There is no just cause for delay in the entry of a final judgment as to these claims.\" Plaintiffs appealed from both 22 July 2003 orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We first observe that this appeal is interlocutory. The trial court's two 22 July 2003 orders dismissed only five of plaintiffs' 23 claims, leaving the remaining 18 claims pending. \"`An interlocutory order is one made during the pendency of an action, which does not dispose of the case, but leaves it for further action by the trial court in order to settle and determine the entire controversy.'\"\n   <em>\n    Embler v.

Since any reliance by the State upon the public trust doctrine would constitute an interest in the property based on an \"attribute of sovereignty\" and not based \"solely on rights and defenses available to private litigants in like circumstances,\" it cannot, under\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   constitute a \"claim of title in land\" within the meaning of N.C.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 44-10.1. While plaintiffs cite numerous cases construing the quiet title statute, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 41-10, it is \u00a7 44-10.1 that constitutes the waiver of sovereign immunity and not \u00a7 44-10. The question is not whether plaintiffs have asserted a claim under \u00a7 44-10, but rather whether their allegations are sufficient to establish a waiver of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 44-10.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A comparison of the two statutes, however, supports the State defendants' contention that plaintiffs' allegations do not set out a claim by the State of title to plaintiffs' land. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 41-10 provides: \"An action may be brought by any person against another who claims\n   <em>\n    an estate or interest in real property\n   </em>\n   adverse to him for the purpose of determining such adverse claims. . . .\" (Emphasis added.) The italicized language stands in contrast to the corresponding language in \u00a7 41-10.1: \"Whenever the State of North Carolina or any agency or department thereof asserts\n   <em>\n    a claim of title to land,\n   </em>\n   . . . [an action may be brought] against the State. . . .\" (Emphasis added.) Had the General Assembly intended in \u00a7 41-10.1 to waive the State's sovereign immunity whenever the State asserted simply an \"interest in real property,\" it knew how to say so.\n   <em>\n    N.C.

Since plaintiffs' complaint does not include allegations sufficient to establish that the State has asserted a claim of title to property owned by plaintiffs within the meaning of N.C.

In that affidavit, Mr. Schecter, who was at that time Director of the Division of Coastal Management, stated that one of the duties of his office is the \"implementation of the beach access policies of the [Coastal Resources Commission] and the Secretary of DENR, including application of the public trust doctrine to ocean beaches. . . .\" Schecter explained that \"[i]n the implementation of those policies,\" he \"appl[ies] the following standards.\" He then described three zones of the beach and stated that \"[t]he dry sand beach zone . . . can be privately owned, but is subject to public rights in the nature of an easement in favor of the general public for the use of the ocean beach.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs also urge us to look at the State defendants' answer to their complaint and the course of the litigation. This Court has previously held, however, that \"our courts have jurisdiction to render declaratory judgments only when the complaint demonstrates the existence of an actual controversy. To satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of an actual controversy, it must be shown in the complaint that litigation appears unavoidable.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Carolina Water Serv., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9131161\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/149/656/#p658\">\n    149 N.C.App. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20S.E.2d%2060\">\n    562 S.E.2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Our review is, therefore, limited to determining whether the complaint established an actual controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The question then becomes whether the Schecter affidavit attached to the complaint is sufficient to meet that requirement. That affidavit sets forth only the standards Mr. Schecter personally applied. Neither it nor the complaint sets forth any rule or regulation adopted by the State defendants. Likewise, nothing in plaintiffs' complaint refers to any rule or regulation concerning the public's use of the dry sand beaches. Moreover, neither the affidavit nor the complaint indicate that Mr. Schecter or anyone else employed\n   by the State has either (1) applied Mr. Schecter's standards to any of the plaintiffs' property or (2) taken any other concrete action asserting rights in the dry sand beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In cases involving comparable allegations, our courts have consistently concluded that no justiciable controversy existed.

In contrast to the above cases, the Schecter affidavit does not even threaten to take any action with respect to any specific parcel of land that plaintiffs own. Nor does it threaten any action should plaintiffs attempt to limit public access to the dry sand beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In short, at best, plaintiffs have asserted a difference of opinion between them and Mr. Schecter regarding the application of the public trust doctrine to the dry sand beach. Plaintiffs are asking us to render an opinion resolving the abstract issue whether the public trust doctrine gives rise to a public easement over the dry sand beaches of our State. In the absence of allegations in the complaint demonstrating an attempt by the State to enforce, with respect to plaintiffs, its alleged opinion regarding the dry sand beach, we do not have jurisdiction to do so. Neither did the superior court. The trial court, therefore, properly dismissed plaintiffs' request for a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Constitutional Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that \"[f]or any court of this State to declare that the general public [has] an implied easement for which the Property Owners need not be compensated would be an unconstitutional taking or deprivation of property without due process.\" Plaintiffs' eighth claim for relief, addressing this theory, states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In the event this Court declares that the State, and therefore the general public, have an implied easement over the Dry Sand Areas of the real property belonging to the Plaintiffs owning beachfront lots, the establishment of such an easement for a public purpose constitutes a taking of these Plaintiffs' real property without compensation. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The parties have identified this as a \"judicial takings\" claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Because of our disposition of plaintiffs' quiet title and declaratory judgment claims based on sovereign immunity and the lack of a justiciable controversy, we need not address the merits of this claim for relief. Dismissal of a claim is proper when the claim is conditioned on the finding of liability under another separate claim, and no such underlying liability was found.\n   <em>\n    See Huyck Corp. v.

Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs' judicial taking claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add an additional constitutional claim: that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 77-20(d) &amp; (e) constitute an unconstitutional taking of property to the extent the subsections may be construed to grant the public an easement over the dry sand beach. In the proceedings below, the State represented that it was not contending that the statutory subsections created rights in the public to the dry sand beach. Plaintiffs orally responded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In view of the State's position today that that is not their interpretation of [N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 77-20(d) &amp; (e)], if they're making that representation to the Court and therefore, disclaiming any reliance on 77-20 for the purpose of creating a public recreational easement, we can usually consent to dismissal of the 23rd Claim for Relief. . . .\n   <em>\n    And we can again at the Court's wish, we can either enter into a stipulation to the effect of dismissing the 23rd Claim for Relief or have the Court dismiss it based on the representations made by the State today.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs do not argue the merits of this claim for relief. Rather, they contend that the trial court erred in dismissing that claim when \"[t]he proper disposition was to have a stipulated dismissal in which the State's undertaking not to rely upon section 77-20(d) &amp; (e) was recorded, or at a minimum, that the State's stipulation be noted on the face of the court's Order.\" Plaintiffs, however, gave the trial court the option to dismiss the claim outright rather than enter a stipulated dismissal. \"A party may not complain of action which he induced.\"\n   <em>\n    Frugard v.
