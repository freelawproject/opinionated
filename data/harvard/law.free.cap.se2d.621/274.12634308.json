For the reasons discussed herein, we hold that defendant received a trial free of prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, the State's evidence tended to show the following: On 7 August 2003, Winston-Salem Police Department Officer E.D. Bradshaw (\"Officer Bradshaw\") noticed defendant driving a vehicle in the Washington Park neighborhood of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Believing defendant's driving privileges were revoked, Officer Bradshaw stopped defendant's vehicle and requested defendant to provide a valid driver's license and vehicle registration. Although defendant provided valid registration for the vehicle, he admitted he did not have a driver's license or driving privileges in North Carolina. Officer Bradshaw then arrested defendant for driving while license revoked. While searching defendant, Officer Bradshaw noticed the smell of \"burnt marijuana about [defendant's] person[.]\" He also found approximately $800.00 in cash and an unwrapped cigar in defendant's pockets. Officer Bradshaw did not find any marijuana on defendant's person during the search. When Officer Bradshaw asked defendant \"several times\" whether \"he had any marijuana,\" defendant answered negatively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant was transported to the Forsyth County Law Enforcement and Detention Center. Prior to entering the building, Officer Bradshaw again asked defendant whether he was in possession of any controlled substances. Defendant replied he was not, and he was taken inside the building. After entering the lobby of the magistrate's office, Officer Bradshaw and Winston-Salem Police Department Officer L.T. Patterson (\"Officer Patterson\") took defendant into a nearby search room. Once inside the search room, Officer Bradshaw informed defendant that he would be \"strip searched.\" Defendant then stated that he had \"residue\" in his right sock. When the officers removed defendant's sock, they found approximately 1.1 grams of marijuana inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was subsequently indicted for possession of a controlled substance on the premises of a local confinement facility and obtaining habitual felon status. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the possession charge, arguing that the term \"local confinement facility\" did not encompass the search room or lobby of the magistrate's office. The trial court denied defendant's motion, and the case proceeded to trial on 18 August 2004. On 19 August 2004, the jury found defendant guilty of possession of a controlled substance on the premises of a local confinement facility. Defendant thereafter pled guilty to obtaining habitual felon status. After concluding defendant had six prior record points and a prior felony record\n   III, the trial court sentenced defendant to a total of seventy to ninety-three months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether: (I) defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial; (II) the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss; and (III) the trial court erred in instructing the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant first argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Defendant asserts he is entitled to a new trial because his trial counsel failed to move to suppress his inculpatory statement to law enforcement officers as well as the evidence seized during the search of his person. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"When a defendant attacks his conviction on the basis that counsel was ineffective, he must show that his counsel's conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must satisfy the following two-part test:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \"counsel\" guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

On appeal, it was determined that the officer \"knew or should have known that his statement was reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response\" from the defendant, and thus the defendant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights were violated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20S.E.2d%20818\">\n    575 S.E.2d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(e)(9) is not restricted solely to those individuals in custody of a local confinement facility or those actions occurring at a particular section of the facility. Instead, unlike N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 14-258.2, 14-258.3, and 14-258.4, N.C.

Only law enforcement officers and those individuals in custody or under \"special arrangements\" are allowed to enter the area.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(e)(9) its plain meaning, we conclude that the legislature intended to cover that portion of the Forsyth County Law Enforcement and Detention Center at issue in the instant case. The legislative intent in making possession of a controlled substance on the premises of a local confinement facility felonious is clear: to deter and prevent drug possession among those individuals present at local confinement facilities. By including the term \"on the premises of\" in its description of the restricted area, the legislature plainly intended that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(e)(9) should extend beyond the bounds of the \"lockup\" area of a local confinement facility, including to those secured areas in which arrestees are temporarily detained for search, booking, and other purposes. Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of possession of a controlled substance on the premises of a local confinement facility. Accordingly, we reject defendant's second argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant next argues the trial court erred in its jury instructions.

The Forsyth County Law Enforcement and Detention Center is a multiple-use building which includes, among other things, a jail, the sheriff's office, and the magistrate's office. As discussed above, law enforcement officers discovered marijuana on defendant's person not while he was in the magistrate's office, but while he was in a secured area of the Forsyth County Law Enforcement and Detention Center provided for the detention and search of individuals awaiting appearance before the magistrate. The determination of whether this area was \"on the premises of a local confinement facility\" involved the interpretation of the bounds of a statute, which is a question of law for the trial court, not a question of fact for the jury. As the trial court made a proper determination regarding the applicability of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(e)(9) to the facts of the instant case, we conclude the trial court did not err in instructing the jury.
