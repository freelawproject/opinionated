These verdicts were consolidated for sentencing, and defendant received five consecutive sentences of a minimum of 275 months and a maximum of 339 months. After careful review of the record, we find no error as to defendant's conviction of five counts of first-degree sexual offense\n   and two counts of felonious sexual act with a minor. However, we must reverse his remaining convictions of felonious sexual act with a minor and indecent liberties convictions, and remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State presented evidence at trial which tended to show the following: in July 2000, defendant moved in with H.J., her mother Rebecca, and half sister A.T. H.J. was six years old at that time. It was agreed that defendant would be treated as a stepfather. H.J. testified that when she was eight, in September 2002, shortly after the birth of her brother, defendant made her pull off her clothes and get in her mother's bed with him. He would turn her on her side and \"stick his thing in [her] backside,\" and that this happened about twenty times. She testified that by \"his thing\" she meant defendant's penis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   She further testified that he would touch her breasts, that before he put \"his thing\" in her \"backside\" he would lick his fingers and touch her \"backside,\" and that the same thing would happen in the living room as well as the bedroom. H.J. stated that he asked her to lick his penis, but she refused, and that he licked her breasts and on her \"front part.\" She also explained that sometimes these acts also occurred in the living room on Sunday, when the race would be on television. H.J. testified that defendant licked her twice, but that it was not at the same time he was putting \"his thing\" in her \"backside\", but afterwards. She explained that her mom found out on 5 June 2003 when A.T. saw defendant \"holding on to her\", and told Rebecca, who then talked to H.J. Subsequently, H.J. talked to the sheriffs and went to the hospital for an examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sara Ehlers Dentel, a forensic nurse examiner, testified that she completed a rape kit on H.J. and took photographs of H.J's vaginal and rectal areas. During her examination, she found what appeared to be bruising and ulcerations inside H.J's rectum consistent with H.J.'s statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Detective Arnette Miles testified that she interviewed H.J. regarding the allegations, and H.J. told her that defendant put \"his thing\" in her \"backside\" in the master bedroom; that he had licked her vagina twice; that, sometimes prior to placing \"his thing\" in her \"butt,\" he would spit on his hands and digitally penetrate her; and that on several occasions defendant also did this in the living room on the couch. After taking this statement, Detective Miles testified that she traveled with two other officers to H.J.'s home, where they questioned defendant. After initially denying the allegations, they again asked defendant \"if he did it,\" and defendant began to cry and nodded his head affirmatively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Miles testified that defendant gave a statement that prior to 5 June 2003, he had sodomized H.J. at least six times. Miles explained that defendant stated that he had licked H.J. two or three times, that H.J. had licked his penis, but he could not remember how many times, and that sometimes this had taken place in the master bedroom and sometimes in the living room on the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Agent Suzi Barker, forensic biologist with the State Bureau of Investigation, testified there was semen found on the panties worn by H.J. on 5 June 2003. Agent Brenda Bisset, a forensic DNA examiner, testified that the DNA profile from this semen matched the DNA profile obtained from defendant. Defendant offered no evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, defendant brings forward assignments of error regarding 1) the sufficiency of the short form indictments; 2) the trial court's failure to completely instruct the jury concerning several of the counts in the indictments; 3) the trial court's instructions were based on theories not alleged in the indictments; 4) the deprivation of his constitutional right to jury unanimity due to jury instructions that resulted in ambiguous verdicts; and 5) the violation of his constitutional right to a jury regarding his sentencing in the aggravated range. We address each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant contends the short-form indictments returned in these cases were defective because they failed to allege all the essential elements of the charges.

We begin by addressing the charges of first-degree sexual offense. First-degree sexual offense is \"a sexual act: (1) With a victim who is a child under the age of 13 years and the defendant is at least 12 years old and is at least four years older than the victim[.]\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-27.4(a)(1) (2003). A \"sexual act\" includes \"cunnilingus ... [and] the penetration, however slight, by any object into the genital or anal opening of another person's body[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20S.E.2d%20359\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-27.1(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   An examination of the record reveals that the jury instructions and verdicts contain specific references to the date, act, and location of the alleged acts. From these references, it is possible to determine which of defendant's five convictions correspond to the possible acts testified to at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 03 CRS 56199, defendant was found guilty of three counts of first-degree sexual offense. The verdict sheet reflects that the first conviction was for acts occurring \"on June 5, 2003\" and the jury instruction includes both this date and the specific act - anal intercourse. This instruction was supported\n   by trial testimony that on 5 June 2003, H.J.'s sister saw defendant \"holding on\" to H.J. The second conviction was for a first-degree sexual offense \"in the living room between 9-4-02 and 6-4-03\" and the jury instructions also include this date range, location, and specific sexual act. H.J. testified that the many of the possible acts had occurred in the living room. The third count was identical to the second except that the location on the verdict sheet and in the instructions was the master bedroom; there was corresponding testimony from H.J. that some offenses had occurred in the bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In 03 CRS 56200, defendant was found guilty of first-degree sexual offense by cunnilingus and the trial judge properly referenced this in his instructions. H.J. testified that defendant licked her on her \"front part,\" and defendant himself stated that he had licked H.J. on several occasions. The risk that the jury would confuse this charge of first-degree sexual assault by cunnilingus with the previous counts was obviated by the trial court's instructions that as to the previous incidents, \"a sexual act means anal intercourse.\" Furthermore, H.J. testified that defendant licked her at a different time than defendant sodomized her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, defendant was found guilty of first-degree sexual offense \"in the living room while the Defendant was watching the race.\" Both the jury instructions and H.J.'s testimony reference the race on television at the time of this offense. Again, this count is distinguishable from the earlier count of first-degree sexual offense \"in the living room.\" H.J. testified to multiple acts, some of which occurred in the living room. Defendant also stated that the alleged acts sometimes took place in the living room. The testimony and jury instructions indicate multiple acts in the living room, one of which took place while a race was on television.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, the charges in the verdict sheet can be related to specific acts, each of which was the basis for a charge of first-degree sexual offense. These instances are not alleged to have occurred within the same \"transaction\" but, rather, were separate and distinct acts occurring at different times and places, each of which forms \"the basis for charging the defendant with a separate count of first-degree sexual offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence II,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. at ___, 612 S.E.2d at 685 (citation omitted). Additionally, the trial court's instructions limited the jury's consideration of the first-degree sexual offenses by date, act, and location as reflected by the testimony and verdict sheets.

The majority seems to draw a distinction between those counts in which the verdict sheets indicate a specific incident (e.g. anal intercourse in the master bedroom) and counts where no other information is listed on the verdict sheets.

The evidence at trial showed that from mid September 2002 (less than one month after the child victim's younger brother was born) until 5 June 2003, the defendant engaged in anal intercourse with the child victim, his step daughter, as many as fifty (50) times, \"anytime he got a chance.\" According to the child it happened as many as thirty times in the master bedroom and as many as twenty times in the living room. The evidence showed defendant licked his fingers and put them in the child's backside prior to anal intercourse. The evidence further showed the defendant on at least one occasion touched her breast and licked her breast, and at least three times, licked her vaginal area. The jury heard evidence of defendant's statement admitting to engaging in anal intercourse with the victim \"at least six times before 5 June 2003,\" and to licking her vagina \"at least two or three times.\" On 5 June 2003, after the victim's sibling saw defendant \"holding\" the child victim, the child was taken to the doctor, examined and determined to have anal bruising and anal ulcerations. Fluid found on the back side of the victim's panties was identified as sperm, subjected to DNA analysis, and determined to be that of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   I would submit that this evidence is more than sufficient to support each and every jury verdict in this case.

Lexis 604 (2005). Analyzing criminal cases in this manner would tend to extend the concept of unanimity far beyond what is reasonable for child sexual abuse cases in general and in this case in particular. Here we have a jury that was properly instructed by the court. During deliberations, this jury made only one request for testimony regarding one incident. The jury deliberated less than two hours before reaching unanimous verdicts on nineteen of twenty counts of sexual acts upon the child victim. Absent any indication the jury was confused or misunderstood the trial court's instructions I cannot agree to overturn these unanimous jury verdicts which overwhelmingly appear to be based on the evidence presented at trial and on properly given instructions. The courts properly presume that jurors pay close attention to the instructions of the trial judge in criminal cases and that they \"undertake to understand, comprehend, and follow the instructions as given.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As our Supreme Court has stated, \"these instructions, when read as a whole, required a verdict of not guilty if all twelve jurors were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in an unlawful sexual act ... [and there is] nothing in the record indicat[ing] any confusion, misunderstanding, or disagreement among the members of the jury which would indicate a lack of unanimity.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartness,\n   </em>\n   326 N.C. at 565, 391 S.E.2d at 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the instant case defendant has failed to show a lack of unanimity in the jury verdicts. There must be more than a \"possibility of a non-unanimous verdict\" to overturn a unanimous jury verdict. We cannot decide cases based on speculation of what might have been. Perhaps the greatest danger posed by the majority opinion is that it would allow a convicted defendant to speculate on appeal, as to what a jury might have done during the course of deliberations at trial and with no indication the jury struggled with unanimity issues, grant defendant a new trial based on speculation. The burden is on defendant to show prejudicial error in order to have his conviction reversed and a new trial granted. Here, the evidence of record shows the jury was instructed on the law by the trial court, the jury was presented with a total of [20] separate verdicts [] as to three specific types of sexual crimes ... and in a [very] short time the jury convicted defendant [of 19 of the 20 counts] in unanimous verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    State v.
