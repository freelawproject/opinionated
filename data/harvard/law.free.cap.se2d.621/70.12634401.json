STEVEN AGEE.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Adijat Jassima Ola, an infant who sues by her parents and next friends, appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk sustaining the special plea in bar of charitable immunity by the Young Men's Christian Association of South Hampton Roads (\"YMCA\") to Ola's motion for judgment alleging negligence. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 4, 2002, Ola was abducted and sexually assaulted in a bathroom on the YMCA premises. At the time of the assault, the parties stipulated that Ola, then 13, \"had used the YMCA's swimming pool and was using the bathroom.\" Ola filed a motion for judgment alleging the YMCA negligently failed to prohibit her assailant, a nonmember of the YMCA, from entering the premises, failed to provide adequate staffing, and failed to repair a broken lock on the bathroom, resulting in her attack and injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The YMCA filed a special plea in bar of charitable immunity. In support of its plea, the YMCA presented evidence of its not-for-profit status, charitable mission and related activities. It was stipulated that Ola's family, including Ola, were YMCA members with a subsidized membership prior to and at the time of the assault. The YMCA contended that, as a beneficiary of the organization's charitable activities, Ola could not recover from it for her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties agreed to proceed on the plea in bar based on an extensive stipulation of facts and exhibits. After a hearing ore tenus, the trial court sustained the YMCA's plea of charitable immunity in a letter opinion dated September 10, 2004, which was incorporated in its final order. We awarded Ola this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. The Scope of Charitable Immunity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The doctrine of charitable immunity \"is firmly embedded in the law of this Commonwealth and has become a part of the general public policy of the State.\"\n   <em>\n    Memorial Hospital, Inc. v.

It is grounded in the public policy that the resources of charitable institutions are better used to further the institution's charitable purposes, than to pay tort claims lodged by the charity's beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When a portion of the responsibility [for charity] is borne by the gifts of the philanthropic-minded, so much of the burden is removed from the public. If a portion of those gifts is diverted to the payment of tort claims, without restriction, the spirit and intent of the gifts are, at once, nullified and that much of the burden is again cast upon the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

A charitable institution is immune from liability to its beneficiaries for negligence arising from acts of its servants and agents, but only if due care has been exercised in their selection and retention.\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

Further, the shield of charitable immunity does not extend to liability for acts of gross negligence or willful and wanton negligence.\n   <em>\n    Cowan v.

The absence of either element makes the bar of charitable immunity inapplicable. First, the entity must show it is organized with a recognized charitable purpose and that it operates in fact in accord with that purpose. \"In conducting this inquiry, Virginia courts apply a two-part test, examining (1) whether the organization's\n   articles of incorporation have a charitable or eleemosynary purpose and (2) whether the organization is in fact operated consistent with that purpose....\"\n   <em>\n    Davidson v.

In the final analysis, whether an entity operates as a charity turns on the facts of each case and not on the particular type of institution.\n   <em>\n    Davidson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049434\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/817/611/#p613\">\n    817 F.Supp. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B. The Trial Court's Findings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In sustaining the YMCA's special plea in bar, the trial court undertook the analysis described above, first determining that the YMCA was a charitable organization operating in accordance with its charitable purpose, and then examining Ola's status as a beneficiary of the YMCA's charity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court first noted the YMCA's articles of incorporation clearly express a charitable purpose \"to put Judeo-Christian principles into practice through programs that build a healthy body, mind and spirit for all.\" This and related statements of charitable purpose in the YMCA's organizational documents established the rebuttable charitable presumption,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and therefore the trial\n   court then examined the actual operation of the YMCA to determine if that operation was consistent with the presumption. The trial court found from the evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   that the YMCA has no stockholders; that it is a nonprofit corporation; that no private individual receives any return from its operation; that charitable contributions form a substantial part of the organization's revenues; that its goal is to maintain financial stability; that any property or profit must be used for charitable purposes; that it is exempt from federal and state income and property taxes; that those who are able to pay are expected to pay, but those who are unable to pay are not pressed for payment and they are provided services free of charge, and that no one is refused admittance to become a member of the YMCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on these factual findings the trial court concluded that the YMCA \"[m]easured against the factors Virginia courts have found indicative of charitable status for purposes of charitable immunity ... must be characterized as `charitable.'\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court then addressed Ola's contention that the YMCA was similar to the recreation center in\n   <em>\n    Bailey v. Lancaster Ruritan Recreation Center, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697439\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/221/#p224\">\n    256 Va. 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20S.E.2d%20621\">\n    504 S.E.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 624 (1998), where the defense of charitable immunity was denied. Ola argued the YMCA's swimming pool component was analogous to the swimming pool operated by the recreation center in\n   <em>\n    Bailey.\n   </em>\n   She pointed out that even though the recreation center had an articulable charitable purpose, \"its overriding purpose was to own and operate a private swimming pool for the exclusive use of its members and thus did not qualify as a charitable organization.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In contrast to the situation in\n   <em>\n    Bailey,\n   </em>\n   the trial court found the YMCA \"provides more charitable benefit than the mere operation of a swimming pool\" including \"a vast array of charitable programs ....\" The trial court noted that unlike the recreation center in\n   <em>\n    Bailey,\n   </em>\n   \"the YMCA does not hold a vote to determine its members, it is exempt from all property and income taxes, [and] its charter contains a not for profit limitation.\" The trial court thus found\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   distinguishable and not controlling authority for this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Having determined the YMCA to be a bona fide charitable organization operating as such, the trial court next discussed Ola's status as a beneficiary of the YMCA's charity at the time of her injuries. The trial court determined that because Ola was using the YMCA swimming pool just prior to the attack and paid a discounted membership fee, she had \"accept[ed] the benefits of [the YMCA] and enter[ed] into a relation which exempt[ed the YMCA] from liability for ... negligence ....\" Ola's argument that her payment of a fee, even though at a reduced rate, barred her from being considered a beneficiary of the YMCA's charity was specifically rejected by the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [S]ince Ola would not have received the benefits of YMCA's services without the charitable gifts made to the institution, she was clearly a beneficiary of YMCA's charitable benefits at the time she suffered her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We find the trial court's analysis well reasoned and amply supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C. The Charitable Presumption\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The YMCA's articles of incorporation unequivocally reflect its nonprofit, charitable status as a nonstock corporation. Article II(A) mandates that the YMCA \"shall be operated exclusively for one or more charitable, religious, educational and scientific purposes.\" Article II(B) then provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Young Men's Christian Association we regard as being in its essential genius a worldwide fellowship united by common loyalty to Jesus Christ for the purpose of developing Christian personality and building a Christian society. The mission statement for the corporation is to put Judeo-Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy body, mind, and spirit for all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under the YMCA's charter, it cannot \"carry on any activities not permitted to be carried on by a corporation exempt from Federal\n   income tax.\" The YMCA's property is dedicated \"to charitable purposes\" even upon dissolution, when all YMCA assets must be distributed to a nonprofit fund \"which is organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes and which has established its tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the [Internal Revenue] Code.\" While the YMCA reserves the right to compensate directors or others for their services, the charter specifically states that \"[n]o part of the net earnings of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of ... its officers [or] directors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The trial court found, and Ola does not dispute, that the charitable purpose and nonprofit structure set out in the YMCA charter established the rebuttable presumption that the YMCA is a charitable organization. We find no error in the trial court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   D. Actual Operation as a Charity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ola argues, however, that \"because of its manner of operation[,]\" the YMCA \"is not a `charitable institution.'\" In effect, Ola argues the presumption that the YMCA is a charitable organization is rebutted by its actual operation. Ola avers that, like the recreation center in\n   <em>\n    Bailey,\n   </em>\n   the YMCA operates as a private health club; it is staffed by paid employees, open only to dues-paying members, and carries liability insurance for situations like Ola's attack. Further, Ola points to the stipulated facts that the YMCA operated at a surplus for four of the previous five years (1999-2003), and its budget contained no separate expenditures for charitable activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ola also contends that the trial court erroneously relied on the fact that 29% of the YMCA's income comes from public donations and that many of its workers are unpaid volunteers. Ola maintains that these financial and personal contributions are not \"a relevant factor in determining whether the YMCA itself is a charitable institution.\" Rather, she argues, \"the determinative factor is the manner of the YMCA's operation and its charitable contributions to others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We agree with the trial court that Ola has not rebutted the presumption that the YMCA is a charitable organization operating in accordance with its charitable purpose. Ola's contention that the YMCA operates only as a private health club is without merit. The YMCA's activities go far beyond the operation of its athletic facilities. The stipulated facts demonstrate that the organization also operates a childcare program, teen leadership programs, literacy programs, parenting programs, wellness programs, and makes its facilities available to local community groups in order to promote its stated values throughout the community. As particularly applicable to Ola, under the \"We Build People\" campaign, the YMCA \"[a]ssist[s] families with the cost of membership\" and \"[e]nable[s] children to gain confidence in the water while learning ... swimming skills.\" The YMCA staff is trained, not only to staff its facility and administer its programs, but also to promote and communicate its core values to all who participate in YMCA programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The fact that these programs, as well as the discounted memberships to needy families or individuals, are not separately accounted for as line items in the YMCA's financial statements was explained by Susan Ohmsen, the YMCA's Chief Financial Officer. Like other charities, the YMCA must adhere to the accounting rules established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board which are commonly termed as GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under GAAP, the YMCA is required to \"record its expenses according to function.\" The practical effect of this GAAP requirement in the financial statements is that charitable expenditures are \"embedded in every expense line.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Further, a charitable organization may carry liability insurance and retain its charitable immunity. As we noted above, a charity's immunity is not absolute, and suits by invitees or strangers for negligence will not be barred by the doctrine of charitable immunity. Thus, it is often prudent and an exercise of fiduciary responsibility for a charitable entity to carry liability insurance for protection in the appropriate circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, the fact that the YMCA generated an operational surplus in some years does not strip it of its charitable status.\n   <em>\n    See Davidson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049434\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/817/611/#p613\">\n    817 F.Supp. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the important consideration is whether any profit or surplus is used to further the charitable purpose of the organization.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049434\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/817/611/#p613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Ohmsen testified that the YMCA's reliance on donated contributions makes it unable to gauge its financial situation from year to year. Therefore, the YMCA depends on any surplus to preserve the charitable programs in existence and facilitate further growth. Ms. Ohmsen noted that it is important for the organization to remain financially healthy in order to encourage donors to make donations. Again, prudence and the exercise of fiduciary responsibility fully justify a nonprofit organization accumulating a surplus, provided it continues to invest in the organization's charitable purpose or otherwise expends the surplus for a charitable purpose. Indeed, a charitable institution's inability to sometimes post a surplus may doom its existence and end its work of charity when nonsurplus years arrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, we cannot agree with Ola's contention that an entity's significant reliance on voluntary contributions is irrelevant to a determination of charitable status. In\n   <em>\n    Weston's,\n   </em>\n   we noted that the defendant hospital was a charitable entity, in part because it was not self-sustaining.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1998592\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/131/587/#p610\">\n    131 Va. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20S.E.%20785\">\n    107 S.E. at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The public policy behind the doctrine of charitable immunity admits the necessity of public and private contributions to carry on the organization's charitable purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While the receipt of a minimal amount of an entity's total revenue as a charitable donation may augur against a finding that it operates in fact as a charity, the YMCA receives nearly one-third of its revenues from the public as donated funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a level of giving cannot be dismissed as\n   <em>\n    de minimis,\n   </em>\n   but should be recognized as a significant factor of charitable operation. The trial court's reliance on the YMCA's receipt of donations was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The trial court also correctly distinguished the recreation center in\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   from the YMCA. While the YMCA is a \"members-only\" organization, it does not, like the center in\n   <em>\n    Bailey,\n   </em>\n   restrict membership only to those who can pay the published fee. Rather, those who seek membership, but cannot afford to pay all of the membership fee, are eligible for a subsidized membership at a discounted rate depending on the ability to pay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, unlike the center in\n   <em>\n    Bailey,\n   </em>\n   the YMCA is a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization, with a significant portion of its mission funded by donations. As the YMCA is readily distinguishable under the multi-factor test from the recreation center in\n   <em>\n    Bailey,\n   </em>\n   that case is not determinative of the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   E. Ola as a Charitable Beneficiary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We next address Ola's contention that she was not a beneficiary of the YMCA's charitable bounty at the time of the attack, and therefore her tort action should not be barred by the YMCA's otherwise applicable charitable immunity. Ola specifically argues that any charitable activities undertaken by the YMCA are too far removed from the negligence at issue to immunize the YMCA against liability. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The trial court found that because Ola paid a discounted membership fee, she \"received the pecuniary benefit of financial assistance\" and therefore, was a recipient of the YMCA's charitable bounty. Ola argues that this finding \"implicitly holds that the YMCA owes a duty of care to members who pay full price dues but owes no duty to members who pay discounted dues.\" We reject Ola's argument.

As the trial court noted, \"Swimming clearly provides an excellent means of maintaining physical and mental well-being and thus can be characterized as a part of the YMCA's charitable benefits.\" Thus, whether Ola paid a full or reduced membership fee, she was a beneficiary of the charitable bounty of the YMCA because she actually used YMCA facilities which depend on charity for their existence and operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   III.
