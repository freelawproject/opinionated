Morris Silver. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in permitting hearsay testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u00b64 2. Did the court err in admitting extrinsic evidence regarding the safe deposit box lease?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b65 3. Did the court err in failing to conclude that the contents of the safe deposit box were a jointly-held asset pursuant to \u00a7 70-1-308, MCA, and the box lease agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u00b66 4. Did the court err in applying gift theory rather than contract theory in determining ownership of the contents of the safe deposit box?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\u00b67 5. Did the court err in awarding the contents of the safe deposit box to the Estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">\u00b68 6. Did the court err in concluding that Jack exercised unauthorized control over the contents of the safe deposit box?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">\u00b69 Jack Silver is the adult son and only child of the decedent, F. Morris Silver. Jack lives in California and is a professor of mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">\u00b610 In December 1995 and January 1996, Jack visited his father at Morris\u2019s home in Missoula, Montana. Morris was then eighty-five years old and a recent widower. He was suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease and was scheduled to be hospitalized for hernia surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">\u00b611 It was agreed that Morris would need care providers to assist him when he returned home from the hospital. Jack was concerned about the presence of strangers in the house, because Morris had approximately $203,987 in cash stored there. Jack recommended that the cash be placed in a safe deposit box, and Morris agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">\u00b6 12 At Morris\u2019s request, his friend and employee Kathleen St. John called a Missoula bank to determine how arrangements could be made to open a safe deposit box, given that Morris was unable to go to the bank. Kathleen made arrangements for Morris and Jack to lease a safe deposit box. At Morris\u2019s direction, Kathleen typed a document stating: \u201cI, F.M. Silver authorize my son Jack Silver to purchase a 10 x 15 x 21 safety deposit box in my name. I also wish for Jack Silver to be a signer allowed access to the safety deposit box.\u201d Morris signed this statement, and it was notarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">\u00b613 Kathleen and Jack delivered Morris\u2019s signed statement to the bank. A bank employee filled out a bank form titled \u201cSafe Deposit Box Lease Agreement\u201d and placed an \u201cX\u201d in the box marked \u201cjoint.\u201d Jack signed the lease and took the bank form to Morris to sign. At Morris\u2019s direction, Jack and Kathleen then delivered the cash to the bank and placed it in the safe deposit box. Jack kept one key to the safe deposit box, and Morris kept another one.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u00b614 OnAugust21,1997, Jack exercised his right under the safe deposit box lease to access the box. He removed the cash from the box, placing it in his own safe deposit box at the same bank. This action was taken without Morris\u2019s direction, consent, or knowledge. Morris died eight days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b615 Carolyn Sauro is the personal representative for Morris\u2019s estate, a substantial portion of which he bequeathed to a charitable foundation. Jack moved for summary judgment in the probate proceeding that he is the legal owner of the contents of the safe deposit box. The Estate opposed Jack\u2019s motion, and a hearing was held to resolve factual issues. Following the hearing, the court entered findings and conclusions in which it determined that Morris retained ownership of the cash and ordered Jack to return possession of the $203,987 to the Estate. Jack appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b616 On evidentiary rulings, this Court\u2019s standard of review is whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Harwood v. Glacier Elec. Co-op, Inc. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 481, 490, 949 P.2d 651, 657. We will uphold a district court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence and are not otherwise clearly erroneous. <em>Tipp v. Skjelset </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 274, 277, 947 P.2d 480, 481-82. This Court reviews conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law was correct. <em>Tipp, </em>285 Mont. at 277, 947 P.2d at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err in permitting hearsay testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\u00b6 18 Over Jack\u2019s objection, the District Court allowed testimony by Kathleen St. John and Carolyn Sauro regarding statements Morris made to them concerning the money in the safe deposit box. Kathleen stated by affidavit that when Morris agreed to put the money in the safe deposit box, he asserted that it was still his. She stated that she never heard him say he intended to make a gift of the money to Jack or that he did not consider it to be his money. Carolyn stated in her affidavit that Morris was most emphatic that the contents of the safe deposit box were to remain his. She also attested that at no time did Morris indicate he had made any gift to Jack of the contents of the safe deposit box and once during the summer of 1997 he said he may have to go to the safe deposit box to secure some of his cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">*1119 In <em>Anderson v. Baker </em>(1982), 196 Mont. 494, 641 P.2d 1035, this Court held that the admission of parol evidence was proper to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the intention of the parties when a depositor into a joint bank account indicated an intent contrary to what was shown on the bank account signature card.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">We are also mindful that the signature cards are forms containing language drafted by the depository institution. While the language thereon may very well describe the agreements between the depositor and the depository, it can hardly be expected to accurately express the intentions and relationships between the joint tenants about which the depository typically has little, if any, knowledge. Where the donor-depositor, as in the instant suit, indicates during her lifetime that her intent is other than that revealed on the signature card, we hold such evidence admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX3\"><em>Anderson, </em>196 Mont. at 500-01, 641 P.2d at 1038. In that case, this Court ruled that consideration of the circumstances under which the signature cards were executed established that no gift was intended when the signature cards were signed. <em>Anderson, </em>196 Mont. at 502, 641 P.2d at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b620 In <em>Thompson v. Steinkamp </em>(1947), 120 Mont. 475, 187 P.2d 1018, Thompson had given Steinkamp money to purchase real property in which title was then held in Steinkamp\u2019s name. Following Thompson\u2019s death, the issue was whether Steinkamp held the property in trust for the benefit of Thompson\u2019s estate. In ruling admissible evidence of statements Thompson had made relating to his intent, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">Here the issue between the parties depended upon the intention with which Mr. Thompson furnished the money to defendant. Whether it was a gift to her as she contends or whether, as plaintiff contends, it was his purpose to have her buy the property in question for him, depended upon Mr. Thompson\u2019s intent. \u201cWhen intent is a material element of a disputed fact, declarations of a decedent made after as well as before an alleged act that indicate the intent with which he performed the act are admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule, and it is immaterial that such declarations are self serving.\u201d (Citations omittedj</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABb\"><em>Thompson, </em>120 Mont. at 481, 187 P.2d at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u00b621  Similarly, in the present case, the contested testimony is evidence of Morris\u2019s stated intent to retain ownership of the cash which he had placed in the safe deposit box. Rule 803(24), M.R.Evid., provides that statements not covered by the enumerated exceptions to the hearsay rule will be allowed if comparable circumstantial guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>antees of trustworthiness exist. Here, the statements put into context Morris\u2019s opening of the safe deposit box and the placement of the cash within the box. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony about Morris\u2019s statements of intent concerning the money which he arranged to have placed in the safe deposit box.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b622 Did the court err in admitting extrinsic evidence regarding the safe deposit box lease?</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b623 Jack points out that under \u00a7 28-2-904, MCA, a written contract supersedes all oral negotiations or stipulations which preceded the execution of the document. He argues that the fact that the safe deposit box lease form was prepared by a bank employee is not relevant to interpretation of the document and that the court therefore erred in finding that Morris did not prepare the lease form or check the box on the form marked \u201cjoint.\u201d Jack points out that Morris duly signed the lease and that he is presumed to have read and understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"AC9\">\u00b624  The District Court\u2019s conclusions do not indicate that they turned on the evidence or the finding to which Jack here objects. Rather, the court gave other reasons for its conclusions. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the extrinsic evidence regarding the safe deposit box lease, and we further hold that the finding that Morris did not select the form of safe deposit box lease or check the box on the form marking the box as joint is supported by substantial credible evidence in the record and is not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">\u00b625 Did the court err in failing to conclude that the contents of the safe deposit box were a jointly-held asset pursuant to \u00a7 70-1-308, MCA, and the box lease agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">\u00b626 Jack contends that the only basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that the contents of the safe deposit box were not jointly-held assets is the self-serving opinion of the Estate\u2019s personal representative, as established in her federal estate tax return form. He asserts that both \u00a7 70-1-308, MCA, and the safe deposit box lease agreement support his contention that the contents of the safe deposit box were jointly held.</p>\n<p id=\"AmU\">\u00b627 Section 70-1-308, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\">Safe deposit box \u2014 -joint tenancy. When so specified in the agreement granting for a term of time the right in two or more per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>sons to use or occupy any safe or box, commonly referred to as a safe deposit vault or box for the safekeeping of valuables, such interest and estate created in the grantees shall be a joint tenancy in such vault or box and pass to the survivors and survivor upon the death of one or more of the joint tenants with right in such survivors and survivor to have access to and possession of such vault or box and the contents thereof under the terms of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aor\">Jack asserts that under \u00a7 70-1-308, MCA, he is the surviving joint co-owner of the cash in the safe deposit box.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b628 The above statute provides for joint access to and possession of the safe deposit box and its contents. The statute does not provide for joint ownership of the contents of the safe deposit box. Nor does the language in \u00a7 70-1-308, MCA, regarding the rights of surviving joint tenants authorize Jack\u2019s removal of the cash from the safe deposit box while Morris was still alive. By definition under the statute, Jack was not a survivor with a right of possession when he removed the cash from the safe deposit box.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b629 Similarly, nothing in the safe deposit box lease agreement established the rights of the lessees as between each other. Under the lease agreement, each of the joint lessees</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">may have access to the safe deposit box. Each of you also has the right to exchange the box or terminate the lease, surrender the box and receive any rent refund due, consent to an increase in rent, or appoint a deputy. Each of you will be liable for the full amount of all payments due under this agreement. If one of you should die, declare bankruptcy, or become incapacitated, we may grant access to the other renter, subject to any restrictions of law or No. 3 above. We may also grant access to the personal representative of the renter that dies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The lease does not create joint ownership of or right of survivorship in the contents of the box-it provides only for joint access to the box and specifically acknowledges that the personal representative of a joint renter who dies may also have access to the box. The lease does not attempt to determine the ownership of contents of the box as between box lessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b630 Under this argument, Jack also cites <em>Malek v. Patten </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 237, 678 P.2d 201. In <em>Malek, </em>this Court held that certificates of deposit held in a joint safe deposit box belonged to the surviving joint box holder, despite the fact that they had been purchased by the other joint box holder, who had since passed away. The decision in <em>Malek, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>however, hinged on the fact that the decedent had purchased the certificates of deposit in the joint names of both safe deposit box holders. <em>Malek, </em>208 Mont. at 243-44, 678 P.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b631  We hold that the District Court was correct in concluding that the contents of the safe deposit box were not a jointly-held asset by virtue of \u00a7 70-1-308, MCA, or the safe deposit box lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u00b632 Did the court err in applying gift theory rather than contract theory in determining ownership of the contents of the safe deposit box?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\u00b633 Jack argues that he was the owner of the cash under contract theory pursuant to \u00a7 70-1-308, MCA. That argument has no merit, as discussed above under Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">\u00b634 Jack also points out that this Court has resisted the application of gift theory with respect to joint bank accounts, citing <em>Casagranda v. Donahue </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 479, 585 P.2d 1286, and <em>State Board of Equalization v. Cole </em>(1948), 122 Mont. 9, 195 P.2d 989. He states that under the \u201cMontana Rule,\u201d when parties have created a joint account by virtue of a written agreement with a financial institution, the terms of that agreement control the disposition of the account and additional evidence is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">\u00b635 Both <em>Casagranda </em>and <em>Cole </em>involved joint bank accounts, not safe deposit boxes. As discussed above, while Jack clearly had joint access to the safe deposit box under a contract theory, that is not the issue here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">\u00b636  Jack has cited no contract theory under which he might properly be declared the owner or co-owner of the cash that was in the safe deposit box. We hold that the District Court did not err in applying gift theory rather than contract theory in determining ownership of the contents of the safe deposit box.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">Issue 5</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">\u00b637 Did the court err in awarding the contents of the safe deposit box to the Estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">\u00b638 Jack points out that the District Court made no determination as to who owned the cash when it was placed in the safe deposit box. He states that the only evidence adduced at trial was that the cash was his when it was deposited into the box. Therefore, he asserts, the court\u2019s judgment has the effect of transferring his property to Morris upon Morris\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u00b639 Although Jack testified speculatively at trial that the cash might have been a \u201cfamily asset,\u201d he did not argue to the District Court that the cash was his sole property. At trial, his position was that the cash was joint property. Jack now asserts for the first time that the cash was his sole property. This Court will not address issues on appeal which were not properly raised before the district court in motions, briefs, and arguments. <em>Nason v. Leistiko, </em>1998 MT 217, \u00b6 13, 290 Mont. 460, \u00b6 13, 963 P.2d 1279, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b640 At trial, Jack testified that Morris had told him, when he was gathering up the cash to put into the safe deposit box, that he should keep the cash \u201cfor a rainy day.\u201d Jack further testified that both he and Morris considered the cash a \u201cfamily asset,\u201d and that most of it had originated with Morris\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b641 Jack\u2019s testimony about Morris\u2019s perception as to the ownership of the cash was contradicted by the testimony of Kathleen and Carolyn that Morris clearly intended to retain ownership of the cash. The relative credibility of the witnesses was thus at issue, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact as to the credibility of witnesses. <em>Groves v. Clark, </em>1999 MT 117, \u00b6 18, 294 Mont. 417, \u00b6 18, 982 P.2d 446, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b642 The court concluded \u201cMorris made no gift of the said cash placed in the said safe deposit box to Jack.\u201d Jack maintains gift theory would be applicable only if it had been established that Morris owned the cash before it was placed in the safe deposit box. He points out that the court made no finding that the cash belonged to Morris before it was placed into the box. However, the evidence was that the cash had been in Morris\u2019s possession for years, in various places throughout his house, where Jack had not resided for over thirty years. That the cash was Morris\u2019s is also supported by the evidence of Morris\u2019s statements to Kathleen and Carolyn to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u00b643  We hold that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Morris retained ownership of the $203,987 placed in the safe deposit box was correct, and the court did not therefore err in awarding the contents of the safe deposit box to the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Issue 6</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">\u00b644 Did the court err in concluding that Jack exercised unauthorized control over the contents of the safe deposit box?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">\u00b645 Jack contends that the District Court\u2019s conclusion that he exercised unauthorized control over the contents of the safe deposit box is inconsistent with both the lease agreement on the box and the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>finding that \u201c[ojn August 21, 1997, Jack exercised his rights under the Lease and removed the entire contents of the Box, and placed the same in another safe deposit box at the Bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b646  No inconsistency exists. The finding that Jack exercised his rights under the Lease relates to the relationship between Jack and the bank. The Estate acknowledges that under the box lease, Jack could enter the box. That right of entry, however, does not determine ownership of property stored in the box and does not establish a right in Jack to remove items from the box which were not his. We hold that the conclusion that Jack exercised unauthorized control over the contents of the safe deposit box is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u00b647 Because Jack has established no error under any of the arguments he has raised, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b539-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b539-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AqV\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">\u00b648 I concur with the result of the majority opinion. However, in doing so, I do not agree with the reasoning given by the majority for resolving issue No. 1 which is related to the affidavit testimony of Kathleen St. John and Caroline Sauro.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\u00b649 If the testimony admitted by affidavit was truly hearsay, I would conclude that it was inadmissible, since it does not come within any of the exceptions to Rule 802 found at Rule 803 of the Montana Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">\u00b650 However, I conclude that the evidence to which Jack Silver objects was not hearsay evidence. \u201cHearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Rule 801(c). As noted in <em>State v. Newman </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 450, 457, 513 P.2d 258, 262, cited in the Commission Commentto Rule 801, hearsay is inadmissible because it rests \u201cfor its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">\u00b651 In this case, the out-of-court statement related by Kathleen St. John and Caroline Sauro was that Morris \u201casserted that the money was still Morris\u2019.\u201d The affidavit testimony was not offered to prove the truth of what Morris asserted and did not depend on Morris\u2019 credibility. The affidavits were offered, instead, to prove that Morris actually made the statement, and, therefore, depended solely on the credibility of Kathleen St. John and Caroline Sauro.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u00b652 If Morris made the statement related by the two witnesses, then the statement was in fact probative of his intent without regard to whether he was being truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b653 For these reasons, I concur with the result of the majority opinion, although I do not agree with everything that is said therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
