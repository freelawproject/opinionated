We affirm the verdict but reverse the District Court\u2019s sentence enhancement for use of a weapon during the commission of an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">\u00b62 Weitzel raises three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">\u00b63 (1) Was there sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for felony assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">\u00b64 (2) Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing rebuttal evidence showing that Weitzel had pawned a handgun in July of 1996?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">\u00b65 (3) Should this case be remanded to the District Court for resentencing in light of the recent decision in <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">\u00b66 On April 10,1998, the State of Montana (the State) filed an Information charging Weitzel with two counts of felony assault and one count of felony conspiracy to sell dangerous drugs. Count I alleged that Weitzel had pointed a handgun at the head of Jeffrey Brewer (Brewer), causing him reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury. Count II alleged that Weitzel had pointed a handgun at Veronica Jenkins (Jenkins), causing her reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury. And Count III alleged that Weitzel had agreed with Cynthia Thilmony (Thilmony) to the sale of marijuana and provided her with $800 cash for that purpose. Weitzel pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">\u00b67 The events giving rise to the charges against Weitzel occurred on March 12, 1998, in Helena, Montana. At that time, Weitzel was a self-employed flooring contractor. He lived in a house on Choteau Street and was engaged to Judy Weidner (Weidner). Weidner\u2019s nineteen-year-old niece, Thilmony, lived nearby in an apartment on Broadwater Circle. On March 12, Thilmony called Weitzel at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>house and asked if she could come over and use his washing machine to do some laundry. Weitzel agreed and Thilmony arrived at his house around noon. During this visit, according to Thilmony, Weitzel asked her if she could procure a half-pound of marijuana for him to purchase. Thilmony agreed to make some inquiries on behalf of Weitzel.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b68 Thilmony then called her boyfriend, Brewer, who in turn called two friends, Mike Zandhuisen (Zandhuisen) and Jeremy Younkin (Younkin). Younkin stated that he could obtain a half-pound of marijuana for $800; Brewer related this information to Thilmony, who informed Weitzel. Weitzel allegedly gave Thilmony $800, and she turned the money over to Brewer to make the purchase of marijuana. Brewer then gave Younkin $700 cash, keeping $100 for himself. However, after obtaining the $700 from Brewer, Younkin and Zandhuisen decided to steal the money from Brewer and split it between themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b69 At about 6:15 p.m., Weitzel allegedly first learned that $800 cash was missing from his wallet, which had been sitting on a desk in his home office throughout the day, and he called Weidner to inform her of the fact. Weitzel and Weidner assumed that the culprit was Thilmony. Sometime after 9:00 p.m., Brewer went to Jenkins\u2019 apartment on Broadwater Circle and called Zandhuisen, who then informed Brewer that he and Younkin did not have the money or the drugs because the $700 had been \u201cripped off\u201d by their supplier. Subsequently, Thilmony went to her apartment and was confronted by Weitzel about the missing cash. According to Weitzel, Thilmony admitted to stealing the money and giving it to Brewer to purchase marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b610 Weitzel then decided to find and confront Brewer. Thilmony drove Weitzel to Jenkins\u2019 apartment. According to Thilmony, Weitzel had a handgun in a shoulder holster under his jacket, and he informed Thilmony that someone\u2019s \u201cgoing to die tonight.\" Upon arriving, Weitzel got out of the car, walked into Jenkins\u2019 apartment, and pinned Brewer\u2019s head against the wall with a dark object, demanding his money back and shouting obscenities. Brewer, Zandhuisen, Scott Smith (Smith), and Rob Hollow (Hollow) subsequently escaped on foot, while Jenkins remained at her apartment. Weitzel left Jenkins\u2019 apartment in Thilmony\u2019s car, but asked her to drop him off at Weidner\u2019s apartment. About fifteen minutes thereafter, Weitzel showed up at Thilmony\u2019s apartment on foot, carrying a cell phone instead of a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u00b611 At 10:08 p.m., the Helena Police Department received a call from Thilmony\u2019s mother, who stated that she believed Thilmony was in danger and expressed concern that there might be a gun involved. Upon responding to the call and arriving at Thilmony\u2019s apartment on Broadwater Circle, the police encountered Weitzel at the front door. Weitzel was immediately patted down but the police found no firearm or holster on his person. The police advised Weitzel of the concern that there might be a gun involved, to which Weitzel responded that the confusion may have been caused by his cell phone. When questioned, Thilmony told the police that $800 had been stolen from her and that Weitzel was helping her to get the money back. Weitzel did not contradict Thilmony\u2019s story at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b612 A few days after this incident, Thilmony told the police about the alleged drug deal and the events leading up to the assault by Weitzel. Weitzel eventually told the police that Thilmony had taken the $800 from his apartment, and that he had gone with Thilmony to Jenkins\u2019 apartment in an attempt to recover the money. Weitzel denied that he had used a gun to threaten Brewer, instead claiming that he had held his cell phone against Brewer\u2019s face during the confrontation at Jenkins\u2019 apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b6 13 The other witnesses to the incident recalled varying, and often contradictory, details about the assault. Although Thilmony did not initially represent to police that a gun had been involved in the incident, she subsequently testified that Weitzel had been holding a handgun when he entered Jenkins\u2019 apartment on the night in question. Zandhuisen claimed that after the incident with Weitzel, Brewer had injuries consistent with having been hit in the head with a gun. However, Brewer denied the same at trial. Smith and Hollow also testified, consistent with Zandhuisen, that Weitzel had wielded a gun against Brewer on the night of March 12. Immediately following the assault incident, Jenkins had excitedly told a neighbor that Weitzel had come into her apartment and thrown Brewer against the wall, but at that time she never mentioned that Weitzel had a gun. However, Jenkins subsequently stated to police that Weitzel had threatened her with a gun. Shortly after the incident, Jenkins mysteriously moved out of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b614 All of the State\u2019s key witnesses (excluding the police) were friends prior to the incident. The authorities did not search Weitzel\u2019s home for any guns, nor did they search Weidner\u2019s apartment for any handguns belonging to Weitzel. At trial, Weidner testified that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>did not believe that Weitzel owned a handgun. Weitzel\u2019s criminal record consisted of only two misdemeanors, neither of which involved drugs or violence. Thilmony was charged with conspiracy but pleaded to theft in return for her testifying against Weitzel. Zandhuisen was also charged with conspiracy but, notwithstanding the absence of an agreement to testify against Weitzel, the charges against him were dismissed. Brewer was not charged in connection with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b615 Prior to trial, Weitzel gave notice that he would present evidence of his good character and assert the defense of justifiable use of force. At trial, Weitzel testified that he had last purchased a handgun in March or April of 1996 and had given it to his brother at that time. On cross-examination, Weitzel clarified that he had purchased a ,9mm Baretta as a belated birthday present for. his brother in 1996, and further denied having any handguns himself. Weitzel\u2019s brother testified at trial about the gift of the pistol in 1996 and also testified that Weitzel did not have any handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b616 At the close of Weitzel\u2019s case-in-chief, the State moved to present rebuttal testimony to the effect that Weitzel had pawned and then subsequently retrieved a handgun from a pawnshop in 1996. That handgun was a .45 caliber Llama similar in appearance to the one described by the State\u2019s witnesses. The State explained that it had not known prior to trial what the testimony of Weitzel and his brother would be concerning Weitzel\u2019s ownership of handguns, and offered the rebuttal evidence to impeach Weitzel\u2019s credibility. The District Court overruled Weitzel\u2019s objections and permitted the State to present the rebuttal evidence in the form of pawn shop records. The court also allowed the State to show the jury an actual .45 caliber Llama to demonstrate the type of firearm that Weitzel had owned in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"A84\">\u00b617 On August 26,1998, the jury returned its verdict, unanimously finding Weitzel guilty of felony assault under Count I, and not guilty of conspiracy to commit the criminal sale of dangerous drugs under Count III. The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to the felony assault charge alleged in Count II. Following the verdict, Weitzel filed a \u201cMotion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict,\" which was denied by the District Court. On October 23, 1998, the District Court sentenced Weitzel to the Montana State Prison for a term of four years for Count I, felony assault, with all of the four-year term suspended upon certain conditions. However, the District Court further sentenced Weitzel to a mandatory term of two years at the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>State Prison, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, for using a weapon during the commission of the felony assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b618 (1) Was there sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for felony assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b619 At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, the District Court denied Weitzel\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of insufficient evidence. A motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence should be granted by the district court \u201c <em>\u2018only </em>where there is <em>no evidence </em>upon which a trier of fact could base a verdict.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019State v. Miller </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 497, 509, 757 P.2d 1275, 1282-83 (quoting <em>State v. Matson </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 36, 42, 736 P.2d 971, 974). This Court reviews the denial of such a motion in the same manner that we review the sufficiency of evidence supporting a jury verdict in a criminal case. That is, we review the record to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Berger, </em>1998 MT 170, \u00b6 25, 290 Mont. 78, f 25, 964 P.2d 725, \u00b6 25. It is within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether to dismiss an action at the close of the State\u2019s case for insufficient evidence, and we will not disturb such a ruling in the absence of an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 21, 290 Mont. 97, \u00b6 21, 966 P.2d 721, \u00b6 21 (citing \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA; <em>Miller, </em>231 Mont, at 509, 757 P.2d at 1282).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u00b620 Weitzel, while acknowledging that witness credibility and weight of the evidence is the province of the jury, contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of felony assault because the testimony of all of the State\u2019s witnesses, with the exception of the police, was lacking in credibility. Weitzel points to \u201cnumerous inconsistencies\u201d in the stories of the State\u2019s witnesses, such as the contradictory \u201ctime-line\u201d put forward by those witnesses as to the events of March 12, and asserts that these conflicts in the testimony render the underlying felony assault conviction invalid. However, Weitzel\u2019s contentions are unavailing and need not be repeated in detail here. \u201c Tt is within the province of the finder of fact to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility of the witnesses]; in the event of conflicting evidence on factual issues, the trier of fact determines which will prevail.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 289, \u00b6 41, 291 Mont. 501, \u00b6 41, 969 P.2d 925, \u00b6 41 (quoting <em>State v. Sattler, </em>1998 MT 57, \u00b6 55, 288 Mont. 79, \u00b6 55, 956 P.2d 54, \u00b6 55).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u00b621 Weitzel was convicted of felony assault under \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA (1997), pursuant to which the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Weitzel caused \u201creasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon.\u201d Section 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA (1997). As Weitzel recognizes, there was testimony from five separate witnesses for the State to the effect that Weitzel assaulted Brewer with a handgun in Jenkins\u2019 apartment on the evening of March 12, 1998. Our function on appellate review is limited to determining whether the jury verdict is supported by sufficient evidence, not whether there was evidence which could support a different verdict. <em>See Johnson, </em>\u00b6 41(quoting <em>Sattler, </em>\u00b6 60). Although the evidence could support a different verdict in this case, it is not this Court\u2019s role to impose our judgment for that of the trier of fact. That the jury chose to believe the version of the facts put forward by the State\u2019s witnesses, rather than Weitzel\u2019s depiction of the events that occurred on March 12, was within its prerogative as the trier of fact. Furthermore, as the State points out, the mere fact that a defendant\u2019s testimony conflicts with that of other witnesses does not, by itself, render the evidence insufficient to support the conviction. <em>See Miller, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>State v. Bower </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 1, 8, 833 P.2d 1106, 1111).</p>\n<p id=\"A1yG\">\u00b622  The testimony of the five witnesses presented a more than sufficient basis from which the jury could determine that Weitzel had used a gun rather than a cell phone to commit the assault on Brewer. When viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, we determine that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of felony assault beyond a reasonable doubt. We hold that there was sufficient evidence to support Weitzel\u2019s conviction for felony assault. We further hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Weitzel\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b623 (2) Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing rebuttal evidence showing that Weitzel had pawned a handgun in July of 1996?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b624 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Lantis, </em>1998 MT 172, \u00b6 52, 289 Mont. 480, \u00b6 52, 962 P.2d 1169, \u00b6 52. The decision to admit rebuttal evidence is a matter that rests largely within the discretion of the trial court, and we will not overturn such a determination unless an abuse of discretion is shown. <em>Morrison v. City of Butte </em>(1967), 150 Mont. 106, 115, 431 P.2d 79. 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u00b625 Before trial, Weitzel provided notice to the State that he would present the defense of justifiable use of force and that he would present evidence of his good character. In his trial testimony, Weitzel claimed that he does not presently own a handgun or a shoulder holster. However, Weitzel went on to describe how he had purchased a handgun in March or April of 1996 as a belated birthday present for his brother. Similarly, Weitzel\u2019s brother testified about the gift of a pistol from Weitzel in 1996 and also corroborated that Weitzel does not presently own or possess any handguns. Over Weitzel\u2019s objections, the District Court permitted the State to introduce pawn shop records in rebuttal showing that Weitzel had pawned a handgun on July 2, 1996, and then retrieved it on July 13, 1996. The court ruled that the rebuttal evidence was \u201cvery relevant\u201d to the question of Weitzel\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b626 On appeal, Weitzel contends that the District Court abused its discretion in permitting the State to introduce the pawn shop records in rebuttal because there was \u201cno basis\u201d in the record for the introduction of that evidence. Weitzel also argues that the court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence because the prosecution failed to discharge its statutory duty to disclose the pawn shop records in advance of trial as required by \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, and Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. Lastly, Weitzel claims that the admission of the rebuttal evidence was improper pursuant to Rule 608, M.R.Evid. We address each of Weitzel\u2019s contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b627 Weitzel\u2019s argument that there was \u201cno basis\u201d in the record for the introduction of the rebuttal evidence is without merit. Weitzel testified at trial as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">Q: Do you own ... a handgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">A: No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">Q: Do you own a shoulder holster?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">A: No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">Q: Have you ever purchased a handgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">Q: Where is that handgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">A: Should be at my brother\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">Q: How long ago did you purchase that handgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-15\">A: March or April of \u201896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-16\">Q: When did you give it to your brother Mark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-17\">A: March or April of \u201896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Q: Has that firearm been in your possession at any time since March or April of 1996?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b628 Weitzel then testified, on cross-examination, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Q: And you don\u2019t have any handguns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">A: No, sir, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">Q: I think you testified that you bought one once and gave it to your brother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">A: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">Q: It was a birthday or something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">A: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">Q: You said it was in ... March of\u201896?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">A: I think it was March or April of \u201896.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">When questioned, Weitzel\u2019s brother corroborated that Weitzel had purchased a ,9mm handgun as a belated birthday present for him in March or April of 1996. When asked whether Weitzel owns any handguns, Weitzel\u2019s brother responded in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">\u00b629 Weitzel takes the position that since he did not testify that he had never owned a handgun, it was improper for the State to introduce rebuttal testimony to the effect that Weitzel had been engaged in a pawn shop transaction involving a handgun in mid-1996. However, we agree with the State that Weitzel \u201copened the door\u201d to the rebuttal evidence by choosing to testify as to his gun ownership, including the purchase of a handgun for his brother in early-1996. More importantly, as the State suggests, the testimony of Weitzel and his brother left the jury with the misleading impression that Weitzel had purchased only one handgun in the past as a gift for his brother. The plain implication of the testimony presented was that Weitzel had last purchased a handgun in early-1996 and had not owned any handguns since that time. Thus, the State\u2019s pawn shop evidence was properly admitted to rebut that misimpression, and to thereby impeach Weitzel\u2019s credibility, by showing that Weitzel had pawned and then retrieved a handgun shortly after the alleged gift and less than two years before the assault incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">\u00b630 Regarding the alleged failure of the State to give notice of the rebuttal testimony, we also conclude that Weitzel\u2019s position must fail. Section 46-15-322, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">Disclosure by prosecution....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(6) The prosecutor shall furnish to the defendant no later than 5 days before trial or at a later time as the court may for good cause permit, together with their statements, a list of the names and addresses of all persons whom the prosecutor intends to call as rebuttal witnesses to evidence of good character or the defenses of alibi, compulsion, entrapment, justifiable use of force, or mistaken identity or the defense that the defendant did not have a particular state of mind that is an element of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Section 46-15-322(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b631 As Weitzel indicates, the duty of pre-trial disclosure by the prosecution under \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, is broader than that required by <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Indeed, the statutory provisions mandate the disclosure of all material and information within the prosecutor\u2019s possession and control, regardless of whether inculpatory or exculpatory in nature. <em>See State v. Licht </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 123, 129, 879 P.2d 670, 673-74. Weitzel further points out that the prosecution\u2019s obligation of disclosure extends to material and information that is in the possession or control of any member of the prosecutor\u2019s staff or any other persons who have participated in the investigation or evaluation of the case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-15-322(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b632 Here, the record shows that an investigating officer first learned of Weitzel\u2019s 1996 pawn shop transaction approximately a month prior to trial and that the prosecutor himself knew of the existence of the pawn shop records about two weeks before trial. Nevertheless, that does not mean that the State was under an obligation to <em>disclose </em>this information before trial. As we have indicated in the past, the prosecution is under no statutory duty to provide pre-trial notice of a witness called to impeach the credibility of a defense witness. <em>See State v. Hildreth </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 423, 430-31, 884 P.2d 771, 775-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b633 In <em>Hildreth, </em>the defendant raised the defense of alibi at trial. In rebuttal, the State called three witnesses. The defendant in <em>Hildreth </em>then challenged those witnesses on appeal, contending that the witnesses had been called to rebut his alibi defense but that the State had failed to discharge its statutory duty to provide written, pre-trial disclosure of these witnesses as required by \u00a7 46-15-322(6), MCA. <em>Hildreth, </em>267 Mont, at 430, 884 P.2d at 775-76. This Court, noting that two of the State\u2019s three \u201crebuttal witnesses\u201d were called to impeach the testimony of defense witnesses rather than rebut the alibi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>defense itself, impliedly held that the prosecution was under no duty pursuant to \u00a7 46-15-322(6), MCA, to provide notice of impeachment witnesses prior to trial. <em>See Hildreth, </em>267 Mont, at 430, 884 P.2d at 775-76. Regarding the third witness, we observed that the State had, without prior notice, attempted to solicit testimony from the witness to rebut the defendant\u2019s alibi defense in circumvention of the statutory \u201cnotice requirements,\u201d but we held, nonetheless, that the admission of the rebuttal testimony was harmless because it had not prejudiced the defendant. <em>Hildreth, </em>267 Mont, at 430-31, 884 P.2d at 776. <em>Hildreth </em>clearly implies that the prosecution is under no statutory duty to provide pre-trial notice of witnesses that may be utilized solely to impeach the credibility of defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b634 Furthermore, even assuming for the sake of argument that the pawn shop records could be characterized as evidence falling within the notice requirements of \u00a7 46-15-322(6), MCA, it is evident that the State provided notice to Weitzel at the \u201cearliest opportunity.\u201d <em>See State v. Madera </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 140, 147-48, 670 P.2d 552, 556; <em>cf. State v. Sage </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 192, 196-97, 717 P.2d 1096, 1098-99 (holding that the prosecution\u2019s statutory duty of providing notice of rebuttal witnesses does not arise until the defense provides notice of its intent to claim a particular affirmative defense). Weitzel\u2019s pre-trial notice did not provide the State with any details about the \u201csubstance of the testimony\u201d to be presented at trial. <em>See Madera, </em>206 Mont, at 148, 670 P.2d at 556. There was no indication that, in presenting evidence of good character or the defense of justifiable use of force, Weitzel would choose to testify as to his handgun ownership. Therefore, the State had no reason to know, in advance of trial, that Weitzel would defend against the charges by claiming that he did not own or possess any handguns. It would be \u201cillogical\u201d to hold that the prosecution was under a duty to disclose a list of witnesses intended to rebut a particular defense where the prosecution \u201cdid not even know about this defense until trial began.\u201d <em>Cf. Sage, </em>221 Mont, at 197, 717 P.2d at 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b635 We agree with the State that it was therefore entitled to rebut the testimony of Weitzel and his brother with relevant evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the pawn shop rebuttal evidence did not become relevant until Weitzel and his brother testified at trial as to Weitzel\u2019s gun ownership. Although Weitzel questions the relevance of the rebuttable evidence, we agree with the District Court that the pawn shop records were highly relevant to the question of Weitzel\u2019s credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>bility. <em>See State v. Arlington </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 127, 141, 875 P.2d 307, 315 (quoting Rule 401, M.R.Evid.) (recognizing that relevant evidence may encompass \u201c \u2018evidence bearing upon the credibility of a witness\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b636 It is clear that Weitzel\u2019s defense strategy was to suggest to the jury that he did not own or possess any handguns and had last purchased a handgun as a gift for his brother in early-1996. Weitzel made a tactical decision to open the door to the issue of gun ownership, and by choosing to testify to the purchase of the handgun in 1996 without disclosing other gun transactions in which he had been involved, Weitzel assumed the risk that his defense strategy would backfire. In short, \u201c[h]e took a chance and his strategy failed. He was caught in a trap of his own making, and no ... statutory impurity arose thereby.\u201d <em>Madera, </em>206 Mont, at 148, 670 P.2d at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b637 Nor do the pawn shop records constitute \u201cother acts\u201d evidence falling under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., and the notice requirements of the so-called \u201cModified Just Rule.\u201d <em>See State v. Just </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957, <em>as modified by State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52. The pawn shop evidence did not show other crimes, wrongs, or acts, and was introduced by the State for the sole purpose of challenging Weitzel\u2019s credibility. Moreover, as the State correctly argues, where a defendant has \u201c \u2018opened the door\u2019 \u201d to the question of his or her character, as Weitzel did here, the State is not precluded from presenting rebuttal evidence pursuant to Rule 404(a)(1), MvR.Evid., without adhering to the notice requirements of the Modified Just Rule. <em>See Arlington, </em>265 Mont, at 156-57, 875 P.2d at 324-25; <em>see also State v. Carter </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 449, 458, 948 P.2d 1173, 1178; <em>State v. McQuiston </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 397, 403, 922 P.2d 519, 523; <em>State v. Newman </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 315, 320, 790 P.2d 971, 974. Weitzel, by presenting testimony about his history of handgun ownership as a character trait, opened the door to the State\u2019s rebuttal evidence showing that Weitzel presented a partial, and thus misleading, history of his gun ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b638 Lastly, we decline to address Weitzel\u2019s argument that the admission of the pawn shop evidence violated Rule 608, M.R.Evid. The State points out that Weitzel failed at trial to raise Rule 608, M.R.Evid., as a basis for exclusion of the evidence. As a general rule, this Court will consider for review only those issues raised before the trial court; we will not review an issue where the defendant has failed to present the issue to the district court. <em>See State v. Herrera, </em>1998 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>173, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 289 Mont. 499, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 962 P.2d 1180, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104 and 46-20-701, MCA. A district court \u201c \u2018will not be put in error where it was not accorded an opportunity to correct itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 502, 506, 726 P.2d 1364, 1366 (quoting <em>State v. Patton </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 417, 422, 600 P.2d 194, 197). None of the circumstances outlined in \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, exist here, nor do either of the parties urge this Court to reach this issue under common law plain error review. Therefore, Weitzel\u2019s failure to raise Rule 608, M.R.Evid., before the District Court constitutes a waiver of that claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AVR\">\u00b639  Given the nature and circumstances of Weitzel\u2019s testimony in this case, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the State to introduce the pawn shop evidence to impeach Weitzel\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"AMa\">\u00b640  Should this case be remanded to the District Court for resentencing in light of the recent decision in <em>State v. </em>Guillaume, 1999 MT 29, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b641 In <em>Guillaume, </em>this Court confronted the question of whether the application of Montana\u2019s weapon enhancement statute, \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA (1997), to a conviction for felony assault pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA (1997), violated the double jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 2. Reasoning that the Montana Constitution \u201caffords greater protection against multiple punishments for the same offense\u201d than does the United States Constitution, this Court held that \u201capplication of the weapon enhancement statute to felony convictions where the underlying offense requires proof of use of a weapon violates the double jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b642 Notwithstanding the absence of a double jeopardy objection below, Weitzel asks this Court to apply <em>Guillaume </em>on appeal and conclude that the District Court\u2019s sentence enhancement on the basis of \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA (1997), violates the multiple punishments proscription of the Montana Constitution. Weitzel, like the defendant in <em>Guillaume, </em>was convicted of felony assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA (1997), for causing reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by \u201cuse of a weapon,\u201d and his sentence was then enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-221(1), MCA (1997), for having \u201cused a . . . dangerous weapon\u201d during the commission of that offense. As in <em>Guillaume, </em>since use of a weapon was an element of the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>felony assault conviction, application of the weapon enhancement statute effectively punished Weitzel twice for use of a weapon in violation of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b643 Even though Weitzel failed to raise the double jeopardy issue in the District Court proceedings, the State concedes, and we agree, that this case must be remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Guillaume. </em>This Court has already invoked plain error review to reach the <em>Guillaume </em>issue on direct appeal, as the State indicates, because \u201c[w]hether multiple punishments have been imposed in violation of a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to be free from double jeopardy brings into question the fundamental fairness of the proceedings and the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 31, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 268, \u00b6 12, 975 P.2d 321, \u00b6 12; <em>see also State v. Roullier, </em>1999 MT 37, \u00b6 25, 293 Mont. 304, \u00b6 25, 977 P.2d 970, \u00b6 25; <em>State v. Aguilar, </em>1999 MT 159, \u00b6 13, 295 Mont. 133, \u00b6 13, 983 P.2d 345, \u00b6 13. The failure to reach Weitzel\u2019s double jeopardy claim would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6 12. Furthermore, this Court has determined that a new rule of criminal law must be applied retroactively to all cases on direct review, such as this one, that are pending and not yet final. <em>See State v. </em>Egelhoff (1995), 272 Mont. 114, 125-26, 900 P.2d 260, 266-67, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Montana v.
