Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they are correct. <em>See Steer, Inc. v. Dept. Of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603. Our standard of review in appeals from grants of summary judgment is <em>de novo. See Meyer v. Creative Nail Design, Inc., </em>1999 MT 74, \u00b6 13, 294 Mont. 46, \u00b6 13, 975 P.2d 1264, \u00b6 13. To be granted summary judgment, the \u201cmoving party has the burden of showing a complete absence of any genuine issue as to all facts considered material in light of the substantive principles that entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Kolar v. Bergo </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 262, 266, 929 P.2d 867, 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b66 The parties have stipulated to the following facts. Babcock purchased insurance for her Ford truck from Farmers. In August, 1997 Babcock borrowed a neighbor\u2019s horse trailer and attached it to her truck. Her truck\u2019s trailerball had a diameter of two inches. However, the trailer she borrowed had a hitch that required a two and 5/8ths inch diameter ball. Babcock attempted to tow the trailer with her truck\u2019s two-inch trailerball. While she drove on highway 12, the trailer came unhooked, left the road, and struck a fence. The trailer and fence were damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u00b67 Farmers paid Babcock for the full cost of the fence\u2019s repair. Babcock requested that Farmers also pay for damage to the horse trailer that she estimated at $4,500. Farmers paid $500 toward the trailer, that amount constituting her policy\u2019s limit for collision and comprehensive coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">\u00b68 In June, 1998 Babcock brought suit in Justice Court, claiming that Farmers was required to pay for the damage to the horse trailer under the provisions of her liability coverage. The Justice Court granted summary judgment in favor of Babcock. Farmers appealed that decision to District Court. The District Court <em>sua sponte </em>deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>mined that the case was appropriate for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of Farmers, concluding that the \u201cplain and ordinary language of the policy\u2019s exclusions to liability prevents coverage for damage to the horse trailer beyond the express limitation.\u201d From that judgment and order Babcock appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b69 Whether the District Court correctly concluded that the liability portion of Babcock\u2019s insurance policy did not provide coverage for a horse trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b610 Babcock\u2019s policy with Farmers provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArL\">Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">This coverage does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">7. Damage to property owned or being transported by an insured person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">8. Damage to property rented to, or in the charge of, an insured person except a residence or private garage not owned by that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">\u00b611 Babcock argues that the provisions of her policy are inherently ambiguous and that the doctrine of reasonable expectations should defeat the exclusionary provisions of the policy. Babcock argues that under her policy\u2019s provisions, a consumer of average intelligence would have believed that if an insured became liable for damages to a trailer, Farmers would cover the damages. In support of her contention, Babcock points to \u201cCoverage B\u201d of the policy, which provides that Farmers will \u201cpay damages for which any insured person is legally liable because of ... property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a ... utility trailer.\u201d Babcock argues further that because the policy defines insured car as including \u201cany utility trailer... while attached to your car,\u201d the policy\u2019s exclusions only apply \u201cwhen the property damaged is \u2018being transported.\u2019 \u201d Babcock argues that the trailer was not <em>transported </em>when it was damaged because it had separated from her truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">\u00b612 Babcock asserts further that exclusion 7 fails to define \u201cproperty\u201d and that it is therefore ambiguous. Noting that her policy elsewhere defines utility trailer, Babcock argues that had Farmers intended to specifically exclude trailers from coverage, it \u201cneeded to have done so with particularity and precision.\u201d Babcock also argues that the phrase \u201cbeing transported by\u201d is ambiguous and that it is reasonable to interpret this phrase to refer to \u201citems of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>within </em>the insured vehicle without actually referring to the vehicle itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b613 Babcock further contends that exclusion 8 is ambiguous because property again is not defined and because the term \u201c \u2018in the charge of\u2019 is problematic and equivocal.\u201d Babcock suggests that \u201cin charge of\u201d suggests a legal responsibility on the part of the person charged with the property in question. Babcock asserts that she \u201cha[d] no such formal, legally binding agreement with the third-party owner of the borrowed horse trailer.\u201d Babcock relies on <em>Miller v. Elite Ins. Co. </em>(Cal. Ct. App. 1980), 161 Cal.Rptr. 322, where the court concluded that an insurance policy\u2019s exclusion, which referred to \u201c \u2018property owned or transported by the insured, or property rented to or in charge of the insured,\u2019 \u201d was ambiguous because that language did not indicate whether \u201cproperty\u201d referred to real property or chattel goods. <em>Miller, </em>161 Cal.Rptr. at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b614 Farmers responds that Babcock has fundamentally misconstrued the purpose of a liability policy and that as a general rule liability policies do not cover damage to the insured\u2019s own property or to property within her control. Farmers argues that to receive coverage for such property, the insured must obtain collision or comprehensive coverage. Farmers recognizes that Babcock had collision coverage but notes that her coverage was limited to $500, which Farmers has paid.</p>\n<p id=\"AW3\">\u00b615 Farmers argues further that Babcock\u2019s policy exclusions are clear and unambiguous. <em>Farmers cites Simmons v. Farmers Ins. Group </em>(Utah App. 1994), 877 P.2d 1255, where the insured towed a borrowed horse trailer that was damaged in an accident. Farmers argues and Babcock does not dispute that the insurance policy at issue in <em>Simmons </em>had language identical to that of the policy in the present case. The <em>Simmons </em>court concluded that the insured\u2019s liability policy did not cover damage to the borrowed horse trailer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">the liability statement of coverage, standing alone, could be read as covering damage to the horse trailer. However, the exclusions to liability coverage prevent coverage for the borrowed trailer. Exclusion 7 states that liability coverage does not apply to \u201c[d]amage to property owned or being transported by an insured person.\u201d The horse trailer was being transported by Simmons, the insured in this case. Further, Exclusion 8 provides that liability coverage does not extend to damage to property \u201cin the charge of, an insured person ... not owned by that person.\u201d Simmons clearly did not own the horse trailer. Accordingly, the plain and ordinary language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>policy\u2019s exclusions to liability prevent coverage for damage to the horse trailer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><em>Simmons, </em>877 P.2d at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b6 16 Farmers argues that in essence Babcock is seeking to convert liability coverage into collision coverage that she did not purchase, thus obtaining a \u201cwindfall\u201d for herself. Further, Farmers distinguishes <em>Miller, </em>arguing that Babcock\u2019s policy addressed the ambiguity in the meaning of the word \u201cproperty\u201d that the <em>Miller </em>court recognized by excepting, in provision 8, \u201ca residence or private garage not owned by that person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b617  Farmers also responds to Babcock\u2019s argument that the exclusion does not apply because the trailer was not \u201cbeing transported\u201d when it was damaged. Farmers argues that Babcock has cited no authority for this interpretation and that the accident clearly occurred while Babcock was in charge of and transporting the trailer. Farmer notes that under Babcock\u2019s interpretation, a passenger ejected from a car would have no claim for medical payments because the passenger did not \u201coccupy\u201d the vehicle at the time of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b618 We agree. The doctrine of reasonable expectations does not apply to create coverage where \u201cthe terms of the insurance policy clearly demonstrate an intent to exclude [such] coverage.\u201d <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 381, 945 P.2d at 37 (citation omitted). The liability exclusions in the present case are not ambiguous on their own terms nor are they ambiguous in light of Babcock\u2019s policy as a whole. Babcock\u2019s policy clearly demonstrates an intent to exclude liability coverage for the damage to the borrowed horse trailer: at the time of the accident, Babcock was transporting the horse trailer and the horse trailer was \u201cin her charge.\u201d The District Court correctly concluded that the liability portion of Babcock\u2019s policy did not cover the damage to the borrowed horse trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u00b6 19 We hold that the District Court did not err in granting Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
