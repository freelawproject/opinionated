Halvorson now appeals the particularized suspicion ruling. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the officer who arrested Halvorson had sufficient information to form a particularized suspicion justifying a stop of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">\u00b63 On September 12, 1998, Missoula City Police Officer Jamie Keintz arrested Halvorson for driving while under the influence of alcohol. Halvorson\u2019s vehicle had a personalized license plate, \u201cRX78SH.\u201d Halvorson refused to take a breathalyzer test during the DUI processing, resulting in suspension of her driver\u2019s license for six months pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-15\">\u00b64 Officer Keintz\u2019s husband is Missoula County Deputy Sheriff Kelly Keintz. Deputy Keintz was on duty when Officer Keintz arrested Halvorson. He followed the arrest on his radio and later dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>cussed the circumstances of the arrest and the license suspension with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b65 On January 4,1999, Deputy Keintz observed a vehicle displaying the personalized license plate \u201cRX78SH\u201d being driven by a female on Highway 93 South. Recognizing the license plate and recalling the earlier arrest and suspension, Deputy Keintz initiated a traffic stop. Halvorson was the driver of the vehicle. Deputy Keintz ticketed her for operating a motor vehicle with her license suspended, in violation of \u00a761-5-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b66 Halvorson moved the Missoula County Justice Court to dismiss the charge against her on grounds that Deputy Keintz did not have sufficient information to form the particularized suspicion of criminal activity necessary to justify an investigative stop of her vehicle. The motion was briefed and was denied without a hearing. Halvorson then pled guilty and appealed to District Court, which likewise denied her motion to dismiss. Reserving her right to appeal the adverse ruling on her motion to dismiss, Halvorson pled guilty. She now appeals on the issue reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">\u00b67 Did Deputy Keintz have sufficient information to form a particularized suspicion justifying a stop of Halvorson\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"AWe\">\u00b68  Montana peace officers are authorized to stop any vehicle observed \u201cin circumstances that create a particularized suspicion\u201d that an occupant of the vehicle has committed or is committing an offense. Section 46-5-401, MCA. To establish particularized suspicion, the State must show (1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>State v. Gopher </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 189, 194, 631 P.2d 293, 296, adopting the analysis <em>of United States v. Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"An\">\u00b69  The existence or nonexistence of particularized suspicion is a question of fact which the district court determines from the totality of the circumstances confronting the officer at the time of the stop. <em>State v. Lafferty, </em>1998 MT 247, \u00b6 10,291 Mont. 157, \u00b6 10,967 P.2d 363, \u00b6 10. On appeal from the denial of a motion to suppress, this Court reviews factual findings to determine whether they are clearly erroneous and conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Lafferty, </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u00b610 Halvorson first asserts that Deputy Keintz did not have sufficient objective data upon which to base his suspicions. She proclaims that without confirming his memory of the earlier suspension of her driver\u2019s license, there were no facts for Deputy Keintz to work with in confirming his suspicions. While she concedes that Deputy Keintz could be expected to remember her distinctive personalized license plate and that her driver\u2019s license was suspended following her refusal to submit to a breath test, she argues that he had no reason to remember that her refusal occurred within six months prior to his investigative stop of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b6 11 The State points out that Halvorson did not argue in her briefs to either the Justice Court or the District Court that Deputy Keintz had failed to confirm that her license was suspended. In fact, she stated in her briefs that \u201cthe only information available to Deputy Keintz was that the registered owner of the vehicle with license plate number \u2018RX78SH\u2019 had a suspended driver\u2019s license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">\u00b612  This Court considers only those issues raised in the pleadings or otherwise before the district court. State <em>v. </em>Herrera, 1998 MT 173, \u00b6 17,289 Mont. 499, \u00b6 17,962 P.2d 1180, \u00b6 17. We conclude that the question of whether Deputy Keintz confirmed before he stopped Halvorson that her license was still suspended has been waived for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b613 Halvorson also asserts that Deputy Keintz did not have a reasonable resulting suspicion that the occupant of her vehicle was or had been engaged in wrongdoing. This Court has not previously considered whether a peace officer\u2019s knowledge that the license of a vehicle\u2019s owner is revoked or suspended is sufficient to establish a reasonable suspicion that a person observed driving that vehicle is engaged in wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\u00b614 On this point, the State cites <em>Village of Lake in the Hills v. Lloyd </em>(Ill. App. Ct. 1992), 591 N.E.2d 524. In that case, the Illinois court concluded that police knowledge that an owner of a vehicle has a revoked driver\u2019s license provides a reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle for purposes of ascertaining the status of the license of the driver. The court stated that common sense dictates that such information, even alone, is enough to provide a constitutional basis for stopping a vehicle. <em>Village of Lake in the Hills, </em>591 N.E.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b615 The State also cites <em>State v. Pike </em>(Minn. 1996), 551 N.W.2d 919, in which the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that an officer\u2019s knowledge that the owner of a vehicle had a revoked driver\u2019s license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>was enough to form the basis of a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity when the officer observed the vehicle being driven. The Minnesota court limited its holding to circumstances in which \u201cthe officer remains unaware of any facts which would render unreasonable an assumption that the owner is driving the vehicle.\u201d <em>Pike, </em>551 N.W.2d at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u00b616  We agree with and adopt the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. In the present case, Deputy Keintz observed that the driver of Halvorson\u2019s vehicle was a woman who matched the information he had about Halvorson. Deputy Keintz had no reason to believe that Halvorson was not the driver of her vehicle at the time he made the investigative stop. We hold that Deputy Keintz had sufficient information to justify the investigative stop of Halvorson\u2019s vehicle. The District Court\u2019s ruling on the motion to dismiss and Halvorson\u2019s conviction are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b29-6\">JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
