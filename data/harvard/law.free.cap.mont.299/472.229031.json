We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\u00b62 Merrick raises one issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b63 Whether there was sufficient evidence to support Merrick\u2019s conviction for robbery?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">\u00b64 On March 13,1997, Erin Legried, a \u201closs prevention specialist\u201d at Shopko in Missoula, Montana, was on duty in the loss prevention office at the front of the store. At the time of the incident, Ms. Legried was 19 years old and had worked for Shopko as a loss prevention officer for about five months. It was Ms. Legried\u2019s job to watch for theft, stop people suspected of shoplifting as they exited the store and bring them back into her office. She testified that she had been involved in approximately 60 arrests or apprehensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">\u00b65 At about 7:15 p.m., while Ms. Legried was in her office doing paperwork, she heard the security alarm go off and witnessed Merrick exiting the store followed by a female employee. Ms. Legried ran outside and followed Merrick about 50 feet into the Shopko parking lot. Ms. Legried approached Merrick, informed him that he had tripped the alarm system, and requested that Merrick return to the store to straighten things out. When Ms. Legried informed Merrick that he had tripped the alarm system, Merrick responded, \u201cThat was my gun. I carry a gun. It sets off the alarms.\u201d Ms. Legried testified that \u201cwhen he said that, he kind of unzipped his coat and reached inside.\u201d At that point, Ms. Legried testified that she turned around and yelled for someone to call 911 because she thought Merrick was going to pull out a gun and use it to either shoot her or at least scare her in order to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>away. Merrick walked away. A man drove up to Ms. Legried in a car and offered to lend her his cell phone. She called 911. Police Officer Thomas B. Johnson of the Missoula Police Department responded. He stopped Merrick about a block from Shopko and placed him under arrest. During a pat down, Officer Johnson retrieved eight knives and two utility knives from inside Merrick\u2019s coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b66 On March 27, 1997, the State filed an Information charging Merrick with robbery in violation of \u00a7 45-5-401, MCA. In the Information, the State alleged that Merrick purposely or knowingly put Ms. Legried in fear of immediate bodily injury. Merrick was tried by jury and convicted of robbery on May 13, 1997. On July 3, 1997, the District Court sentenced Merrick to a term of 40 years in the Montana State Prison. Merrick appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b67 We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Roullier, </em>1999 MT 37, \u00b6 17,293 Mont. 304, \u00b6 17,977 P.2d 970, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b68 Whether there was sufficient evidence to support Merrick\u2019s conviction for robbery?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b69 Section 45-5-401, MCA, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of robbery if in the course of committing a theft, the person... purposely or knowingly puts any person in fear of immediate bodily injury.\u201d Neither party contests the fact that Merrick committed a theft or that in the course of that theft, Ms. Legried was in fear of immediate bodily injury. The only issue is whether Merrick acted with purpose or knowledge in causing that fear. Merrick contends that there was insufficient evidence that he acted purposely or knowingly because Ms. Legried\u2019s fear was based on her reaction to his personal appearance and her mistaken belief that he unzipped his coat after informing her that he was carrying a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b610 \u201cPurposely\" and \u201cknowingly\u201d are defined by statute. Section 45-2-101(34), MCA, provides that \u201ca person acts knowingly with respect to the result of conduct described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware that it is highly probable that the re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>suit will be caused by the person\u2019s conduct.\u201d Section 45-2-101(64), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] person acts purposely with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense if it is the person\u2019s conscious object to engage in that conduct or cause that result.\u201d Accordingly, whether there was sufficient evidence to convict Merrick depends on whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Merrick was aware that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that Ms. Legried would, fear immediate bodily injury as a result of his conduct or if it was his \u201cconscious object\u201d to cause her fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b611 Ms. Legried testified that after Merrick activated Shopko\u2019s theft alarm system, she left her post in the store and approached Merrick in the parking lot. Ms. Legried asked Merrick to return to the store and he refused. After his refusal, Ms Legried testified that the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">Q. What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">A.... I go, well, you set off the alarms, we need to get it straightened out. And [Merrick] said, that was my gun. I carry a gun. It sets off the alarms. And when he said that, he kind of unzipped his coat and reached inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">Q. Now, can you describe for us what the expression on his face was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">A. Um, psycho, kind of evil. I mean, it scared me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">Q. And his actions. Can you describe for us again what he did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">A. He, like, when he said, it\u2019s my gun, it always sets off the alarms, his coat was probably zipped up to about here (indicating), and he unzipped it and stuck his hand like about right here (indicating), and then that\u2019s when I turned around \u2018cause I thought he was going to pull out a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">Q.... What did you think was going to happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">A. I thought he was going to pull out a gun and either use it or \u2014 just use it. I mean, use it like to shoot me, or use it to scare me to get me away from him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">\u00b612 In turn, Merrick admitted that he did tell Ms. Legried that he was carrying a gun and that it set off the security alarm, but that he had meant it as a joke. Merrick also testified that he did not unzip his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>jacket and insert his hand inside, but that he might have put his hands in his pockets to hold the stolen items in his coat. Merrick points to the fact that the arresting officer, Thomas B. Johnson, testified that had Merrick unzipped his coat it was possible that some of the stolen items would have fallen out.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b613  The testimony of one witness is sufficient to prove a fact. <em>See State v. Santos </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 125, 131, 902 P.2d 510, 514 (citing State <em>v. Radi </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 451, 462, 578 P.2d 1169, 1176). Circumstantial evidence may be used to prove any element of an offense. <em>See State v. Mergenthaler </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 198, 204, 868 P.2d 560, 563 (citing <em>State v. Lynn </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 430, 435, 795 P.2d 429, 433). Additionally, the weight and credibility of witnesses are exclusively the province of the trier of fact. <em>See Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 131, 902 P.2d at 514. In the event of conflicting evidence, it is within the province of the trier of fact to determine which will prevail. <em>See Santos, </em>273 Mont. at 131, 902 P.2d at 514 (citing State <em>v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 189, 860 P.2d 89, 94).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b614  Essentially, whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Merrick acted purposely or knowingly when he put Ms. Legried in fear of immediate bodily injury, turns on a determination of credibility. The jury could have believed Ms. Legried\u2019s testimony that when she approached Merrick he told her he had a gun, he had an \u201cevil\u201d expression on his face, and he unzipped his jacket and reached inside. From this circumstantial evidence, a rational trier of fact could have inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that Merrick was not simply making a joke when he referred to his gun nor was he adjusting the stolen knives when he reached toward his coat, but rather that he mentioned a gun and made a move toward his coat with the awareness that it was highly probable that Ms. Legried would fear immediate bodily injury on account of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b6 15  We conclude that Ms. Legried\u2019s testimony was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Merrick purposely or knowingly put Ms. Legried in fear of immediate bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
