Bradley filed this action with the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, asking for a declaratory judgment can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>celling a contract under which he purchased an automobile. The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Aes\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants and denying Bradley\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b63 In 1997, Terry Bradley shopped for a motor vehicle at Eisinger Motors in Kalispell, Montana, and left his name and telephone number with salesman \u201cGeo.\u201d Johnson. Johnson called Rick Muffitt, a salesman at North Country Automotive and Marine, Inc., to inquire whether that dealership had any vehicles meeting Bradley\u2019s wishes. Muffitt told Johnson that North Country had a 1996 GMC Yukon which might interest Bradley. Johnson gave Muffitt Bradley\u2019s telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b64 Muffitt called the Bradley home and identified who he was and how he had obtained the Bradleys\u2019 telephone number. Muffitt avers that he identified North Country as his place of employment, although Bradley avers that he did not. Muffitt told Bradley that he had a 1996 GMC Yukon on the sales lot. Bradley invited Muffitt to bring the vehicle to the Bradleys\u2019 home, which Muffitt did.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b65 Bradley and his wife test-drove the GMC Yukon and decided to buy it. They allowed Muffitt to take their trade-in vehicle back to the dealership to determine its value. Muffitt took the paperwork for the sale, which was prepared at the North Country dealership, back to the Bradleys\u2019 home, where Terry Bradley signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b66 The Bradleys later contacted North Country regarding options that they wished to have installed on the vehicle. Muffitt swears by affidavit that, at that time, the Bradleys expressed their satisfaction with the GMC Yukon and invited him to stop by their house again.</p>\n<p id=\"AZB\">\u00b67 The purchase was financed through First Security Bank. The Bradleys made payments of $681.51 per month for two months, and then attempted to cancel the contract. When the defendants did not agree to that, Terry Bradley filed this action requesting a declaratory judgment that the sales transaction was a personal solicitation sale and that North Country\u2019s failure to inform the Bradleys that they had a right to cancel the contract is an unfair and deceptive trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"Afx\">\u00b68 Both sides moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion, and Bradley appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment for the defendants and denying Bradley\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u00b610 We review appeals from summary judgments de novo. <em>Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 443, 446, 930 P.2d 661, 663. Like the District Court, we apply the following evaluation, pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.R:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (internal citations omitted). We review the legal determinations made by a district court to ascertain whether the court erred. <em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont, at 265, 900 P.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b611 At issue is the applicability to this transaction of Montana\u2019s Personal Solicitation Sales Act, Title 30, Chapter 14, part 5, MCA. The Act protects buyers in \u201cpersonal solicitation sales\u201d by providing a cooling-off period during which the buyer may choose to cancel such a sale. The Act defines \u201cpersonal solicitation sales\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">any attempt by a seller who regularly engages in transactions of the same kind to sell goods or services which are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, when either the seller or a person acting for him contacts the buyer by telephone or in person other than at the place of business of the seller, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">(a) an attempted sale in which the buyer personally knows the identity of the seller, the name of the business, firm, or organization he represents, and the identity or kinds of goods or services offered for sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">(b) an attempted sale in which the buyer has initiated the contact with the seller;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">(c) an attempted sale of a newspaper subscription in which the seller is a minor engaged in both the delivery and the sale of the newspaper; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">(d) an attempted sale of an insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Section 30-14-502(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">\u00b6 12 The District Court determined that the transaction at issue in this case was not a personal solicitation sale. That is the first error alleged by Bradley, who maintains that because North Country was in the business of selling motor vehicles, it qualifies under the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>statute as a \u201cseller who regularly engages in transactions of the same kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b6 13 A fundamental principle of statutory construction is that the intent of the legislature is to be pursued whenever possible. Section 1-2-102, MCA. In determining that intent, a statute which is plain and unambiguous on its face must be applied as written. <em>Connery v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 115, 119, 929 P.2d 222, 225. Legislative history may be considered only when the legislative intent cannot be determined from the statute\u2019s content. <em>Dorn v. Board Of Trustees of Billings School Dist. No. 2 </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 136, 144, 661 P.2d 426, 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b614 The District Court interpreted the words \u201ctransactions of the same kind\u201d in \u00a7 30-14-502(2), MCA, to refer to transactions as a whole-that is, the place, the mode of contact with the consumer, and the product; not just the type of product sold. Because Bradley presented no evidence that North Country regularly engaged in sales of vehicles by telephone or in person at buyers\u2019 homes, the court ruled that the Personal Solicitation Sales Act did not apply to this sale. The court stated that \u201c[t]here is no indication of an intent by the legislature to address a single instance of telephone or home contact by a regularly established seller of a certain type of goods or services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">\u00b615 We agree with the District Court. The plain meaning of the words \u201cregularly engages in transactions of the same kind\u201d logically refers not only to the type of goods sold, but also to other aspects of the transaction; e.g., whether the transaction was a door-to-door or telephone sale. The title of the legislation which became the Act was \u201cAn act for the general revisions of laws relating to a three-day cooling off period on door-to-door sales.\u201d \u201cDoor-to-door sales\u201d necessarily refers to more than a single transaction at a buyer\u2019s home, and clearly identifies the kind of transactions sought to be regulated under the Act. The words \u201cregularly engages\u201d substantiate the legislature\u2019s intent to limit the statute\u2019s application to only those solicitors who sell their products in this manner on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"AP8L\">\u00b616  We conclude that the Personal Solicitation Sales Act does not apply to a one-time sale by telephone or in person at a buyer\u2019s home. Because Bradley did not bring forth any evidence that North Country regularly attempted sales by telephone or in person other than at its place of business, we agree with the District Court that the Personal Solicitation Sales Act does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00b6 17 Bradley also argues that the District Court erred when it determined that because Muffitt identified himself and the business for which he was employed to Bradley, this sale was within the exception to the definition of \u201cpersonal solicitation sales\u201d set forth at \u00a7 30-14-502(2)(a), MCA. Because we have affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling that the Personal Solicitation Sales Act does not apply to this sale under the court\u2019s first rationale, we need not address this question. Because we determine that judgment for the defendants was correct as a matter of law, we also do not address Bradley\u2019s third argument, that the court should have instead granted his motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">\u00b618 We hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment for the defendants and in denying Bradley\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-4\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART and DISTRICT JUDGE SHERLOCK, sitting in place of JUSTICE NELSON and DISTRICT JUDGE HENSON, sitting in place of JUSTICE REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b185-5\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AJm1\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b619 I dissent from the majority opinion. I would reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b620 The Plaintiff, Terry L. Bradley, brought this action pursuant to that part of the Consumer Protection Act which pertains to \u201cpersonal solicitation sales\u201d and is found at \u00a7 30-14-501, MCA, et seq. The purpose of this part of the act is \u201cto afford consumers subjected to high pressure personal solicitation sales tactics a cooling-off period.\u201d In stating the purpose of the act the legislature made no distinction regarding the frequency with which a seller engages in personal solicitation sales tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b621 The act requires that before any personal solicitation, the seller clearly identify itself; (\u00a7 30-14-503, MCA) and provide any buyer with the right to cancel any sale consummated within three days following the transaction. Section 30-14-504, MCA. Section 30-14-505, MCA requires that the seller provide the buyer with a notice of his or her right to cancel and states that until the notice has been provided the time for cancellation does not begin to run. A personal solicitation covered by the act is defined in \u00a7 30-14-502, MCA, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">(2) \u201cPersonal solicitation\u201d means any attempt by a seller who regularly engages in transactions of the same kind to sell goods or services which are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, <em>when </em>either the seller or a person acting for him contacts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>buyer by telephone or in person other than at the place of business of the seller, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">(a) An attempted sale in which the buyer personally knows the identity of the seller, the name of the business, firm, or organization he represents, and the identity or kinds of goods or services offered for sale ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b622 In this case the District Court held that North Country Auto and Marine did not engage in a \u201cpersonal solicitation\u201d because it does not regularly contact buyers by telephone or in person at a place other than the seller\u2019s place of business. The majority, after setting forth the correct rules of statutory construction, then misapplied those rules to affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b623 As noted by the majority, legislative intent must first be determined by the plain language of the statute. When the statute speaks for itself, other forms of interpretation are not appropriate. The plain language of \u00a7 30-14-502(2), MCA, does not require that a seller regularly engage in solicitation by phone or in person in order for a transaction in which that seller is involved to satisfy the definition of \u201cpersonal solicitation.\u201d The statute defines \u201cpersonal solicitation\u201d as <em>\u201cany attempt </em>by a seller who regularly engages in transactions of the same kind to sell goods ... when either the seller or a person acting for him contacts the buyer by telephone or in person other than at the place of business of the seller ...\u201d Section 30-14-502(2), MCA (emphasis added). The plain language of the statute simply requires that the seller regularly engage in selling the type of item which is the subject of the transaction and applies to <em>\u201cany attempt\u201d </em>by that seller to solicit business by phone or in person somewhere other than at the seller\u2019s place of business. All of those elements were satisfied in this case. North Country Auto regularly engages in the sale of automobiles. An automobile was the subject of the transaction which gave rise to this lawsuit. The original solicitation was by phone and follow-up contact between the buyer and seller occurred in person at the buyer\u2019s home, which was a place other than the seller\u2019s place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b624 By adding the requirement that the seller regularly engage in solicitations by telephone or at a place other than the seller\u2019s place of business, the District Court, and now the majority of this Court, have added requirements to the statute that are not found in its plain language. Therefore, I dissent from that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u00b625 The District Court also held that even if Bradley\u2019s purchase from North Country Auto and Marine was the result of a \u201cpersonal solicitation\u201d this particular transaction was exempted from coverage based on \u00a7 30-14-502(2)(a), MCA, which exempts a transaction in which the \u201cbuyer personally knows the identity of the seller ...\u201d The District court held that because Murfitt claims to have identified himself to Bradley during the initial phone call, Bradley \u201cpersonally knew\u201d the identity of the seller. However, the District Court\u2019s conclusion ignores the language in \u00a7 30-14-503, MCA, which requires that in every \u201cpersonal solicitation\u201d the seller identify itself at the time of the initial contact. Therefore, if the mere fact that the seller identifies itself is sufficient to exempt it from the act\u2019s coverage, then all the notice requirements of the act and cancellation rights provided by the act would be eliminated simply by a seller\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the act. The exception would literally swallow the rule. That interpretation ignores the requirement that statutes be interpreted in a way that does not defeat their object or purpose. <em>See Montana Talc Co. v. Cyprus Mines Corp. </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 491, 498, 748 P.2d 444, 449, and the requirement that various provisions of an act be construed in a way to give effect to all parts of the act if possible. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\">\u00b626 In order to give effect to \u00a7\u00a7 30-14-503 through -505, MCA, I would interpret the exemption provided at \u00a7 30-14-502(2)(a), MCA, to apply only in those situations where the buyer has some familiarity with the seller based on his own personal knowledge without regard to the introduction required by \u00a7 30-14-503, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b627 Furthermore, I conclude that the District Court erred when it decided as a matter of fact that Murfitt did identify himself and his employer to Bradley during their initial contact. That finding was based on Murfitt\u2019s affidavit as are those facts set forth in paragraphs 4 through 6 of the majority opinion. However, Bradley filed his own affidavit, which in several important respects, controverts those statements made in Murfitt\u2019s affidavit. For example, Bradley stated that Murfitt insisted on bringing the vehicle to his home, and after the purchase was agreed upon, submitted a number of papers for Bradley\u2019s signature which Bradley was not given the opportunity to read. Bradley stated in his affidavit that he does not recall Murfitt saying who he worked for during their initial conversation but that he did recall being angry when he first realized, while signing the sales documents, that he was doing business with North Country. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>stated that he had previously bought a boat from North Country and would not have knowingly done business with that firm again.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b628 The District Court resolved the factual issue created by contradictions in Murfitt\u2019s and Bradley\u2019s affidavits by simply finding that Bradley\u2019s affidavit was not credible. However, it is not the function of the District Court to resolve issues of credibility and thereby decide factual issues by summary judgment. Therefore, I conclude that even if the District Court had correctly interpreted the exemption provided in \u00a7 30-14-502(2)(a), MCA, there was no factual basis upon which to apply that exemption as a bar to Bradley\u2019s claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b629 For these reasons, I dissent from the majority opinion and would reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-6\">JUSTICE HUNT joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
