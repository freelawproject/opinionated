We reverse the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b62 The Department of Revenue of the State of Montana (DOR) conducted three separate audits and assessments of Decker for the years 1987 through 1992. On April 17,1992, DOR assessed additional taxes and interest against Decker for coal taxes for the years 1987 through 1988. Decker timely filed an objection to the assessment before the DOR Division Administrator. On April 14,1994, DOR assessed additional taxes and interest against Decker for coal taxes for the years 1989 through 1990. Both assessments were consolidated before the DOR Division Administrator. The DOR Division Administrator denied Decker\u2019s appeal from the 1987-1990 tax assessments. Decker appealed that decision to the DOR Director. The Director denied the appeal. Decker then appealed the Director\u2019s decision to the State Tax Appeal Board (STAB). Decker also filed an interlocutory appeal requesting the District Court to define \u201cmarket value\u201d and \u201carm\u2019s length agreement.\u201d On January 25,1996, Judge Baugh issued an order defining \u201cmarket value,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 15-35-107(1) and (3), MCA, as the price a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller under the market and economic conditions at the time of the sale. Neither Decker nor DOR appealed from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b63 On April 30,1996, DOR assessed additional taxes and interest for coal taxes for the years 1991-92. Decker appealed this assessment. That appeal was also denied. Decker then appealed the 1991-92 coal tax assessments to STAB. The appeals from the 1987-90 assessment and the 1991-92 assessment were consolidated. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment before STAB. STAB denied Decker\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted DOR\u2019s motion. Decker filed a petition for judicial review of STAB\u2019s decision. The District Court determined that STAB had hot included Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in the manner and form required and remanded to STAB for such findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b64 On September 15,1997, STAB issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and an Order. Again concluding that STAB had failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>include Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law as required, the District Court remanded to STAB once more for appropriate Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. On February 6, 1998, STAB issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and an Order affirming DOR\u2019s assessment of additional coal taxes against Decker. Decker petitioned for judicial review. On December 1,1998, Judge Watters entered an Order and Memorandum affirming STAB\u2019s Third Order. Decker appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b65 The following are undisputed facts as set forth by the parties in their respective briefs. Decker owns and operates a coal mine in Montana (hereinafter referred to as the Decker mine). Decker, Black Butte Coal Company (Black Butte) and Big Horn Coal Company (Big Horn) all entered into contracts in the mid-1970s with Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) for the long-term delivery of coal. Under the terms of those contracts, each of these entities was to supply ComEd with coal at a base price that would be adjusted over time by a predetermined escalator. During the audit period of 1987-1992, the base price plus escalators on the Decker/ComEd contract computed to a price of roughly $24-$28 per ton.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b66 Three contracts for the sale of coal are at issue in this appeal: (1) a contract entered into on December 31, 1986 between Decker (seller) and Big Horn (buyer) for the sale of coal by Decker during 1987; (2) a contract entered into on December 31, 1987 between Decker (seller) and Big Horn (buyer) for the sale of coal from 1988 through 1992; and (3) a contract entered into on January 1,1988 between Decker (seller) and Black Butte (buyer) for the sale of coal during the years 1988 through 1992 (collectively referenced herein as the Montana Contracts).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b67 The price of coal sold by Decker to Big Horn and Black Butte for the relevant audit years 1987 through 1992 under the Montana Contracts ranged from approximately $7.50 per ton to $10.42 per ton. For the coal that Decker sold to Black Butte and Big Horn under the Montana Contracts, Decker timely reported and paid to the State of Montana $8.5 million in coal taxes on the full contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b68 The Montana Contracts followed from the decision of Black Butte and Big Horn, both Wyoming entities, to exercise their rights under separate coal purchase contracts, negotiated between themselves and ComEd in the 1970s (hereafter the Wyoming Contracts). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Black Butte and Big Horn apparently had the contractual right under the Wyoming Contracts to buy or \u201coutsource\u201d coal from an alternate source rather than mine the coal themselves. Exercising their right to outsource the coal, Black Butte and Big Horn contracted to purchase coal from Decker on the condition that ComEd contemporaneously purchase that coal from them. The coal purchased by Big Horn and Black Butte from Decker was shipped by Decker to ComEd to fulfill the contractual obligations of Big Horn and Black Butte under the Wyoming Contracts. Decker did not receive any additional money or other consideration of any nature from Big Horn or Black Butte for the coal when it was resold to ComEd under these separate Wyoming Contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b69 At the time of the Montana Contracts, Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019, Inc. (Kiewit) directly or indirectly through its subsidiary Kiewit Mining Group (KMG), had ownership in Decker, Big Horn and Black Butte. Decker was a 50/50 Montana joint venture between KMG and Western Minerals, Inc., a wholly separate entity owned by Nerco, Inc. (NERCO). Black Butte was a 50/50 Wyoming joint venture between KMG and Bitter Creek Coal Company, a wholly separate entity owned by Union Pacific Corporation. Big Horn was a Wyoming Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Kiewit.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b6 10 Negotiation of the Montana Contracts between Decker and Big Horn and Decker and Black Butte took place principally between Donald Sturm of Kiewit (on behalf of Big Horn and Black Butte) and Gerald Drummond of NERCO (on behalf of Decker).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b611 A majority of Decker\u2019s management committee, comprised of an equal number of persons designated by Kiewit and NERCO, must authorize sales of coal made by Decker. NERCO, Kiewit\u2019s partner in Decker, was a competitor of Kiewit and knowledgeable about the coal market conditions from 1986 through 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b612 DOR has audited all major coal producers in the state of Montana from 1987 through 1990, but is unaware of any prices paid to Montana coal producers under coal contracts entered into from 1987 through 1990 that exceeded the approximately $7.50 to $10.42 per ton that Decker received from Big Horn and Black Butte under the Montana Contracts. The prices paid to other coal producers for contracts negotiated and entered between 1986 and 1989 ranged from $5.13 per ton to $8.70 per ton.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u00b613 The following are comparable long term coal contracts that were negotiated and entered into during much the same time period as the Montana Contracts at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-26\">\u00b6 14 DOR did not conduct a market value study nor did it determine the market value of coal for contracts entered into from 1986 through 1988. Rather, DOR imputed a price of roughly $24 to $28 per ton to the Montana Contracts based solely upon prices negotiated under a contract entered into on June 20, 1974 between Decker (seller), and ComEd (buyer), a Chicago, Illinois-based electric utility (hereafter the 1974 ComEd Contract). The coal prices under the 1974 ComEd Contract (as adjusted by predetermined escalators) for coal sold during the audit period were not intended to and did not follow market value prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-27\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-28\">\u00b615 The parties do not dispute the Findings of Fact in STAB\u2019s order of February 6,1998. Rather, they dispute the application of those facts to the law as set forth in \u00a7 15-35-107, MCA, and in Judge Baugh\u2019s Interlocutory Order of January, 1996. Decker appeals from the District Court\u2019s conclusion that STAB and DOR correctly interpreted the law in imputing market value to the coal contracts in question. Thus, resolution of this appeal involves questions of law that are to be reviewed for correctness rather than the clearly erroneous standard applicable to an agency\u2019s finding of fact. <em>See Steer, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-29\">\n<em>Issues Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-30\">\u00b616  Pursuant to \u00a7 15-35-107, MCA, DOR may impute a value to coal sales rather than relying on contract prices if (1) it determines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the contract price does not represent an arm\u2019s-length agreement; <em>and </em>(2) the imputed value approximates market value. Thus, the questions presented for this appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\">\u00b617 1. Whether Decker has an arm\u2019s-length relationship with Wyoming coal producers, Big Horn and Black Butte?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b618 2. Whether the $24-$28 per ton value that DOR imputed to the contracts approximates market value?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b619 Since we determine that resolution of issue number two is dispositive, we do not address issue number one.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b620 Section 15-35-107, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">When value of coal may be imputed \u2014 procedure. (1) The department may or shall at the request of the taxpayer impute a value to the coal which approximates market value f.o.b. mine in a case where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">(c) a person sells coal under a contract which is not an arm\u2019s-length agreement[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u00b621  In order to impute a value to coal sales under \u00a7 15-35-107(l)(c), MCA, DOR must meet a two-part standard: it must determine that the contract price does not represent an arm\u2019s-length agreement and that the transaction is less than market value. The two criteria are stated in the conjunctive. Thus, if DOR fails to satisfy either standard, DOR may not impute a value to the coal sales in question. Since we determine that Decker has shown that DOR\u2019s imputed value does not \u201capproximate\u201d market value under the market and economic conditions pertaining in 1986-1988, we need not address the question of whether the sales were arm\u2019s-length.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">\u00b622 In his interlocutory order, Judge Baugh defined \u201cmarket value\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-13\">The term \u201cmarket value\u201d as set forth in Sec. 15-35-107(1) and (3), M.C.A., means the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller under the market and economic conditions at the time of sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALp\">\n<em>Department of Revenue\u2019s Contentions:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">\u00b623 DOR contends that there was no need to conduct a market value study; rather, the best indicators of value for the coal at issue are the actual sales of coal mined by Decker in the 1980s and sold to ComEd pursuant to the 1974 contract between ComEd and Decker. The record contains examples of such sales that occurred between Decker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>and ComEd, Black Butte and ComEd, and Big Horn and ComEd at prices between roughly $24 and $28 per ton.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b624 DOR argues that in imputing value, \u00a7 15-35-107(3), MCA, allows DOR to apply factors used by the federal government under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>613 </em>and 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.613-41, including the taxpayer\u2019s sales of ores or minerals of like kind and grade. DOR may also consider any other additional criteria it considers appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b625 DOR contends that, when applying the factors from the above IRS regulation, the representative market price is established by the coal sold to ComEd under the 1974 ComEd Contract. The assessments of Decker were appropriately based upon that 1974 arm\u2019s-length contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b626 In summary, DOR contends that this appeal involves Decker coal that is mined at Decker, loaded on the train at Decker, shipped directly to ComEd, and never touched by Black Butte or Big Horn. As characterized by DOR, when the coal comes down the conveyor belt at the Decker mine, it is purchased by Big Horn and Black Butte and resold to ComEd before it hits the railroad car. DOR posits that Decker cannot use this \u201cpaper sham\u201d transaction to contract away its tax obligation on coal that is mined in the state of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\"><em>Decker\u2019s </em>Contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b627 Decker contends that DOR\u2019s imputed price of $24-$28 per ton, based upon the 1974 ComEd Contract, has no reasonable relationship to the undisputed market price of coal during the period when the Montana Contracts were negotiated. The 1974 ComEd Contract was negotiated over a decade earlier under very different market and economic conditions. Decker produced and sold all of the coal it was allowed to sell to ComEd under the 1974 contract and paid the State of Montana all coal taxes due based on these prices. Decker argues that DOR made no attempt to support its position with evidence that there were any contracts negotiated under the \u201cmarket and economic\u201d conditions existing in 1986-1988 at prices higher than what Decker received under the Montana Contracts. Absent Decker\u2019s sales of coal to Big Horn and Black Butte under the Montana Contracts, the coal in question would have been sold in the same market at the same or lower prices to another consumer, or perhaps it would have remained in the ground for lack of another buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">\u00b628 Decker argues that STAB failed to make any factual findings to support DOR\u2019s imputed price of $24-$28 per ton as \u201cmarket value\u201d under the legal standard established by Judge Baugh. To the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Decker asserts it had no opportunity, during the period in question, to sell this coal for the $24-$28 per ton prices that DOR has imputed.</p>\n<p id=\"ARQ\"><em>The District Court\u2019s </em>Conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">\u00b629 After determining that substantial evidence supported DOR\u2019s decision that the transactions were not arm\u2019s-length, the District Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">The only market for Decker\u2019s coal was Commonwealth Edison. Commonwealth Edison was the only relevant market because the \u201cWyoming Contracts\u201d sales were contingent upon the contemporaneous sale of Decker\u2019s coal to Commonwealth Edison. The contracts did not permit either Black Butte or Big Horn to sell coal to anyone other than Commonwealth Edison. This closed market (Commonwealth Edison) was the market condition at the time of sale.... Therefore, the market value of coal was approximately $24-$27 a ton, the price of the coal under the Commonwealth Edison contracts. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">130 Under \u00a7 15-35-107, MCA, DOR may impute a value to coal sales rather than rely on contract prices if: (1) it determines the contract price does not represent an arm\u2019s-length agreement, and (2) the imputed value approximates market value. Judge Baugh, in his interlocutory order, defined market value as: \u201cThe term \u2018market value\u2019 as set forth in Sec. 15-35-107(1) and (3), M.C.A., means the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller under the market and economic conditions at the time of the sale.\u201d This definition, which is not disputed, by its terms requires a determination of what a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller under a contract negotiated under the market and economic conditions prevailing as of 1986-1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b631  The only evidence presented as to what a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller pursuant to a contract negotiated in 1986-1988 was in the Sansom Report prepared by Decker\u2019s expert, Dr. Robert L. Sansom. The Sansom Report documents transactions and bids for coal comparable in quality and in time to the Montana Contracts. The Sansom Report shows that coal sales in Decker\u2019s market area, which reflected the market and economic conditions prevailing at the time of the sale, ranged from $3.77 to $7.61 per ton. The Sansom Report took into account both short term (spot market) contracts and long term contracts negotiated in the same time frame as Decker\u2019s 1986-1988 contracts with Big Horn and Black Butte. Although DOR did not agree with Dr. Sansom\u2019s conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Montana Contracts were at market value, it does not disagree with any of the data or other factual recitations contained in the report as to what coal was selling for from 1986 to 1988. Further, DOR did not present any evidence that coal contracts were entered into from 1986 to 1988 at prices that differed from those enumerated in the Sansom Report. The coal prices ($7.50 to $10.42 per ton) under the Decker/Black Butte and Decker/Big Horn contracts were equal to or greater than the coal prices set forth in the Sansom Report ($3.77 to $7.61 per ton). There being no evidence to the contrary, we conclude that the prices paid to Decker by Black Butte and Big Horn under the Montana Contracts met or exceeded market value, in other words, the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller under market and economic conditions <em>at the time of the sale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b632 The District Court concluded that the only relevant market was ComEd. However, the agreed upon definition of \u201cmarket value\u201d does not distinguish between an open and a closed market. Rather, the plain language of the definition refers to the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller under the market and economic conditions at the time of the sale. We conclude that market value is established by the Sansom Report\u2019s undisputed documentation of coal sales from 1986 to 1988. Secondly, the fact that the parties made the sale of coal under the \u201cMontana Contracts\u201d contingent upon the contemporaneous sale of the coal to ComEd does not change the fact (shown by the Sansom Report) that there was a market for the sale of coal to buyers other than Black Butte or Big Horn. This was not a \u201cclosed market\u201d situation where the customers (Black Butte and Big Horn) could not turn elsewhere to purchase or outsource the coal. <em>Compare Palmer v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1973), 479 F.2d 153, 163 (recognizing \u201cclosed market[s] where the customer cannot turn elsewhere to purchase the services or products offered\u201d). The fact that ComEd was bound to purchase coal from Black Butte and Big Horn was attributable to ComEd\u2019s 1974 contracts, not to the 1980s Montana Contracts. We conclude that the District Court erred in concluding that ComEd\u2019s 1974 contracts defined the relevant market for the purpose of determining market value with regard to the Montana Contracts. ComEd\u2019s obligations under the 1974 contracts do not define \u201cmarket and economic conditions at the time of sale\u201d for willing buyers and sellers of coal in Montana during the 1980s.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b633 Moreover, the $24-$28 per ton price imputed by DOR ignores the temporal component of the market value definition. DOR\u2019s im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>puted price is erroneously pegged to the 1974 ComEd contracts rather than to any market factors extant \u201cat the time of the sale.\u201d The fallacy of DOR\u2019s position is apparent from the expert report submitted by DOR\u2019s expert, Dr. Ronald Johnson, whose report was not a market value study but rather an overview of long-term coal contracting. Dr. Johnson recognized that the market and economic conditions existing when the 1974 ComEd Contract was negotiated differed from the market and economic conditions between 1986 and 1988 when the Montana Contracts were negotiated. He also recognized that the coal prices that Decker received from ComEd from 1986 to 1988 were based upon price escalators pre-determined back in 1974 and that those escalators \u201cdid not do a very good job of tracking new contract prices of the mid and late 1980s\u201d and \u201cwere not design[ed] to closely follow changes in the market price for coal, however defined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b634 Dr. Johnson\u2019s observations are borne out by the Stagg Report, which was commissioned by the State of Montana\u2019s Department of Commerce. Stagg Engineering was retained by the Department of Commerce to conduct a study and assessment of the future market demand for Montana coal production and related topics. The results of the study were published in January, 1996 for the Montana Department of Commerce and the Office of the Governor, Economic Development Office. The report provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">The Decker mine is facing several critical issues related to sales to both Detroit Edison and Commonwealth Edison. ... Of much greater economic importance to Decker profitability and future State tax revenues, however, are the prices embodied in the long-term contracts for both utilities. The Consultant\u2019s analysis, as well as abundant anecdotal evidence and observations by utility industry analysts, indicate that the current contract prices are significantly above market, by a factor of 50% in the case of Detroit Edison and as much as 300% for Commonwealth Edison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b635 The 1996 Stagg Report does not specifically reference the 1986-1988 time frame at issue here. Nonetheless, it graphically illustrates the fact that contract prices based upon pre-determined escalators, which were negotiated years ago in long-term contracts, do not accurately reflect present-day market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b636 As Decker points out, the illogic of DOR\u2019s position is further illustrated by reversing the price differential between the 1970s and 1980s contracts at issue. Had coal prices <em>increased </em>from the 1970s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>time period instead of decreasing, the coal prices under the 1980s contracts would exceed the prices from the 1970s contracts. Under DOR\u2019s rationale, DOR would ignore the higher negotiated market price in the 1980s and assess taxes based upon the lower prices negotiated in the 1970s. This would unfairly and illogically deprive the State of tax revenue by freezing tax assessments at 1970s levels. When coal prices decrease, as they did in the 1980s, it is equally illogical to assess the 1980s production of coal at the higher 1970s prices. Both logic and law dictate that the assessment be based upon market value <em>at the time of the sale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b637 We find unpersuasive DOR\u2019s arguments that Decker\u2019s 1974 contract with ComEd should determine the market value of coal sold under the Montana Contracts. DOR contends that the 1974 ComEd Contract is relevant to the determination of market value for the Montana Contracts because the price of coal under that contract could not be determined until the coal was actually sold by Decker in the 1980s. That is, the price at which coal is sold under the long-term contracts is determined at or near the time of sale. This is true. However, this contention ignores the fact that the price paid for coal in the 1980s pursuant to long-term contracts is determined, not by reference to market and economic conditions extant in the 1980s, but by reference to escalators pre-determined in the 1970s that were not designed to track current market value. DOR\u2019s contention that the 1970s long-term contract prices, when implemented in the 1980s according to predetermined escalators, are \u201cat the time of sale,\u201d is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b638 DOR further argues that its reliance upon the 1974 ComEd Contract is compelled because that contract establishes the price for the same coal being shipped to ComEd on the same train as the Decker/Big Horn and Decker/Black Butte coal in dispute. Thus, posits DOR, it was comparing \u201capples to apples.\u201d This argument ignores the fact that coal, like apples, can be an interchangeable commodity in the sense that one train load may contain a sufficient quantity of coal to satisfy numerous contracts entered into at different times and for different prices. Decker did not use the coal mined pursuant to the Black Butte and Big Horn contracts to satisfy Decker\u2019s 1974 contract obligation to ComEd. As Decker points out, the Black Butte and Big Horn coal, although transported on the same train as the Decker/ComEd coal, was \u201cnew coal.\u201d That is, Decker had already satisfied its contract with ComEd. The Black Butte and Big Horn con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tracts thus represent coal that Decker was mining above and beyond any coal that Decker needed to satisfy its ComEd contract. The fact that it was the \u201csame coal\u201d in terms of quality and source does not mean that it was the same coal that was being shipped to satisfy the 1974 ComEd Contract, nor does it mean that Decker was somehow precluded from negotiating new sales of that coal at different prices reflecting the market and economic conditions \u201cat the time of the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b639 In support of its reliance on the 1974 ComEd Contract, DOR invokes \u00a7 15-35-107(3), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">(3) When imputing value, the department may apply the factors used by the federal government under 26 U.S.C. 613, or that provision as it'may be labeled or amended, in determining gross income from mining or the department may apply any other or additional criteria it considers appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b640 In turn, the federal regulation interpreting 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 613 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">Sales or purchases, including the taxpayer\u2019s, of ores or minerals of like kind and grade as the taxpayer\u2019s, will be taken into consideration in determining the representative market or field price for the taxpayer\u2019s ore or mineral only if those sales or purchases are the result of competitive transactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.613-4(c)(3) (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u00b641 Thus, DOR contends, it had leeway to consider Decker\u2019s \u201cown actual sales prices for ores or minerals of like kind and grade.\u201d Although the above regulation clearly allows consideration of the taxpayer\u2019s own sales of ores of like kind and grade, it does not suggest that the taxpayer\u2019s own actual sales, <em>regardless of date and price, </em>shall be determinative of current market value. Rather, the regulation is couched in terms of ascertaining a \u201crepresentative\u201d market. For purposes of resolving the issue under consideration, a \u201crepresentative\u201d market is one that reflects market value \u201cat the time of the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">\u00b642  Decker\u2019s sale of coal to ComEd pursuant to a 1974 contract with pre-determined escalators is not representative of the market and economic conditions at the time of the sale and thus does not meet the controlling definition of market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">\u00b643  DOR and STAB\u2019s conclusion that the 1974 ComEd Contract price represents the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller under the market and economic conditions at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>1980s sales is incorrect. We conclude that Decker has shown that DOR\u2019s imputed value of $24-$28 per ton does not \u201capproximate[ ] market value f.o.b. mine,\u201d \u00a7 15-35-107(1), MCA, under the market and economic conditions pertaining in 1986-1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b644 The decision of the District Court, affirming STAB, is reversed and DOR\u2019s assessment based upon the imputed value of $24-$28 per ton is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b514-6\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"AxyK\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u00b645 The majority has elevated form over substance in accepting Decker\u2019s contentions. As the DOR ironically frames the question presented: How can this coal be worth the values of $7 to $ 10/ton claimed by Decker and its expert when it is <em>simultaneously sold </em>to Commonwealth for $24 to $29/ton? The plain answer to that question is that it can only be attributed the lesser value, as the majority has done here, by ignoring the economic realities of the transactions at issue. I dissent because I agree with the DOR that artificial prices between companies that share common management and ownership do not accurately reflect the true value of coal upon which coal production taxes are based. Rather, the best indicator of value for Montana coal production tax purposes is the <em>actual prices paid </em>for the coal in question, as determined by the long-term contracts underlying the transactions. As discussed below, I conclude that the DOR has satisfied both prongs of the conjunctive test for imputing a taxable value to coal sales and, therefore, that the DOR\u2019s assessments should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\n<em>1. The Montana Contracts Were Not Arms-Length Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u00b646 The majority does not address whether the Montana Contracts were arms-length transactions. It is crucial to address this prong, however, because the DOR\u2019s imputed value follows entirely from this starting premise. As defined by Judge Baugh, an \u201carms-length\u201d transaction is an agreement (1) between independent (2) non-controlled parties (3) with opposing economic interests. Looking at the record as a whole, it is clear that the Montana Contracts were not arms-length. Being non-arms-length, the contract prices paid to Decker by Big Horn and Black Butte simply were not representative of \u201cmarket value\u201d as contemplated by Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u00b647 First, the Kiewit Companies were not independent of one another. Kiewit owned all or part of Decker, Big Horn, and Black Butte. Decker claims that notwithstanding Kiewit\u2019s ownership interests in all three subsidiary companies, the Montana Contracts were arms-length by virtue of the fact that the agreements were negotiated by a representative of Kiewit on behalf of Big Horn and Black Butte and by a representative of NERCO on behalf of Decker. However, as the Department argues and as STAB found, such \u201cnegotiation\u201d is insufficient to render the Montana Contracts arms-length, since the respective \u201cnegotiators\u201d were shown to both be members of the Decker Management Committee. In other words, a member of the Decker Management Committee \u201cnegotiated\u201d with another member of the Decker Management Committee to sell Decker coal. These \u201cnegotiations\u201d were nothing more than Decker negotiating with itself for the sale of Decker coal with Decker approving what was \u201cnegotiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Acu\">\u00b648 Second, the Kiewit Companies were jointly controlled. Not only is Kiewit\u2019s overlapping ownership of all three subsidiary entities strongly indicative of control, <em>see Creme Mfg. Co. v. United States </em>(5th Cir. 1974), 492 F.2d 515, 520, but the record shows that Kiewit controlled the day-to-day management and operational responsibilities of Decker, Big Horn, and Black Butte. Additionally, Kiewit filed a combined Montana Corporation License Tax return for all three subsidiary entities indicating that they were engaged in a unitary business. <em>See Allied-Signal, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 768, 781, 112 S.Ct. 2251, 2260, 119 L.Ed.2d 533, 548 (indicating that objective indicia of a \u201cunitary business\u201d are (1) functional integration, (2) centralization of management, and (3) economies of scale). Kiewit\u2019s filing of a unitary tax return is, by itself, an admission that Decker, Big Horn, and Black Butte were jointly controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b649 Third, the Kiewit Companies did not have opposing economic interests. Although Decker claims that NERCO\u2019s participation in the negotiation of the Montana Contracts ensured that Decker received the highest price for its coal, this fact does not magically render the transactions the result of opposing economic interests. It is too simple a point to belabor here, but all of the parties to the Montana Contracts, including NERCO, had the same economic interest of selling more Decker coal. Put simply, everyone stood to profit by the Montana Contracts. This was especially true of Kiewit: not only would ComEd pay Kiewit under the lucrative long-term Big Horn and Black Butte contracts without diminution by the Wyoming coal severance tax, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Kiewit would also be paid for the additional Decker coal that was mined with Decker, as it turns out, being taxed only on the lower face value of the Montana Contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\n<em>2. The Value Imputed to the Montana Contracts Was Market Value</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b650 As the DOR discovered in auditing Decker, the obligations of Big Horn and Black Butte to purchase Decker coal under the Montana Contracts were totally contingent upon two things: first, Big Horn and Black Butte had <em>no right </em>to purchase Decker coal under the Montana Contracts until Decker had satisfied its monthly delivery obligations to ComEd pursuant to the 1974 contract; and second, Big Horn and Black Butte had <em>no obligation </em>to purchase Decker coal under the Montana Contracts unless ComEd was purchasing coal pursuant to the Wyoming Contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b651 In other words, the Montana Contracts were clearly ancillary to and contingent upon the preexisting long-term contracts. While the Montana Contracts were not arms-length, it is undisputed that the 1970s long-term contracts between ComEd and the Kiewit Companies were arms-length agreements negotiated between a willing buyer and seller. Therefore, nothing should prevent the DOR from piercing the sham Montana Contracts and reaching the true value of the underlying, arms-length transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b652 The DOR is permitted to impute a value to coal when a party (1) sells coal under a contract which is not an arms-length agreement, and (2) the contract price is below market value. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 42.25.512 (l)(b) and 42.25.1708 (l)(b), ARM. Here, having determined that the Montana Contracts were not arms-length agreements, the DOR then correctly determined that the sham contract prices were below \u201cmarket value\u201d as determined by the price provisions of the underlying long-term contracts at the time of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b653 The DOR satisfied all three requirements implicit in Judge Baugh\u2019s definition of market value: (1) that the price a \u201cwilling buyer\u201d (ComEd) would pay a \u201cwilling seller\u201d (Kiewit) was $24-$28/ton; (2) that the \u201cmarket and economic conditions\u201d for the Decker coal at issue were defined by the 1970s long-term contracts between the Kiewit Companies and ComEd; and (3) that the price provisions (base price + escalators) of the long-term contracts determined the price \u201cat the time of sale\u201d for Decker coal sold to ComEd during the 1980s.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">\u00b654 First, the DOR\u2019s imputed value of $24-$28/ton was equivalent to the actual prices paid for Decker coal by ComEd under arms-length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>agreements. In implementing its broad authority under \u00a7 15-35-107(3), MCA, the DOR did not, contrary to Decker\u2019s suggestions, rely solely on the 1974 long-term contract between Decker and ComEd as the basis for its imputation. While the DOR did initially look to that contract in defining the relevant market value for Decker coal, which it is entirely justified in doing under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 613 and 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1613-4, the DOR went further and compared the value of Decker coal sold under the 1974 contract with the value of Decker coal sold under the Wyoming Contracts to verify the accuracy of its imputed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">\u00b655 This inquiry showed that Decker, Big Horn, and Black Butte were each selling Decker coal to ComEd during the audit period at <em>substantially similar prices </em>as determined by the arms-length long-term contracts: Decker was receiving $26.79 to $28.04/ton under its 1974 contract, while Big Horn and Black Butte were receiving $23.71 to $29.47/ton under the 1976 Wyoming Contracts. Therefore, the DOR\u2019s imputed value of approximately $24-28/ton was obviously based on the prices paid to the Kiewit Companies by ComEd under <em>all three long-term contracts, </em>not just the 1974 Decker/ComEd contract. This methodology was. an entirely appropriate use of the DOR\u2019s authority, under \u00a7 15-35-107, MCA, to utilize \u201cother criteria\u201d in arriving at an imputed value. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-35-107(3), MCA (specifying that the DOR may utilize the factors enumerated in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 613 or \u201cmay apply any other or additional criteria it considers appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b656 Given that the DOR\u2019s imputed value of $24-$28/ton represents the actual prices paid by ComEd during the audit period for the Decker coal at issue, Decker cannot refute the DOR\u2019s imputation. Decker has simply failed to sustain its burden of proving that the imputed value for the coal at issue does not approximate market value. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-35-107(3), MCA. Since the underlying long-term contracts were arms-length, those contract prices therefore represent the amounts a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the Decker coal at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b657 Second, the 1970s contracts defined the \u201cmarket and economic conditions\u201d for the sale of Decker coal during the audit period. Decker contends, and the majority accepts, that coal is an entirely fungible substance. The majority goes awry by assuming, erroneously, that there is a single market value for coal and, consequently, that the value of long-term coal contracts negotiated under markedly different market conditions can be judged according to current market con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ditions for coal contracting. Not only does this position fail to acknowledge the public policy underlying Montana\u2019s coal severance tax, but it leads to an absurd legal result.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b658 As the DOR suggests, the primary legislative purpose underlying Montana\u2019s coal severance tax was to establish \u201ccategories of taxation which recognize <em>the unique character of coal as well as the variations found within the coal industry.'' </em>Section 15-35-101(2)(d), MCA (emphasis added). In enacting the coal severance tax, the Montana Legislature found that \u201cwhile coal is extracted from the earth like metal minerals, there are differences between coal and metal minerals\u201d justifying different treatment for taxation purposes. Section 15-35-101(1), MCA. These differences, as expressly found by the legislature, include the fact that \u201ccoal is the only mineral which is <em>so often marketed through sales contracts of many years\u2019 duration\u201d </em>(\u00a7 15-35-101( l)(b), MCA); that \u201ccoal, unlike most minerals, <em>varies widely in composition and consequent value when marketed\u201d </em>(\u00a7 15-35-101(l)(c), MCA); and that different types of coal \u201cin Montana have <em>sufficiently different markets and value </em>and therefore require different production taxes\u201d (\u00a7 15-35-101(l)(e), MCA) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b659 As a general rule, the public policy of this state is set by the Montana Legislature through its enactment of statutes. <em>Duck Inn, Inc. v. Montana State Univ. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 519, 523-24, 949 P.2d 1179, 1182. The public policy underlying Montana\u2019s coal severance tax recognizes the unique character of coal as a mineral substance, the different markets and values which exist for different types of coal, and the prevalence of long-term contracting in the coal industry as a means of ensuring a coal supply of a particular grade or quality. If the Montana Legislature has expressly recognized variations in coal quality and consequent value, and the prevalence of long-term contracting in the coal industry because of these variations, nothing should prevent the DOR from recognizing the same and imputing a value to a long-term contract based upon actual sales prices where, as here, that contract specifies coal of a particular quality and provides for a price at the time of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b660 Decker\u2019s sale and delivery of coal was, by the very terms of the Montana Contracts, contingent upon Black Butte and Big Horn being able to \u201ccontemporaneously sell and deliver\u201d an identical quantity of Decker coal to ComEd pursuant to the Wyoming Contracts; and that coal had to be of a <em>specific quality </em>under the terms of the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Contracts (contractually specified BTU, ash fusion temperatures, and specific percentages of moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon, ash, sulphur, and sodium), which identically parallel the highly specific coal quality provisions of the 1974 Decker/ComEd contract. Although the Wyoming Contracts themselves are not in the record, they presumably contain the identical coal quality provisions. Indeed, the Johnson Report suggests that one of the reasons for the Montana Contracts was because Big Horn and Black Butte were having trouble supplying coal of the particular quality mandated by the Wyoming Contracts at a reasonable extraction cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">\u00b661 Notably, Decker cites no sales of <em>Decker coal </em>(by Decker, Big Horn, or Black Butte) during the audit period other than the sham sales made to its companion Kiewit companies under the Montana Contracts. Decker\u2019s hypothetical argument that it could have sold its coal to other willing buyers under market conditions in the 1980s begs the question: What reasonable coal company would undercut its profit potential by selling on the open market when it could enter into an intra corporation sale which is tied to preexisting long-term contracts with higher prices? Put simply, it strains good faith to assume that Decker would be a \u201cwilling seller\u201d on the open market when it already had a \u201cwilling buyer\u201d in ComEd who would pay significantly higher prices than dictated by existing market conditions. The District Court was correct in determining that this was, in effect, a \u201cclosed market\u201d situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b662 In that respect, the Sansrom Report, upon which the majority relies, is simply irrelevant. The Sansrom Report is a description of the 1980s market for sp6t contracts and new long-term contracts, however, it cites no sales of <em>Decker coal </em>during the audit period. In essence, what Decker is arguing by relying on the Sansrom Report is that evidence of other 1980s prices for coal <em>not mined from Decker and not sold to ComEd </em>provides better evidence of the value of the Decker coal at issue than the actual value of Decker coal sold to ComEd during the audit period. This is an absurd position.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b663 Contrary to the majority\u2019s reasoning, judging sales of Decker coal under the Montana Contracts by sales of coal of other quality and value suffers, as the DOR justifiably asserts, from an \u201capples-to-oranges\u201d comparison. The Johnson Report clearly articulated that, \u201ccoal is not a homogeneous commodity\u201d since it \u201cvaries greatly in terms of its BTU content and other physical properties, and power plants are designed to burn certain types of coal.\" Remember that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>value of coal, unlike other minerals, varies dependent upon its composition. Section 15-35-101(l)(c), MCA. Therefore, as compelled by the federal Clean Air Act, a major factor underlying the prevalence of long-term contracting between a utility company like ComEd and a low-sulphur western mine like Decker is, in fact, the <em>heterogeneous nature of coal. </em>The majority\u2019s simplistic analysis on the basis of the Sansrom Report is fallacious because, as the Johnson Report stated, it \u201ccompletely ignores the economic rationale for long-term contracts between coal suppliers and utilities, a dominant feature of the coal market, especially in the Western United States during the 1970s and 1980s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b664 Furthermore, the apparent \u201cillogic\u201d of the DOR\u2019s position, as suggested by Decker and accepted by the majority, is an obvious red herring. The inverse situation would never arise. Keep in mind that the underlying long-term contracts here were arms-length and that the DOR\u2019s imputation flows from the fact that the surface Montana Contracts were not arms-length. Therefore, assuming that the long-term contract is an arms-length agreement, as here, the DOR would never be in a position to impute a different value to that contract under the conjunctive test for approximating market value. Without any evidence that the agreement was non-arms-length, the contract sales price would be determinative of the taxable value of that coal even if the contract price were significantly below current market value. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15-35-102(7), 15-35-103(2), and 15-35-107(l)(c), MCA. However, where, as here, the contract price is non-arms-length and totally contingent upon contemporaneous sales of the same coal under a lucrative long-term contract, the DOR should be entitled to pierce the sham contract price and tax the true value of the underlying transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b665 Third, the long-term contracts specify a contemporary sales price according to a base price and predetermined escalators which are calculated \u201cat the time of sale.\u201d That these contracts were not designed to closely follow changes in the price of spot market and new long-term contracts is immaterial unless one ignores coal\u2019s variability in composition and market value, and the economic rationale for long-term coal contracts. Pursuant to the price provisions of the underlying long-term Decker/ComEd contract, the base price together with the price adjustments under the predetermined escalators constitute the \u201c \u2018current price\u2019 or \u2018current per ton price.\u2019 \u201d If that were not sufficient evidence that the underlying long-term contracts contain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>temporal dimension sufficient to satisfy the definition of market value, Kiewit itself represented to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that \u201c[tjhe price at which coal is sold under the Company\u2019s long-term contracts is determined at or near the time of sale ....\u201d Plainly, the time of \u201csale\u201d occurred during the 1980s when Decker coal was loaded on the train f.o.b. at the Decker mine for delivery to ComEd, not in the 1970s when the long-term contracts were entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b666 Given the legislative findings on the purpose of taxing coal differently from other minerals (i.e., because of variations in coal quality, value, and markets) and the DOR\u2019s broad authority in imputing value, nothing under Montana law prohibits the DOR from recognizing that long-term contracts strictly specifying coal of a particular quality and providing for a contract price determined at the time of sale, such as here, are directly representative of the relevant market value for that particular coal. Indeed, the DOR\u2019s assessments not only approximate market value; they constitute market value. I would affirm because there is no better approximation of market value than the actual prices paid for the coal at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\n<em>Concluding Remarks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b667 The law is supposed to respect substance above form. Section 1-3-219, MCA. After today, however, other vertically integrated mining companies that hold lucrative long-term coal contracts and do business in Montana now possess, thanks to Kiewit\u2019s ingenious legal shell game and the majority\u2019s formalistic holding, a paradigm for avoiding being taxed on the true value of their long-term contracts. By simply arranging for a sham spot market or new long-term coal contract between subsidiaries at prices slightly above current market value, a parent company, like Kiewit, can reap massive profits on underlying long-term coal contracts while paying relatively minimal taxes on the mock value of the surface contract. Provided that such a transaction is structured to be at least equivalent to current market value for spot market and new long-term coal contracts, the transaction will only be taxable at the contract sales price regardless of whether the agreement was non-arms-length.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b668 In short, the majority has accepted Decker\u2019s following argument, and its absurd consequences, lock-stock-and-smoking-barrel: \u201c[TheJ ownership interests of Kiewit potentially affects only whether the Montana Contracts were arm\u2019s length agreements. Even if these agreements are determined not to be arm\u2019s length agreements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Montana law does not allow the Department to impute a price above the <em>market price </em>for coal.\u201d The majority, by treating coal as an entirely fungible substance with a <em>single market value, </em>has effectively-reduced the two-pronged test for approximating market value to a single inquiry: Does the new contract price, irrespective of whether it is tied to existing long-term contracts with substantially higher prices, match or exceed current market value for other new contracts? If so, then the DOR cannot impute a different value to that contract, even where, as here, the contract price is plainly the product of a sham, intracorporation transaction. I dissent; today\u2019s absurd decision dupes the State of Montana and its citizens out of over $50 million in rightful tax revenues and that may be only the beginning.</p>\n<judges id=\"b522-4\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concurs in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
