Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the preindictment delay was not a violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">\u00b65 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Burt\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they are correct. See <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dept. Of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Interstate Production Credit v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b437-18\">\u00b67 In June, 1990 Burt was hired as office manager and bookkeeper for Sunbird Aviation (Sunbird), a fixed-base aviation services company. Burt handled Sunbird\u2019s books, accounts payable and receivable, and payroll. She had authority to sign checks for Sunbird. In October, 1995, Burt resigned her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">\u00b68 Following Burt\u2019s departure from Sunbird, Sunbird\u2019s new bookkeeper and Sunbird\u2019s president, Greg Mecklenburg, reviewed Sun-bird\u2019s bank statements from the previous year and discovered that each one of the bank statements was missing approximately four canceled checks. These checks were payable either to \u201ccash\u201d or to Burt. Further investigation established that from June, 1990 Burt wrote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>approximately three hundred unauthorized checks on Sunbird\u2019s account and that she also wrote approximately forty-five duplicate payroll checks. In January, 1996, Sunbird filed suit to recover monies from Burt.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b69 In January, 1997, the State filed an Information charging Burt with five counts of felony theft. The first four counts alleged that Burt stole more than a quarter million dollars from Sunbird. The fifth count alleged that Burt stole $840 from another company, Simpson Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b610 In October, 1998 Burt filed a motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial. The District Court held a hearing in October, 1998 and denied Burt\u2019s motion. Burt received a jury trial in October, 1998 and was convicted on all five counts. In December, 1998 the District Court sentenced Burt to ten years prison, with five years suspended, on Count one, and to four consecutive terms of ten years, each one of them suspended, on Counts two through five, resulting in a total sentence of fifty years prison with forty-five years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b611 1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the preindictment delay was not a violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\u00b6 12 Burt urges that the delay between the time when the State could have filed charges and the time when the State filed the Information (hereafter, the preindictment delay) violated due process. Burt argues that the State could have charged her in January, 1996 but intentionally delayed charging her and directed private citizens to investigate her. Burt argues that the State in essence used unfettered civil discovery to investigate her criminal case and that her cooperation in civil discovery \u201cnailed shut her criminal coffin.\u201d Burt argues that by waiting to file charges, the State avoided triggering her right to a speedy trial. Burt contends further that she suffered actual prejudice in the effect of the preindictment delay on her \u201chealth and emotions\u201d and the \u201churricane effect that civil discovery and investigation had on [her] subsequent criminal case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\"><em>\u00b613 The </em>State responds that the District Court did not err in finding that Burt was not actually prejudiced by the preindictment delay. The State argues that the only evidence of prejudice was testimony by Burt\u2019s husband that Burt\u2019s state of mind had deteriorated and that she was depressed and anxious. The State asserts that anxiety by itself does not constitute actual prejudice for purposes of due process. The State notes that Burt does not claim that her defense was impaired by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the unavailability or death of any critical witness. The State also argues that the preindictment delay was necessary for the State to investigate \u201cBurt\u2019s deceptions more fully.\u201d The State argues further that although the prosecution apparently obtained some investigative materials from the civil action brought against Burt, charges were filed against Burt only after an independent audit was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b614 This Court has previously addressed the due process implications of preindictment delay. In <em>State v. Curtis </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 288, 297, 787 P.2d 306, 311, we concluded that \u201cthe issue of prejudice is a question of fact.\u201d We recognized that the State must have \u201ca reasonable time to investigate the crime,\u201d <em>Curtis, </em>241 Mont. at 297, 787 P.2d at 312, and that premature indictments could \u201cincrease the likelihood of unwarranted charges being filed\u201d or \u201cimpair investigations by causing sources of information to dry up and by alerting other potential defendants of the possibility of indictment.\u201d <em>Curtis, </em>241 Mont. at 298, 787 P.2d at 312 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b615  Further, in <em>State v. Taylor, </em>1998 MT 121, 289 Mont. 63, 960 P.2d 773, we concluded that whether preindictment delay results in a violation of a defendant\u2019s due process rights requires a two-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">First, the defendant has the burden to show that he has suffered actual and substantial prejudice from the delay. Then, if he has shown sufficient prejudice, we must weigh the reasons for the delay offered by the State, as well as the length of the delay, to determine whether the defendant\u2019s rights have been denied. Throughout our analysis, we should be guided by the principle that a pre-indictment delay will lead to a violation of a defendant\u2019s due process rights if it can be said that requiring the defendant to stand trial \u201cviolates those fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions and which define the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adt\"><em>Taylor, </em>\u00b6 20 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">\u00b6 16  In the present case, we hold that the District Court correctly determined that Burt was not prejudiced by the preindictment delay. We decline to conclude that a defendant\u2019s anxiety during the preindictment period, without more, constitutes actual prejudice for purposes of establishing a due process violation. <em>Compare State v. Mouser </em>(Alaska Ct. App. 1991), 806 P.2d 330, 337, n.3 (concluding that \u201c[b]ecause anxiety, no matter how real, will not, in itself, impair the accused in defending against a charge, it does not qualify as prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>in the due process context\u201d). Burt has cited no authorities in support of her claim that the anxiety and stress that she experienced as a result of the asserted delay amounted to \u201cactual and substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>\u00b6 20. Nor has Burt shown that the preindictment delay resulted in a loss of witnesses or evidence or that requiring her to stand trial \u201cviolate[d] those fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions and which define the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>\u00b6 20 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b617 Burt also claims that the preindictment delay violated her right to privacy. We conclude that Burt has failed to preserve this issue for our review. The State contends and Burt does not dispute that she failed to raise this issue below. The rule is well established that we do not address issues that have not been preserved for review. <em>See Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easeley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b6 18 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Burt\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AX7\">\u00b619 Burt argues that her right to speedy trial has been violated. Without citation to any authority, Burt contends that she became an accused in January, 1996 when a civil complaint was filed against her and that the filing by \u201cState agents\u201d was tantamount to filing by the prosecution. Burt argues that Deputy County Attorney Marty Lambert directed two private citizens, Mecklenburg and Jim McLean (McLean) to investigate her alleged crimes and that those citizens were therefore agents of the State. The State responds that the District Court correctly concluded that the filing of Sunbird\u2019s civil complaint does not mark the time from which a speedy trial analysis should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b620 We note that Burt also claims that \u201c[t]he seizure of Mrs. Burt and then papers from her car in early January is an \u2018arrest\u2019 for purposes of speedy trial calculations.\u201d Burt fails to indicate the <em>year </em>in which this alleged \u201cseizure\u201d occurred. She also fails to cite to anything in the record that would suggest a \u201cseizure\u201d of her person. Regarding her papers, in her statement of facts Burt cites only to testimony by her husband that police had removed papers from Burt\u2019s car when it was found in Jefferson County and that the police returned some of the papers. Burt does not identify the papers, nor does she argue their importance to her defense. On this scant record, we conclude that Burt\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u00b621 The District Court found that Mecklenburg and McLean were not agents of the State but rather that they met with the County Attorney to request prosecution of Burt and that the County Attorney told them that he would not assist them in their civil action. Further, the District Court found that the County Attorney informed Mecklenburg and McLean that he would not file a criminal action as a collection action and that he did \u201cexpect cooperation... in any criminal investigation and prosecution by his office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b622 We conclude that Burt has failed to identify anything in the record that would support her claim that Mecklenburg and McLean acted as agents of the State. We further conclude that her contention that calculation of her right to speedy trial should begin in January, 1996 is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b623 Burt argues, however, that even if her right to speedy trial did not begin in January, 1996, her right to speedy trial has nonetheless been violated. Burt argues that if speedy trial calculations begin from the filing of the Information, more than 275 days of delay are attributable to the State. Burt argues that the State therefore has the burden of showing that Burt was not prejudiced by the delay between the filing of criminal charges against her and the start of her trial. Further, Burt appears to argue that \u201cnearly all of the delay should be assessed against the state because throughout the case the prosecution denied access to documents necessary to Burt\u2019s defense.\u201d Burt argues that the delay resulting from her counsel\u2019s withdrawal for medical reasons should be charged to the State. Finally, Burt contends that she timely asserted her right to speedy trial, that she suffered prejudice because of her \u201cexcessive\u201d anxiety, and that her defense has been \u201cimpaired\u201d as a result of the delay. The State responds that the District Court correctly concluded under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866, that Burt\u2019s right to speedy trial was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b624 The District Court made the following undisputed pertinent findings. The State filed the Information in January, 1997; Burt was arraigned, booked and released on bail on the same day. The case was originally set for trial in August, 1997; however, Burt moved for a continuance for medical reasons and the trial was reset for December, 1997. In November, 1997 Burt entered guilty pleas to the charges against her and sentencing was set for January, 1998. In January, 1998 Burt moved to continue the sentencing date and to withdraw her guilty pleas. The District Court granted her motions and set the case for pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>trial conference in March, 1998. On March 20, 1998 the District Court set the case for trial in April, 1998; however, on March 27, 1998 Burt\u2019s attorney moved to withdraw and was replaced by new counsel in April, 1998. By agreement of counsel, the District Court reset the trial as a trial to the bench on July 13, 1998. On July 13, 1998 Burt moved to withdraw her consent for waiver of jury trial, requested substitutions of both her defense counsel and the Honorable Judge Olson, and requested a change in venue. The following day, the District Court denied Burt\u2019s motions for substitution of judge and change of venue and granted Burt\u2019s motions to substitute counsel and to withdraw her waiver of jury trial. At a pretrial conference held later in July, 1998, Burt\u2019s counsel requested that the case be set over for a pretrial conference in September, 1998. At the September, 1998 pretrial conference the District Court set the case for trial by jury on October 26, 1998. On October 2, 1998 Burt filed a motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AOp4\">\u00b625 In its order denying Burt\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial, the District Court determined that the State is responsible for the \u201cinstitutional delay from January 30 to August 26, 1997 of 208 days.\u201d The District Court further concluded that the remaining time between August, 1997 and the trial in October, 1998 was delay \u201cattributable directly to defendant\u2019s requests for continuances.\u201d The District Court determined that because the delay attributable to the State is less than 275 days, \u201cthe burden remains on the defendant to demonstrate prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b626 The District Court found that although Burt alleged stress and anxiety from the delay, \u201cthe majority of the delay was of her own making.\u201d Further, the District Court found that although Burt alleged the possible loss of exculpatory evidence, she made no showing that any witnesses or evidence had been lost. Concluding that Burt had not established prejudice as a result of the delay, the District Court denied her motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b627 Whether a defendant has been denied her right to speedy trial is a question of constitutional law. <em>See State v. Small </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 113, 116, 926 P.2d 1376, 1378 (citations omitted). Since 1972, this Court has followed the general guidelines set forth in <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, in evaluating claims that a defendant was denied her right to speedy trial under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>See, e.g., State v. Sanders </em>(1973), 163 Mont. 209, 213, 516 P.2d 372, 375. In <em>City of Billings v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866, we set forth a new method for application of the speedy trial factors in <em>Barker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b628 Applying <em>Bruce, </em>we agree that the length of delay in the present case triggers a speedy trial analysis, as more than 200 days elapsed between Burt\u2019s arrest and her trial. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55 (concluding 200 days of delay triggers speedy trial analysis). We agree with the District Court that the State is responsible for the institutional delay from January 30 to August 26, 1997 of 208 days. <em>Compare State v. Puzio </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 163, 167, 595 P.2d 1163, 1165 (concluding institutional delay is chargeable to the State). We further agree with the District Court that Burt is responsible for the delay that resulted thereafter. Burt makes no showing how the prosecution\u2019s alleged denial of documents contributed to the asserted delay in her trial. Nor does she claim that the State\u2019s denial of documents was the basis for any of her motions to continue trial. In the absence of a nexus between the State\u2019s alleged discovery misconduct and the delay in Burt\u2019s trial, we conclude that Burt\u2019s argument is without merit. Nor do we find persuasive Burt\u2019s contention that the delay resulting from the withdrawal of her counsel should be charged to the State. The record establishes that Burt\u2019s counsel did not withdraw solely for medical reasons. In his motion to withdraw, Burt\u2019s counsel stated that \u201c[t]his motion is made for medical reasons in which counsel requires relief from further representation, for the reason that there is deterioration in the attorney-client relationship and for financial reasons.\u201d We conclude that the delay resulting from the withdrawal of Burt\u2019s counsel is attributable to Burt. <em>Compare State v. Dess </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 116, 123, 602 P.2d 142, 146 (where court concluded, after appellant\u2019s counsel moved for continuance and requested that new attorney appointed to case have at least a month to prepare, that \u201cseven weeks of the delay followed appellant\u2019s motion for continuance and must be attributed to appellant\u201d). Further, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the delay is attributable to the State, the delay did not prejudice Burt but rather enabled her to have counsel at trial. Because the delay attributable to the State is less than 275 days, Burt has the burden of showing prejudice from the delay in her trial. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56 (concluding \u201cwhen it has been demonstrated that 275 days of delay is [sic] attributable to the State, the burden should shift to the State to demonstrate that the defendant has not been prejudiced by the delay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b629 As Burt asserted her right to speedy trial before her trial, she made a timely assertion of that right. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 57 (concluding de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>fendant must assert right to speedy trial before commencement of trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b63 0 Finally, we consider whether Burt has established that she was prejudiced by the delay in her trial. Burt argues that she was severely prejudiced because of the anxiety she experienced during the delay in her trial. We conclude that Burt has not shown that her pretrial stress and anxiety prejudiced her. Burt was not incarcerated. Burt has not shown that she suffered excessive stress as a result of the delay in her trial and she has made no showing that her \u201ceconomic hardship,\u201d her \u201cstigma\u201d as a result of being charged with a crime for the first time, and her recourse to the services of a psychiatrist were consequences of the pretrial delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b631 Burt appears to argue that the delay in her trial prejudiced her defense. In lieu of legal argument in support of this position, Burt refers this Court to her preindictment delay claims. For the reasons previously discussed, we conclude that her argument is without merit. Again, Mecklenburg and McLean were not agents of the State. Nor has Burt shown that any witnesses or evidence were lost as a result of the delay in her trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b632  We hold that Burt\u2019s right to speedy trial was not denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u00b633 The judgment and orders of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-8\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
