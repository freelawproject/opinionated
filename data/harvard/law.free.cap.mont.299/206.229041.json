We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues raised and discussed in Fedder\u2019s briefs as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by permitting Farmers Plant Aid, Inc., and Casey Smith to prosecute this fraudulent conveyance action after transferor John Foss filed a bankruptcy petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">\u00b64 2. Was it necessary that the plaintiffs establish that they had a lien or security interest in the property before they brought this action for fraudulent conveyance?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">\u00b65 3. Did the court err in finding that Fedder knew Foss was indebted to Farmers Plant Aid, Inc., and Smith on November 29,1989, when Foss transferred his interest in their joint property to her?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">\u00b66 4.

Did the court err by concluding that a fraudulent conveyance had occurred as opposed to a preference?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-19\">\u00b68 6. Did the court err by concluding that a fraudulent conveyance had occurred even though there was no proof of the value of the property transferred?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-21\">\u00b69 7. Did the court err in entering certain other conclusions of law?</p>\n<p id=\"ASu\">\u00b610 Casey Smith and Farmers Plant Aid, Inc., lease mineral rights to real property in Ravalli County, Montana, for purposes of extracting peat from that land. They have an outstanding October 1993 default judgment against John Foss for $118,343.59 plus interest and costs for Foss\u2019s intentional interference with their access to the peat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>resources and his assault upon Smith with a rifle on September 25, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b611 Smith and Plant Aid brought this action pursuant to the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, \u00a7\u00a7 31-2-301 through -325, MCA (1989), to collect on their judgment against Foss. They allege that Foss fraudulently conveyed his forty-four percent interest in certain Ravalli County real property to his then-wife Connie Fedder in November of 1989, for consideration of $1. Following the conveyance, Fedder held an eighty-eight percent interest in the property and Foss\u2019s children from a previous marriage held a twelve percent interest. The marriage of Foss and Fedder was dissolved in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b6 12 Smith and Plant Aid originally named both Foss and Fedder as defendants in this action. However, Foss filed for bankruptcy in September 1994, listing numerous creditors and no assets. He was eventually dropped as a defendant in this action. By stipulation, the parties submitted the case to the District Court based upon their briefs and the deposition testimony and exhibits filed. The court entered judgment in favor of Plant Aid and Smith, voiding the conveyance from Foss to Fedder and granting Plant Aid and Smith the right to levy execution upon the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err by permitting Farmers Plant Aid, Inc., and Casey Smith to prosecute this fraudulent conveyance action after transferor John Foss filed a bankruptcy petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u00b614 Fedder asserts that upon Foss\u2019s filing of a bankruptcy petition in September 1994, Foss\u2019s bankruptcy trustee acquired the right to avoid his pre-petition fraudulent conveyances. She asserts that fraudulent conveyance claims thus passed from individual creditors such as Smith and Plant Aid to Foss\u2019s bankruptcy trustee, and that Smith and Plant Aid thus lost their standing and right to pursue a fraudulent conveyance claim. Fedder cites cases to support her argument, but all of those cases deal with the loss of creditors\u2019 rights to pursue such proceedings <em>during the pendency of the bankruptcy. </em>That is not the situation presented in the present case. Here, the judgment was obtained after the completion of Foss\u2019s bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"ADt\">\u00b615  Section 524 (e) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that discharge of a debt of a debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity for such debt. Numerous cases have held that after the close of a bankruptcy, creditors are free to resume or commence a fraudulent conveyance action against the transferee. <em>E.g., Federal Deposit Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Corp. v. Davis </em>(4th Cir. 1984), 733 F.2d 1083, 1085 (\u201cOnce a bankruptcy case has been closed, creditors having unavoided liens on fraudulently conveyed property can pursue their state law remedies independently of the trustee in bankruptcy\u201d); <em>Kathy B. Enterprises, Inc. v. United States </em>(9th Cir. 1986), 779 F.2d 1413, 1415. Even where collection efforts may have occurred during the pendency of a bankruptcy, that is not a sufficient reason to set aside a subsequent judgment in favor of the creditor. <em>Kathy B., </em>779 F.2d at 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"A7V\">f 16 The record of Foss\u2019s bankruptcy case, a copy of which was filed with the District Court following this Court\u2019s remand for that purpose, establishes that Foss\u2019s bankruptcy trustee was appointed after this action was filed, on September 6, 1994. Fedder removed this action to federal court on grounds that it was related to the bankruptcy case. Upon motion of Smith and Plant Aid, however, the federal court remanded the case to state district court. The bankruptcy court and the trustee clearly had notice of this action during its pendency. An order releasing Foss from all dischargeable debts was entered on January 31, 1995, and the trustee was discharged and the bankruptcy case finally closed on November 27,1996. Judgment was not entered in the present case until several months later.</p>\n<p id=\"ALT\">\u00b6 17  We hold that the District Court did not err by granting judgment in this action after Foss\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding had been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b618 Was it necessary that the plaintiffs establish that they had a lien or security interest in the property before they brought this action for fraudulent conveyance?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b6 19 Fedder states that in order for a person to recover in a fraudulent conveyance action, that person must be a creditor. She asserts that neither Smith nor Plant Aid were creditors when they obtained the underlying judgment in this action. They were not creditors of Foss, who had received a bankruptcy discharge; they were not creditors of the bankrupt estate, with which they did not file a claim; and they were not her creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b620 Fedder\u2019s argument is based upon the faulty premise that this action is in essence a claim against Foss\u2019s bankruptcy estate. This is simply incorrect. There is no requirement in either state fraudulent conveyance law or the bankruptcy code which mandates that plaintiffs file a proof of claim in bankruptcy court to preserve their right to pursue a fraudulent conveyance action against a third-party trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>feree like Fedder. Fedder was not the bankrupt party and the plaintiffs are not attempting to share in a distribution of Foss\u2019s bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"ADT\">\u00b621  This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Cahill-Mooney Const. Co. v. Ayres </em>(1962), 140 Mont. 464, 373 P.2d 703, compels the conclusion that a party need not obtain a lien or security interest prior to filing a claim for fraudulent conveyance under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. In <em>Ayres, </em>the plaintiff creditor brought suit for collection on a debt and joined with it a claim to set aside fraudulent conveyances made by the debtor defendant to other co-defendants. The Court quoted with approval Chief Justice Cardozo of the New York Supreme Court, \u201cWe think the effect of these provisions [of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act] is to abrogate the ancient rule whereby a judgment and a lien were essential preliminaries to equitable relief against a fraudulent conveyance,\u201d and held that a creditor could join his action on a debt with an action to set aside a conveyance under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. <em>Ayres, </em>140 Mont, at 468 and 475, 373 P.2d at 705 and 709.</p>\n<p id=\"Az-\">\u00b622  Thus, the holding of <em>Ayres </em>specifically relieved creditors of the burden of obtaining a lien prior to bringing a Fraudulent Conveyance Act claim. In the present case, the plaintiffs had obtained their judgment against Foss in October 1993. We hold that they were under no obligation to take any further steps prior to the filing of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u00b623 Did the court err in finding that Connie Fedder knew Foss was indebted to Farmers Plant Aid, Inc., and Smith on November 29, 1989, when Foss transferred his interest in their joint property to her?</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\u00b624 Our standard of review of findings of fact, as discussed under this issue and under Issue 4 below, is whether the District Court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Whalen v. Taylor </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 293, 299, 925 P.2d 462, 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\u00b625 The above statement of this issue represents Fedder\u2019s restatement of portions of several of the court\u2019s findings; the court did not actually find that Fedder knew that Foss was indebted to Plant Aid and Smith when he transferred his property right to her. The relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>findings, which Fedder also challenges as not supported by substantial evidence, were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">6. On or about September 25,1989, John D. Foss committed an assault against Si Smith\u2019s successor in interest, Plaintiff Casey Smith herein, by pointing a rifle at him and threatening to shoot and kill him when Smith tried to enter the property under the mining rights of Plaintiff Farmers Plant Aid. At or near the same time, John D. Foss destroyed an access road and flooded the peat resource on the property in which Plaintiff Farmers Plant Aid had an interest in the mineral resource, thereby depriving Plaintiff Farmers Plant Aid of its right to mine peat and causing Farmers Plant Aid damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">25. Despite her protestations otherwise, this Court also finds that Connie Fedder had actual knowledge that John Foss had engaged in tortious conduct against Farmers Plant Aid. At her deposition in this matter, she testified that John\u2019s sister, Millicent Huggans, had hired John Foss to plow up the road used by Farmers Plant Aid to mine peat moss.... Moreover, it is evident that she was well aware of the continuing hostilities between members of the Foss family and Farmers Plant Aid and its agents spanning several decades and generations, as well as among the Foss family members themselves. In point of fact, and as found by this Court herein at Finding of Fact No. 12, Connie and John were at the time of the 1989 conveyance involved in a suit filed by other members of the Foss family claiming that Connie and John Foss had fraudulently obtained ownership of his elderly mother\u2019s 53% interest in the Foss family property, which also renders Connie\u2019s claims of ignorance regarding the on-going feuds highly suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Fedder\u2019s chief contention of error as to finding number 6 is that the finding is improperly based upon the contents of prior court actions. She asserts that this constitutes impermissible use of hearsay and does not comport with the purpose for which judicial notice exists. Fedder points out that none of the witnesses in the present case testified that Foss had destroyed an access road and flooded the peat resources on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b626 The plaintiffs filed as an exhibit a copy of the earlier default judgment against Foss in the intentional interference and assault action, along with the court\u2019s accompanying memorandum. The plaintiffs also filed as exhibits copies of 1985 District Court findings, conclusions, and an order prohibiting the Fosses, and specifically John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Foss, from \u201cinterfering or impeding in any manner the peat operations of Smith, his successors and assigns;\u201d and a 1990 order of the District Court finding Foss in contempt of court for deliberately interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 access to the peat resource on the Foss property.</p>\n<p id=\"Aga\">\u00b627  Our Rules of Evidence provide that a court may take judicial notice of \u201c[r]ecords of any court of this state or of any court of record of the United States or any court of record of any state of the United States.\u201d Rule 202(b)(6), M.R.Evid. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court acted properly in taking judicial notice of earlier court orders and findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b628 We next consider the court\u2019s finding number 25, regarding Fedder\u2019s knowledge of Foss\u2019s tortious conduct. Fedder\u2019s deposition testimony unquestionably establishes that she knew Foss had plowed up property on which the plaintiffs were conducting their peat mining activities and that Smith had threatened to sue Foss over the assault with the rifle. In that deposition, she also described the continuing hostilities between the Smith and Foss families as akin to the \u201cMartins and the McCoys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b629 We hold that the above two findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b630 Are certain other findings of fact clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b631 Fedder also challenges as unsupported the following finding made by the District Court concerning Fedder and Foss\u2019s actions after Foss conveyed his property interest to her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">21. However, they [Fedder and Foss] continued to represent to others that they both owned the property in question. Indeed, John and Connie continued to utilize the professional services of attorney Joseph Massman who approximately one year after entry of the Final Decree advised the public that he presently represented both Connie and John and that they were interested in selling \u201ctheir\u201d property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">This finding, says Fedder, is based \u201cpurely upon an unauthenticated hearsay letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">\u00b632 Our Rule on authentication states that \u201cthe requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Rule 901(a), M.R.Evid. The letter here in question, which was printed on attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Massman\u2019s letterhead paper, was attached to Massman\u2019s deposition as part of his file on Fedder and Foss\u2019s dissolution of marriage, which he produced for his deposition. We hold that the exhibit was properly-authenticated and supported the District Court\u2019s finding number 21, which was not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b633 Fedder also specifically challenges the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">24. Despite Connie\u2019s representation that John no longer works for her, John Foss continues to exert control over equipment located on the above-described real property. ... Thus, this Court concludes that Connie\u2019s representations that the 1989 conveyance was intended as her settlement in the dissolution proceedings, and that John Foss had no justifiable interest in the property following the conveyance, are suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Fedder asserts that the record does not support this finding concerning Foss\u2019s continued control over equipment on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b634 This finding is supported by Fedder\u2019s deposition. In that deposition, Fedder replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked whether Foss still lived with her. She then elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">The last he told me he was going over to Hamilton, take the equipment that he wanted to take, beat the shit out of what he wanted to beat the shit out of. And he didn\u2019t give a \u2014 we can\u2019t print that-what went on. He could not be arrested. He was a Foss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">That Foss continued to take and destroy equipment located on the property indicates his continued control over the equipment. We hold that the record supports the court\u2019s finding that Foss continued to exercise control over equipment, which finding was not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Issue 5</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u00b635 Did the court err by concluding that a fraudulent conveyance had occurred as opposed to a preference?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">\u00b636 Our standard of review of a District Court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470,474,803 P.2d 601,603. We apply that standard in considering this and the remaining issues discussed in relation to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AXm\">\u00b637  A debtor may pay one creditor in preference to another or may give one creditor security for the payment of his demand in preference to another. Section 31-2-104, MCA. Fedder argues that Foss\u2019s transfer of title to her was in effect, a preference in recognition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>she would be entitled to maintenance or support from him when they dissolved their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"AC6\">\u00b638  At the time of the November 1989 conveyance, however, Fedder and Foss were still married and their dissolution action was not yet pending. The property transfer was not part of the dissolution, but preceded it. Additionally, Fedder has produced no evidence that Foss owed her any other obligation at the time of the conveyance. Thus, we conclude that Fedder has not established that she was a creditor of Foss at the tim e of his property conveyance to her for purposes of preferences to creditors as allowed under \u00a7 31-2-104, MCA. \u00b639 More importantly, Fedder did not raise this argument as an affirmative defense to the complaint, nor did she raise it in her proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. We will not hold the District Court in error based on an argument not raised before it. <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Issue 6</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b640 Did the court err by concluding that a fraudulent conveyance had occurred even though there was no proof of the value of the property transferred?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b641 Fedder points out that the essence of a fraudulent conveyance is that property is transferred to another without fair consideration. <em>See </em>\u00a7 31-2-311, MCA (1989). She states that the District Court erred in making no findings on whether the transfer from Foss to her was supported by fair consideration. She also asserts that the court\u2019s conclusion that Foss was rendered insolvent by the conveyance of his interest in the property was not supported by sufficient evidence, in that there was no evidence of Foss\u2019s existing debts and that Foss had no existing debt to the plaintiffs at the time he conveyed his property to her.</p>\n<p id=\"AoP\">\u00b642  Lack of evidence of fair market value of Foss\u2019s interest is irrelevant under well-established Montana authority. In <em>Montana Ass\u2019n of Credit Mgmt. v. Hergert </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 442, 452, 593 P.2d 1059, 1064, this Court set forth the standard for determining whether fair consideration was given for purposes of determining whether a conveyance was fraudulent: \u201ca consideration that is merely good and valuable will not support a conveyance which will render the grantor insolvent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00b643 The District Court found, and Fedder does not contest, that Foss was rendered insolvent by his transfer to her of his interest in the real property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">[Fallowing the conveyance of his interest in the subject real property to Connie, John D. Foss did not have assets with a present fair salable value sufficient to pay his probable liability on his existing debts as they became absolute and matured. Connie testified that John rarely, if ever, worked and that at the time of the November 29,1989 conveyance, John Foss had no other assets to his name other than the subject property.... Connie also testified that John Foss had no money or clothes following the transfer.... She testified that other than his interest in the ranch, John Foss had no other property including personal property.... Connie further testified that John Foss had bad debts at the time of the conveyance.... Thus, by Connie\u2019s own admission, this Court finds that the November 29,1989 conveyance to Connie rendered John Foss insolvent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A77\">The District Court noted that the consideration listed in the agreement by which Foss conveyed his interest in the property to Fedder was $1. The court also noted the copies of Realtor listing agreements appended to Fedder\u2019s deposition in which Fedder listed the property for sale in 1994 for $1,260,000 and in 1995 for $700,000.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae-\">\u00b644  In light of the facts established in this case and the rule of law set forth in <em>Hergert, </em>we conclude that it was not necessary that the plaintiffs establish the present value of the property interest which Foss conveyed to Fedder, or that Foss had an existing debt to them at the time he conveyed his property interest to Fedder. We hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that a fraudulent conveyance had occurred even though there was no proof of the present value of the property transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Issue 7</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b645 Did the court err in entering certain other conclusions of law?</p>\n<p id=\"AYu\">\u00b646 Fedder argues that the conclusion that \u201cJohn and Connie\u2019s retention and use of the same lawyer, one year after their divorce, for the purpose of marketing \u2018their\u2019 property, contributes to the conclusion that John\u2019s transfer was illusory and occurred in name only\u201d is improperly based solely upon an unauthenticated letter from Massman and that the court improperly took judicial notice, in reaching its conclusions, of court orders and judgments in other cases. We have ruled above that the letter from Massman was properly considered as part of the record upon which it was stipulated that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>should enter its judgment. We now hold that the court\u2019s conclusion based upon that letter was correct. Similarly, we have ruled above that the court did not err in taking judicial notice of court orders and judgments in this case and in others previously before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b647 Fedder asserts that the court erred in concluding that at the time of the conveyance to Fedder, Foss was involved in protracted pending litigation and was under the threat of litigation by Smith and Plant Aid; that on the day of the conveyance, Foss attended a hearing on an order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court for violating an earlier restraining order; and that he was aware or should have been aware that litigation might ensue from his tortious assault of Smith and his other acts interfering with the peat mining operation over the years. Again, all of these conclusions are correct based upon the record provided to the District Court and upon which it based its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b648 Fedder argues that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that she had knowledge of the fraud at the time of the conveyance; and that even if the plaintiffs are entitled to disregard the conveyance, they cannot do so without compensating her for the support she gave up by entering into the transaction with Foss in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b649 The conclusion that Fedder had knowledge of the fraud at the time of the conveyance is based upon the court\u2019s conclusions that Fedder knew that Foss had committed or been accused of committing tortious conduct against Plant Aid; upon the court\u2019s unchallenged finding that Foss continued to live on the property following the conveyance; and on the finding which we have affirmed above that Fedder knew that Foss had bad debts and no other assets following the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b650 We find completely without merit the argument that even if the plaintiffs are entitled to disregard the conveyance, they cannot do so without compensating Fedder for the support she gave up by entering into the transaction with Foss. Her claim for maintenance was never litigated, let alone reduced to judgment. Further, that after-the-fact claim did not constitute consideration for Foss\u2019s interest in the property. We note that absent other events, Fedder will retain her pre-fraudulent conveyance interest in forty-four percent of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b651 Fedder summarily argues that the court erred in failing to rule on her objections to exhibits offered by the plaintiffs. The exhibits as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>to which she raised specific objection in her briefs have been discussed above. Absent any argument to the contrary, we conclude that any error in the court\u2019s failure to rule on the remaining objections is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b652 Finally, in her supplemental brief, Fedder argues that she was entitled to a jury trial. She did not raise this issue in her initial brief on appeal. The supplemental briefs were allowed following this Court\u2019s remand of this case to the District Court for the limited purpose of allowing that court to develop the record and to enter written findings, conclusions, and an order as to whether the plaintiffs were entitled to bring this action, as discussed under Issues 1 and 2. Because the jury trial issue was not timely raised on appeal, we decline to consider it. See EBI/ <em>Orion Group v. Blythe </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 50, 56, 931 P.2d 38, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b653 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
