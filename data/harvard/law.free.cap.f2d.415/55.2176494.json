After a non-jury trial, the District Court granted the plaintiff, Advance Business Systems and Supply Company, both treble damages of $50,142 and injunctive relief based on certain of the claimed antitrust violations. SCM appeals from the judgment of liability and in addition challenges as excessive the award of attorneys\u2019 fees of $35,875. Advance cross-appeals, contending that the District Court erred in failing to find additional antitrust violations and in failing to award damages claimed by the plaintiff in respect to them. Because both parties are appealing from the judgment of the District Court, they will, for clarity, be referred to in the opinion as plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">Defendant SCM is a New York corporation which manufactures and sells, among other products, office copying machines and the paper and other supplies used in the machines. Advance, the plaintiff, is a Maryland corporation formed in 1964 to distribute paper and supplies for copy machines, primarily in the Baltimore area. It is a franchised dealer for Nashua Corporation, a manufacturer and distributor of such paper and supplies on a nationwide basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">As the findings of the District Court indicate, the office copying machine market is actively competitive, with customers changing readily from one copier to another. Manufacturers and distributors supply many different models of copy machines using a variety of copying processes. Xerox Corporation, the industry leader, markets the only machines using the \u201cindirect electrostatic process\u201d ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 1967 it controlled approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>mately 60% of the office copying market in the United States. SCM, utilizing the direct electrostatic process in its copiers, has about 3% of the market, measured either by the number of machines sold or rented or by the total number of copies made annually on the several brands of machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Since the sale of supplies, particularly paper, is often more profitable than the sale or rental of the machines themselves, competition is especially sharp in this branch of the copying industry. SCM copiers, employing the direct electrostatic process, will make copies only on special coated paper, sold by SCM and other manufacturers and distributors, including the plaintiff. In 1967, SCM sold about 13% of all copies made on direct electrostatic machines; a number of other manufacturers of direct electrostatic copying equipment, including Den-nison and Bruning, had larger shares of the market. SCM\u2019s share of the market has been shrinking since 1964, when it sold approximately 37 % of all direct electrostatic copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">SCM and other manufacturers make copy machines available on three alternative bases: purchase, rental, or lease from an independent leasing company. Customers who rent machines generally pay on a \u201cmachine click\u201d or \u201ccopy service\u201d basis, the rental varying with the number of copies actually made on the particular machine. Copying supplies for use with the machines are sold both by machine manufacturers and by paper manufacturers which, like Nashua Corporation, produce coated paper designed for use in the various machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">SCM sells most of the supplies used with SCM copiers, but since 1965 it has faced increasing competition in this area, particularly from Nashua Corporation and its dealers, including the plaintiff. The District Court found that approximately 90% of the competition SCM encountered in the sale of electrostatic paper in Maryland was from Nashua.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">In the present litigation, Advance challenges a number of SCM\u2019s practices in the copy supply market as forbidden under the antitrust laws. The complaint alleged that SCM by various actions unreasonably restrained trade; that it attempted to monopolize and conspired to monopolize trade in the manufacture and sale of electrostatic copying supplies; and that it impermissibly tied sales of its electrostatic copying paper to its machines, other supplies, service contracts, and warranties. The District Court found that SCM had violated the antitrust laws in three respects, all involving tying arrangements made illegal either by section 3 of the Clayton Act or by section 1 of the Sherman Act. SCM contests that judgment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">I. <em>Tying Arrangements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Tying arrangements may be defined as agreements under which the vendor will sell one product only if the purchaser agrees to buy another product as well. As a result, competition is curbed in two ways. First, the buyer is prevented from seeking alternative sources of supply for the tied product; second, competing suppliers of the tied product are foreclosed from that part of the market which is subject to the tying arrangement. Whenever a tie-in is successful, competition is inevitably curtailed; moreover, tie-ins can rarely be justified for they \u201cserve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition.\u201d Standard Oil Company of Cal. &amp; Standard Stations v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 305-306, 69 S.Ct. 1051, 1058, 93 L.Ed. 1371 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">For these reasons, tie-ins have been held illegal under both section 3 of the Clayton Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and section 1 of the Sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>man Act. Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 514, 2 L.Ed. 2d 545 (1958) (\u00a7 1); International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 68 S.Ct. 12, 92 L.Ed. 20 (1947) (\u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3); International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S. 131, 56 S.Ct. 701, 80 L.Ed. 1085 (1936) (\u00a7 3). The standards of illegality under the two statutes are not identical, however, and therefore the tying practices of SCM found illegal by the District Court must be examined separately in light of the particular statute applicable to each specific arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Two of the three challenged practices to be discussed involve tie-ins between rented SCM machines and SCM supplies and are therefore covered by the Clayton Act, which applies only to tie-ins involving \u201cgoods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 14. In the third arrangement, however the sale of SCM paper is tied to SCM service contracts, which do not come within the terms of the Clayton Act. To establish liability, the latter practice must, therefore, be shown to be \u201cunreasonable\u201d under section 1 of the Sherman Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">A. <em>The Clayton Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALu\">In section 3 of the Clayton Act, Congress singled out tying arrangements and \u201cauthoritatively determined that those practices are detrimental where their effect may be to lessen competition.\u201d Standard Oil Co. of Cal. &amp; Standard Stations v. United States, 337 U.S. 293 at 311, 69 S.Ct. 1051 at 1060. If a transaction may be characterized as a tie-in between items covered by the Clayton Act, therefore, it is automatically illegal under section 3 whenever \u201ca substantial volume of commerce in the \u2018tied\u2019 product is restrained.\u201d Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 608, 73 S.Ct. 872, 97 L.Ed. 1277 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">1. <em>The Model 55</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">The first antitrust violation found by the District Court in the present case involved SCM\u2019s practice of marketing its Model 55 copier solely on a \u201ccopy service\u201d basis. Under this plan, the customer pays a single charge based on the number of copies run on the machine as recorded by a meter, and supplies and service are included in the single charge. Since the plan forecloses all competition for supplies to be used with Model 55, the District Court concluded that it was illegal \u201cunless and until Model 55 is also offered for rental on a reasonable basis without the requirement that SCM paper be purchased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">On appeal, SCM urges that this conclusion is erroneous in four respects. First, it contends that the \u201ccopy service\u201d plan is not illegal because each of its components \u2014 machine and paper \u2014 is separately available, and \u201cwhere the buyer is free to take either product by itself there is no tying problem even though the seller may also offer the two items as a unit at a single price.\u201d Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518, n. 4 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\"> Although Model 55 was originally distributed only on a copy service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>basis, the District Court found that since March 1, 1967, the machine has also been offered separately for sale and lease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Purchase of a copying machine for $4250, however, is clearly not the economic equivalent of rental at a charge of approximately $.035 per copy. The lease arrangement which SCM suggests as a theoretical alternative to rental (there is no indication in the record that a Model 55 has in fact ever been leased) envisages an intermediate sale of the machine by SCM to an independent leasing company, which in turn leases the machine to the customer. The record is devoid of evidence that such a leasing arrangement represents a reasonable alternative to direct rental by SCM to the user of Model 55, in respect to price, machine maintenance and service, or practical availability. Consequently, Model 55 and SCM supplies cannot realistically be regarded as separately available to SCM\u2019s customers. Tie-ins are non-coercive, and therefore legal, only if the components are separately available to the customer on a bais as favorable as the tie-in arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"> In its next argument, SCM asserts that the copy service tie-in is not illegal because the District Court did not find that SCM had any economic power over the tying product, the Model 55 copier. In so aguing, however, SCM ignores the distinction between standards of illegality under the Clayton Act and those established by the Sherman Act. In Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 608-609, 73 S.Ct. 872, 880 (1953), the Supreme Court clearly pointed out the difference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">When the seller enjoys a monopolistic position in the market for the \u201ctying\u201d product, <em>or </em>if a substantial volume of commerce in the \u201ctied\u201d product is restrained, a tying arrangement violates the narrower standards expressed in \u00a7 3 of the Clayton Act because from either factor the requisite potential lessening of competition is inferred. And because for even a lawful monopolist it is \u201cunreasonable, <em>per se, </em>to foreclose competitors from any substantial market,\u201d a tying arrangement is banned by \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act when <em>both </em>conditions are met. (Emphasis in the original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Congress singled out tie-ins for special treatment in the Clayton Act upon the generally accepted view that they rarely have any function other than suppression of competition. For the same reason, a seller\u2019s successful imposition of a tying arrangement on a substantial amount of commerce may be taken as proof of his economic power over the tying product. See Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 89 S.Ct. 1252, 22 L.Ed.2d 495 (1969); Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 514 (1958). The Clayton Act therefore requires no separate showing of economic dominance where a tying arrangement affects sufficient commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">SCM further argues, however, that Advance has not shown that substantial commerce in the tied product \u2014 copying supplies \u2014 is restrained by the arrangement. At trial, Advance showed only that in the course of selling its own supplies in the Baltimore area, it \u201cdiscovered\u201d the Model 55 in eight locations, and SCM contends that this cannot support the District Court\u2019s finding that \u201ca not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product is affected\u201d by the copy service plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">SCM misconstrues the District Court\u2019s finding, which is not limited to foreclosure of that portion of the market in which the plaintiff and defendant are actual competitors. As the Supreme Court recently said in Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 502, 89 S.Ct. 1252, 1258 (April 7, 1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">Congress has encouraged private antitrust litigation not merely to compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>sate those who have been directly injured but also to vindicate the important public interest in free competition, [citation omitted] For purposes of determining whether the amount of commerce foreclosed is too insubstantial to warrant prohibition of the practice, therefore, <em>the relevant figure is the total volume of sales tied by the sales policy under challenge, not the portion of this total accounted for by the particular plaintiff who brings suit. </em>(Emphasis added.) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOF\">In the present case, the District Court found that in 1966 SCM sold approximately 200 million sheets of paper to be used with Model 55\u2019s under copy service. At a copy service charge of approximately $.035 a copy, the aggregate revenue from this source was $7,000,000. Clearly this represents a substantial volume of commerce. See Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., <em>supra </em>(almost $200,000 not insubstantial) ; International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 68 S.Ct. 12, 92 L.Ed. 20 (1947) ($500,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">SCM\u2019s final contention with respect to the copy service plan is that Advance did not demonstrate that it was harmed or threatened with harm by the copy service plan. Such a showing is a prerequisite to a private antitrust action seeking treble damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act or injunctive relief under section 16.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court, however, found that Advance suffered $16,714 in single damages as a result of SCM\u2019s restrictive practices, and there is ample support in the record for this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Although the court did not segregate the damages or assign particular dollar losses to each of SCM\u2019s different restrictive practices, it did specifically find a \u201cprobable loss of some sales of paper for use with the few Model 55 machines proved to have been in copy service in Baltimore.\u201d The court further concluded that \u201cSCM\u2019s copy service plan denied plaintiff the opportunity to compete for this business.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s burden of proving the fact of damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act is satisfied by the showing of <em>some </em>damage arising from a given antitrust violation ; further proof is relevant only to the amount, and not the fact of damage. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969). Since the plaintiff\u2019s total exclusion from the Model 55 supply market constitutes \u201cthreatened\u201d as well as past damage, the court\u2019s grant of injunctive relief was justified under section 16 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">2. <em>Other Rental Agreements</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANM\">The District Court also found that SCM illegally imposed tying arrangements on direct lessees of its other copier models, Models 33, 44, 66, and 88, by threatening to cancel the rental agreements and falsely representing that competitive supplies used by the lessees were damaging the rented machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">SCM\u2019s rental agreements for copiers other than Model 55 include a provision that \u201csupplies which may cause damage or deterioration will not be used in the machines.\u201d We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that such a clause is itself not unreasonable, since it is designed to avoid damage to the lessor\u2019s property. International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 397, 68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>S.Ct. 12 (1947). An illegal tying arrangement may be shown to exist, however, even where it is not imposed by means of an express contractual provision. The presence of the illegal condition may be inferred from an extrinsic course of conduct supplementing the written contract. Osborn v. Sinclair Refining Co., 286 F.2d 832 (4th Cir. 1960); McElhenney v. Western Auto Supply Co., 269 F.2d 332 (4th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In the present case, the District Court found that through persistent and deliberate misrepresentations, sabotage, and threats of cancellation, SCM effectively used the \u201cdamage or deterioration\u201d clause in the rental agreement to coerce lessees to use only SCM supplies in their rental machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Although, as the court specifically found, Nashua paper is no more likely than SCM paper to damage SCM machines, SCM representatives informed customers that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">the use of Nashua supplies would cause service calls and interrupt the continuous operation of their SCM machines * * * [and they did so] for the purpose of inducing them to cease dealing or to refrain from dealing with the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Specific instances of misconduct by SCM representatives were shown at trial and accepted by the trial judge as part of a consistent course of conduct by SCM:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">It was the policy of defendant from at least as early as August of 1965 and continuing through until the date of trial to threaten the cancellation of rental agreements with customers who used competitive supplies in their SCM machines. This policy was communicated to SCM machine lessees, who were customers and prospective customers of competitive suppliers, including the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">The District Court concluded that the plaintiff had been damaged by the illegal tying arrangement imposed as a result of SCM\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">SCM maintains that an illegal tie-in contract cannot properly be inferred from its conduct with respect to the rental agreements. Reiterating arguments raised in the copy service context, SCM asserts that it had no economic power over the tying product, the rented machines, and that in any event there could be no tie-in where the machines and supplies could be <em>purchased </em>separately. As we have explained in the earlier context, purchase is not the economic equivalent of rental, and no showing of economic power is required to establish a violation of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">SCM also insists that the court could not determine that an illegal tying arrangement had been imposed by SCM in light of its own finding that no rental agreements in Maryland were actually terminated by SCM because of a customer\u2019s use of competitive supplies. The fact that an agreement is leniently administered, however, does not necessarily lessen, and certainly does not eliminate, its restrictive effect on competition. The overhanging threat of enforcement is ever present, and implied agreements, like express contracts, may be \u201cheld over the heads of vendees [and] deny defendant\u2019s competitors access to the fenced-off market on the same terms as the defendant.\u201d Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 12, 78 S.Ct. 514, 521 (1958); International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 398, 68 S.Ct. 12 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">B. <em>The Sherman Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">The third antitrust violation found by the District Court pertains to an arrangement by which SCM tied its service contracts to the sale of SCM paper and supplies. Section 3 of the Clayton Act is not applicable when either the tying or tied product is a service, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the court\u2019s conclusion that the tie-in was illegal was based on section 1 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">SCM provides service for SCM machines in several ways. For customers not already receiving free service contracted for under rental and copy service programs, or under the terms of sale guarantees, service is available on either a time and material basis or under a service maintenance contract. Under the service maintenance contract, SCM agrees to furnish unlimited service for the contract\u2019s duration, to replace most defective parts without charge, and to make regular inspections, all for a single annual fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Service is extended on a time and material basis whether or not a customer is using SCM supplies with his SCM machine. Similarly, before April 15, 1963, the flat fee service contract contained no restrictions relating to the use of competitive supplies. Since then the contract has been amended and at present contains the following two clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">Because SCM photocopy machines are designed to give excellent performance with SCM photocopy supplies, including Microstatic Dispersant, Re-plenisher, and Electrostatic Copy Paper, SCM reserves the right to suspend this agreement as to any machines in which other suppliers\u2019 paper or other supplies have been used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">This agreement shall not apply to any repairs made necessary by the use in SCM photocopy machines of dispersant, replenisher, electrostatic copy paper or other photocopy supplies made by other than SCM and not approved by SCM for use in SCM equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Notably, SCM has never approved any competitive paper for use in SCM machines, although, as the District Court found, SCM officials know that Nashua paper is \u201csafe and as effective as SCM paper for such use.\u201d In effect, therefore, the service contract is tied to the sale of SCM supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Under the Sherman Act, tying arrangements are <em>per se </em>illegal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">whenever a party has sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product <em>and </em>a \u201cnot insubstantial\u201d amount of interstate commerce is affected. (Emphasis added.) Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 499, 89 S.Ct. 1252, 1256 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">In the present case, the District Court concluded that the \u201ccompetitive supplies\u201d clauses in the service contract gave rise to a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sherman Act, and we are in agreement with that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">In one respect, however, we find the court\u2019s reasoning inconsistent with both the law and its own general conclusion as to the illegality of SCM\u2019s conduct in connection with the service contracts. In analyzing SCM\u2019s practices, the District Court correctly decided that a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act occurred when SCM employees utilized the competitive supplies provisions in the service contract to coerce customers to use only SCM supplies. Our only disagreement with the court arises from its conclusion that the restrictive provisions of the service contract were not invalid on their face. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-15\">The antitrust laws do not require SCM to furnish service at a flat rate under its service agreement- when other than SCM supplies are used, provided SCM is willing to furnish service in such cases at a fair rate on a time and material basis. But the antitrust laws do not allow SCM to misrepresent the effect of the agreement or the reasons for malfunctioning of the machines as part of a plan to force customers to abandon the use of competing supplies which do not damage the machine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">In antitrust terms, the judgment that the restrictive clauses are themselves reasonable is not warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>by the contract language prohibiting use of competitive supplies. The court specifically concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">SCM was legally entitled to cancel the flat rate service agreement unless SCM supplies were used, provided SCM was willing, as it was, to offer service at a reasonable price on a time and material basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The misrepresentations, sabotage, and threats of cancellation by SCM employees, which the court describes, were intended to disparage competitive supplies and thereby induce customers to use only SCM supplies. As antitrust law provides and as the court properly concluded, the imposition of such a condition is illegal. However, the tying arrangement is no less invalid when it is written into a formal contract than when it is imposed by means of coercive or fraudulent practices. The court\u2019s reasoning relative to SCM\u2019s informal practices is equally applicable to the contract clauses themselves. We have here both illegally restrictive contract language and conduct designed to enforce the illegal restrictions \u2014 all in violation of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u25a0 In its cross-appeal, Advance presents arguments for finding the cancellation and repairs clauses unreasonable as written. The plaintiff asserts that the clauses, which clearly tie the service contract to the sale of SCM supplies, were not motivated by legitimate reasons, such as the difficulty of servicing machines which use unfamiliar supplies, but were adopted and imposed on the customer solely for anti-competitive purposes. Therefore, asserts Advance, the clauses themselves are illegal, for the accepted principle is that tying arrangements \u201cserve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition,\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">such nonanticompetitive purposes as these arrangements have been asserted to possess can be adequately accomplished by other means much less inimical to competition. Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518 n. 5 (1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Where, as here, the seller establishes no business reason for imposing the tying arrangement, Advance argues that the court must find it illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Advance is correct in claim-in that SCM has failed to establish a legitimate reason for the tying clauses. The District Court found significance in the fact that they were added to the contract at the insistence of the sales department rather than the service department. Accordingly, it concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVO\">the competitive supplies clauses, authorized by SCM\u2019s national sales department, were designed to be used as a lever to coerce customers to use only SCM supplies. The service agreement was actively and intentionally used for that purpose by field personnel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Use of tying arrangements as an anti-competitive device is the very behavior which the antitrust law of tie-ins is designed to prevent. Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 8, 78 S.Ct. 514 (1958). Therefore, the District Court\u2019s reasoning that the service contract arrangement is per <em>se </em>illegal under the Sherman Act applies to the contract clauses themselves as well as to the coercive conduct of SCM employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">SCM asserts, however, that the flat fee service arrangement cannot give rise to a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sherman Act because there is no showing that SCM has \u201csufficient economic power with respect to the tying product,\u201d a 'necessary element of <em>per se </em>illegality. It thus challenges the District Court\u2019s finding that SCM had \u201csufficient economic power to permit it to use its * * * agreements * * * as tying products or vehicles to coerce the sale of paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">Although it is impossible to state with precision a general rule as to what constitutes \u201csufficient economic power over the tying product\u201d to render a tie-in illegal, it is clear that no actual economic dominance need be shown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\">Even absent a showing of market dominance, the crucial economic power may be inferred from the tying product\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>desirability to consumers or from uniqueness in its attributes. United States v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 83 S.Ct. 97, 9 L.Ed.2d 11 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG1\">Some courts and commentators have assumed that at present there is no real distinction between the standards of the Clayton Act and the Sherman Act, and that if a tying arrangement is successfully imposed on a \u201cnot insubstantial\u201d amount of commerce, a violation of both statutes results.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfF\">In its most recent pronouncement on tying arrangements under the Sherman Act, the Supreme Court comes close to adopting this position.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 503-504, 89 S.Ct. 1252, 1258 (1969), the Court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADB\">These decisions rejecting the need for proof of truly dominant power over the tying product have all been based on a recognition that because tying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose that cannot be achieved in some less restrictive way, the presence of any appreciable restraint on competition provides a sufficient reason for invalidating the tie. Such appreciable restraints result whenever the seller can exert some power over some of the buyers in the market, even if his power is not complete over them and over all other buyers in the market. * * * <em>Accordingly, the proper focus of concern is whether the seller has the power to raise price, or impose other burdensome terms such as a tie-in, with </em>re-<em>sped to any appreciable number of buyers within the market. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"as-dedup-0\">In analyzing the facts of <em>Fortner </em>itself, however, the Court went beyond a simple inquiry into the success or failure of the tying arrangement to assess the \u201cspecial economic power\u201d of the defendant and the \u201cuniqueness\u201d of the tying product.</p>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">The Court\u2019s approach in <em>Fortner </em>indicates that there are situations in which the mere showing of a tie-in\u2019s success may be an inadequate basis from which to infer the seller\u2019s control over the tying product. In <em>Fortner </em>itself, the plaintiff in the antitrust suit was the only buyer subject to the challenged tying arrangement. The lower court reasoned that, in the circumstances, the plaintiff\u2019s acquiescence in the arrangement was not sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s \u201ceconomic control with respect to buyers generally.\u201d 394 U.S. at 499, 89 S.Ct. at 1256. Since the plaintiff had not shown the defendant\u2019s power over the tying product in any other way, the trial court there concluded that there was no illegal tie-in.</p>\n<p id=\"AGp\">Although the Supreme Court reversed the lower court, it recognized the validity of its reasoning that no inference could be drawn from a single buyer\u2019s acceptance of the tie-in. The Court therefore rested its finding that the seller had sufficient power over the tying product on a factual assessment of the product\u2019s \u201cuniqueness\u201d and \u201cdesirability\u201d rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>than on mere success in imposing the tie-in.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Moreover, <em>Fortner </em>suggests that even where an \u201cappreciable number of buyers\u201d are involved, the effectiveness of a tie-in may not always' show' the seller\u2019s economic power because it is possible that some tie-ins serve \u201clegitimate business purposes.\u201d 394 U.S. at 506, 89 S.Ct. 1252. Although adjudicated tie-in.cases and scattered dicta suggest that, there are only a few such legitimate purposes,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> their existence precludes reliance on a flat rule which would make all successful tie-in illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under <em>Fortner, </em>therefore, unless the defendant can show legitimate business reasons for a tie-in,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the \u201csufficient economic power\u201d test of <em>per se </em>illegality is satisfied when it appears that the seller has the power to \u201cimpose other burdensome terms such as a tie-in, with respect to any appreciable number of buyers within the market.\u201d 394 U.S. at 504, 89 S.Ct. at 1259. This is not a new standard, for the Court has previously recognized that extensive imposition of a tie-in may sufficiently indicate a seller\u2019s economic control over the tying product, at least when \u201cno other explanation has been offered for the existence of these restraints.\u201d Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 8, 78 S.Ct. 514, 519 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">In the case before us, the District Court found that the tying arrangement was imposed to increase sales rather than to serve a legitimate purpose srfch as the preservation of good will or the protection of a new industry. The District Court\u2019s well-supported, extensive and clear-cut findings of sabotage, misrepresentation, and threats of cancellation underline the fact that the clauses in the service contract were an integral part of a pattern of anticompetitive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The District Court\u2019s findings that SCM imposed the service contract tying arrangement in order to coerce customers to use only SCM supplies effectively rule out the possibility of any \u201clegitimate business purpose\u201d for the tie-in. The Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in the <em>Northern Pacific </em>case is therefore applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">So far as the [defendant] was concerned its purpose obviously was to fence out competitors, to stifle competition. While this may have been exceedingly beneficial to its business, it is the very type of thing the Sherman Act condemns. In short, we are convinced that the essential prerequisites for treating the defendant\u2019s tying ar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>rangments as unreasonable <em>\u201cper se\u201d </em>were conclusively established below and that the defendant has offered to prove nothing there or here which would alter this conclusion. 356 U.S. at 8, 78 S.Ct. at 519.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">SCM\u2019s service agreement, as written, explicitly prescribes a tying condition. No acceptable business purpose underlies this condition, but, as the District Court found, it was incorporated in the contract only to suppress competition in copying supplies. Acquiescence in the burdensome term by an appreciable number of customers gives rise to an inference that SCM had \u201csome power over some buyers\u201d in the market.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, the tying arrangement is <em>per se </em>illegal under section 1 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">II. <em>Other Antitrust Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\"> In its cross-appeal, Advance complains of error in the District Court\u2019s failure to find further antitrust violations arising from SCM\u2019s behavior in the office copy supply market. The court concluded that neither the <em>sale </em>of SCM machines nor the guaranty accompanying such sales had been conditioned on the purchase of SCM supplies, and the record fully supports this conclusion. The court did find that during 1964 the sale of paper had been tied to the sale of toner used in the copying machines. However, the two items are at present sold separately at reasonable prices, and the court held that regardless of any damage that may have been suffered by others, the plaintiff showed no damage from the earlier tie-in. We find no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Advance also alleged in its complaint that SCM attempted to monopolize and conspired to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of paper for its copying machines, in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act. The court concluded that SCM had not attempted to monopolize the relevant submarket \u2014 sale of coated paper for all \u201cdirect\u201d electrostatic copiers; SCM sells paper only for use in SCM machines. The court properly held that paper for use in SCM machines is not a relevant market or sub-market, since all \u201cdirect\u201d electrostatic copiers are reasonably interchangeable. United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966); United States v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 351 U.S. 377, 76 S.Ct. 994, 100 L.Ed. 1264 (1956). We agree with these conclusions in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">III. <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">The District Court assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages arising from SCM\u2019s illegal tying arrangements at $16,714. Under the statute, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, the damages were trebled. The damages were primarily based on costs incurred by Advance in mitigating the effect of SCM\u2019s restrictive practices, and were described by the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">All factors considered, the Court has concluded that the fair measure of damages to plaintiff in this case is the reasonable cost of furnishing service to those customers of plaintiff who purchased paper and other supplies for use in SCM machines, plus the value to plaintiff of Elkins\u2019 [President of Advance] time spent in offsetting defendant\u2019s restrictive practices. The sum of those two items fairly covers plaintiff\u2019s actual damages, including the small loss of specific sales which plaintiff proved and the probable loss of some sales of paper for use with the few Model 55 machines proved to have been on copy service in Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4U\">The record satisfies us that the court\u2019s findings with respect to the damages actually awarded are not clearly erroneous. However, regarding one item of damages not awarded by the court, the loss of Commercial Credit business, its basic factual findings and our decision today concerning the service contract tie-in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>compel a modification of the damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">At trial, the plaintiff showed and the court affirmatively found that \u201cthe plaintiff was wrongfully deprived of the sales actually made by SCM to Commercial Credit.\u201d These sales of paper and supplies were lost because SCM threatened to cancel Commercial Credit\u2019s service contract if it continued to use .Nashua supplies sold by Advance. The court, concluding that by the terms of the contract \u201cSCM was legally entitled to cancel the flat rate service agreement unless SCM supplies were used\u201d and therefore that the threat to cancel was not an antitrust violation, awarded no damages for the lost sales. Our decision, as set forth above, that it was error not to hold the cancellation clause itself illegal as a tie-in will require the award of additional damages for the lost Commercial Credit sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">IV. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Finally, both parties object to the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded by the court. The plaintiff requested fees of $60,000, and the court awarded $35,-875, subtracting that portion of the fees attributable to time spent in developing issues and items on which the plaintiff failed to prevail. The plaintiff complains that the award is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Defendant SCM, on the other hand, contends that the District Court abused its discretion by setting a fee in excess of the single damages award. Relying on a number of cases, SCM contends that attorneys\u2019 fees should not exceed a reasonable percentage of the single damage award. See Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Brookside Theatre Corp., 194 F.2d 846 (8th Cir. 1952); Milwaukee Towne Corp. v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., 190 F.2d 561 (7th Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In the cases cited, however, the damage awards were large, and a percentage limitation did not preclude substantial and compensatory attorneys\u2019 fees. When the damages recovered are relatively small, as in the present case, it is not necessarily an abuse of discretion to grant fees exceeding the amount of single damages. Courtesy Chevrolet, Inc. v. Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders, 393 F.2d 75 (9th Cir. 1968); Vol-asco Products v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 346 F.2d 661 (6th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">The plaintiff insists that the District Court underestimated the amount of work attributable to its successful claims, while the defendant asserts that very little legal time or effort was required in respect to the issues on which the plaintiff prevailed. It appears that in fixing the fees, the District Court considered a number of factors: the magnitude and complexity of the litigation, the time and labor spent, the standing of counsel at the bar, and other relevant considerations set out in its supplementary opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\"> The District Court is in the best position to evaluate the amount and quality of the work actually performed by plaintiff\u2019s attorneys and to determine what proportion of their time and labor was expended on issues with respect to which the plaintiff was ultimately awarded damages. In the circumstances, we cannot conclude that the' District Court abused its discretion in awarding fees of $35,875; but as the case must be remanded for modification of the judgment for the plaintiff to include the Commercial Credit item, the District Court will have an opportunity to augment the counsel fees if in its opinion the fees awarded were unduly diminished by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to prevail in that court as to the Commercial Credit claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">Affirmed and remanded for modification of the award of damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-13\">.
