The certificate of probable cause, required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, was issued by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-14\">Davis, on his plea of not guilty in the District Court for Douglas County, Nebraska, was convicted by a jury in 1965 of murder in the first degree (killing in the perpetration of a robbery). Neb. R.R.S. 1943 \u00a7 28-401 (1964). He received a life sentence. On appeal the judgment of conviction was affirmed. State v. Davis, 180 Neb. 830, 146 N.W.2d 220 (1966). Certiorari was denied. Erving v. Nebraska, 386 U.S. 998, 87 S.Ct. 1320, 18 L.Ed.2d 348 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-15\">The homicide and Davis\u2019 presence in an automobile near the scene of the crime are not in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-16\">In the federal proceeding, the state trial bill of exceptions (transcript) was introduced in evidence and the parties entered into a \u201cStipulation of Uncontroverted Facts.\u201d Some of the facts are stated in the opinion of the Nebraska Supreme Court and in that court\u2019s opinion in the companion appeal. State v. Erving, 180 Neb. 824, 146 N.W.2d 216 (1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 998, 87 S.Ct. 1320, 18 L.Ed.2d 348 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-17\">An Omaha bar was robbed shortly after 9 p. m. on August 18, 1964. In the course of the robbery the bartender was shot. He soon died of the wound he had received. Three blacks, Jerry Erving, Jr., Deborah Boston, and Nathaniel Hall, were present in the bar at the time and fled with money taken from the cash register and with bottles of liquor. Hall carried the gun and .shot the bartender. Davis, also a black, was the driver of the car by which Erving, Deborah, and Hall had arrived at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-18\">The automobile was parked outside the bar and pulled away just after the crime. The car was seen and was described to the police. An officer in a car passed it, attempted to follow it, and soon found it empty but with its lights on. In the automobile were a bottle of whisky bearing a marking used at the bar and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>bandanna or scarf similar to that worn by one of the participants in the robbery. The registration found in the automobile identified the car as belonging to Davis\u2019 father.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Officers went to the address listed in the registration. Inquiry there led them to the home of Davis\u2019 girl where, about 10 p. m., Davis was found. He was arrested and taken to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Upon arrival at the station Davis was interrogated, placed in a line-up, and booked. He was not turned over to the juvenile authorities. The next morning he was further questioned by two colored detectives. Davis\u2019 mother went to the station that day but her .request to see her son was refused. His father and uncle also were unsuccessful in getting to see him. The officers questioned Davis further that evening. One of them typed a summary of that interrogation. In this interview Davis admitted his involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">At 12:30 a. m. on August 20 a deputy county attorney and one of the detectives again questioned Davis. This was recorded by a court reporter. Davis once more confessed. His mother was allowed to see him on August 20 after the statement had been recorded and after he had been removed from the station to the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">Hall, Erving, Deborah, and Davis were charged with murder. Hall pleaded guilty. The others pleaded not guilty. On motion of the state the three cases were consolidated for trial pursuant to Neb. R.R.S. 1943 \u00a7 29-2002 (1964). Timely objections to the consolidation were made by all three and their respective motions for severance were denied. Each defendant had his own lawyer. Davis\u2019 counsel was retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">The trial resulted in an acquittal for Deborah and in convictions for Davis and Erving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">In the warden\u2019s response to the district court\u2019s order to show cause, it was suggested that Davis had failed to exhaust his state remedies because he had not utilized the Nebraska post-conviction procedure provided by Laws 1965, c. 145, now Neb. R.R.S.1943 \u00a7\u00a7 29-3001 to 29-3004 (Supp.1967). See Case v. Nebraska, 381 U.S. 336, 85 S.Ct. 1486, 14 L.Ed.2d 422 (1965). We are satisfied, however, as was the district judge, that the issues raised in the federal habeas proceeding are substantially identical with issues raised on Davis\u2019 direct appeal from his conviction; that the Nebraska court would rule that it has already passed upon them; and that state remedies have been sufficiently exhausted so as to satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b). See Kennedy v. Sigler, 397 F.2d 556, 559 (8 Cir.1968); State v. Hizel, 181 Neb. 680, 150 N.W.2d 217, 219 (1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 868, 88 S.Ct. 143, 19 L.Ed.2d 145; State v. Newman, 181 Neb. 588, 150 N.W.2d 113, 114 (1967); State v. Parker, 180 Neb. 707, 144 N.W.2d 525, 529 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-14\">On this appeal Davis asserts the absence of probable cause for his arrest. He also claims that at the joint trial his federal constitutional rights were violated by the receipt (a) of evidence of his confessions and (b) of evidence admissible only against a codefendant, including, in particular, statements which incriminated or tended to incriminate Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-15\">We turn at once to the last issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">The challenged evidence consisted of the testimony of three witnesses (Gray Smith; his wife, Margaret Smith; and Hightree) as to events which took place inside the bar that night; state exhibits 1-6 inclusive, consisting of five photographs of the inside of the bar and one photograph of its exterior ; the testimony of witness Dee as to his finding an empty .22 caliber shell casing on the bar\u2019s floor; state exhibit 7, the casing; state exhibit 9, the bandanna found in the Davis automobile; the testimony of Detective Sergeant Foxall concerning the oral confessions of Deborah and Erving; the testimony of witness Fitch as to the deposition of the court reporter who took the statement from Deborah; and Deborah\u2019s statement which was the exhibit attached to that deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>Deborah\u2019s oral statement, according to Foxall, referred to a driver of the automobile. She did not name the driver or otherwise identify him as Davis. She spoke of her friend Erving and of his coming up to her \u201cin an automobile with another man driving, and another man * * * in the back seat, all colored.\u201d She joined them. She did not know the other two men. There \u201cwas some talk amongst the men in the car about holding up the place * * After the shooting at the bar she and Erving returned to the parked automobile \u201cand the driver drove west * * They came across Hall and picked him up. They stopped \u201cand they were in the process of counting the money and splitting up same between the men only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">Erving\u2019s oral statement, according to Foxall, included comments that Davis and Hall came to Erving\u2019s home the evening of August 17 in Davis\u2019 automobile. The three drove around a bit. Hall and Davis came by again early the next evening. They drove around. They saw Deborah on the street and she got into the car. Eventually, they parked near the bar and looked inside. Erving and Deborah entered. When Erving and Deborah left the bar after the shooting, \u201cthey got into the automobile, aroused Donald Davis, who was relaxing behind the wheel, told him that [Hall] had shot the bartender and drove around * * * \u201d, picked up Hall, and went to what Erving believed was Davis\u2019 home \u201cwhere they counted the money by dumping this all on the floor of the automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">Witness Fitch was a court reporter. He testified that on May 1, 1965, he took a deposition from Mrs. Mary Kay Wain, another reporter; that Mrs. Wain was to have surgery and would be unavailable at the time of the trial; and that Mrs. Wain testified that on August 20, 1964, she took a statement from Deborah and prepared a transcript from her notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">Deborah\u2019s statement before the court reporter recited: She was born in August 1948 in Little Rock, Arkansas. On the night of August 18 Erving came by in an automobile. She got in. There were two others in the car beside Erving. She did not know their names. There was talk about robbing the bar. The \u201cthree boys were talking about it together.\u201d She and Erving entered the bar. The other man followed. After the shooting, the one with the gun went out first. Then she and Erving left. The two returned to the car. The driver was still there. They drove around the corner and picked up the other man.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">At the trial Davis took the stand in his own behalf. Erving and Deborah did not. Davis testified that he and Erving and Hall had been drinking that night; that nothing was said about robbing the bar; that he was so drunk that he fell asleep while they were parked before the bar; that he did not see Hall get out; that the next thing he remembered was Erving and Deborah\u2019s getting back into the car and telling him, \u201cMan, let\u2019s get on away from here\u201d; that Erving had to shake him to wake him; that they encountered Hall on the way; that Hall still had the gun; that they went to Erving\u2019s home; that he, Davis, was sick and threw up; that, when the others came out of the house, they returned to him two or three dollars he had advanced to them; that he started to drive Hall home because he, Davis, had to take his mother to work; that a police car passed them and Hall jumped out; that Davis had no driver\u2019s license and was drunk and all he could think of was getting out, too; that he did get out and started running; that he never planned to rob the bar; that he was never inside it; that he stopped there to let Erving go in and get beer and whisky; and that he gave him money to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-13\">The trial record reveals that appropriate and timely objections were made on behalf of Davis to the introduction of all the material which tended to implicate him. It also reveals that, with two minor exceptions, the court repeatedly and specifically instructed the jury that the evidence objected to was not admissible against Davis. The court failed so to instruct only when the shell casing and the bandanna were intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>duced. This was an obvious oversight and is of no significance, in any event, in view of the repeated and consistent admonitions which were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">On March 4, 1968, the district court, in ruling upon the issue, held that it was \u201cgoverned by the rationale of Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232 [77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278] (1957)\u201d and that the state trial court did not deprive Davis of any federal constitutional right when it refused to sever his trial or to exclude the references to Davis from the statements of his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\"><em>Delli Paoli, </em>although a 5 to 4 decision, was a controlling precedent at the time the district court denied Davis\u2019 application for federal habeas. The court\u2019s ruling, therefore, was then fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">But two and one-half months later <em>Delli Paoli </em>was overruled by Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). The principle enunciated in <em>Bruton </em>is that the admission, in a joint trial, of a codefend-ant\u2019s confession implicating the defendant in the crime <em>may be </em>violative of the defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause of the sixth amendment, despite any instruction by the trial court that the jury disregard the confession in determining the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The Supreme Court stressed the \u201csubstantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt\u201d and the \u201cpowerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant\u201d. 391 U.S. at 126 and at 135-136, 88 S.Ct. at 1622 &amp; 1628.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">In Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968), the Court held that <em>Bruton </em>is to be applied retroactively and to both state and federal prosecutions. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), and Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), were cited in support of the application of the Confrontation Clause to the states by the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">We must therefore decide whether <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Roberts, </em>both handed down after the district court\u2019s decision in this case, compel a reversal of that ruling. <em>Bruton, </em>by its emphasis on \u201csubstantial risk\u201d and \u201cpowerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant,\u201d does not rule out the possibility that, in proper circumstances, limiting instructions may be fully effective and may work to assure a defendant the fair trial to which he is entitled. Indeed, the Court specifically recognized this when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnS\">\u201cNot every admission of inadmissible hearsay or other evidence can be considered to be reversible error unavoidable through limiting instructions; instances occur in almost every trial where inadmissible evidence creeps in, usually inadvertently. \u2018A defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one\u2019 (citations omitted). It is not unreasonable to conclude that in many such cases the jury can and will follow the trial judge\u2019s instructions to disregard such information.\u201d 391 U.S. at 135, 88 S.Ct. at 1627.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">This court has recognized this distinction and has held that the <em>Bruton </em>principle must be applied on a case-to-case basis \u201cwith practicality and common sense.\u201d Slawek v. United States, 413 F.2d 957, 964 (8 Cir.1969); Caton v. United States, 407 F.2d 367, 372 (8 Cir.1969), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 984, 89 S.Ct. 2149, 23 L.Ed.2d 773. We apply this standard to the evidence received in the joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-13\">We are not very much concerned about the Smith-Hightree-Dee testimony as to the events which took place inside the bar that August evening, or about the photographs or the shell easing or the bandanna. There is no dispute that the shooting took place and that Hall, who fired the shot, was, both before and afterward, an invited passenger in Davis\u2019 automobile. Certain of these physical evidence items would be admissible anyway, if Davis had been separately tried, and the rest, at the most, would be irrelevant. None <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>bears upon the sixth amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">We are gravely concerned, however, with detective Foxall\u2019s testimony as to the respective oral confessions of Deborah and Erving, and with Deborah\u2019s written confession, all of which were introduced in evidence with instructions to the jury that they were not admissible against Davis. Davis did not have the right to cross-examine Erving and Deborah before the jury. Erving\u2019s statement implicated Davis by name and by action. It made him a part of the enterprise and a beneficiary of its loot. Deborah\u2019s statements, both oral and written, did not identify Davis by name, but she did enumerate three young colored men, including her friend Erving, as the occupants of the automobile, place in their mouths a conversation about holding up the bar, and say that the three divided the stolen money. Coupled with Erving\u2019s testimony, Deborah\u2019s identification is specific, complete, and corroborative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">Here, then, are the \u201cpowerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant\u201d and the \u201csubstantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary,\u201d will look to \u201cthe incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining * * * guilt\u201d, which the Supreme Court so stressed in its <em>Bruton </em>opinion. We cannot differentiate factually the statements of the Davis codefendants from that of Bru-ton\u2019s codefendant to the effect that he and Bruton committed the armed robbery with which they were charged. This situation is different from that of the general and nonidentifying details with which we were concerned in our <em>Cat\u00f3n </em>and <em>Slawek </em>cases cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">The respondent warden, however, argues that the facts of the present case are legally distinguishable from those of <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Roberts. </em>It is said that in neither of those cases did the defendant himself confess; that Deborah only referred to the \u201cdriver\u201d of the car and was unable to give his name; and that Erving\u2019s confession actually tended to exonerate Davis, rather than to implicate him, for it states that Erving and Deborah went into the bar not to rob but to buy, and it further states that, when they emerged, they had to arouse Davis, a fact not consistent with his being the driver of a get-away car. It is further said that both Erving and Deborah did take the stand but that Davis did not request or exercise the right to cross-examine either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">We are not persuaded by this argument. It is true that Davis\u2019 own statements were placed in evidence but their admissibility remains seriously at issue. We feel, too, that the Deborah-Erving testimony, in the aggregate, clearly identifies and implicates Davis and does not leave the driver unidentified or revealed as a person innocently sleeping, relaxed, and unconcerned. Deborah's and Erv-ing\u2019s taking the stand is of no constitutional significance for this was done only for purposes of laying a foundation to the challenge to the confessions. They were on the stand outside the presence of the jury and Davis had no opportunity or right to confront or cross-examine them before the jury. This does not satisfy the sixth amendment right to confrontation. See Douglas v. Alabama, supra, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">We thus conclude that on the <em>Bruton </em>issue the district court\u2019s order denying relief must be reversed and the case remanded. Consequently, it is not necessary for us to pass upon the issues of probable cause for Davis\u2019 arrest and of the admissibility of Davis\u2019 own confessions. Nevertheless, in a desire to be as helpful as possible to the district court and to the state court, we venture the following observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-10\">1. We have no difficulty with the issue of probable cause. The robbery of the bar, the shooting there, the presence of a two-toned Oldsmobile parked in front of the bar, and the automobile\u2019s departure immediately after the crime were reported to the police. Shortly thereafter a police car, with its officer-driver possessed of this information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>passed an automobile which fit the description. He followed it and came upon it empty but with its lights burning. He found in it the telltale whisky bottle, the bandanna, and the registration in the name of the senior Davis. Inquiry at the Davis home led officers within the hour to the son. He was found with his trousers damp and with currency on the floor beside his billfold. Certainly, all this adds up to probable cause and, in the light of recent cases, needs no further elucidation on our part. See Leffler v. United States, 409 F.2d 44, 48 (8 Cir. 1969); Jackson v. United States, 408 F.2d 1165, 1170 (8 Cir.1969); Reed v. United States, 401 F.2d 756, 757, 758-761 (8 Cir.1968), cert. denied 394 U.S. 1021, 89 S.Ct. 1637, 23 L.Ed.2d 48; Theriault v. United States, 401 F.2d 79, 81-83 (8 Cir.1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1100, 89 S.Ct. 898, 21 L.Ed.2d 792; Harris v. Stephens, 361 F.2d 888, 892-893 (8 Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 964, 87 S.Ct. 1040, 18 L.Ed.2d 113; Schook v. United States, 337 F.2d 563, 565-566 (8 Cir. 1964); and cases cited in these several opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">2. We feel that we need not now, and indeed should not, pass upon the various factual and legal aspects of the issue as to the constitutionality of the admission of Davis\u2019 own confessory material. With Deborah acquitted, the trial situation has changed. Further, that aspect of the confession issue which concerns the Nebraska procedure\u2019s compliance with the standards enunciated in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), was recently ruled upon and clarified by Chief Judge Van Oosterhout\u2019s opinion in Parker v. Sig-ler, 413 F.2d 459 (1969). In the light of these developments, it is only right that the Nebraska courts have the first opportunity to rule upon the issue of voluntariness and to comply with procedural requirements which have now been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">As is always the case, we have a natural reluctance to interfere with a state\u2019s judicial process. But <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Roberts </em>compel us to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">Unless an extension is granted, as here-inbelow permitted, the State of Nebraska is given 90 days from the date of issuance of our mandate in which to have a retrial of Davis underway. If his new trial is not begun in an appropriate state court within those 90 days, the district court shall grant Davis\u2019 application for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court, however, upon appropriate showing, may allow a reasonable extension of time beyond the 90 days and thereby defer the issuance of the writ. If for any reason the State concludes not to retry Davis, we expect the prosecution promptly to advise the district court and the penitentiary authorities of that decision so that Davis\u2019 release may then be effected forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
