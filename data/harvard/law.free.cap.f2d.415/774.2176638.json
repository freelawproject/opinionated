Since the petitioner has not exhausted his state remedies we need not decide whether the federal habeas court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing and failing to require an answer from the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The dismissal of the petition is affirmed without prejudice to the right of appellant to seek relief in the state courts. E. g. Hill v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 831.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
