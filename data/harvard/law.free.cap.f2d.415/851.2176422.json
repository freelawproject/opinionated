BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b913-30\">This is another monument to needless waste of lawyer and Judge time and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>perhaps more important, client money. For now, 14 months later, the case must go back to start the normal process of discovery leading to the production of facts or the demonstrated lack of them on which, either before or after a conventional trial, the real merits of the case will be determined. This is but a different prelude to the common refrain on the high mortality rate to a dismissal under F.R.Civ.P. 12(b) for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the usual perils should be added the unsoundness\u2014 both administratively and substantively \u2014 of trying, in the orbital atmosphere of this dynamic era, to resolve new, but serious, questions of constitutional law on barebones pleadings. Courts ought not to be pulled into academic exercises on a case that factually may never be. Byers v. Byers, 5 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 205. Courts ordinarily should grapple with these problems on a factual record. Public Affairs Associates, Inc. v. Richover, 1962, 369 U.S. 111, 82 S.Ct. 580, 7 L.Ed.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">Not following these principles, the District Judge, by an unrevealing order that is in no way illumined by the slightest indication of his reasons, dismissed a complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> charging that the public school authorities purposefully declined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>to accord a specific status \u2014 renewal of employment contract and granting tenure \u2014to the plaintiff-teachers because of the exercise by the teachers of First Amendment rights of speech and association in support of causes opposed by these state school authorities. Such dismissal was too quick, to soon, too enigmatic, so we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">The plaintiffs, Etersque and Elenore Pred, were teachers in the mathematics and English departments in the Miami-Dade County Junior College operated by the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each was in his third year of teaching under an annual contract and was eligible for a \"continuing contract\u201d tantamount to \u201ctenure\u201d beginning with the fourth year if he met the requirements of \u00a7 231.36, Florida Statutes, F.S.A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">With a factual specificity that more than met the Rules\u2019 requirements (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>they alleged that each was a competent teacher satisfying all the statutory requirements for a fourth year contract tantamount to tenure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">The complaint then went on to charge with like directness that the refusal of the authorities to grant each a fourth year contract was in violation of Florida law, the school\u2019s own policies, and, important here, Federal laws and Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Again exceeding the demands of the Rules, the complaint spelled out both the activities<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 participation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>each in the Dade County Classroom Teachers\u2019 Association, Inc., and energetic advancement by Mrs. Pred in classroom instruction of her courses in literature of the new demands for campus freedom \u2014that were distasteful and the cause <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the rejection of a \u201ccontinuing contract\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"acy-dedup-0\">Under the spirit of the <em>Conley </em><footnotemark>9</footnotemark> reading of a complaint which diminishes, if not altogether obliterates, the restrictive approach of some of our earlier cases <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> requiring the allegation of \u201cfacts\u201d as distinguished from \u201cconclusions\u201d in civil rights cases,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this complaint is a direct, positive charge that these two teachers, who would otherwise have attained the coveted tenure, were denied the fourth year \u201ccontinuing contract\u201d solely because of their activities in supporting by word, deed, action and association ideas and lawful movements that were opposed by the State school authorities. That reduces the case to simple but awesome terms: apart from difficulties or deficiency in proof<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 in light of the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>cretion that is essential for school officials to have in teacher selection \u2014 may the State constitutionally deny a state-created status because of First Amendment activities of the applicant?</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Of course, the stock reflex to this question \u2014 there is no \u201cright\u201d to public employment, and here no \u201cright\u201d to a merit-based \u201ccontinuing contract\u201d \u2014 has for over a decade been rejected time and time again. \u201cTo state that a person does not have a constitutional right to government employment is only to say that he must comply with reasonable, lawful, and nondiscriminatory terms laid down by the proper authorities. * * \u201d Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, 1956, 350 U.S. 551, 555, 76 S.Ct. 637, 639, 100 L.Ed. 692, 698. To draw from the fact that \u201cpersons seeking employment in\u201d public schools have \u201cno right to work for the State in the school system on their own terms\u201d and such employment may be \u201cupon * * * reasonable terms laid down by the * * *. authorities\u201d the \u201cfacile generalization that there is no constitutionally protected right to public employment is to obscure the issue. * * * We need not pause to consider whether an abstract right to public employment exists. It is sufficient to say that constitutional protection does extend to the public servant whose exclusion pursuant to a statute is patently arbitrary or discriminatory.\u201d Wieman v. Updegraff, 1952, 344 U.S. 183, 191, 73 S.Ct. 215, 219, 97 L.Ed. 216. \u201c[T]he Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly said in an earlier stage of this case, \u2018 * * * the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.\u2019 \u201d Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 1967, 385 U.S. 589, 605-606, 87 S.Ct. 675, 685, 17 L.Ed.2d 629, 642. And to these pronouncements prior to the Trial Court\u2019s dismissal below must be added the Pickering<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> reiteration, just then fresh off the juridical press. \u201cTo the extent that the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s opinion may be read to suggest that teachers may constitutionally be compelled to relinquish the First Amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of the public schools in which they work, it proceeds on a premise that has been unequivocally rejected in numerous prior decisions of this Court. E. g., Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183 [73 S.Ct. 215, 97 L.Ed. 216] (1952); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 [81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231] (1960); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 [87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629] (1967). \u2018[T]he theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.\u2019 Keyishian v. Board of Regents, <em>supra, </em>at 605-606 [87 S.Ct., at 685, 17 L.Ed.2d at 642].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\">The protections of the First Amendment have been given special meaning when teachers have been involved.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Simply because teachers are on the public payroll does not make them second-class citizens in regard to their constitutional rights. See Spevack v. Klein, 1967, 385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574; Garrity v. New Jersey, 1967, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562. \u201cOur Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom * * Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 1967, 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 683, 17 L.Ed.2d 629, 640. \u201cTo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>impose any strait-jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603, 87 S.Ct. at 684, 17 L.Ed.2d at 641. \u201c \u2018The vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools/ Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 487 [81 S.Ct. 247, 251, 5 L.Ed.2d 231, 236], The classroom is peculiarly the \u2018marketplace of ideas/ The Nation\u2019s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth \u2018out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection.\u2019 * * * \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 603, 87 S.Ct. at 683, 17 L.Ed.2d at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Nor does the further implied argument fare any better. In effect the school authorities assert that the teachers were not deprived of their rights, for neither was prevented from speaking, writing, and believing as he chose. If they wished to propagandize, simply do it elsewhere, not as public school teachers. But as Judge Learned Hand said years ago in Bomar v. Keyes, 2 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 136, 139. \u201cIt would emasculate the [Civil Rights] act * * * to leave without recourse those who were later made the victims of reprisals of which they had not been warned.\u201d More than that it would sap the Constitution of its vital force in relation to public employees. It would, in the area of First Amendment rights, be to throw out this Hobson\u2019s choice: speak or work. Moreover, the execution of any such policy through discharge or non-reemployment would have both a specific and a general impact. It would, as to the individual concerned, be to cut him off from work and income. But to others the consequence might well be more serious. It would be the warning that others would suffer the same fate so that eventually there would be workers, but not speaking or feeling free to speak, they would be silent workers. And in the teaching community we must recall that \u201c \u2018[t]he threat of sanctions may deter * \"* * almost as potently as the actual application of sanctions.\u2019 N.A.A.C.P. v. Button [1963, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 338, 9 L.Ed.2d. 405, 418] * * * The danger of that chilling effect upon the exercise of vital First- Amendment rights must be guarded against by sensitive tools which clearly inform teachers what is being prescribed.\u201d Keyishian v. Board of Regents, <em>supra, </em>385 U.S. 604, 87 S.Ct. at 684, 17 L.Ed.2d at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Equally unpersuasive is the related argument that since there is no constitutional right to public employment, school officials only allowed these teachers\u2019 contracts to expire, and thus they cannot be liable for a violation of any rights protected by \u00a7 1983. But in the posture of this case this misconceives the whole thrust of their claim. The right sought to be vindicated is not a contractual one, nor could it be since no <em>right </em>to reemployment existed. What is at stake is the vindication of constitutional rights \u2014 the right not to be punished by the State or to suffer retaliation at its hand because a public employee persists in the exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Yet in the face of the strong allegations which must now be credited (see notes 7, 8 <em>supra), </em>this bold position, accepted by the Trial Court, claims the very power purposely to retaliate and discriminate as a punitive, coercive depressant so long as no contractual (or appropriate local statutory) right to employment is violated. But the State may not deny the Constitution, and the Civil Rights Act by its terms makes the state-actor \u201cliable * * * in an action at law\u201d to the victim for the deprivation of any rights * * * secured by the Constitution * *</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">These principles were long ago followed in Bomar v. Keyes, <em>supra </em>\u2014 a case very closely in point with the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>we face. There the plaintiff was dismissed from her teaching job because she took a month off to serve on a federal jury. She sued under the predecessor of \u00a7 1983 for loss of the expectancy of continued employment, an interest which the law will protect. The Court held that plaintiff had stated a claim for relief since she had a right to serve on a jury and the loss of her job had caused pecuniary damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">Likewise unavailing is any effort to distinguish <em>Bomar </em>on the basis that in that case the teacher\u2019s contract was prematurely terminated, while in the present case defendants merely allowed plaintiffs\u2019 contracts to expire by their own terms. This again is to dilute the right from a constitutional to a contractual one.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although this analysis extinguishes the principal contentions of the school authorities, as near as we can discern them,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we must yet answer the broad question stated above (see text at note 12, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 whether state-created status may be denied because of First Amendment activities. And the answer has to be: maybe yes, maybe no.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">As <em>Pickering </em>and <em>Tinker, supra, </em>reflect, there are limitations on speech both for teachers and students. Thus, in <em>Pickering </em>the Court remarked \u201cit cannot be gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d Pickering v. Board of Education, 1968, 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L.Ed.2d 811, 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">In this balancing only the broadest lines were indicated.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But the specifics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>mentioned by the Court identify factors which are relevant negatively, affirmatively, or both. \u201cThe statements [of the teacher] are in no way directed towards any person with whom appellant would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work as a teacher. Thus no question of maintaining either discipline by immediate superiors or harmony among coworkers is presented here. Appellant\u2019s employment relationships with the Board and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with the superintendent are not the kind of close working relationships for which it can persuasively be claimed that personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391 U.S. 569-570, 88 S.Ct. 1735, 20 L.Ed.2d 818. An accusation that too much money is being spent on some activity is not necessarily per se detrimental to the school\u2019s interests for such \u201can accusation reflects rather a difference of opinion between Pickering and the Board as to the preferable manner of operating the school system, a difference of opinion that clearly concerns an issue of general public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391 U.S. 571, 88 S.Ct. 1736, 20 L.Ed.2d 819. Nor was the Court \u201c* * * presented with a situation-in which a teacher has carelessly made false statements about matters so closely related to the day-to-day operations of the schools that any harmful impact on the public would be difficult to counter because of the teacher\u2019s presumed greater access to the real facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the Court went on, what was before it \u201cis a case in which a teacher has made \u2022erroneous public statements upon issues then currently the subject of public attention, which are critical of his ultimate employer but. which are neither shown nor can be presumed to have in any way either impeded the teacher\u2019s proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom or to have interfered with the regular operation of the schools generally.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Against a sweeping declaration of First Amendment rights to students and teachers<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the Court acknowledges that it \u201chas repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school authorities, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools\u201d so that \u201cproblem lies in the area where students in the exercise of First Amendment rights collide with the rules of the school authorities.\u201d <em>Tinker, supra </em>at 393 U.S. 507, 89 S.Ct. 737, 21 L.Ed.2d 738. \u201cThere is no indication that the work of the school or any class was disrupted. * * * [T]here were no threats or acts of violence on school premises.\u201d In \u201cour system, undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393 U.S. 508, 89 S.Ct. 737, 21 L.Ed.2d 738-739. Taking its cue from our decision in Burnside v. Byars, 5 Cir., 1966, 363 F.2d 744 and the obverse result in Blackwell v. Is-saquena County Board of Education, 5 Cir., 1966, 363 F.2d 749, the Court summed up the State\u2019s burden.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-11\">\u201cIn order for the State in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint. Certainly where there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>finding and no showing that the exercise of the forbidden right would \u2018materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school,\u2019 the prohibition cannot be sustained. Burnside v. Byars, <em>supra </em>at 749.\u201d <em>Tinker, supra </em>at 393 U.S. 509, 89 S.Ct. 738, 21 L.Ed.2d 739.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akg-dedup-0\">\u201cIn the absence of a specific showing of constitutionally valid reasons to regulate their speech, students are entitled to freedom of expression of their views. As Judge Gewin, speaking for the Fifth Circuit, said, school officials cannot suppress \u2018expressions of feelings with which they do not wish to contend.\u2019 Burnside v. Byars, <em>supra, </em>at 749.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393 U.S. 511, 89 S.Ct. 739, 21 L.Ed.2d 740.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">But the Court makes plain that there must be this balancing. \u201cBut conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason- \u2014 -whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior\u2014 materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guaranty of freedom of speech. Cf. Blackwell v. Issaquena County Bd. of Education, 363 F.2d 749 (C.A. 5th Cir., 1966).\u201d Id. at 393 U.S. 513, 89 S.Ct. 740, 21 L.Ed.2d 741. And the activities as protected or non-protected First Amendment rights depend on that weighing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">We have emphasized these limitations because they demonstrate why an ascertainment of the real facts \u2014 not just what the lawyers say the facts are or amount to \u2014 is indispensable in marking the contours of rights so vital, both to the individual and to society in its policy determination of an educated, which is a responsible, citizenry. Without even intimating the acceptable outcome on remand, the two activities for which this claimed discrimination was meted out are quite different. One, relating to the effort to organize teachers for effective action is quite removed from the classroom-schoolhouse variety. The other, involving possible propaganda or agitation within the classroom and the course of instruction, comes much closer to collision with the need for discipline, both within the classroom and within the school as a whole. This may well limit the extent or kind of expression of ideas under the First Amendment\u2019s umbrella. This critical differentiation of precise facts will cut across both the merits of the claims and the remedy. For on the facts must rest the determination of whether the denial of a continuing contract was (a) a reprisal for these actions in expression of ideas, thoughts or associations rather than permissible nondiscriminatory professional evaluations and, if so, (b) whether under the circumstances in relation to the reasonable demands of a system of organized responsible learning these actions were protected. On a finding of (a) and (b) the remedy (c) might well also depend on all of the facts. See, <em>Tinker, supra, </em>at 393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>So now months later the case goes back to find how much of a case it is for either one-or both of these teachers. Whether it gets any place, or how far it will go is beyond prediction now except \u2014 as we repeat and repeat and as done so recently in Webb v. Standard Oil Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 414 F.2d 320; and Equity Capital Co. v.

At all times pertinent hereto, the Plaintiffs have been members of and active in the programs of the Dade County Classroom Teachers\u2019 Association, Inc., an organization of teachers whose function is to protect the interests of teachers in Dade County and to encourage and protect academic freedom. The Plaintiffs have expressed sympathy with the objects of the Dade County Classroom Teachers\u2019 Association, Inc., and have expressed their concern for educational betterment and improvement. The Plaintiff, STANLEY ETERSQUE, has been a vital and moving force in the recruitment of members for the Dade County Classroom Teachers\u2019 Association at the South Campus of the subject school. These actions have offended those Defendants who are administrative officers simply because they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>opposed to the purposes of the Dade County Classroom Teachers\u2019 Association, Inc., and wish to rid their schools of those who do not agree with their own philosophy.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">' 11. The Plaintiff, ELENORE PRED, has apparently been committed to a course of conduct that encourages students to participate in \u2018the current demand for campus freedoms.\u2019 She has had the audacity to discuss these subjects in conjunction with a course on literature and has even mentioned \u2018arbitrary use of authority by College Administration.\u2019 These actions by the Plaintiff, ELENORE PRED, have offended the individual administrators who are her superiors, as evidenced by a report to Dr. Ann Ackourney from Mr. George Bergen (her immediate superior) as set forth in a memorandum dated March 30, 1968, a true copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\">. \u201c8. The Defendants have so acted solely for the purpose of destroying the Plaintiffs\u2019 rights of freedom of speech and assembly and for the purpose of curtailing and restricting academic freedom. The Defendants have used their power to hire and rehire in a manner so as to chill and depress freedom of speech and academic freedom among their instructional personnel. The individual defendants have embarked upon a program of repression of liberty and academic freedom in the schools under their control that has almost no parallel or precedent within the United States with the possible exception of the dark days when school administrations were discharging or refusing to rehire teachers who engaged in civil rights activities. The individual defendants intend to use the non-rehiring of the Plaintiffs as an example of what will happen to those under their supervision and control who do not adhere to the \u2018administration line\u2019 in the expression of their views, both on and off the campus.</p>\n<p id=\"AIf\">12. All of the foregoing expressions on the part of the plaintiffs are anathema to the individual Defendants. It was for these expressions of views and solely for these expressions of views and not for any demonstrated incompetencies as teachers, that the Defendants have refused to rehire the Plaintiffs for the forthcoming school year. It is for these expressions of views and not for any other reasons that the Plaintiffs are now being penalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">14. The actions of the Defendants are in violation of the laws and Constitutions of the State of Florida and of the United States which prohibits [sic] -governmental bodies and personnel from acting in wholly arbitrary, whimsical and capricious fashion; from acting to destroy academic freedom, assembly and expression.

The school board advanced two theories to support its motion to dismiss: plaintiff\u2019s contract had expired and she had no constitutional right to public employment, and plaintiff had furnished defendant with good cause for dismissal. As to the first defense the Court said that \u201cno one questions the fact that the plaintiff had neither a contract nor a constitutional right to have her contract <em>renewed, </em>but these questions <em>are not involved in this ease.\u201d </em>364 F.2d at 179 (Emphasis added). As to the second defense, the Court said that \u201cwe take it to be beyond cavil that the state may not force the plaintiff to choose between exercising her legitimate constitutional rights and her right of equality of opportunity to hold public employment.\u201d 364 F.2d at 180. <em>Cf. </em>Garrity v.

One, the absence of the county superintendent as a party, if really the ultimate hiring authority (See F.S.A. \u00a7 231.36, note 4, <em>supra), </em>as distinguished from the President of a college as here, is not fatal at this stage where his professional judgment is being influenced by staff recommendations assumed to be the product of constitutional discrimination. The second is that an English teacher (Mrs. Pred) cannot teach notions of \u201cfreedom\u201d etc. in literature courses. Although classroom activities involve a closer confrontation between complete freedom of expression and essential discipline, which is a proper factor for close evaluation, it would obliterate cherished ideas about the relationship of teacher-pupil and the teacher\u2019s role in character building were instruction so closely confined to the technicalities of a particular subject or academic discipline. With its inexorable logic and predictability there may even be a great moral lesson in 2 x 2 equal 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b919-15\">. \u201cBecause of the enormous variety of fact situations in which critical statements by teachers and other public employees may be thought by their superiors, against whom the statements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>directed, to furnish grounds for dismissal, we do not deem it either appropriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general standard against which all such statements may be judged.\u201d <em>Pickering, supra </em>at 391 U.S. 569, 88 S.Ct. 1735, 20 L.Ed.2d 817.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. \u201cFirst Amendment rights, applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment, are available to teachers and students.

These petitioners merely went about their ordained rounds in school. Their deviation consisted only in wearing on their sleeves a band of black cloth, not more than two inches wide. They wore it to exhibit their disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and by their example, to influence others to adopt them. They neither interrupted school activities nor sought to intrude in the school affairs or the lives of others. They caused discussion outside of the classrooms, but no interference with work and no disorder. In the circumstances, our Constitution does not permit officials of the State to deny their form of expression.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-11\"><em>Tinker, supra </em>at 393 U.S. 514, 89 S.Ct. 741, 21 L.Ed.2d 741.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
