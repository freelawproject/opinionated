Subsequently, the District Attorney\u2019s office informed appellee Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania of the alleged illegal use of the telephone, and Bell in turn, acting in accordance with tariff regulations filed with both the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, discontinued appellants\u2019 telephone service on the stated ground that the service had been and would be used for unlawful purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-21\">Appellants brought suit against Specter and Bell in the district court pursuant to section 406 of the Federal Communications Act (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 406),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charging inter <em>alia </em>that their telephone service (and their right to the continuation thereof) was summarily discontinued without legal process or proceeding in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 202. The district court refused to preliminarily enjoin appellees from the continued termination of appellants\u2019 telephone service and dismissed the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>In their effort to litigate this controversy in the Federal courts rather than in either of the aforementioned commissions or in the state courts, appellants have attempted to walk the thinnest of legal tightropes. On the one hand, they argue that termination of their telephone service was illegal because done without a hearing and on the basis of alleged illegally seized evidence. On the other hand, they insist that Bell acted reasonably in all respects in terminating their service and that the tariff regulations (under which Bell was admittedly obligated to act) <footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were reasonable \u2014 even though they did not provide for a hearing prior to termination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Detecting the obvious lack of balance in appellants\u2019 position, the district court held, and correctly so, that if Bell acted reasonably in the premises, as appellants concede, there was no cause of action upon which relief could be granted under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying the motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissing the complaint will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-22\">. To date, there appears <em>to have been only </em>one other case brought under \u00a7 406. It is McBride v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 171 F.2d 1 (C.A. 9, 1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-24\">. Although appellants asserted in their complaint' that the district court had jurisdiction under the Civil Rights statutes, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 et seq., the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>court did not explore this claim because it was not pursued below. Similarly, appellants do not press this jurisdictional basis on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">. As stated in Carter v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 365 F.2d 486, 496 (C.A. 5, 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1008, 87 S.Ct. 714, 17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967) : \u201c * * * a tariff, required by law to be filed, is not a mere contract. It is the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">. The ostensible reason for appellants\u2019 refusal to challenge the reasonableness of the tariffs or of Bell\u2019s activity in terminating their service appears to be their reluctance to contend with the familiar doctrine of \u201cprimary jurisdiction.\u201d As stated in 3 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 19.01 at 3 (1958) : \u201cThe precise function of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is to guide a court in determining whether the court should refrain from exercising its jurisdiction until after an administrative agency has determined some question or some aspect of some question arising in the proceeding before the court.\u201d There can be little doubt that if appellants had attacked the reasonableness of Bell\u2019s practice or of the tariffs herein the district court would have found primary jurisdiction in either the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission or the Federal Communications Commission. See Ambassador, Inc. v. United States, 325 U.S. 317, 65 S.Ct. 1151, 89 L.Ed. 1637 (1945) ; Philco Corp. v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 80 F.Supp. 397 (E.D.Pa. 1948). <em>Cf. </em>Carter v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 365 F.2d 486 (C.A. 5, 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1008, 87 S.Ct. 714, 17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-20\">Appellants\u2019 reliance upon Telephone News System, Inc. v.
