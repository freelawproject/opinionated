Cf. Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 1964, 376 U.S. 473, 84 S.Ct. 894, 11 L.Ed.2d 849.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the unfair labor practice stage it sought to try one of the factual issues of the certification de novo, only to find that the Board would not permit it. The propriety of this ruling is the sole question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">To begin at the beginning, the union filed a representation petition, after which the regional director conducted the customary pre-election hearing, determined the appropriate unit and ordered an election. The union won by a vote of 26 to 22, but only by virtue of challenging the validity of four ballots, all of which were against the union, claiming the voters to be ineligible supervisors. The company objected to the union\u2019s right to challenge, asserting that the supervisory status of all the voters was conclusively \u201clitigated\u201d in the pre-election hearing and could not be reliti-gated after the election.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, it requested a post-election hearing if the regional director disagreed with its view of the conclusiveness of the pre-election determination. The regional director, after an ex parte investigation, determined that two of the ballots should be counted, and ordered a hearing to determine the status of the others, Wiley and Schilling. This was within his discretion under NLRB Rules and Regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After an extensive hearing the hearing officer recommended that both ballots remain uncounted. The regional director did not adopt the recommendation as to Wiley, but did as to Schilling, and therefore certified the union. Review by the Board was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">When the company refused to recognize it the union filed charges instituting an unfair labor practice proceeding. At these proceedings counsel for the General Counsel rested upon the election and certification of the union and the company\u2019s admitted refusal. The company\u2019s response was to request a de novo hearing on the supervisory status of Schilling. It did not seek to offer additional evidence, newly discovered or otherwise, cf. NLRB v. Air Control Prods., 5 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 245, 251, or try to persuade the trial examiner in effect to review the prior decision to determine if it was legally erroneous or factually unsupported, cf. NLRB v. Southbridge Sheet Metal Works, Inc., 1 Cir., 1967, 380 F.2d 851, 854, &amp; n. 2; Pepsi-Cola Buffalo Bottling Co. v. NLRB, 2 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 676. The company\u2019s only argument was that before it could be found guilty of an unfair labor practice it was entitled to a complete new hearing upon Schilling\u2019s status as of right under section 10(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (b). The trial examiner disagreed, and refused to conduct a hearing upon this issue, concluding that it had been fully litigated in the post-election hearing. With no other issues in dispute, the impropriety of the company\u2019s refusal to bargain followed as a matter of course. The Board affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The company raises, basically, three criticisms of the Board\u2019s ruling. The most basic one, that objections to the representation election may not be resolved in post-election hearings, need not detain us. This claim was not only untimely made, see Magnesium Casting Co. v. Hoban, 1 Cir., 1968, 401 F.2d 516, cert. denied 393 U.S. 1065, 89 S.Ct. 720, 21 L.Ed.2d 708<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but frivolous in the light of the Board\u2019s wide discretion in fulfilling its section 9(c) function of certifying election results. Cf. NLRB v. A. J. Tower Co., 1946, 329 U.S. 324, 67 S.Ct. 324, 91 L.Ed. 322. Such hearings have long been held. It is not necessary that they be specifically provided for in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Secondly, the company argues that even if the Board can hold such hearings, no resolution of any issue in such should be binding in any subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding. Initially it points to the disparity in terms of procedural safeguards between the unfair labor practice hearings and the representational hearings \u2014 both pre- and post-election. Whereas in the unfair labor practice hearings a trial examiner presides<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the rules of evidence developed in the courts are controlling \u201cso far as practicable,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in both representational hearings a hearing officer presides<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the judicial rules of evidence are not controlling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In view of the \u201cso far as practicable\u201d language of section 10(b) and the representational nature of the issue involved in the post-election hearing in this case, we shall abide by the long line of cases that have found the representational determinations to be binding in a later unfair labor practice proceeding. See NLRB v. Air Control Prods., 5 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 245; NLRB v. Douglas County Elec. Membership Corp., 5 Cir., 1966, 358 F.2d 125. There is no reason to distinguish post-election hearings from those held earlier, unless it were contended that the later hearings dealt with issues largely related to conduct which could form the basis for an unfair labor practice charge and only incidental to the question of the proper representation, a distinction we will return to. As the court in Air Control Prods., <em>supra </em>335 F.2d at 251, stated, \u201cWe are not dealing with objections to the manner in which the election (or election campaign) is conducted or those in which election activities constitute unfair labor practices.\u201d Nor do we accept the company\u2019s objection to the Board\u2019s rule, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(d), which in effect denies the applicability to post-election hearings of the prohibition of section 9(c) (1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c) (1), against the acceptance of hearing officer\u2019s recommendations in pre-election proceedings. The restriction in section 9(c) (1) on the powers of hearing officers seems to have been part of a general reform in 1947 to separate prosecutorial and adjudicative functions of the Board. \u201cPresumably, the purpose is to isolate the Board members from the Board agents, who conduct the representation investigations * * *.\"<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are persuaded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Board\u2019s contention that while it still formally complies with the section 9(c) (1) restriction in pre-election cases, the addition of section 3(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(b), in 1959 and the subsequent delegation of the Board\u2019s powers in representational proceedings to the regional directors, with a limited discretionary appeal to the Board virtually nullifies the insulating effect of section 9(c) (1), and therefore the Board need not apply a dead letter law to post-election hearings, where it does not literally apply. The regional director is not the neutral adjudicator that Board members are presumed to be, since he partakes in the prosecutorial functions. See McLeod v. Local 239, Inter. Broth, of Teamsters, etc., 2 Cir., 1964, 330 F.2d 108; NLRB Rules and Regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 101.5-101.8, 102.14-102.19. Therefore, the majority of representation decisions are made solely by an official not strictly neutral; moreover, when decisions are granted appeal by the Board, they come with the recommendations of this subordinate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, the Board could hardly be prevented from instituting a procedure which is probably fairer, and which, it has been contended, is a requirement of due process under Morgan v. United States, 1936, 298 U.S. 468, 56 S.Ct. 906, 80 L.Ed. 1288. See Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Vincent, 2 Cir., 1967, 375 F.2d 129, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 839, 88 S.Ct. 63 (Friendly, J.) rejecting as frivolous argument that nonrecommendation provision of section 9(c) (1) is unconstitutional, noted in 14 Wayne L.R. 617 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The company\u2019s third major claim is that even if some issues decided in the representational proceedings may be binding in a subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding, the recent cases, Heights Funeral Home, Inc. v. NLRB, 5 Cir., 1967, 385 F.2d 879, and Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 1966, 124 U.S. App.D.C. 365, 365 F.2d 898, hold that the issue of \u201csupervisory status\u201d of any employee must be relitigated. This is a misconception. These cases allow relitigation only when the subsequent unfair labor practice is \u201cunrelated\u201d to the prior election proceeding; for example, interference with organizational rights by supervisors, or the discharge of an employee allegedly a supervisor. But in <em>Amalgamated, Clothing Workers </em>the court specifically noted, \u201cWhere a company is charged with refusal to bargain with a union certified after election, the proceeding is sufficiently \u2018related\u2019 to the representation proceeding to preclude re-litigation of such common issues as the scope of the appropriate unit and <em>employees therein.\u201d </em>365 F.2d at 904. (Emphasis added.) The issue is one of fairness: was the particular point that arises in the unfair labor practice proceeding significant and actually contested at the prior hearing, and was it clearly focused in terms of the issue arising in the later unfair labor practice charge. In the present case the supervisory status of Schilling was the key issue in the post-election hearing, was vigorously contested, and was focused in terms of the validity of the union victory. The overlap, in other words, was precise.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">This is not to say that the company could not have raised before us the issue of the adequacy of the evidence to support the regional director\u2019s conclusion that Schilling had supervisory status. To return to Boire v. Greyhound, <em>supra, </em>it cannot be put in a position where it could never have such a determination. The company, however, though preserving its rights to raise such issues by objecting before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>NLRB,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> did not choose to press them before us, either by brief or oral argument. So far as its petition to review and set aside is concerned, this was a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">However, so far as the Board\u2019s cross-petition for enforcement is concerned, possibly we should take a cursory look at the adequacy of the Board\u2019s findings to support its order, on the assumption that the special statutory basis for the Court\u2019s decision in NLRB v. Ochoa Fertilizer Corp., 1961, 368 U.S. 318, 82 S.Ct. 344, 7 L.Ed.2d 312, is not present here, leaving a burden of sorts upon the Board in spite of the employer\u2019s lack of argument. Cf. NLRB v. Local 111, United Broth. of Carpenters, 1 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 823, 825; NLRB v. Filtron Co., 2 Cir., 1962, 309 F.2d 184; NLRB v. Kellburn Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 1945, 149 F.2d 686. But cf. NLRB v. National Mineral Co., 7 Cir., 1943, 134 F.2d 424, 425, cert. denied 320 U.S. 753, 64 S.Ct. 58, 88 L.Ed. 448. Such a look would give us no qualms in enforcing the order. NLRB v. Gary Aircraft Corp., 5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 223, cert. denied 387 U.S. 918, 87 S.Ct. 2032, 18 L.Ed.2d 971; Brewton Fashions, Inc. v. NLRB, 5 Cir., 1966, 361 F.2d 8, cert. denied 385 U.S. 842, 87 S.Ct. 95, 17 L.Ed.2d 75; NLRB v. Swift &amp; Co., 1 Cir., 1961, 292 F.2d 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">However, this is the most we have to do. The matter was well put in the concurring opinion in NLRB v. Red Spot Elec. Co., 9 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 697, at 699.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">I approve the judgment of the court as announced in the majority opinion, and agree that upon a petition of this kind we should carefully examine the record for the purpose of determining that the Board had jurisdiction to make its order and that it has not \u201ctraveled outside the orbit of its authority\u201d. Such procedure is in conformity with the ancient practice of courts of equity when asked to enter a default decree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az0\">With respect to other matters stated or suggested by the opinion, I do not think that the rule of National Labor Relations Board v. Cheney California Lumber Co., 327 U.S. 385, 66 S.Ct. 553, 90 L.Ed. 739, has been modified either by the language of the statute or by anything said in Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456, or in National Labor Relations Board v. Pittsburg SS. Co., 340 U.S. 498, 71 S.Ct. 453, 95 L.Ed. 479. The language of \u00a7 10(e) of the Act quoted and relied upon in the Cheney Lumber Company case has not been changed in the later Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">In a subsequent case the Ninth Circuit cited this concurrence with approval. F.P.C. v. Arizona Edison Co., 9 Cir., 1952, 194 F.2d 679, 685. Clearly the court must be satisfied that the Board had jurisdiction. However, Ochoa Fertilizer Corp., <em>supra, </em>itself would seem to have put to rest any concept that the enforcing court, qua court, has a substantive interest in the correctness of the decision underlying the order, or, to quote our Brother Godbold\u2019s dissent, \u201cwhether in the interest of the national policies represented by the Congressional labor enactments * * * the court should enforce the order.\u201d No doubt the court, qua court, owes a duty to itself to ascertain that the form of the order is such that enforcement would be practicable, but beyond that we are not persuaded that a respondent cannot lose a valid point by waiver any less than <em>Ochoa </em>held it could by consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">.

In either instance, such action by the regional director may be on the basis of an administrative investigation or, if it appears to the regional director that substantial and material factual issues exist which can be resolved only after a hearing, [he shall issue and cause to be served on the parties a notice of hearing on said issues before a hearing officer.\u201d]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\">.

Cf. NLRB v. Rexall Chem. Co., 1 Cir., 1967, 370 F.2d 363. But if the rule was void, recourse thereto could not be held necessary. It is also too late to contend that the post-election hearings were not exempted by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a) (6) from the safeguards of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">.

The Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">This case comes before us under two separate and district statutory provisions. Pursuant to \u00a7 10(f), <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the company petitioned this court to review and set aside the order of the Board. The NLRB filed in one document its answer to the company\u2019s \u00a7 10(f) petition and its cross-petition to enforce pursuant to \u00a7 10(e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therein it said \u201cthat the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ceedings had before it, the <em>findings of fact, conclusions of law, </em>and order of the Board <em>were and are in all respects valid and proper </em>under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended * * and it asked this court to enforce its order. (Emphasis added). While all members of the panel agree that the employer waived its \u00a7 10(f) rights by failing to press the supervisory issue before this court, we differ on the Board\u2019s right to enforcement under \u00a7 10(e) and on the standard which we are required to employ in determining if such a right exists in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In my view the majority standard of a \u201ccursory look\u201d at the record is insufficient. More than that is required for the court to put its judicial imprimatur on the enforcement of a Board order. In reaching that conclusion I consider the express statutory language adopted by Congress after heated debate over the defects of the pre-Taft-Hartley evi-dentiary standard and the tendency of some appellate courts to rubber stamp Board orders out of deference to administrative expertise, and also the Supreme Court\u2019s elaborate indorsement of the purpose of the amended standard in Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">There can be no argument over what the statute says. The problem is whether it is, or is not, to be given application in the particular situation before us. <em>Universal Camera </em>amply explained the congressional purpose, and I must note several of its observations. That case came about by the intercircuit conflict in interpretation of the effect of the Taft-Hartley Act Amendments (1947) on the reviewing power of the courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Wagner Act had provided that the findings of the Board as to facts, if supported by the evidence, were conclusive. The Supreme Court thereafter had read \u201cevidence\u201d to mean \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The courts had found the Board\u2019s burden satisfied under the Wagner standard if the results were supported by substantial evidence viewed in isolation. From the resulting Congressional outrage came the \u201csubstantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d test, which ultimately became the Taft-Hartley standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">. Against this background the Supreme Court said that \u201cCongress has left no room for doubt as to the kind of scrutiny which a court of appeals must give the record before the Board to satisfy itself that the Board\u2019s order rests on adequate proof.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">After carefully examining the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Amendments, the Supreme Court set out the language so often paraphrased as the <em>Universal Camera </em>standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">To be sure, the requirement for canvassing \u201cthe whole record\u201d in order to ascertain substantiality does not furnish a calculus of value by which a reviewing court can assess the evidence. Nor was it intended to negative the function of the Labor Board as one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect. Nor does it mean that even as to matters not requiring expertise a court may displace the Board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo. </em>Congress has merely made it clear that a reviewing court is not barred from setting aside a Board decision <em>when it cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirely furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board\u2019s view. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">340 U.S. at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 464, 95 L.Ed. at 467-468.

The Taft-Hartley Act nowhere intimates any Board right to enforcement except upon satisfaction of the substantiality standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The role of the enforcing court in pre-Taft-Hartley days was described by the Second Circuit in NLRB v. Kellburn Mfg. Co., Inc., 2 Cir. 1945, 149 F.2d 686:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">As is well understood, an enforcement proceeding is therefore, a combination of an appeal from the order, and a motion to enforce it. In its first aspect, i. e., as an appeal, we think that it rests upon the respondent to show at least that the findings have no substantial support in evidence; and, if so, it follows that when, as here the respondent defaults, it is not necessary to make that examination. We are called upon therefore to go no further than to examine the findings, decide whether they support the order, and whether the order itself is in accordance with the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In a post-Taft-Hartley case <footnotemark>9A</footnotemark> the Seventh Circuit, relying on <em>Kellburn, </em>and without consideration of the effect of the 1947 amendments and <em>Universal Camera, </em>restated the idea that in an enforcement proceeding the burden is on the respondent to show want of substantial evidence, and that the default of the employer before the enforcing court operates as a confession of the allegations of the enforcement petition, so that all the court then need do is to see if the findings support the order and whether the order complies with the statute, issues on which the Board has the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">But power of the court to enforce a Board order is statutory. Once Congress has written into the statute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>standard of review the court cannot give itself power to enforce under a lesser standard, articulated for procedural efficiency and expedition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The majority rely upon a line of cases predicated upon NLRB v. Cheney Cal. Lumber Co., 1946, 327 U.S. 385, 66 S.Ct. 553, 90 L.Ed. 739. <em>Cheney </em>is inapposite. It involved a clear default in the agency proceedings. The employer in <em>Cheney </em>simply failed to file exceptions to the Trial Examiner\u2019s intermediate report and failed to request oral argument before the Board. 327 U.S. at 386, 66 S.Ct. 553. The Supreme Court merely invoked the orthodox \u00a7 10(e) statutory prohibition<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> against judicial examination of an issue not raised before the Board. 327 U.S. at 388-389, 66 S.Ct. 553.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The employee <em>sub judice </em>has vigorously protested the supervisory issue in all agency proceedings. The \u00a7\u2022 10(e) prohibition has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In NLRB v. Local 111, United Broth. of Carpenters, 1st Cir. 1960, 278 F.2d 823, 825 Judge Aldrich writing for the First Circuit, set out what seems to me correct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">Any order entered following a decision by the Board is, of course, the court\u2019s order, and not that of the Board. In this respect the matter differs from an appeal from a district court. We are correspondingly more concerned with the content of the order. For if, on default, we must automatically enter any order prepared by the Board Congress would in effect be giving to an administrative board the final word in the formulation of our injunctions. We recognize no such power, even if it could be thought that there was such an intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">278 F.2d at 825. Then he departed from that to say that \u201cfull scrutiny need not be accorded a party who has failed to diligently preserve and prosecute his Section 10(f) rights.\u201d But the inquiry is whether in the interest of the national policies represented by the Congressional labor enactments, including the 1947 Amendments, the court should enforce the order. The less than full scrutiny standard of <em>Local 111, </em>in effect a penalty against a nondiligent employer and a reward to the Board, is simply not allowed by \u00a7 10(e).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover <em>Cheney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>does not stand for such a rule. NLRB v. Filtron, Inc., 2 Cir. 1962, 309 F.2d 184, 185 is a per curiam adoption of the rationale of <em>Local 111 </em>and also relies on <em>Cheney. </em>NLRB v. Kellburn Mfg.

National Minerals Co., 7 Cir. 1943, 134 F.2d 424, 425-426, cert. denied 320 U.S. 753, 64 S.Ct. 58, 88 L.Ed. 448, antedate TaftHartley and Universal Camera.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The presumption of correctness attending the proceedings of administrative agencies cannot dispense with or water down the standard of review specifically established by Congress for enforcement of Board orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">I would review the Hearing Officer\u2019s report<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> under the <em>Universal Camera </em>-\u00a7 10(e) test.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">II. The Substantiality of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">The Hearing Officer, appointed by the Regional Director to conduct the post-election hearing to determine the supervisory status of Schilling and Wiley, adopted as his legal guide to \u00a7 2 (11) NLRB v. Beaver Meadow Creamery, Inc., 3 Cir. 1954, 215 F.2d 247, 251. He concluded that <em>Beaver Meadow Creamery </em>held that \u201cthe term supervisor is to be read disjunctively and that the possession of any one of the Section 2(11) powers will make one a supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>According to the Hearing Officer, (1) Schilling\u2019s shift overlapped the other two shifts, (2) he was announced as \u201cforeman\u201d sometime in early Spring by Lunt, <em>the department supervisor, </em>(3) he subsequently received a 25 to 75 cent an hour pay raise, although it was expressly found that no discussion ever followed with respect to his duties, responsibilities, or authority, (4) he \u201cgives employees the work, checks the negatives before they make their plates, and looks at the plates after they make them.\u201d (5) the order of jobs is given to Schilling by Lunt, whose presence in the department varies from none to 20-30 times a day, (6) Schilling tells men which jobs to do, including occasionally writing instructions for the night shift on a blackboard when Lunt does not do so, (7) he confers with the lithographic department supervisor on approximately 90 percent of the plate quality control problems, and (8) he cheeked on several occasions time card entries made by department employees and notified them of mistakes made.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">On the other hand, the Hearing Officer also made three other important findings, best set out in his own language :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">Lunt, <em>the admitted supervisor of the department, </em>is not a plate maker by trade, and has only a general knowledge of the plate making techniques. It appears from the record that Lunt is responsible for the over-all supervision of the department or section, but that internally the method of operation is left up to Schilling who has the technical knowledge necessary for the making of plates, (emphasis added). * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">Testimony reflects that those considered by the Employer to be supervisors are salaried while both Schilling and Wiley are hourly paid as are other hourly employees. Other supervisors are rated on an annual basis, while Schilling and Wiley are rated on a semi-annual basis as are other hourly rated employees. Neither attends regularly scheduled supervisor meetings as do the admitted supervisors.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7E\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">It is clear from the record that neither Schilling nor Wiley has the authority to hire, fire, promote, discipline, suspend, lay off, recall, discharge, or reward their employees or to effectively recommend such action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">The Hearing Officer then framed the supervisory issue in a nutshell: \u201c[T]he evidence does reflect that both of them [Schilling and Wiley] assign work and transfer employees from one assignment to another. The question is whether such actions are of a merely routine clerical nature or whether, in the exercise of this authority, they use independent judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">The Regional Director disagreed as to Wiley. But he adopted as his own decision the Hearing Officer\u2019s determination of Schilling\u2019s status, a finding rubber-stamped without review by the Board in both its representation and unfair labor practice capacities.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">This court has only recently held that \u00a7 2(11), defining under the NLRA who constitutes a \u201csupervisor,\u201d is a pragmatic test. In Ross Porta-Plant, Inc. v. NLRB, 5 Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 1180, 1182, the court noted that the definition re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>quired \u201cactual authority effectively to direct others.\u201d The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoiA\">By this we mean the type of authority which flows from management and tends to associate an individual with management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">In enacting \u00a7 2(11) of the Act Congress did not intend to exclude from its protection any individuals except those who possess true managerial powers. This section is designed to apply to supervisors with genuine management prerogatives as distinguished from \u201cstraw bosses, leadmen, set-up men, and other minor supervisory employees.\u201d S.Rep.No. 105 on S. 1126, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. The company\u2019s designation of these employees as \u201cdepartment heads,\u201d \u201cassistant foremen\u201d or \u201cforemen\u201d is not controlling in the absence of delegation to them of bona fide managerial powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">404 F.2d at 1182. See NLRB v. American Mfg. Co. of Texas, 5 Cir. 1968, 405 F.2d 473, 474 (per curiam); NLRB v.

Substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole fails to show that Schilling was anything more than a \u201clead man\u201d or \u201cstraw boss\u201d.

As a result, summary enforcement has been denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In <em>Red Spot, </em>pursuant to 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(c) and the Board\u2019s regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.12 and 102.48, the Board automatically adopted the trial examiner\u2019s report because the employer did not file exceptions to the report. The court held it would not grant summary enforcement without examining the record. The First Circuit declined to follow <em>Red Spot </em>in NLRB v. Auburn Curtain Co., Inc., 1 Cir. 1951, 193 F.2d 826. <em>Red Spot </em>was concerned with the <em>Cheney </em>problem \u2014 the effect of default in the agency proceedings \u2014 and the disclaimer of it in <em>Auburn Curtain, </em>correctly points out that it is inconsistent with <em>Cheney. </em>See also NLRB v.

But none of this has to do with the scope of review in a case such as is before us where there has been no default in the agency proceedings and hence no scope of action for the statutory prohibition of \u00a7 10 (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b352-13\">.

To enforce the former without careful scrutiny of the latter in accordance with the substantial evidence test may result in a certification and bargaining order being forced by judicial abdication upon less than a majority of the employees whose rights are paramount. See NLRA, Sections 7 and 9(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157 and 159(a) (1964).
