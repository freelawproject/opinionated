After the filing of this suit in Michigan, a District Judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted defendant\u2019s motion to quash service of process on him in Tennessee. But he also denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to transfer. He relied in this regard upon Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, 369 U.S. 463, 82 S.Ct. 913, 8 L.Ed.2d 39 (1962), and Mayo Clinic v. Kaiser, 383 F.2d 653 (8th Cir. 1967). The District Judge then certified that his order involved a controlling question of law and this court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">The controlling federal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (1964) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-18\">\u201cThe district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-19\">The purpose of this amendment has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in Goldlawr, Inc. v. Hei-man, <em>swpra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Mr. Justice Black in the opinion for the Court held that lack of personal jurisdiction over a defendant did not deprive the court of jurisdiction so as to prevent transfer to the appropriate District Court under \u00a7 1406. The opinion said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-20\">\u201cNothing in that language indicates that the operation of the section was intended to be limited to actions in which the transferring court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants. And we cannot agree that such a restrictive interpretation can be supported by its legislative history \u2014 either that relied upon by the Court of Appeals or any other that has been brought to our attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-21\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASz\">\u201cThe language of \u00a7 1406(a) is amply broad enough to authorize the transfer of cases, however wrong the plaintiff may have been in filing his case as to venue, whether the court in which it was filed had personal jurisdiction over the defendants or not. The section is thus in accord with the general purpose which has prompted many of the procedural changes of the past few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>years \u2014 that of removing whatever obstacles may impede an expeditious and orderly adjudication of cases and controversies on their merits. When a lawsuit is filed, that filing shows a desire on the part of the plaintiff to begin his case and thereby toll whatever statutes of limitation would otherwise apply. The filing itself shows the proper diligence on the part of the plaintiff which such statutes of limitation were intended to insure. If by reason of the uncertainties of proper venue a mistake is made, Congress, by the enactment of \u00a7 1406(a), recognized that \u2018the interest of justice\u2019 may require that the complaint not be dismissed but rather that it be transferred in order that the plaintiff not be penalized by what the late Judge Parker aptly characterized as \u2018time-consuming and justice-defeating technicalities.\u2019 It would at least partially frustrate this enlightened congressional objective to import ambiguities into \u00a7 1406(a) which do not exist in the language Congress used to achieve the procedural reform it desired. Gold-lawr, Inc. v. Heiman, 369 U.S. 463, 465-467 (1962), 82 S.Ct. 913, 915-916. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">It seems clear to us that <em>Goldlawr </em>completely disposes of appellant\u2019s first argument as to jurisdiction. The United States District Court in Michigan had jurisdiction of this complaint, although not of the person of defendant. It also had the power under \u00a7 1406(a) to transfer the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">We recognize, of course, that the <em>Gold-lawr </em>case did not deal with the same fact situation we face here. On the instant record, where the accident is alleged to have occurred in Tennessee and the Judge\u2019s opinion says that defendant had never lived in Michigan, we would have to assume that as appellant contends, this suit may well have been filed in the United States District Court in Michigan just to stop the running of the statute of limitations in Tennessee. But the language we have quoted from Mr. Justice Black\u2019s opinion in <em>Goldlawr </em>seems to describe the congressional intent in adopting \u00a7 1406(a) as not excluding such a purpose. And this appears to be true, although venue in Michigan is \u201cwrong\u201d only because of lack of personal service on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">Two Courts of Appeals have squarely held with the District Judge and the ap-pellees on facts which in all important respects are identical. They are the Eighth Circuit in Mayo Clinic v. Kaiser, 383 F.2d 653 (8th Cir. 1967), and the Fifth Circuit in Dubin v. United States, 380 F.2d 813 (5th Cir. 1967). In the <em>Dubin </em>case, the Fifth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-8\">\u201cLooking to the language of \u00a7 1406, the statute is couched in terms of \u2018laying venue in the wrong division or district.\u2019 The statute does not refer to \u2018wrong\u2019 venue, but rather to venue laid in a \u2018wrong division or district.\u2019 We conclude that a district is \u2018wrong\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1406 whenever there exists an \u2018obstacle [to] * * * an expeditious and orderly adjudication\u2019 on the merits. Inability to perfect service of process on a defendant in an otherwise correct venue is such an obstacle.\u201d Dubin v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 815.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">Arguments in favor of the appellant\u2019s position are set forth effectively in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in <em>Goldlawr </em>and in a United States District Court opinion, Skilling v. Funk Aircraft Co., 173 F.Supp 939 (W.D.Mo. 1959). The footnote on page 468 of 369 U.S. on page 916 of 82 S.Ct. the <em>Gold-lawr </em>case is particularly noted. But, of course, it spoke only for two members of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">The Supreme Court in <em>Goldlawr </em>held that congressional intent in adopting \u00a7 1406(a) included a recognition that \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d may require the transfer of a complaint so that a plaintiff would not be penalized by \u201cjustice-defeating technicalities.\u201d Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, <em>supra </em>369 U.S. at 467, 82 S.Ct. 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>Obviously, the District Judge in this case felt it was in \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d to effect the transfer. We find no fact presented and no principle of law argued to us to convince us of any abuse of discretion on the part of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">.
