Count I of the Complaint alleged violation of (1) sections of the Civil Rights Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibiting intimidation of voters; (2) First Amendment rights of free political expression; and (3) Fourteenth Amendment \u201cequal protection\u201d rights. Count II alleged violations of the federal Hatch Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by defendant members of the Chester Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">The Complaint, in broad outline alleged that twenty-two members of the Chester Police Force, named as defendants, are Republican Party committeemen; many of them electioneer in the vicinity of polling places on Election Day and as a result voters are intimidated; and the political activities of the policemen are sanctioned by the defendant Mayor of Chester and its chief of police and the defendant Chairman of the Chester Republican Executive Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-20\">The plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction October 22, 1968, the day the Complaint was filed. Hearing was had on that motion on October 28, 1968. Plaintiffs presented the testimony of eleven witnesses, including the defendants Nacrelli, Bail and Eyre. Testimony for five additional witnesses was stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-21\">When the plaintiffs rested their case, counsel for the defendant Chester Republican Executive Committee and its chairman Joseph Eyre, orally moved \u201cthat the application for <em>'preliminary injunction </em>as far as Mr. Eyre is concerned and so far as the Republican Executive Committee is concerned be dismissed. * * *\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">At that point, counsel for all the other defendants stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-23\">\u201cIf the Court please, I would like to make a <em>similar </em>motion on behalf of Mayor Nacrelli, Chief Bail and also the rest of the policemen who are named defendants.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-24\">The defense called a single witness who testified with respect to Count II of the Complaint alleging violations of the Hatch Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The parties then presented oral argument on the two defense motions \u201cthat the application for preliminary injunction * * * be dismissed.\u201d When they concluded, the District Court said in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201cI am going to make my decision right now. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201cThis case is rather imminent because of the election coming up a week from tomorrow, and if I deny the request for the preliminary injunction, why, obviously it can\u2019t be resolved during that\u2019 time. <em>For future purposes, the plaintiffs may do as they see fit and obtain a permanent injunction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cI will start out by saying this, that the request for a preliminary injunction is denied. The motions to dismiss are granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cNow, I base that on the following facts: In the first instance, I have heard no evidence whatsoever which convinces me that in any way any of these police officers, the Mayor, the Chairman of the Chester City Republican Executive Committee or any member of that committee or anyone else coerced or intimidated anyone in any election that has been mentioned in this court. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\u201cI will say parenthetically that in the case of Captain Morelli there might be sufficient evidence to raise a doubt, particularly in view of the testimony that he opened the polling place in the morning and closed it at night. This is obviously a case in equity, and I don\u2019t think that testimony would even carry the burden in a routine civil case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\u201cThere is little more that I can say concerning the facts. There just simply aren\u2019t any facts on which we could order the very unusual relief of a preliminary injunction. All counsel present are well aware of that. We don\u2019t issue a preliminary injunction unless we have strong evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">\u201cThere is no evidence before me of irreparable harm. There is no evidence before me that the plaintiffs, if they were permitted to proceed, would have more than a strong possibility of recovering. There is no evidence before me particularly that they do not have an adequate remedy at law. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">\u201cI wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not condoning or approving anything that was done. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t know precisely what was done because there is insufficient evidence before me, but so far as I can determine from the evidence, not one of these defendants has violated the law in any respect. Therefore, <em>the petition and motion for preliminary injunction will be denied.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">Court was then adjourned. Following adjournment, the Clerk of the District Court made the following docket entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD6\">\u201c1968</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-15\">\u201cOct. 28 Hearing re: Preliminary injunction. Argued re: deft\u2019s oral motion to dismiss. \u2014 C.A.V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-17\">The court makes oral findings of fact and conclusions of law: and orders that the petition for injunction is denied, and the motion to dismiss is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-19\">The Docket discloses these further entries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-20\">\u201cNov. 4 Answer of J. L. Eyre, etc. filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-21\">\u201cNov. 12 Answer of John H. Nacrelli et al. filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-22\">\u201cNov. 12 Case Listed for Trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-23\">\u201cNov. 15 Transcript of 10/28/68 filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-24\">\u201cNov. 26 Notice of Appeal of plaintiffs, filed. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-25\">It must be noted at this juncture that the District Court wrote to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on November 8, 1968 advising him in substance that it had held the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss \u201cunder ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>visement\u201d and decided to grant them after the hearing on the application for a preliminary injunction and that it did not agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u201cthe Court should not grant a motion to dismiss after the case was heard on the application for preliminary injunction.\u201d The District Court further stated in its letter that \u201cIf you wish to take an appeal, it appears to me very definitely that the record is complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">That the defendants construed their oral motions \u201cto dismiss\u201d during the course of the preliminary injunction hearing to be directed to the application for the preliminary injunction is clearly indicated by the fact that in their respective Answers to the Complaint filed on November 4 and November 12 (after the entry of the October 28, 1968 docket entry) defendants separately stated that \u201cDefendants respectfully pray this Court to dismiss this Complaint with costs on the Plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We are of the opinion that the District Court erred in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint. Its action was in the nature of a grant of summary judgment. It is well-settled that successfully resisting motion for preliminary injunction where factual issues are presented does not entitle the defendant to summary judgment without opportunity to present additional evidence, if need be, on final hearing. Progress Development Corporation v. Mitchell, 286 F.2d 222, 233 (7th Cir. 1961); see, too, Capital City Gas Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 373 F.2d 128 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the interests of justice and judicial economy would be most effectively served by remand of the cause to the District Court with directions to proceed <em>forthwith </em>to final hearing and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Accordingly, the Order of the District Court, as reflected in the above-quoted docket entry of October 28, 1968, denying the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for injunc-tive relief and dismissing their Complaint, will be vacated and the cause remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with this Opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-15\">. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1971(b), 1983, 1985(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-16\">. 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1502(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-25\">.
