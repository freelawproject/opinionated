Wallace appeals from dismissal of his action against the Insurance Company of North America (hereinafter IN A). The ease was tried to a District Judge sitting in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-22\">IN A issued to appellant an insurance policy which promised to pay him one-half the principal sum, or $12,500, for the \u201closs of one member\u201d. \u201c.Member\u201d was defined to include \u201ceye\u201d and \u201closs\u201d was defined, \u201cwith regard to eye, entire and irrecoverable loss of sight.\u201d On January 24, 1966, appellant was struck in the right eye by a foreign, metallic object which was removed with a giant magnet. A traumatic cataract, which developed in the eye, was extracted on January 28. The ophthalmologist who performed these operations, Dr. George Widener, and a second ophthalmologist, Dr. Harry Abell, Jr., deposed that appellant, without correction, could see out of the eye only about half as well as the normal eye can see under clear water. With correction consisting of a contact lens plus glasses to improve his focusing ability, appellant, after the operations, had 20/60 vision in the injured eye, meaning that he could see to eat and take care of himself and could read newspaper headlines, but not standard newsprint. Further examination by Dr. Widener on January 3, 1968 revealed that appellant\u2019s correctable vision in the injured eye had deteriorated to 20/80 because of the formation of a secondary cataract. Dr. Widener, however, recommended an operation called a \u201cdiscission\u201d which would result in a return to 20/20 correctable vision \u201cprovided we get no complications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Appellant brought suit against INA to recover under his policy for loss of his eye. Kentucky law controls this case, which was removed to the District Court as a diversity action. The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that Wallace\u2019s loss of sight was \u201centire\u201d but not \u201cirrecoverable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We agree with the District Judge that appellant\u2019s loss of sight was \u201centire\u201d but was not \u201cirrecoverable,\u201d and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">1. Whether the loss of sight was \u201centire\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">We agree with the District Judge that, under Kentucky law, the entire loss of sight in one eye requires only the practical loss of the use of the eye. Continental Casualty Co. v. Linn, 226 Ky. 328, 10 S.W.2d 1079 (1928); Standard Accident Ins. Co. of Detroit, Mich. v. Bailey, 235 Ky. 626, 633, 32 S.W.2d 5 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The appellant has lost the practical use of his right eye. Without correction, he could do little more than distinguish light and blurred objects. In cases cited by appellee wherein benefits were denied under similar policies, the plaintiffs enjoyed greater use of their injured eye than did Wallace. <em>See, </em>Starks v. Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen, 259 Ky. 213, 82 S.W.2d 328 (1935); Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Powers, 260 Ky. 810, 86 S.W.2d 1001 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The Tenth Circuit stated in Order of United Commercial Travelers v. Knorr, 112 F.2d 679, 682 (1940):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">\u201cOne has lost an eye when the eye is no longer of some practical value or benefit. It is not required that the last vestige of light be extinguished before it can be said that one has lost an eye.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">2. Whether the loss of sight was \u201cirrecoverable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">The loss of useful sight in appellant\u2019s right eye is permanent and can be recovered, if at all, only after an operation and by use of both glasses and a contact lens. Appellant argues that the Court must disregard the use of glasses or lenses in determining the recover-ability of his vision, citing Pargas Co. v. Hagan, 428 S.W.2d 779 (Ky.1968), wherein the Court upheld the Kentucky Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board which disregarded the use of eyeglasses or lenses in determining the amount of an award, under KRS \u00a7 342.105, for \u201cthe total and permanent loss of the sight of an eye.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">We think that <em>Hagan </em>may be distinguished in that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation provision awards benefits for \u201ctotal and permanent loss,\u201d and the insurance contract before us pays benefits only for \u201centire and irrecoverable loss.\u201d The words \u201ctotal\u201d and \u201centire\u201d are synonymous, but \u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201cirrecoverable\u201d are subject to different interpretations. \u201cPermanent\u201d is defined as \u201ccontinuing or enduring without fundamental or marked change,\u201d while \u201cirrecoverable\u201d means \u201cnot capable of being recovered or rectified.\u201d <em>See, </em>Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1961). The latter, but not the former, implies that an attempt must be made to determine whether the allegedly \u201cirrecoverable\u201d item is \u201ccapable of being recovered.\u201d Appellant\u2019s loss of sight might well be \u201cpermanent\u201d yet not \u201cirrecoverable.\u201d <em>Hagan </em>should not be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-17\">We find no Kentucky case which interprets the word, \u201cirrecoverable\u201d. This Court, however, in the early case of Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Feldman, 99 F.2d 83 (1938), cert. denied, 306 U.S. 636, 59 S.Ct. 485, 83 L.Ed. 1037 (1939), considered the use of available corrective measures in determining whether one\u2019s sight was irrecoverable. The Court held that an insured had not suffered \u201cthe irrecoverable loss of the entire sight of both eyes\u201d such that he was \u201ctotally and permanently unable to perform any work\u201d within the meaning of his insurance policy where he had 931/3 percent loss of vision in one eye and 80 percent loss in the other, but acquired normal vision after undergoing an operation on the weaker eye and being fitted with glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>In Home Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Stewart, 114 F.2d 516 (1940), the Tenth Circuit considered the same problem stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cGlasses are worn by a substantial proportion of people of all ages. Many of them have very little vision in the natural eye, but with the use of glasses their vision is substantially normal for all practical purposes. They pursue their businesses and professions with success. They meet in competition those with normal vision in the natural eye, and they are not seriously handicapped. It cannot be said that they have suffered the irrecoverable loss of sight. Here it is stipulated that for the purpose of this case, the insured has normal vision when he wears glasses. A court cannot say in a single judicial breath that he has suffered the irrecoverable loss of his sight within the meaning of the policy and at the same time that he has normal vision. The two are so diametrically in conflict that they cannot be brought into parallelism. The provision in the contract embraces the loss of sight by atrophy of the optic nerve or in some other manner which is irrecoverable, but it cannot be reasonably construed to cover a case where sight was lost but through surgery and the use of glasses normal vision is again enjoyed.\u201d 114 F.2d at 518.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"><em>See also, </em>Southland Life Ins. Co. v. Dunn, 71 S.W.2d 1103 (Tex.Civ.App.1934); Reliable Life Ins. Co. v. Steptoe, 435 S.W.2d 630, 632 (Tex.Civ.App.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> Appellant further argues that he need not attempt to recover his loss of sight by undergoing medical treatment or wearing glasses because Kentucky has not applied the \u201cdoctrine of minimizing damages\u201d to insurance policies. Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Hurt, 254 Ky. 603, 607, 72 S.W.2d 20 (1934). Kentucky law, however, does not prohibit the parties to an insurance policy from inserting the doctrine in the policy. <em>Hurt, supra, </em>at 608, 72 S.W. 2d 20. The word \u201cirrecoverable\u201d in the instant policy requires minimization of damages in that it implies that appellant make an attempt to determine whether his sight could be recovered by means of glasses or surgery. The District Judge, after hearing the medical and other testimony, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">\u201cThis plaintiff can have the loss of sight in his right eye [the injured one] substantially if not completely restored by means of reasonably simple surgery and the use of artificial lenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">As a finding of fact, we consider that the foregoing was not clearly erroneous. See Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. We are of the opinion also that the District Judge made correct application of Kentucky law to whatever factual issues were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
