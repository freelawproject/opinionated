Nix v. Fulton Lodge No. 2, IAM, N.D.Ga.1967, 262 F.Supp. 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">The underlying facts are straightforward and undisputed. Nix was employed by the Grand Lodge of IAM as a press representative for the international union. He became a member of IAM, although membership was not a condition of employment, and affiliated with Fulton Lodge No. 2. His position with IAM was categorized as \u201cstaff employee.\u201d The staff employees were the only unit of IAM not organized and represented by an independent bargaining agent. Nix initiated an organizational campaign to form the IAM Representatives Association, an independent bargaining representative for the staff employees. The campaign extended for a year or more, with heat and passion not diminished by the fact that the employer was itself a union. Nix and IAM President Siemiller circulated mailings to the staff employees and to each other. Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>attempting to catalog all the vigorous remarks and charges made and the industrial warfare that took place, they included charges by Siemiller that Nix was making threats against him and the Executive Council of the union and was subjecting the union to constant harassment and propaganda in the press and elsewhere. Siemiller charged that \u201cNix had made many false statements in the material that he has sent you while conducting his organizing campaign.\u201d Nix made a written charge that per diem was being paid by the union to employees in violation of the constitution, and demanded of Siemiller that he proceed to recover from Siemiller himself, other officers and members of the Executive Council, and the sureties on their bonds, union funds said to have been improperly paid out. Nix brought a \u00a7 8(a) (5) charge against IAM, then withdrew it. He made a series of charges of fraud and misconduct against a member of the Executive Council, and an investigating committee considered the charges and rejected them. Siemiller wrote Nix, implying that he might be discharged, stating that he and his \u201cAssociates on\u00bb the Executive Council\u201d were not justified in continuing Nix\u2019s employment if in their judgment he was not needed. Nix carried on a running argument with Sie-miller about vacation, automobile mileage, exclusion of Nix from meetings, isolation of Nix from other employees, and a variety of other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">A representation case was brought before the National Labor Relations Board. The Board certified the Representatives Association as the appropriate bargaining unit and ordered an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">After the Board order but before the election Nix wrote and disseminated to staff employees a letter stating <em>inter alia </em>that \u201cBob Quick, general chairman of United Airlines (then Capital) didn\u2019t hesitate to picket Grand Lodge when he thought Hayes [former IAM President] ordered him to trample on the rights of his members. You know what happened? They broke their necks getting down to settle things with Bob and get him off that sidewalk. Would Bob do it again? Ask him?\u201d A second letter, responding to Quick\u2019s denial that he ever picketed the international, admitted that the information was derived from hearsay sources, but noted that, on confrontation by Nix, Quick did not deny the incident. These letters were only two of more than twenty mailings that Nix sent out in his organizational efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The election was held and the Representatives Association won. Approximately a month later Siemiller notified Nix that he was fired. A few days later, September 6, 1966, Nix filed unfair practice charges against the union. The next day Bob Quick, a member of and president of an IAM local in California, invoked provisions of the IAM constitution (1966),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and charged Nix with misconduct in making the statements concerning Quick in the two letters described above. The alleged misconduct is that described by Art. L, \u00a7 3, which subjects a member to possible reprimand, fine, suspension and/or expulsion from membership after notice and hearing for, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">Circulating or causing in any manner to be circulated any false or malicious statement reflecting upon the private or public conduct, or falsely or maliciously attacking the character, impugning the motives, or questioning the integrity of any member or officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The charges brought by Quick alleged misconduct in terms tracking the above language almost verbatim except for the insertion of the dates of the two Nix letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">A hearing was conducted before a trial committee <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which knew of the pendency of the charges made by Nix to the NLRB. The committee found that Nix \u201cdid circulate or cause to be circulated a false and/or malicious statement reflecting upon [Quick\u2019s] private or public conduct, which statement falsely and/or maliciously attacked his character and integrity as a Union member.\u201d The committee recommended that Nix be expelled from membership. By overwhelming votes the Fulton Lodge membership sustained both the report and the recommended expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The trial committee noted in its report to the Fulton Lodge membership that it excluded from evidence in the misconduct proceedings \u201cstatements and/or documents [which Nix tried to have admitted] pertaining to his discharge from the Staff and his organizing campaign, which in our opinion as a Trial Committee, had nothing to do with this case.\u201d \u25a0See Part III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">After the trial committee hearing and before the local membership vote, Nix filed his complaint in district court without attempting to exhaust his appellate remedies under the IAM constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In the district court Fulton Lodge filed a three-pronged motion to dismiss: (1) district court jurisdiction was preempted by the unfair practice charge pending before the Board; (2) Nix waived his right to judicial review by his failure to exhaust his internal appellate remedies; (3) and Nix\u2019s statements, made in the context of an organizational campaign, were \u201cextraunion\u201d and consequently unprotected by the free speech provisions of the LMRDA. The motion was denied. On appeal Fulton Lodge raises the identical issues on specification of error, to which is added a fourth: (4) the district court erred in making its order applicable to the IAM Grand Lodge, i. e., to the international union as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">The unfair practice proceedings were still pending when the district court entered its judgment below. Subsequently, but before submission of this appeal, the Board decision was rendered, finding that the discharges of Nix and others were not discriminatorily motivated but that after the Representatives Association was certified as bargaining agent IAM, by refusing to furnish it with requested information, breached its duty to bargain. <em>IAM and Nix </em>et al., 172 NLRB 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">I. Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">Congress expressly provided two broad anti-preemption provisions in the LMRDA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in response to objections initially raised by then Sen. John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This court has held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>that rights guaranteed under the LMRDA are not subject to preemption by the National Labor Relations Board. International Bhd. of Boilermakers, etc. v. Braswell, 5 Cir. 1968, 388 F.2d 193, 195-196.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">II. Exhaustion of remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We have no difficulty in concluding that the district court did not err in holding that the facts of Nix\u2019s ease were such as not to require him to exhaust intra-union remedies under \u00a7 101(4) of LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) (4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Detroy v. American Guild of Variety Artists, 2 Cir. 1961, 286 F.2d 75, 79. The subsection does not establish a jurisdictional bar or absolute waiver to judicial review, but preserves the discretionary exhaustion doctrine which allowed pre-LMRDA courts to determine whether pursuit of internal remedies should be required in a given case. Simmons v.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Avisco, Local 713, Textile Workers, 9 Cir. 1965, 350 F.2d 1012; Detroy, <em>swpra; </em>cf. NLRB v. Industrial Union of Marine &amp; Shipbuilding Workers, 1968, 391 U.S. 418, 88 S.Ct. 1717, 20 L.Ed.2d 706. The first review authority to whom Nix would have been required to apply was IAM President Siemiller, and the next review authority was the Executive Council. The continuing difficulties between Nix on the one hand and Siemiller and the Executive Council on the other fully justified the district court\u2019s conclusion that Nix was not required to attempt to exhaust his intra-union appellate remedies before seeking judicial relief. See Calagaz v. Calhoon, 5 Cir. 1962, 309 F.2d 248, 259-260. Cf. Glover v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co., 1969, 393 U.S. 324, 89 S.Ct. 548, 21 L.Ed.2d 519 (U.S. Jan. 14, 1969) (under Railway Labor Act). The union is the victim of its own appellate review structure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>III. The offensive statements: protected or not?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Fulton Lodge presses the theory that statements made in the context of an in-tra-union organizational campaign are \u201cextra-union\u201d comments and not protected. The fallacy in this argument lies in the facts. Nix was expelled from membership, according to the trial committee report, solely for the effect of the remarks upon Quick\u2019s personal character and union reputation, not on the basis of any organizational activity. As we have noted above, the committee excluded from evidence statements and documents proffered by Nix pertaining to the organizing campaign and to his discharge, on the ground they had nothing to do with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The union-employee and union-officer cases relied on by the union miss the mark.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is a \u201cunion-member\u201d case. <em>See </em>262 F.Supp. at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">The Bill of Rights (Title I) of the LMRDA did not enjoy an orderly genesis.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently the statutory language and the legislative history are a source of confusion as well as enlightenment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The courts, therefore, have substantially shaped the Bill of Rights into a guarantee of union democracy, with the right of free speech enjoying a particularly favored position. The landmark decision interpreting LMRDA \u00a7 101(a) (2) is Saltzhandler v. Caputo, 2 Cir. 1963, 316 F.2d 445, in which the Second Circuit held that a union may not subject to retributive disciplinary action a member accused of libeling or slandering a union officer. The <em>Saltz-handler </em>rationale has been subsequently extended by the courts to protect from disciplinary retribution numerous types of communication.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>From this judicial evolution of the scope of the LMRDA free speech protection, a general rule is perceivable: a union member has the statutory right \u201cto express any views, arguments, or opinions\u201d inside or outside of a union meeting,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> subject to only three general limitations: (1) reasonable union rules relating to the conduct of union meetings; (2) reasonable rules relating to individual responsibility to the union as an institution; and (3) reasonable rules requiring members to refrain from conduct which would interfere with the union\u2019s performance of its legal or contractual obligations. The first limitation is immaterial to the case at bar. The \u201creasonableness\u201d standard of the latter two limitations is a legacy of legislative compromise which leaves the balancing of the institutional interests and individual rights to the trial judge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The district court correctly held that the union did not show Nix\u2019s statements to fall within the ambit of either of these provisos. He cannot be disciplined for the substance and effect of his comments about Quick. <em>See </em>Saltzhandler v. Ca-puto, <em>supra, </em>316 F.2d at 450 n. 8. As the Second Circuit held in <em>Saltzhandler:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agr\">\u201cThe LMRDA of 1959 was designed to protect the rights of union members to discuss freely and criticize the management of their unions and the conduct of their officers. The legislative history and the extensive hearings which preceded the enactment of the statute abundantly evidence the intention of Congress to prevent union officials from using their disciplinary powers to silence criticism and punish those who dare to question and complain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>316 F.2d at 448-449. The statements of Nix here involved were protected speech.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">IV. Scope of relief</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The injunctive relief granted by the district court purported to bind the international organization as well as the local lodge. The international body was not named in the Nix complaint as a party, was not served with process, did not appear as a party, and no express relief was sought against it.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nix moved for leave to join the international as a party, but rather than specifically ruling on the motion the district court treated the action as one against the union as a whole and not against individuals or a branch of the union, considering that the union had no legal existence as an entity separate from its members and that the international was in active concert with the subordinate local by and through the constitution and by-laws. The court concluded that the action was in the nature of a class action. Also it held Fulton Lodge No. 2 was merely an agent of the international.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Unquestionably Fulton Lodge is a creature of the international organization, created and controlled by the IAM constitution and by-laws.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The charges filed with the local organization were dictated by both substantive and procedural directives contained in the IAM constitution. <em>See </em>notes 2 through 5, <em>supra, </em>with accompanying text. Prosecution of charges against an IAM member cannot, under the circumstances, be considered the independent action of an autonomous local organization. Furthermore, membership, though initiated by and through the local organization according to the constitution,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is in the m<em>ternational </em>union.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And the international organization, to a large extent, is responsible for the actions, of its subordinate bodies. <em>See generally </em>Evans, The Law of Agency and the National Union, 49 Ky.L.J. 295 (1961). Cf. 1 CCH Lab.Law Rep. \u00b6 1695.70 (pointing out that the NLRA \u00a7 2(13), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(13), perpetuates the common law rules of agency to govern international-subordinate responsibility). In addition, it would be difficult to effectuate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>purposes of the LMRDA free speech provision in a case such as is before us, where membership is in the international, if the international cannot be subjected to a remedial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">But the existence of the substantive elements of a cause of action did not vest the district court with jurisdiction over the international. LMRDA \u00a7 102, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412 permits the district court to grant \u201csuch relief (including injunctions) as may be appropriate,\u201d but this does not expand in personam jurisdiction beyond that arising from proper designation of a party as defendant and proper service of process upon the party. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a) and 4(d) (3). Calazaz v. Calhoon, 309 F.2d 248 (5th Cir. 1962) is not to the contrary. That case was brought as a class action against all members of a union and against individuals who were representatives of the class. The plaintiff denied any intent of making the union itself a party defendant. Service of process was had on an officer of the union who gave actual notice to the membership who comprised the class. Nix did not name or seek process or relief against the international union to the extent it can be sued as though a jural entity, nor did he bring a class action against members of the international association with process on a member of the class. Nix sued the local lodge and its president. This is not enough to bind the international.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">However, Nix was entitled to amend to seek relief against the international. On remand he should be given that right if he still desires it.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">V. Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The district court reserved for future determination the question of compensatory damages to Nix.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">We affirm in part, vacate in part and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">. Jurisdiction in the district court is based upon LMRDA \u00a7 102, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412. Free speech within the union is guaranteed by the \u201cBill of Rights\u201d provisions of LMRDA (Title I) under \u00a7 101(a) (2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) (2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\"><em>\u201cFreedom of speech and </em>assembly.\u2014 Every member of any labor organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members; and to express any views, arguments, or opinions; and to express at meetings of the labor organization his views, upon candidates in an election of the labor organization or upon any business properly before the meeting, subject to the organization\u2019s established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing herein shall be construed to impair the right of a labor organization to adopt and enforce reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every member toward the organization as an institution and to his refraining from conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or contractual obligations.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\">.

No one can reasonably object to giving a legitimate organization the right to protect its institutional interests ; yet it is undeniable that unions, like other voluntary associations, in time succumb to the \u2018iron law of oligarchy.\u2019 Democracy cannot thrive in an environment hostile to dissent and opposition ; therefore a line must somehow be drawn between legitimate resistance and illegal subversion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-13\"><em>See also </em>Cox, <em>supra, </em>note 12, at 834-835; \u201cDissent in a union, like treason in a nation, must be suppressed if the purpose is to destroy the union, encourage a rival, or bring about the violation of legal or contractual obligations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\">. The protection provided by LMRDA \u00a7 101(a) (2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) (2), is not absolute. A union or its officers simply may not use their disciplinary powers and processes to suppress statements made by a member so long as such comments do not fall within the ambit of the general limitations of the statute designed to provide institutional security. A union member or official who considers himself defamed by the statements of another member, is not preempted by the LMRDA from recourse to a civil action for defamation. See Saltzhandler v.
