It is the responsibility of the federal courts solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties. The essential facts are that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent inhaled dangerous fumes while in the employ of All American Engineering Company. During his lifetime the decedent obtained a judgment of $210,000 against Union Carbide as damages for this mishap, and this judgment was satisfied after an unsuccessful appeal. Some five years later the decedent died, allegedly as a result of the defendant\u2019s above mentioned negligence. Plaintiff brought suit and summary judgment was entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">While New Jersey\u2019s highest court has not ruled on the question raised here, at least two New Jersey cases support the proposition that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is barred and extinguished by the decedent\u2019s having obtained a recovery during his lifetime. Lawlor v. Cloverleaf Memorial Park, Inc., Law Div. 1968, 101 N.J.Super. 134, 243 A.2d 293; Li-bera v. Whittaker, Clark and Daniels, Inc., Law Div. 1952, 20 N.J.Super. 292, 89 A.2d 734. Compare Lawlor v. Cloverleaf Memorial Park, Inc., App.Div.1969, 106 N.J.Super. 374, 256 A.2d 46. We observe that this view is consistent with that of nearly all states having similar statutes. See Annotation, 39 A.L.R. 579 (1925). Moreover, the record does not sustain the contention that the present action involves elements of recoverable damage not covered by the decedent\u2019s earlier suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
