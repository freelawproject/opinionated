See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The district court held that four Negro teachers employed by the Madison Parish school system had been dismissed in violation of the holding in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836, aff\u2019d with modifications on rehearing en banc, 380 F.2d 385, cert. denied sub nom, Caddo Parish School Bd. v. United States, 389 U.S. 840, 88 S.Ct. 67, 19 L.Ed.2d 103 (1967). In so holding, the district court denied the school teachers\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. That denial is the sole question raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Attorneys\u2019 fees are historically beyond the scope of taxable costs. Globemaster, Inc. v. Magic Am. Corp., 6 Cir. 1967, 386 F.2d 420. Their award necessarily requires a permitting statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a contractual obligation, or an equitable discretion in the trial court. Brisacher v. Tracy Collins Trust Company, 10 Cir. 1960, 277 F.2d 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The trial court found that the teachers\u2019 dismissals were not \u201cunreasonable and obdurately obstinate\u201d and accordingly did not tax attorneys\u2019 fees against the school board. See Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, Virginia, 4 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 310. We find no compelling circumstances to justify overturning the trial court\u2019s discretion in refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirm. See Kemp v. Beasley, 8 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 14; Harrington v. Texaco, 5 Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-23\">. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II, specifically allows attorneys\u2019 fees in cases filed to redress discrimination in Pub-lie Accommodation Actions. The Act provides no legal basis for attorneys\u2019 fees in school desegregation cases. Kemp v. Beasley, supra,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
