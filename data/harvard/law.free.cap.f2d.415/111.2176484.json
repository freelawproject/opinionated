They were found guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">All claims of error raised by appellant Deming have been dealt with in Deming v. United States, 415 F.2d 99. They will not be discussed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Appellant Kuhn raises the same issue under Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, as did Deming. We find no error with respect to the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Kuhn also alleges that the District Court erred in permitting Special Agent Carrington, who testified as to the conduct of the gambling operation, to put dates on certain bet slips which were introduced into evidence. Appellant\u2019s theory is that this was done without introducing the documents from which Carrington determined the dates. However, while the chartbooks were not introduced, the racing forms which are the original form in which the information is published were introduced into evidence. Thus Kuhn had the opportunity to test the accuracy of Carrington\u2019s testimony by comparison to the documents on the basis of which he dated the bet slips. There was no error in permitting the dating of the bet slips.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b174-8\">CELEBREZZE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AQh\">(dissenting) .</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">I dissent for the reasons set forth in my dissenting opinion in DiPiazza v. United States and Deming v. United States, 415 F.2d 99. In my opinion, Government agents procurred the search warrants against premises occupied by Deming and Kuhn through abuse of the administrative summons authorized under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 which resulted in a wrongful invasion of rights secured to them under \u00a7 605 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">In January of 1966, I.R.S. special agents purporting to act \u00fander the authority spelled out by Congress in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> summoned telephone company toll records for Deming\u2019s telephone numbers. These records disclosed calls from two telephones used by Deming to a telephone number in .New Orleans, La., used by DiPiazza, and two telephone numbers used by Kuhn in Lexington, Kentucky. The agents then summoned telephone company toll records for Kuhn\u2019s Lexington numbers. These records showed a large number of calls going to Deming\u2019s two telephones. In June of 1966, on the basis of this lead, an I.R.S. special agent called Kuhn\u2019s Lexington telephone numbers and placed wagers with parties there. On July 22, 1966, Government agents obtained search warrants and simultaneously raided premises occupied by Deming and Kuhn. Appellants were convicted on the basis of the evidence seized in these raids.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">Appellants moved to suppress the evidence seized. During the hearing on the motions, the I.R.S. special agent who was in charge of the investigation in these cases and led the raid against Deming\u2019s premises testified that he made his investigation \u201cfor the purpose of prosecution.\u201d In Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. 440, 449, 84 S.Ct. 508, 513, 11 L.Ed.2d 459 (1964), however, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \u00a7 7602 summons could not be used \u201cfor the improper purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.\u201d Consequently, I submit that the summons used by the Government to obtain Appellants\u2019 toll records were not \u201cother lawful authority\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 605. Since I believe that the judgments should be reversed on this basis, I express no opinion regarding Appellants\u2019 contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968) bar the introduction of the evidence seized during the raid of their premises.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\">.
