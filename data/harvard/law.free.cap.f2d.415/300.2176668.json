United States, 368 F.2d 957 (8th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1009, 87 S.Ct. 1353, 18 L.Ed.2d 438 (1967).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">Rowell filed, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, a motion to vacate and set aside the judgment of his conviction theretofore entered by that court. The district court overruled the motion from which order Rowell brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-20\">The contention is made that the statutes under which Rowell was convicted are unconstitutional, as his compliance therewith would have compelled him to incriminate himself in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Subsequent to the hearing in the district court the Supreme Court handed down its decisions in Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969), and United States v. Covington, 395 U.S. 57, 89 S.Ct. 1559, 23 L.Ed.2d 94 (1969), both decisions dealing with the Marihuana Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4741 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-22\">Rowell did not prior to trial or upon appeal to this court from his conviction raise the question of his privilege against self-incrimination, but raised the issue for the first time in his motion to the district court, which is the subject of this appeal. The Government does not challenge Rowell\u2019s standing to raise the constitutional issue now. In Becton v. United States, 412 F.2d 1005 (8th Cir. June 27, 1969), this court held that where there is no indication in the record that the defendant waived his right to raise the Fifth Amendment privilege, it is entirely appropriate and \u201cjust under the circumstances\u201d to pass upon the constitutional issue. To the same effect, see United States v. Covington, su<em>pra, </em>and Miller v. United States, 412 F.2d 1008 (8th Cir. June 27, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>There is no indication in this record that Rowell waived his Fifth Amendment rights and it is appropriate therefore that we pass upon the constitutional issue as now raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Following <em>Leary </em>and <em>Covington, </em>this court held in <em>Becton, supra, </em>and <em>Miller, supra, </em>handed down simultaneously with <em>Becton, </em>that the attempted application of \u00a7 4744(a) is unconstitutional as violative of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">More recently, another panel of this court held in Baker v. United States, 412 F.2d 1010 (8th Cir. July 3, 1969), that there is no significant difference between \u00a7 4744(a) and \u00a7 4742(a), and that the Fifth Amendment, when timely raised, is a complete defense to a charge brought under \u00a7 4742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">These recent decisions of this court are thus controlling and require that this ease be reversed and remanded for entry of an order granting petitioner\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-14\">.
