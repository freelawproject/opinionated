ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b987-23\">In D. C. Transit System, Inc. v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission (Transit I),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reviewed the Commission\u2019s Order No. 245,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> promulgated after a public hearing in 1963, by which Transit was authorized to raise its token fare for passenger transportation within the District of Columbia and between the District and points in Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We then resolved several subsidiary issues germinated by that order, but were unable to pass judgment as to the legal propriety of the fare increase. The order in that aspect was predicated upon the Commission\u2019s finding that a margin of return of $1,480,746, representing a <em>4.87% </em>rate of return on Transit\u2019s operating revenues, was just and reasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Upon examination of the record, however, we discovered that we had \u201cno intelligible basis for disposing of the competing claims before us that the return allowed by the Commission is, on the one hand, too high, and, on the other, too low.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we remanded the case to the Commission \u201cfor further proceedings * * * to determine the margin of return over and above operating expenses that Transit should be allowed.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">On September 17, 1965, shortly before our remanding order was certified to the Commission, Transit filed a new tariff making numerous fare changes for 1966,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> including elevations in the District cash fare from 25 to 30 cents, and in the District token fare from 21.25 to 25 cents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Exerting a power conferred by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact (Compact),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Commission promptly suspended the new tariff pending a determination as to its reasonableness, and thereafter conducted a public hearing on the proposals it contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">On January 26, 1966, in purported response to our remand, and without prior notice or further hearing for the purpose, the Commission entered Order No. 563,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in supplementation of Order No. 245, reaffirming the return for 1963 the latter had previously allowed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It simultaneously issued Order No. 564,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in which it found that a margin of return for 1966 of about $2,000,000 above operating revenues, symbolizing a return rate of 6.03%, would be fair and reasonable,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but that the- existing fare scale would generate net earnings estimated at only $648,357.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commission nonetheless felt that a fare increase, save in a minor respect not questioned here, was unnecessary because of the availability of $2,-166,933 in a special reserve which had been created in consequence of our decision in Bebchick v. Public Utilities Commission.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In lieu of an increase, the Commission permitted Transit to draw upon the reserve for approximately $1,-350,000 to accommodate the anticipated deficit in its earnings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">Timely petitions for rehearing,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> denied by the Commission, ripened for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>present review<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> various issues stemming from these orders.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> No. 20,200 brings contentions that Order No. 563 is invalid for lack of notice and hearing, and is erroneous on the merits. No. 20,-201 presents importantly the claim that the margin of return awarded by Order No. 564 is unreasonable, and it, like No. 20,202, includes attacks upon other Commission findings and conclusions. We proceed now to a consideration of the problems thus engendered, in the sequence <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we deem best suited to exposition of the reasons for which we set each of the Commission\u2019s orders aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">1963 Margin Of Return Following our remand, the Commission promulgated in Order No. 563 its supplemental findings to Order No. 245, and \u201caffirmed\u201d its earlier finding that a margin of return representing a rate of 4.87% on operating revenues \u201cwas fair and reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Petitioners in No. 20,200 attack Order No. 563 on the ground that it does not comply with our instructions governing the Commission\u2019s task on remand.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The disclosures made by the record, now to be delineated, lead us to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>We pointed out in <em>Transit I </em>that the return of 4.87% possesses no inherent validity, and voiced our \u201cneed to know more than we have been told about why the Commission thought this was the appropriate margin.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We observed that the margin of return properly allowable over legitimate operating expenses is \u201cthe sum of money needed to attract the capital, both debt and equity, required to insure financial stability and the resulting capacity of the utility to render the service upon which the public depends.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And we stressed the necessity for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-4\">\u201cinquiries and findings \u2014 judgmental as the latter may often be because ratemakers must be prophets of the future as well as historians of the past \u2014into such things as the capital programs in prospect, what such programs entail in terms of down-payments as well as financing, the cost of borrowing money, working capital needs, the desirable ratio of debt to equity, the incentives required by a stockholder to keep his money in the business and the dividends and growth rates requisite to supply these incentives, the opportunities in these respects provided in comparable businesses, and the related matters which must be prayerfully explored by the conscientious regulator before he can begin to say why he fixed upon 4.87 rather than 6.5 or 3.2.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB0\">Despite these explicit guidelines, we search in vain the Commission\u2019s supplemental opinion for the vital findings, or for any manifestation that the Commission has made the inquiries referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The bulk of Order No. 563 is devoted to a summary of the testimony of various witnesses given during the 1963 hearing. The summary covers such matters as Transit\u2019s rate base; the capital structures of Transit and other utilities; Transit\u2019s cost of capital and that of other utilities; the degree of risk borne by Transit shareholders, as compared with other regulated utilities; dividends and earnings of Transit and its parent,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and those of other utilities; Transit\u2019s estimated debt expense for the future annual period; actual and authorized operating ratios of Transit and other utilities; and the average market prices of the stock of Transit\u2019s parent. Having thus reviewed the record in somewhat greater detail than in its original order, the Commission then simply reaffirmed its earlier conclusion on the rate of return in language strikingly reminiscent of that which when remanding we had characterized as \u201cstock generalizations which serve only to frustrate, rather than illuminate, judicial review:\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-9\">\u201cWe have before us then an abundance of testimony relating to returns authorized and/or earned by transit companies, telephone companies, electric companies, and gas companies. This information allows us to examine earnings on investments carrying, to some degree, a comparable risk, and are of some value when considered in relation to this particular company. No single rate of return is universally applicable to all transit companies in the United States. A fair rate of return varies with the times and conditions of a particular company as these conditions and opportunities exist at the time of the weighing of the facts in the making of a determination. What constitutes a reasonable rate of return is a question of fact, the solution of which calls for the exercise of sound judgment and common sense by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-10\">\u201cWe have weighed very carefully all testimony and exhibits in this proceeding, along with supplemental data where noted. We are of the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>that fares producing an operating ratio in the range of 95 to 95.5 constituted a fair and proper return. The projected net operating income of $1,-480,000 was the amount necessary to enable Transit to service its debt, pay reasonable dividends, retain a reasonable portion in its business, and to attract investments of private investors. It was, in addition, the amount necessary to maintain investor confidence and to protect the company from the risks peculiar to the transit industry and to Transit itself.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">\n<em>Dividend Payout</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The Commission\u2019s opinion is almost wholly devoid of any indication of the method by which it calculated that a margin of return of $1,480,000 was fair and reasonable. The Commission did account for a portion of that sum by finding that a dividend payout of $500,000 would be reasonable \u2014 apparently in response to our observation that \u201cTransit\u2019s annual dividend pay-out of about $500,-000 appears to have been treated as if it were a cost of operation, like the annual expenditure for gas and oil, with no examination of, or conclusion about, its appropriateness.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Our concern, however, is hardly alleviated by the Commission\u2019s treatment of this point on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-12\">\u201cWhile there was no direct testimony as to the dollar amount required to be available for dividends, the record does show that $500,000 has been paid out annually over past years to the investors. In view of the fact that in the past three years the market price of the parent company has been relatively stable, it appears to us that the margin of profit allowed by the Commission was fair and reasonable to both the investor and the consumer.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">The Commission\u2019s stock price stability theory cannot survive close scrutiny. A stable market price could indicate that a constant dividend yield has been consistently too high or too low, as well as that it has been fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, the theory finds little support in the record,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and we have been refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>red to no authority buttressing the validity of this method of establishing the appropriateness of a dividend.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Thus we are left, as before, without an acceptable rationale for a dividend payout of $500,-000, but only the fact that over a period of years Transit has paid annual dividends in that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">\n<em>Return on Rate Base</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AeI\">The Commission\u2019s ratemaking responsibilities are by no means exhausted by any determination it may make as to a fair dividend.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Even were we able to sustain the Commission in that regard, we would not be enabled thereby to affirm the Commission\u2019s allowance of a total return of $1,480,000. What is needed is a reasoned justification of the end_. result \u2014 the entire excess of gross operating revenues allowed over operating expenses. Here, however, the Commission does not provide any suitable explanation of or support for its ultimate conclusion that a margin of return of $1,480,000 is fair and reasonable. Save for its verdict with respect to the dividend payout, the only concrete finding that the Commission made is that the authorized margin of return would be equivalent to a return on rate base of approximately 6%%.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We express no view on the reasonableness of such a return on rate base, nor on the accuracy of the Commission\u2019s statement that such a return is \u201cconservative.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We do stress, as we did in our former opinion, that testing the reasonableness of an operating ratio by reference to the return on rate base, while sometimes useful, \u201ccan never be conclusive. The important thing is not that the result reached by the operating ratio method be compared with that which would have been reached under some other method, but that the operating ratio method be applied rationally and intelligibly in the first instance.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Absent a calculation of operating ratio responsive to the considerations enumerated in our opinion remanding the Commission\u2019s reference to return on rate base could not provide independent support for the result it reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">\n<em>Costs of Capital</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">On our prior revi\u00e9w, we took note of the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in FPC v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>Hope Natural Gas Co.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> that \u201cin balancing investor and consumer interests, it is essential to consider the capital costs of the enterprise.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We emphasized that the operating ratio method does not make an inquiry into capital costs irrelevant, and that indeed \u201cit was in part the failure of rates established by the rate base method to cover the capital costs of most motor carriers\u201d that gave birth to the operating ratio method.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">During the course of the 1963 hearing, bofh Transit and the protestants <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> submitted evidence relating to Transit\u2019s cost of capital. Transit\u2019s expert witness testified to a combined cost of debt and equity capital for Transit of 7.8%, derived from industry averages.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> He stated further that this figure could not itself be taken to represent a fair return, but would have to be adjusted upward, to about 10%, to allow for a reasonable addition to surplus.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The 10%, he said, could be applied to the \u201cphysical value of the plant that is devoted to public service\u201d in order to determine a fair return.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Protestants\u2019 expert recommended that Transit be permitted to earn gross revenues sufficient to provide a return on its equity capital of 12% after allowing for operating expenses and interest on its debt. He reached this figure after study of the earnings-price ratios of Transit\u2019s corporate parent<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and 12 urban transit companies that he felt were \u201cmost comparable\u201d to Transit. Over the ten-year period from 1952 through 1961, he found, the average of the 12 companies was approximately 11%. This he increased to 12% to compensate for the increased risk borne by Transit\u2019s shareholders emanating from Transit\u2019s abnormally high debt-equity ratio.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> He stated that the 12% could be applied to Transit\u2019s average book equity for 1963 in order to provide a fair return on equity.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> He then added the resulting figure to Transit\u2019s estimated debt expense for the test period, and arrived at a sum which he felt should be allowed as the margin of return over operating expenses.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-15\">The Commission made no findings based on any of this evidence, and did not analyze the cost of capital testimony of Transit\u2019s expert witness. With respect to the testimony of protestants\u2019 expert, the Commission had only this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-16\">\u201cMoreover, we have considered but placed little emphasis on protestant\u2019s recommended rate of return utilizing the cost-of-capital method. It should be noted that more traditionally the computation of the cost of capital is done by determining the cost of debt and of equity and weighting the two for a composite rate. The protestants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>in this case disregarded this traditional method. We feel that the cost-of-capital method utilized is inappropriate in determining a proper rate of return for a transit company. Our view is reinforced when we consider the capital structure of this particular company. Other factors in addition to cost of capital should be considered in making the return allowance. These additional factors include the degree of risk involved, a comparison of earnings, the ability to attract capital, the economic conditions of both the market place and the community, the efficiency of management, and the contribution to surplus. We have seen that the recommendation of the pro-testante expert witness is based not on a mathematical formula but a weighting of any [sic] judgmental factors. Thus, the \u2018judgment\u2019 factors tend to undermine the objectivity of the end results. This is especially true when the answers given by the witness on his cross-examination are compared with his direct testimony.\u201d <footnotemark>48</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArK-\">We are unable to understand the Commission\u2019s failure to make findings on the critical cost of capital factor. Nor are we persuaded by its stated reason for rejecting the approach taken by protestants\u2019 expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In the first place, that protestants\u2019 expert \u201cdisregarded\u201d the \u201ctraditional method\u201d and testified to a cost of equity capital, rather than an overall or combined cost of capital, does not appear to us to deprive his testimony of utility. The witness explained why he talked in terms of a cost of equity capital: \u201cI do not employ a composite rate of return, as I believe that my method of allowing the actual interest expenses, and a determination of the return on the actual equity investment is simpler and gives approximately the same result.\u201d Had the Commission desired, the protestants\u2019 figure for cost of equity capital could have been transformed quite easily into a figure representing a combined cost of debt and equity capital.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> As we have noted, Transit\u2019s witness did testify to an overall cost of capital.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">We are also puzzled by the Commission\u2019s statement that \u201cthe cost of capital method * * * is inappropriate in determining-a proper rate of return for a transit company,\u201d and we do not understand how this view is \u201creinforced\u201d by reference to \u201cthe capital structure of this particular company.\u201d Indeed, it is difficult to see how else the Commission could hope to determine \u201cthe sum of money needed to attract the capital, both debt and equity, required to insure financial stability\u201d than through an analysis of the sort proposed by the two expert witnesses.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> And though Transit\u2019s unusual capital structure may have a bearing on its costs of acquiring debt and equity capital,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> it is unclear why that factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>precludes ascertainment and consideration of such costs at all.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">\n<em>Comparable Earnings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">By including \u201ca comparison of earnings\u201d in its list of \u201cadditional factors\u201d the Commission may have had reference to FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co.,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> where the Supreme Court said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7LFt\"><em>\u2018\u2018the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks. </em>That return, moreover, should be sufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise, so as to maintain its credit and to attract capital.\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">As various commentators have noted,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> implicit in this language are two methods for determining a fair rate of return. One, commonly referred to as the \u201cattraction of capital\u201d standard, attempts to do so by looking to the capital costs of the enterprise as reflected in earnings-price ratios. The other, frequently denominated the \u201ccomparable earnings\u201d standard and suggested by the italicized portion of the language quoted, is based on a comparison of the return on equity of the subject company with the returns afforded by other companies. Thus, while we are unable to accept the Commission\u2019s reasons for rejecting the cost of capital evidence presented to it, we certainly do not intend to intimate any disagreement with the Commission\u2019s statement that \u201ca comparison of earnings\u201d is an additional factor to be considered.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> On the contrary, we strongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>admonish that a comparison of the returns being afforded Transit\u2019s shareholders with those of other companies of corresponding risk is necessary to a responsible determination of the proper margin of return which Transit should be allowed.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the Commission\u2019s allusion in this case to the comparable earnings standard,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> it is clear that it made no meaningful evaluation of the level of returns being afforded Transit shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">In remanding, we noted that, at the time Transit began operations, the company\u2019s heavy debt capitalization <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> \u201cmade inevitable large returns on equity to the extent that the relatively heavy interest requirements were safely covered and the gamble on traffic levels after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>the resumption of operations was won.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> But we added that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-5\">\u201cThe urgency of the problem of traffic uncertainty has, however, receded appreciably into the past. Although it continues to exist to some degree by reason of the seemingly inexhaustible enthusiasm of motorists and highway builders, on the one hand, and persistent speculation about rail rapid transit, on the other, we think the time has come for the Commission to make a careful review and analysis of the earnings experience of Transit from its inception, and of what that experience has meant to the equity owners, both by way of dividend payments and growth in book values through retained earnings. We do not see how current fare increases can properly be appraised apart from such a study, and the reflection of its results in the articulation of the Commission\u2019s decision as to the margin of revenues over expenses appropriate to today\u2019s needs, as distinct from the crisis conditions of nearly a decade ago.\u201d <footnotemark>62</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">The Commission responded to these comments by setting forth gross statis<em>ties on </em>Transit\u2019s total , and average-per-year retained earnings over a nine-year period, and the range of net operating income figures over that period. It observed that \u201cthe rate of dividend growth has been zero since 1960,\u201d noted \u201clittle growth trend in the earnings per share,\u201d and stated that \u201c[t]he degree of stock price stability in the market place indicates to us that earnings in the past have not been excessive.\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s approach thus appears to have been to justify current earnings and dividends by reference to those of the past, in clear contrast to our mandate that the Commission articulate its \u201cdecision as to the margin of revenues over expenses <em>appropriate to today\u2019s needs as distinct from the crisis conditions of nearly a decade </em>ago.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">There is much information in the records of both the 1963 and 1965 rate proceedings relative to Transit\u2019s return on equity, as well as the returns being earned by companies with which Transit might be compared,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> but the Commission made no findings based on any of this evidence. We respect the Commission\u2019s primary fact-finding responsibility, but we cannot ignore the substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>indications in the record that the Commission has permitted Transit to earn extraordinarily high returns on its investment. The protestants in the 1963 proceeding introduced evidence that Transit\u2019s average book equity for 1963 <footnotemark>66</footnotemark> would be $4,206,990;<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and its debt expense for that period $602,089.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> On this basis the total return of $1,480,746 allowed by the Commission represents a return on equity of $878,657, or approximately 21% .<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Transit introduced data showing the average earnings on common stock equity of 15 transit companies for 1959-61 to be 8.7%,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and the protestants showed average earnings on book equity of 12 transit companies for 1952-61 to be 7.5%.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Transit\u2019s evidence in the 1965 proceeding discloses the average return on book equity for 18 urban transit companies for the period 1960 to 1964 to have been approximately 4.5%, while Transit\u2019s average return on book equity for the same period was 23.3%. Protestants introduced exhibits revealing that, for the period 1959 to 1964, Transit\u2019s average return on book equity was 24.01% while the average for ten transit companies for that period was 9.45%.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">One witness in the 1963 proceeding testified that Transit had experienced \u201cabnormally high earnings on the equity investment,\u201d and calculated that over a six-year period Transit had accrued earnings in excess of \u201cfair annual earnings on book equity,\u201d which he set at 14%, in the amount of $3,882,000. Another witness in the 1965 proceeding testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-13\">\u201cwhen one looks at the figures [representing Transit\u2019s return on equity] * * * one wonders whether or not he is looking at the figures for a regulated utility. * * * [T]here are many highly speculative industries which would like to be able to hold out such high returns to the equity in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>vestor. <em>I know of no other utility company that can show as high a return on equity, on average, as this </em>one.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">We do not decide, whether, based on this record, the Commission could have made a sustainable finding that the return allowed by Order No. 245 was \u201ccommensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks.\u201d <footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In view of the Commission\u2019s failure to make a finding one way or the other on that question, no such inquiry on our part is called for.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> We do think, however, that the Commission\u2019s failure to deal meaningfully with the evidence we have summarized is significant as a further indication that it has misconceived the nature of its responsibilities and the kind of inquiries and determinations that must be made in setting rates under the operating ratio method. In the absence of any inquiry into the appropriateness of the returns being afforded Transit shareholders in the light of returns being earned by other companies of comparable risk,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">the peculiar risks borne by Transit shareholders,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> and any other relevant factors, we are unable to conclude that the Commission has responsibly complied with its statutory mandate to prescribe just and reasonable fares.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">In sum, we find in the Commission\u2019s supplemental opinion little in the way of \u201cparticularized reference\u201d to the matters discussed in our remand opinion, none of the essential findings called for, and no manifestation of inquiry into any of the considerations \u201cwhich must be prayerfully explored by the conscientious regulator before he can begin to say why he fixed upon 4.8 rather than 6.5 or 3.2.\u201d <footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Instead, it has clearly treated Transit\u2019s $500,000 dividend payout as a \u201ccost of operation\u201d without any inquiry into its appropriateness. It has dismissed evidence as to Transit\u2019s cost of capital as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d And it has made no meaningful evaluation of the returns being afforded Transit shareholders. We think it evident that, though purporting to equate a fair return with \u201cthe amount necessary to enable Transit to service its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>debt, pay reasonable dividends, retain a reasonable portion in its business, and to attract investments of private investors,\u201d <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> the Commission has neglected to apply that principle in practice. Under these circumstances, the disposition we should make of the orders under review is a matter of some difficulty, to which we now turn our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">On our original review of this case in <em>Transit I, </em>we were unable to discern from the Commission\u2019s opinion the method by which it had computed the return to be allowed Transit. Because the Commission had \u201cdescribed its deliberations and conclusions * * * [solely] in terms of stock generalizations which serve only to frustrate, rather than illuminate, judicial review,\u201d <footnotemark>78</footnotemark> we were left without \u201can adequate basis for knowing why it did what it did.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> But notwithstanding our uncertainty as to whether the Commission had actually made the inquiries and the concomitant decisions we held to be required by the statute,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> we were unwilling to conclude, merely from the absence of findings in its order, that the Commission had not performed its duties.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Thus we did not disturb the effectiveness of the fare increase granted by Order No. 245, nor did we make provisions for restitution by Transit of increased fares collected pursuant to that order.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Instead, we remanded to the Commission to enable it to clarify the grounds of its action or, if necessary, to formulate a new order.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-17\">The case now before us, however, is quite different. The Commission, once again, does not advance a rational basis for its determination of rate of return\u2014 despite the opportunity afforded it to do so, after we had enunciated the applicable principles and emphasized the need for findings.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Moreover, it now appears affirmatively that at no time in this proceeding has the Commission made the investigations and the resolutions essential to a legitimate exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>of its authority to prescribe just and reasonable fares.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Since we cannot escape the conclusion that the Commission\u2019s approval of the fare increase was based upon a mistaken view of its responsibilities in setting rates under the operating ratio method, we hold that Orders Nos. 245 and 563 must be set aside <footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">The question nonetheless remains whether we should again remand to the Commission, to permit further consideration and a new order. For even where agency action must be set aside as invalid, but the agency is still legally free to pursue a valid course of action, a reviewing court will ordinarily remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>to enable the agency to enter a new order after remedying the defects that vitiated the original action.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> A remand for this purpose, however, necessarily assumes continuing power in the agency to deal with the subject matter of the proceeding. Where, because of changed circumstances,<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> or because of the decisional grounds nullifying the initial order,<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> the agency does not possess that authority, a remand is manifestly unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Orders Nos. 245 and 563 have been superseded by later fare orders entered by the Commission subsequent to our remand in <em>Transit </em>I-<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The propriety of another remand thus hangs on the Commission\u2019s power to devise a new order, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>governing the years intervening between Order No. 245 and the entry of a subsequent order prescribing the \u201clawful fare * * * to be in effect.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The Commission, however, possesses no authority to fix rates for the past. An order prescribing the lawful fares to be charged by a public utility, being essentially legislative in character, ordinarily speaks only for the future.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> And we find nothing in the statutory provisions governing the Commission\u2019s regulatory responsibilities <footnotemark>93</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>indicates an intent to depart from this \u201ccustomary pattern of fixing rates prospectively.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Hence, we conclude that the Commission lacks power to enter a new rate order in this proceeding, and that a remand for further consideration is not called for.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"agn-dedup-0\"> With Orders Nos. 245 and 563 invalid and further remand now futile,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>it follows that Transit must be compelled to make appropriate restitution for the increased fares it collected.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> This conclusion is unaffected by the fact that we do not decide that the fares authorized are unjust or unreasonable as a matter of law. Our role as a reviewing court is not to make an independent determination as to whether fares fixed by the Commission are just and reasonable, but rather to insure that the Commission, in exercising its rate-making power, has acted rationally and lawfully. Our function is normally exhausted when we have determined that the Commission has respected procedural requirements, has made findings based on substantial evidence, and has applied the correct legal standards to its substantive deliberations.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Our task is likewise at an end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>when we have ascertained that the Commission has not done so.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> In this case, given our conclusion that the Commission failed to apply appropriate criteria, and failed to make the inquiries prerequisite to valid exercise of its rate-setting authority, we could not permit Transit to retain the increased fares, since to do so would be to give legal effeet to the Commission\u2019s invalid order.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> This is so notwithstanding that we have held neither that the Commission lacked power to order a fare increase, nor even that the fares authorized are, as a mat\u00a3er 0f jaw&gt; unjust or unreasonable.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK9G\">Thus we are confronted with the necessity of formulating the criteria by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>which the amount of restitution is to be measured. Ordinarily, of course, the proper disposition on setting aside a rate increase unlawfully ordered by the Commission would be to compel the regulated company to restore the entire difference between the higher fares collected under the invalid order and the amount that it would have received from the fare schedule previously in effect.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> More fundamentally, however, our decision in this regard is to be governed by the equitable considerations which apply to suits for restitution generally<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> The basic question is whether \u201cthe money was obtained in such circumstances that the possessor will give offense to equity and good conscience if permitted to retain it,\u201d and is \u201cno longer whether the law would put him in possession of the money if the transaction were a new one.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Since restitution is not a matter of right, but is <em>\u201cex gratia, </em>resting in the exercise of a sound discretion,\u201d <footnotemark>105</footnotemark> it lies within our authority to direct restitution in an amount less than the whole sum of the increased fares collected under the invalid order,<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> or to deny it altogether, if compelling equitable considerations so dictate.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> The exercise of such an equitable discretion by this court is by no means an usurpation of the administrative powers of the Commission nor is it an arbitrary extension of judicial authority; it is \u201cmere inaction and passivity in line with the historic attitude of courts of equity for centuries.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">Because we have found the Commission\u2019s action in approving the fare increase to have been invalid, and because we have no basis in later valid action of the Commission for inferring that the rates set by Order No. 245 were in fact, just and reasonable, despite the defects in the Commission\u2019s deliberations leading to their original approval,<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> we could not, as we have said, give legal effect to those rates by withholding restitution altogether. At the same time, we are confronted by circumstances indicating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>substantial probability that it would be inequitable to compel Transit to restore the entire amount it realized from the fare increase. More specifically, we see that by Order No. 245 the Commission found that the net income of $937,669 which Transit would earn under the then existing fare schedule would not constitute a \u201cfair and adequate return,\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> and nowhere in this proceeding has that finding been challenged. Indeed, the evidence presented by protestants at the 1963 hearing was to the effect that a return of $1,107,000 would be fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Additionally, we note that the net income which the Commission found Transit would earn in consequence of the preexisting fares would have represented a return on equity of less than 8%,<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> while protestants\u2019 expert witness recommended a return on equity of 12%.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> And in a later rate proceeding, after determining Transit\u2019s cost of capital and taking into account the returns afforded by other companies of comparable risk, the Commission found to be fair and reasonable a return on equity of 14%,<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> a determination today affirmed by this court as based on adequate findings and reasons supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> We could not permit the Commission\u2019s latter conclusion to control the amount of restitution now to be ordered, since it was based on a record reflecting conditions in years later than the period relevant here,<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> and it did not purport to be a determination of a fair return for the years with which we are concerned.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> On the other hand, it has obvious significance as a factor suggesting the inequity in ordering Transit to repay the entire amount of the fare increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">In sum, we find substantial and unmistakable indications, in the record under review as well as in a subsequent determination of the Commission which we have affirmed, that it would be unfair to order Transit to restore the full amount it realized under the invalid fare increase. In so concluding, we have placed particular reliance upon the Commission\u2019s finding as to the amount of net income which would have been earned by Transit under the fare schedule in effect prior to Order No. 245. That finding was properly grounded, conformably with the Commission\u2019s role in fixing rates to operate in the future, upon estimates of expenses to be incurred and revenues to be received during the future test period. But we perceive no justification for permitting such a prediction to control the course we are to follow in equitably disposing of funds collected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>during years already past.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> \u201cThere are times, to be sure, when resort to prophecy becomes inevitable in default of methods more precise. At such times, \u2018an honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances\u2019 is the only or-ganon at hand. * * * But prophecy, however honest, is generally a poor substitute for experience.\u201d<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> We think these observations are applicable here, and we are unable to see how any proper resolution of the matter of restitution in the circumstances presented could ignore the reality of Transit\u2019s financial experience during the years in question.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">In laying down a standard by which to measure Transit\u2019s right to retain funds collected under the fare increase, we are aware that we are ill-equipped, even were we authorized to do so, to search the record and reach our independent conclusions as to what would have constituted reasonable fares for the period in question. Nevertheless, the duty to reach a just decision in this regard cannot be shirked, and our effort must be to find a solution which lies within our competence as a reviewing court, while at the same time responding in the fullest possible measure to the equitable considerations that must guide us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">The disposition we deem most consonant with this objective would compel Transit to restore the amount realized by the fare increase only to the extent that its actual return is not reduced to an amount which all parties have agreed would be unreasonably low. Thus Transit will be permitted to retain any portion of the higher fares necessary to preserve its actual earnings during the years in question<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> at the level conceded by the protestants to represent a fair return. In so doing, we do not say that the Commission erred in failing to adopt the testimony of protestants\u2019 expert witness, nor that fares designed to produce the return proposed by the protestants would have been the only lawful fares, nor even that they would have been just and reasonable. We decide only that in the circumstances of this case it clearly does not offend \u201cequity and good conscience\u201d to permit Transit to retain that part of the fare increase essential to avoidance of an undisputedly unfair return. One circumstance upon which we place considerable weight in reaching this conclusion is the availability of the Commission\u2019s 1967 decision permitting a return to the equity holder quite close to that recommended by the protestants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>in this proceeding.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Though, for reasons already explained, we are unable to regard that determination as controlling with respect to the question before us, we think it is entitled to weight as \u201cthe opinion of a body of experts upon matters within the range of their special knowledge and experience.\u201d <footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Being cognizant of the dangers in attributing finality to positions taken by the parties in a proceeding which so broadly affects the interests of the public as this one, we do not decide whether, in the absence of that later determination by the Commission, the course taken here would be open to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The Acquisition Adjustment Account</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Petitioners in No. 20,201 complain of a fundamental change by the Commission in the method of its treatment of Transit\u2019s acquisition adjustment account, which has engaged our attention before.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> The event giving rise to this account was Transit\u2019s purchase in 1956 of properties from its predecessor, Capital Transit Company (Capital), at a price lower by $10,339,041 than the net original cost of those properties to Capital.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> Transit\u2019s allowances for depreciation thereon could, of course, have been related to its own acquisition cost; but this would have required the development of new depreciation rates computed on remaining life, and new depreciation bases derived in part from distribution of the purchase price among the items of property acquired. To save the labor incidental to that process, however, the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia (PUC), the Commission\u2019s predecessor, ordered that two things be done. One was the establishment of the acquisition adjustment account to accommodate an amortization, over a ten-year period beginning August 15, 1956, of the $10,339,041 difference in acquisition cost to Capital and Transit, respectively.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> The other was a direction that depreciation be accrued on the basis of Capital\u2019s original cost and at the rates previously fixed for Capital, with ten annual offsetting credits to operating expenses of $1,033,904 derived from the amortization.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-14\">PUC selected the ten-year period for amortization in order to link it to an annual accrual of $1,044,196 over the identical period to a reserve designed to absorb Transit\u2019s estimated future expenses for track removal and street repaving incidental to its franchise-required conversion from Capital\u2019s trolleybus operation to Transit\u2019s eventual all-bus operation.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> With the amortization and the accrual in almost the same annual amount for exactly the same period, any material impact from either upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Transit\u2019s income posture would be avoided.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">In Order No. 245, however, the Commission suspended the annual accruals to the reserve as of January 1, 1963, concluding that its existing balance would cover all of Transit\u2019s removal and repaving expenses anticipated for the immediate future.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> The Commission stated that it would also reexamine, the period for liquidation of the acquisition adjustment balance in light of PUC\u2019s decision to coincide its amortization with the period established for accruals to the reserve for removal and repaving.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> The Commission observed that \u201cthe proper [original] solution [by PUC], completely equitable to both applicant and the ratepayers, would have required the total sum represented by the acquisition adjustment account to be distributed \u2018over all items of depreciable property\u2019 as recorded on the books as of August 15, 1956,\u201d <footnotemark>132</footnotemark> and it felt that such treatment \u201cwould have been the only completely accurate and equitable method.\u201d <footnotemark>133</footnotemark> The Commission would, it said, \u201crelate the acquisition adjustment balance to the properties acquired on August 15, 1956, which are still in service and subject to depreciation at original cost\u201d<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> but, noting that additional evidence was needed for this purpose, it ordered that amortization of the acquisition adjustment account continue without change \u201cuntil adequate evidence supporting a different rate [of amortization] is presented to the commission.\u201d<footnotemark>135</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">In <em>Transit I, </em>we upheld the Commission\u2019s determination on this point.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Shortly before we did so, however, the Commission, by Order No. 385, had proceeded to alter radically the scheme for amortization of the acquisition adjustment balance.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> Without taking further evidence, it decided that as of January 1, 1964, the period for amortization of the balance of $2,519,484<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> would be extended to August 15, 1976, the duration of Transit\u2019s franchise.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> The Commission thus enlarged the remaining original period, which would have expired on August 15, 1966, for the write-off of this balance from approximately two and one-half years to about twelve and one-half years, and reduced the amount of the annual amortization from the previous $1,033,904 to the much lower figure of $199,561.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-18\">In directing this change, the Commission did not relate the liquidation of the acquisition adjustment balance to any new schedule for depreciation of the involved properties, a procedure it had promised in Order No. 245 and one which we had regarded as \u201cmost sensible.\u201d <footnotemark>141</footnotemark> Instead, it said that amortization of that balance within the remaining two and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>one-half years of the period originally prescribed might so reduce net operating profits after the terminal point on August 15, 1966 as to require another fare increase.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> Thus arising is the question whether the Commission was at liberty to alter the mode of amortization, with a view to pegging Transit\u2019s fares, without correlating in some reasonable fashion, the new method in time and amount to ongoing depreciation of the acquired properties, for the inflated book values of which the acquisition adjustment account was established as an offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">As a preliminary matter, though, we face, but reject, a common protest by Transit and the Commission that petitioners are foreclosed from litigating that issue because they did not seek a review of Order No. 385, by which the change complained of was directed. The Commission promulgated Order No. 385 without a hearing of any sort, in spite of its claim, in defending its earlier Order No. 245 before us in <em>Transit I, </em>that it had to have more evidence before it could intelligently alter the amortization of the acquisition adjustment balance.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> And when the Commission adopted Order No. 385, it proceeded upon a completely new theory \u2014 the need to stabilize Transit\u2019s fares. There was no opportunity for the protestants to combat the change, or the basis upon which it was made, before it became a reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Petitioners made a timely application to the Commission for reconsideration of Order No. 385. In denying it, the Commission proclaimed \u25a0 that the order was \u201csubject to complete analysis and review in any future rate proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> This very clearly left the matter open to reexamination, and indeed the Commission reexamined it in Order No. 564, this time rejecting petitioners\u2019 objection on the merits.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> It is the determination made in the latter order, presently under review, that petitioners now attack, and this they may properly do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">Reverting to the merits of petitioners\u2019 contention, we find that the Commission\u2019s new plan for amortization of the acquisition adjustment balance largely sets for naught fundamental considerations the Commission was obliged to observe. One was the intended function of the amorization as the counterweight to excessive depreciation charges. While, on the assets Transit bought from Capital, Transit was annually taking the same depreciation Capital was allowed to take, the amount of the annual amortization was to balance out the difference between Transit\u2019s purchase price and their higher value on Capital\u2019s books.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> Quite obviously, Transit\u2019s annual depreciation expense would become inflated if the compensatory value of the amortization was reduced. And such a reduction was necessarily destined when the Commission ordered its drastic changes in the amortization term and the amount of the annual amortization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">This we see in vivid outline as we again consult the record before us. Of $46,534,172 in original cost of the de-preciable properties Transit acquired from Capital in 1956, a total of $35,979,-793, or 77.3% had been retired from service by January 1, 1964, the effective date of the Commission\u2019s change.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Transit\u2019s projection, not significantly variant from the plan the Commission adopted in Order No. 385,<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> 61.1% of the remaining $10,554,379 would be retired at the close of 1966, the future test period, and 89.3% thereof at the end of 1970 \u2014 approximately the midpoint of the new amortization period.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> At the same time, the acquisition adjustment amortizations, which would occur annually in level amounts, would quite expectably maintain a steady course.

width=\"1288\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">The Commission\u2019s stated reason for modification of the acquisition adjustment amortization was the avoidance of a fare increase in 1966, when under the existing arrangement the amortization would come to an end.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> Nonetheless, it did not undertake to support, either by evidence or findings,<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> its theory that this circumstance would create a probable need for such an increase, and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>the record its view in that regard seems conjectural. This is especially so since at the time of the changeover there existed a court-ordered reserve of more than <em>$2,000,000 </em>to serve precisely the Commission\u2019s professed purpose.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark> And we detect, as serious consequences of the Commission\u2019s modification of the acquisition adjustment amortization artificial reductions of Transit\u2019s net earnings for ensuing years which ostensibly would justify the very fare increase that the change was predicted to forestall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">For the calendar year 1964, Transit stated a return on equity of 10.56%, reflecting $511,115 in net income and $4,837,992 in equity. Without the change, Transit\u2019s net income would have been $760,232 greater,<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> and the return on equity would have soared to more than 26%. Similarly, for the 12 months ending June 30, 1965 \u2014 the historical test period<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> \u2014 Transit reported net operating income of $1,024,855, representing a 3.23% rate of return; but without the change the return on equity, with another $760,232 in additional income for that year,<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> the rate of return would have been almost 75% greater. Again, for 1966 \u2014 the future test period<footnotemark>158</footnotemark>\u2014 Transit\u2019s net earnings were estimated at only $648,357,<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> but with the change its projected depreciation expense was $475,-145 higher than otherwise it would have been.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">Judicial decisions have long censured depreciation plans breeding excessive charges which in turn exaggerate the costs of serving the public.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> We ourselves have held, in a conceptually indistinguishable situation, \u201cthat the substantial inflation of operating costs due to excessive depreciation * * * is unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s handling of Transit\u2019s acquisition adjustment account does violence to the wholesome principle those cases espouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">Moreover, the costs of the service a regulated utility provides should, as far as possible, be borne by those who are served as they are being served. The disproportion between the amortization of the acquisition adjustment balance- and remaining depreciable life of the acquired properties charges present riders with substantial depreciation ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>pense properly assignable only to those who will ride in the future. If Transit\u2019s customers are to pay for the rides they themselves take, operating expenses must be projected within a range that is reasonable in the historical as well as the mathematical sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">We do not suggest that Transit should be required to make up at one fell swoop the differences reflected by possible percentage variations between the amount of depreciation accruing on the acquired properties before January 1, 1964, the Commission\u2019s changeover date, and the portion of the acquisition adjustment balance written off before that date.<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> Prior to that time, the period for amortization of that balance was related, not firmly to depreciable life of the properties Transit got from Capital, but rather, as we have said,<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> to the ten-year period for accruals to the reserve for track removal and street repaving; and this arrangement has never been challenged. The resolution of any problem in that connection is in the first instance, of course, a matter for the Commission. Now, however, the track removal and repaving accruals have been halted, at least temporarily, and the Commission has decided that it will put the amortization of the remaining acquisition adjustment balance on a different footing. We hold that, in doing so, it must maintain, subsequent to the changeover date, a reasonable relationship between the amortization and accruals of depreciation of the properties remaining in service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">Deficiency In Depreciation Reserve</p>\n<p id=\"ACh\">In 1964, the Commission found a large deficiency, existing as of August 15, 1963, in Transit\u2019s reserve for depreciation on operating properties.<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> It then required the depreciation reserve to be adjusted upward to its proper level and as an offset, the amount of the deficiency to be placed in a suspense account.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> In Order No. 564, the Commission decided to close out the deficiency balance of $1,099,627 in the latter account.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> The blueprint it followed in doing so, however, gave rise to the cluster of problems we reach next.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">Of the deficiency balance, $806,168 was the aggregate of underaccruals of depreciation on properties then still in service. The Commission directed that this amount be taken out of the suspense account and placed above the line<footnotemark>168</footnotemark> in Transit\u2019s depreciation expense account for 1966<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> and treating that much of the deficiency as a decrement Transit might legitimately recover from its fare-payers, the Commission granted Transit \u201c[restoration\u201d by authorizing the removal of $806,168 from the court-ordered reserve<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> that we have mentioned<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> and will shortly consider in greater detail.<footnotemark>172</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">The remaining $293,459 of the deficiency balance represented underaccruals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>on properties which, after the deficiency was ascertained, were' transferred to nonoperating status. Holding that Transit could not collect that portion of the deficiency from its farepayers, the Commission decreed that it be transferred from the suspense account to the depreciation expense account as a below-the-line<footnotemark>173</footnotemark> entry.<footnotemark>174</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">\n<em>The $806,168 Deficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ah8\">Petitioners in No. 20,201 argue that the $806,168 should not have been charged off in a single year, and should not have been deducted from the court-ordered reserve. They point to the fact that some of the properties as to which this part of the deficiency arose have service lives exceeding 30 years, and urge that any recoupment be \u00e9ffected through annual deductions from operating income over the remaining life of Transit\u2019s franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The problem, as we analyze it, breaks down into three facets, each of which we will discuss. The first concerns the handling of this item in the projection of Transit\u2019s operating costs preliminarily to establishment of a margin of return. The second is the question whether Transit may reclaim this portion of the under-accrued depreciation for its investors. If so, the third is whether its deduction from the court-ordered reserve, in lieu of some other type of adjustment, is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">\n<em>Treatment for Ratemaking Purposes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQZe\">The Commission viewed the $806,168 as a loss to Transit\u2019s investors for which they had not been compensated, and felt that \u201cthe techniques of preferring to</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">accomplish [reimbursement] by a charge against a court-ordered reserve in lieu of charging a particular period\u2019s profit and loss account, is merely a matter of semantics.\u201d <footnotemark>175</footnotemark> By its appraisal, \u201cwhether the deficiency * * * is written off directly on the operating statement of a particular period or periods, or whether it flows first through the court-ordered reserve, the impact on the rate-paying public is still the same.\u201d <footnotemark>176</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">We are not able to concur in the Commission\u2019s reasoning. As we interpret the record, the above-the-line debit of the $806,168 to Transit\u2019s depreciation expense account added just that much in pre-1966 depreciation expense to Transit\u2019s operating costs for 1966. The calendar year 1966, it will be recalled, was the future annual period for which Transit\u2019s operating expenses were estimated,<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> and we understand that the Commission\u2019s estimates incorporated this adjustment.<footnotemark>178</footnotemark> If this is so, the projection of depreciation expense was inflated to the extent of $806,168 by a past, nonrecurring item. This, in turn, would necessarily misshape the margin of return that Transit was ultimately allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">We have, in another context, delineated the principle that, to avoid this very kind of distortion, deductions for depreciation must be maintained in reasonable relationship with the service period of the property depreciated.<footnotemark>179</footnotemark> To reach the closest possible accord with that principle, depreciation deficiencies, once ascertained, must ordinarily be amortized over such remaining life as the properties involved may happen to have.<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> We speak now of the treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>of the $806,168 for ratemaking purposes, and not of its possible defrayal by Transit\u2019s riders. In the understanding that the Commission included that part of the depreciation deficiency in its computation of Transit\u2019s expenses for the future test period, we say that its action in doing so was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">\n<em>Recovery from Farepayers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Petitioners do not contend that a depreciation deficiency cannot normally be levied against ratepayers, but encompassed, we thing, within their objection to deduction of the $806,168 from the court-ordered reserve is the query whether Transit\u2019s farepayers now have such an obligation.<footnotemark>181</footnotemark> It was \u201cclear to the Commission that this deficiency in depreciation charges should equitably be made up by charges to the ratepayer,\u201d <footnotemark>182</footnotemark> but to us that is not nearly so evident. We would agree that if Transit\u2019s investors have not recouped the portion of their in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>vestment reflected by the deficiency, the Commission, weighing the equities, might in some reasonable manner impose some or all of the burden upon the riders.<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> We encounter difficulty, however, because although the Commission undertook to determine whether the burden should \u201cequitably\u201d fall upon investors or farepayers, it nowhere appears to have ascertained whether Transit\u2019s investors have already been reimbursed for the diminished value of their investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">We faced a cognate problem in Washington Gas Light Company v. Baker,<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> where PUC, in fixing the utility\u2019s rate base, deducted an allocable portion of its book reserve for depreciation rather than straight-line depreciation accruals. PUC acted upon the conclusion that the utility\u2019s revenues had been reduced because the annual charges for depreciation during most of the life of the property were too low, and that \u201cit would be inequitable for investors to bear the burden a second time by, for example, charging the undepreciated amount to earned surplus.\u201d <footnotemark>185</footnotemark> We pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-5\">\u201cDespite this premise, the record contains no evidence as to whether earnings during the life of this property sufficiently exceeded the fair rate of return to compensate investors for the inadequate depreciation charges. We recognize that the legality of past rates may not be challenged, and that past excessive earnings belong to the Company just as past losses must be borne by it. That is not to say, however, that when the Commission purports to act on the equities of the situation, and awards higher rates because of past inequities to investors, it must not support the factual premise upon which it builds by evidence in the record. \u2018Elaborate calculations which are at war with realities are of no avail.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>186</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">The same considerations are involved here. The Commission made no finding as to whether Transit\u2019s investors have received remuneration for the depreciation undercharges from actual earnings over and above fair return while the properties were in service.<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> Nor has our attention been directed to any evidence upon which a considered judgment in that regard could be attained.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> We cannot approve as equitable an arrangement based upon a determination that does not reflect a consideration of factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>crucial to an informed decision as to where the equities really lie. Our remand of Order No. 564 will provide an opportunity for the Commission to explore the matter, make findings, and reach a just conclusion responsive to the guidelines we have discussed.<footnotemark>189</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">\n<em>Resort To The Court-Ordered Reserve</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Should the Commission find that Transit\u2019s investors remain unreimbursed for the underaecrued depreciation, it would again face the question whether repayment could be accomplished by resort to the court-ordered reserve \u2014 a course petitioners vigorously oppose. We reiterate, however, that the $806,168 represented depreciation accruing during an era gone by, and that to no extent was it an advance charge for depreciation to arise only in the future. And we rule that the court-ordered reserve is a legitimate source for full and immediate rectification of any unreimbursed deficiency that might be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">In our 1963 <em>Bebchick </em>decision,<footnotemark>190</footnotemark> we held that a fare increase PUC had granted Transit was unwarranted, and this made necessary a disposition of the excess in fares that Transit had collected while the increase was in effect. It was \u201cnot feasible,\u201d we said, \u201cto require refunds to be made to individuals who paid the increase,\u201d<footnotemark>191</footnotemark> but \u201c[nevertheless, the amount realized by Transit from the increase must be utilized for the benefit of the class who paid it, that is, those who use Transit.\u201d <footnotemark>192</footnotemark> To accomplish this, we continued Transit must establish a fund, or set up an account or reserve, in an amount equal to the increase.<footnotemark>193</footnotemark> We specified that \u201c[t]he utilization and disposition of the fund, or the special account or reserve, as the case may be, shall be left to the discretion of the Commission having regulatory authority with respect to Transit, provided such discretion is exercised consistently with the purpose of benefiting Transit users in any rate proceedings pending or hereafter instituted.\u201d<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> Thus the special reserve, to which the Commission within these limitations was at liberty to resort, soon thereafter came into being.<footnotemark>195</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">The deficiency in Transit\u2019s depreciation reserve developed because too little depreciation had been charged to fare-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>payers in 1963 and prior years.<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> The Commission, in correcting the deficiency of $806,168 from the court-ordered reserve, endeavored to place the charge, as nearly as could be, where it should always have been. As the Commission said, \u201c[t]he logic of charging this deficiency off against the court-ordered reserve lies in the fact that just as the credits in the court-ordered reserve represent a build-up over a period of years prior to the current year, so does the depreciation reserve deficiency represent a build-up in past years\u2019 depreciation charges to be made up in current or future periods.\u201d<footnotemark>197</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">In sum, the court-ordered reserve is the equivalent of fare overpayments, and the deficiency is the amount of depreciation undercharges, both occurring in the past. The Commission\u2019s conclusion, in essence, was that the past depreciation undercharges might be offset by the past fare overcharges.<footnotemark>198</footnotemark> The objectives the reserve was designed to achieve, we think, are well served by its use to make Transit whole for any unredeemed diminution in value of its properties devoted to past public use, in lieu of the imposition of that burden on future fare-payers. We would regard such a procedure as a proper exercise of the Commission\u2019s regulatory discretion,<footnotemark>199</footnotemark> provided only that Transit's investors have not already received adequate recompense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">\n<em>The $252,688 Deficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">As we have observed,<footnotemark>200</footnotemark> the Commission directed that $293,459 of the total depreciation deficiency be charged below the line to Transit\u2019s depreciation account for nonoperating properties, thereby foreclosing its recapture from the farepayers. Transit concedes that this was proper as to $40,771, which relates to properties never placed in public use,<footnotemark>201</footnotemark> but contests the disposition of the remaining $252,688, asserting that the latter was a recoverable depreciation deficiency on operating properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The $252,688 is unreimbursed depreciation accumulating on a garage and on an office building while in public service during the period in which the general depreciation underaccrual occurred. After the deficiency was discovered by the Commission in 1964 and its amount was ascertained, the garage in its entirety and the office building to the extent of 80% were transferred to non-operating status and removed from public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The sole reason the Commission advanced for the adjudication complained of was that because these properties were no longer in public service at the time the Commission decided to close out the depreciation suspense account, they should assume their aliquot share of the deficiency.<footnotemark>202</footnotemark> This conclusion, we hold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>is erroneous as a matter of law. Indisputably, $252,688 of the deficiency was attributable to the garage and the office building at a time when they were fully operative and wholly devoted to public service. Like unrecovered depreciation accruing on other properties while so engaged,<footnotemark>203</footnotemark> Transit was entitled to reimbursement of the $252,688 from its farepayers. There is no disabling connection between a deficiency in past years\u2019 depreciation and the fact that the property giving rise to it is subsequently withdrawn from public use. The charge for depreciation is generated while the property is consigned to the public weal, and is not eroded by what is done with it thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The Commission must therefore give the deficiency of $252,688 the same treatment that the $806,168 will be accorded. This means that the Commission, after thorough investigation, will first determine the extent, if any, to which Transit\u2019s investors may have already been repaid by excesses of past actual earnings over a fair margin of return while the properties in question were in service.<footnotemark>204</footnotemark> The Commission will then proceed to a disposition consonant with justice to all concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">The Investment Tax Credit</p>\n<p id=\"AiqZ\">Transit has benefited considerably from the investment credit, since 1962 permitted against federal income taxes,<footnotemark>205</footnotemark> including a credit estimated at $685,608 for the test year 19 66.<footnotemark>206</footnotemark> The Commission did not, either for that year or for any prior period, utilize the credit to reduce its ratemaking projections of Transit\u2019s total tax expense. Petitioners in No. 20,201 complain that, as a result, these savings have never been passed on to Transit\u2019s riders, and that this in effect has required the riders to pay for taxes greater than those Transit has actually incurred. Transit should be required, these petitioners urge, to transmit the credit to its customers through the medium of lower fares.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">Order No. 564 tells us that the Commission\u2019s treatment of Transit\u2019s investment credits is an effort \u201cto comply with the intent of Congress as expressed in Section 203(e) of the 1964 [Internal] Revenue Act.\u201d <footnotemark>207</footnotemark> That section restates the congressional purpose, in making the credit available, \u201cto provide an incentive for modernization and growth of private industry (including that portion thereof which is regulated).\u201d <footnotemark>208</footnotemark> It further pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>vides, germanely to the issue here, that \u201cCongress does not intend that any agency or instrumentality of the United States having jurisdiction with respect to a taxpayer shall, without the consent of the taxpayer, use\u201d the credit \u201cto reduce such taxpayer\u2019s Federal income taxes for the purpose of establishing the cost of service of the taxpayer or to accomplish a similar result by any other method.\u201d <footnotemark>209</footnotemark> We have already had occasion to analyze the requirement Section 203 (e) imposes, and to apply it with full force to a federal regulatory agency.<footnotemark>210</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">The Commission\u2019s discussion of the problem leaves us uncertain as to whether it considers itself controlled by Section 203(e), or as to whether the Commission adheres to it as a matter of administrative policy. The section in terms applies only to an \u201cagency or instrumentality of the United States,\u201d<footnotemark>211</footnotemark> which the Commission clearly is not. It is the creature of the Compact<footnotemark>212</footnotemark> made bjr the District of Columbia and the states of Virginia and Maryland, to which Congress of constitutional necessity consented,<footnotemark>213</footnotemark> consolidating the Washington metropolitan area for unitary regulation of mass transit service. Congress contemplated that the Commission would be \u201cthe common agency of the signatories,\u201d<footnotemark>214</footnotemark> and the Compact designates the Commission \u201can instrumentality of\u201d the three contracting powers,<footnotemark>215</footnotemark> a character inevitable from numerous provisions it contains.<footnotemark>216</footnotemark> The Commission was in error if it felt that it was inexorably bound by the injunction Section 203(e) imposes.<footnotemark>217</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">But the issue does not vanish here, for the Commission\u2019s authority to administratively adopt the canon expressed in Section 203(e) is something else again. \u201cA regulatory agency,\u201d we have said, \u201cmay, should, and in some instances must, give consideration to objectives expressed by Congress in other legislation, assuming they can be related to the objectives of the statute adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>tered by the agency.\u201d<footnotemark>218</footnotemark> It may, in an appropriate exercise of the authority delegated to it, select adjudicative guidelines from policy incorporated into statutes not legally binding upon it.<footnotemark>219</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">It does not, however, appear that the Commission, in adhering to Section 203 (e), engaged in a decisional act. Administrative discretion implies concentration upon a problem in its distinctive context, while legislation must necessarily address the problem more broadly. What in overall result may be wholesome as a legislative rule having general operation may be unfeasible as a judgmental exercise in a particular case. The Commission\u2019s consideration of Transit\u2019s investment credits embraced only a reference to the statute, with which it coupled \u201can effort to comply with the intent of Congress as expressed in\u201d the statute,<footnotemark>220</footnotemark> without any indication that it was making either a conscious choice or an individualized application of the statutory rule as a rule of its own. Moreover, it seems to have made no appraisal as to the desirability of applying the Section 203(e) requirement in the situation before it, or effort to balance an inducement to Transit to invest against the possibility of lower rates to the traveling public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">In sum, there are no signs of the particularized inquiries or the reasoned conclusions which make for an exercise of discretion. On the contrary, the Commission states that its disposition of the matter \u201cis in accordance with commission action in rate cases which were processed through this commission since the 1964 [Internal] Revenue Act .was passed,\u201d<footnotemark>221</footnotemark> and that \u201c[t]he commission finds no reason at this juncture to change its policy with respect to treatment of the investment tax credit.\u201d <footnotemark>222</footnotemark> This plainly connotes an undeviating course pursued with reference to every carrier in every Commission proceeding, irrespective of its individual and perhaps unique characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">This case is essentially not unlike FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc.,<footnotemark>223</footnotemark> where the commission involved, because of the \u201cnational policy in favor of competition,\u201d <footnotemark>224</footnotemark> authorized an applicant to furnish radiotelegraph service to two foreign countries in duplication of a similar service already afforded by another company. The Court pointed out that \u201c[t]he Commission has not in this case clearly indicated even that its own experience, entirely apart from the tangible demonstration of benefit for which [the other company] contends, leads it to conclude that competition is here desirable. It seems to have relied almost entirely on its interpretation of national policy.\u201d<footnotemark>225</footnotemark> The Court said that \u201c[h]ad the Commission clearly indicated that it relied on its own evaluation of the needs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>industry rather than on what it deemed a national policy, its order would have a different foundation\u201d <footnotemark>226</footnotemark> but, it added, \u201c[t]o say that national policy without more suffices for authorization of a competing carrier wherever competition is reasonably feasible would authorize the Commission to abdicate what would seem to us one of the primary duties imposed on it by Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>227</footnotemark> In the Court\u2019s view, it was \u201cnot inadmissible for the Commission, when it makes manifest that in so doing it is conscientiously exercising the discretion given it by Congress, to reach a conclusion whereby authorizations would be granted wherever competition is reasonably feasible.\u201d<footnotemark>228</footnotemark> But the Commission\u2019s grant, it was held, was infirm because \u201cthe conclusion was not based on the Commission\u2019s own judgment but rather on the unjustified assumption that it was Congress\u2019 judgment that such authorizations are desirable.\u201d <footnotemark>229</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">We think substantially similar considerations obtain in this case, and conclude that we should remand to the Commission for inquiry and deliberation suitable to proper treatment of Transit\u2019s investment credits. Legislative policy reflected in tax statutes of general application may have a legitimate role in rate regulation, and tax objectives may be honored in a degree appropriate within the principles mandated by the specific regulatory statute drawn into the litigation.<footnotemark>230</footnotemark> This is particularly so when, as here, it is evident that without regulatory consequences the tax program may encounter frustration <footnotemark>231</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">The congressional goal in making the investment credit available is crystal clear. The committee reports on the 1962 legislation \u2014 which gave birth to this credit \u2014 stated in unison that the aim was to stimulate investment by reducing the net cost of acquiring depre-ciable assets.<footnotemark>232</footnotemark> \u201cRealistic depreciation alone, however,\u201d the Senate Committee on Finance explained, \u201cis not enough to provide the essential economic growth. In addition, a specific incentive must be provided if a higher rate of growth is to be achieved.\u201d <footnotemark>233</footnotemark> And while, save as a reflector of legislative policy, Section 203(e) does not itself concern the Commission, the fact remains that Transit, in common with other taxpayers, was made a beneficiary of the investment credit by the 1962 provisions. Neither in purpose nor in substance were the latter affected in their bearing upon nonfederally regulated utilities by the circumstance that the Section 203(e) compulsions were limited to federal regulatory agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>On the other side of the ledger is the admonition that \u201cwhen the out-of-pocket tax cost of the regulated [taxpayer] is reduced, there is an immediate confrontation with the ratemaking principle that limits costs of service to expenses actually incurred.\u201d<footnotemark>234</footnotemark> Deviations from that guideline can be tolerated only when solidly justified upon \u201ca delicate balancing by the Commission of the interests of the company, its shareholders, the consumer and the public.\u201d <footnotemark>235</footnotemark> In our view, congressional objectives underlying both the tax and the regulatory laws here involved would be sub-served by Transit\u2019s retention of so much, but no more, of its investment credits as would provide sufficient incentive for outlays in depreciable properties on a scale and at a pace beneficial to the traveling public <footnotemark>236</footnotemark> This will, of course, involve a careful assessment of the extent, if any, to which Transit, as a regulated carrier, needs the inspiration the investment credit is designed to furnish and, if so, the treatment essential to meeting that need.<footnotemark>237</footnotemark> The pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>cise point at which relevant tax policy and ratemaking principles may become reconciled is primarily a matter of administrative expertise and judgment, subject to judicial appraisal by the standards traditionally governing review of administrative action.<footnotemark>238</footnotemark> But any play the Commission might give to Section 203(e) requirements can be indulged solely in consequence of an exercise of its own judgment,<footnotemark>239</footnotemark> soundly conceived and exercised with appropriate ' regard for the responsibilities entrusted to it, and our approval will be summoned only by a rational accommodation of the investment credit within the Commission\u2019s positive duty to maintain the reasonableness of Transit\u2019s fares.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Deferred Tax Charges on Track Removal And Street Repaving Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">From August, 1956, through the calendar year 1962, as we have mentioned in another context,<footnotemark>240</footnotemark> Transit accrued $1,044,196 annually to its reserve for track removal and street repaving, but during the same period spent substantially less for these purposes.<footnotemark>241</footnotemark> In the computation of its District of Columbia income taxes,<footnotemark>242</footnotemark> Transit was allowed deductions, not for amounts accrued, but only for removal and repaving costs actually incurred during the tax year.<footnotemark>243</footnotemark> The ratemaking treatment warranted in this situation thus became a problem confronting Transit\u2019s regulatory agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">In 1959, PUC ordered the resulting increases in Transit\u2019s income taxes to be charged to the reserve for removal and repaving, attributing this technique to a net-of-taxes theory <footnotemark>244</footnotemark> The underlying idea was that there would be charges to the reserve, instead of to income tax expense, for the higher taxes in the earlier years when accruals exceeded expenses; and that these charges would be offset, in the later years when taxes would decrease as actual expenses surpassed accruals, with credits to the reserve matched and corresponding debits to income tax expenses. Thus, said PUC, \u201cthe customers will not be currently charged with the total estimated cost of track removal and repaving without the offsetting benefit of the related reduction in income taxes.\u201d <footnotemark>245</footnotemark> By mid-1965, in consequence of this process, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>reserve had been reduced by $222,072 in accumulated tax charges.<footnotemark>246</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">In the meanwhile, after the Commission suspended accruals to the reserve in 19 63,<footnotemark>247</footnotemark> Transit\u2019s track removal and street repaving expenses became substantial. By Order No. 564, the Commission directed Transit to remove the $222,072 from- the reserve by a credit in that amount to the reserve and a contra-debit to a new account denominated \u201cDeferred Tax Charges \u2014 Track Removal Costs.\u201d <footnotemark>248</footnotemark> The Commission stated that this adjustment \u201cwas made to conform with the \u2018net of taxes\u2019 treatment instituted by\u201d PUC,<footnotemark>249</footnotemark> explaining that \u201c[i]f the charges to the [reserve] account were generated on a \u2018net of taxes\u2019 basis, and continued thus over a 7-year period as long as debt adjustments were required, consistency demands that, now that the time has arrived for the credit entries, the procedure set up by the PUC be continued to its logical conclusion.\u201d <footnotemark>250</footnotemark> The Commission then made provision for a new charge, as an operating expense for 1963 and the first eight months of 1964, of 5% of Transit\u2019s net cost of track removal and repaving.<footnotemark>251</footnotemark> The Commission also made known its plan to \u201ccontinue the entire \u2018net of taxes\u2019 treatment of track removal expenditures until the entire amount of $222,072.22 is offset.\u201d <footnotemark>252</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">Transit\u2019s prime objection to this procedure stems from apprehensions that it will reduce its recovery of the increased income taxes it was required to pay to the District. After the Commission stopped accruals to the reserve for track removal and repaving, Transit\u2019s annual expenditures for track removal and repaving rose to a point higher than its annual District taxable income.<footnotemark>253</footnotemark> Since the District makes no provision for carrying tax losses forward, Transit urges that it will- be permanently deprived of at least some of the tax decreases in later years that, on a net-of-taxes basis, would ordinarily have approximated the earlier tax elevations. Transit also argues that by directing the <em>5% </em>charge as an annual operating expense, the Commission has departed from the net-of-taxes approach in seeking to make Transit whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-15\">We find Transit\u2019s fears to be unfounded, and its criticisms of the Commission\u2019s program unavailing. The Commission fully recognized that the increased income taxes Transit has been required to pay to the District, as well as all its expenses for track removal and street repaving,<footnotemark>254</footnotemark> are ultimately to be charged to its fare-payers. The Commission\u2019s order, as elucidated by an elaborate interpretive representation,<footnotemark>255</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>in practical effect simply defers the charges for taxes to such times as expenditures are made from the reserve. The burden of the charges will eventually fall upon the farepayers, and Transit\u2019s reimbursement therefor will sooner or later become complete. We need not ponder whether, consistently with law and with sound ratemaking and accounting principles, the Commission might have dealt with the problem differently.<footnotemark>256</footnotemark> Nor need we join in the debate between Transit and the Commission as to whether its treatment accords <em>with </em>the original net-of-taxes theory, to which the Commission in any event was not legally wedded.<footnotemark>257</footnotemark> It was clearly within the Commission\u2019s authority and discretion to relate Transit\u2019s recovery of the tax increases to its actual expenditures from the reserve,<footnotemark>258</footnotemark> and we decline to upset on grounds of unreasonableness the method by which it does so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Estimate of Bus Maintenance</p>\n<p id=\"aq4-dedup-0\">Transit projected the expenses <footnotemark>259</footnotemark> associated with the operation of its buses by adding to its actual operational costs of $4,249,452 during the historical test period ending June 30, 1965, the increases, computed on a system-wide basis,<footnotemark>260</footnotemark> which it anticipated for 1966, the future test period. The Commission, however, adopted the estimate of its staff, which was lower by $426,-538.<footnotemark>261</footnotemark> This difference was attributable to a decrease in expenses which the staff expected as a result of Transit\u2019s programmed replacement of 100 old buses with new buses in June, 1965, and a turnover of another 100 buses in June, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">The Commission\u2019s staff accepted, as the cornerstone of its projection, Transit\u2019s historical cost figure of $4,249,452. It began its calculation of adjustments for the future by estimating the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>of miles buses in each of various groups <footnotemark>262</footnotemark> would travel during 1966, and multiplying those miles by a per-mile cost of operation for that group. It then worked into its computation the 200 new buses, assigning to each a maintenance cost factor, throughout 1966, of six cents per mile of operation, exclusive of increased labor costs for 1966; and eliminated the 200 oldest buses in Transit's fleet, which were much more expensive to maintain.<footnotemark>263</footnotemark> This substitutional technique won the approval of the Commission, which deemed it \u201c[t]he most important adjustment\u201d that Transit should have made.<footnotemark>264</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">This observation, to say the least, is not fully accurate. Transit\u2019s appraisal of future expenses, as we have pointed out,<footnotemark>265</footnotemark> incorporated bodily its expenditures for bus maintenance during the historical test year expiring in June 30, 1965. Since the beginning of 1962, when Transit became fully converted to an all-bus system, it has acquired an average of about 115 new buses each year, and has removed from service an equivalent number of its older buses; and from 1958 until 1962, it had similarly replaced 75 to 100 buses per year. Thus Transit\u2019s actual maintenance expense for the historical test year, which the Commission\u2019s staff accepted and utilized,<footnotemark>266</footnotemark> included and gave full credit to the savings realized from the exchange during that year of approximately the same number of new buses which would displace old buses during 1966, the future test year. From aught that appears, the staff\u2019s appraisal in some measure \u2014 perhaps in large part \u2014 duplicated this reduction,<footnotemark>267</footnotemark> and concomitantly lowered the amount purporting to reflect Transit\u2019s overall bus maintenance expense for the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">But this is not all. The evidence vindicates Transit\u2019s thesis that operational expenses become larger as a bus grows older, and obviously a new bus placed in service in mid-1965 or mid-1966 will be months older at the end of 1966.<footnotemark>268</footnotemark> Since the staff\u2019s rating for the maintenance of the 200 new buses was an unchanging factor of six cents per mile throughout 1966, the increased cost of operation that accompanies aging was not given its just due.<footnotemark>269</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">Moreover, the staff\u2019s estimate of six cents, the record reveals, was derived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>from Transit\u2019s operation of 20 brand-new buses over a period during 1965 of less than a month.<footnotemark>270</footnotemark> A cost history of the operation of so few new buses for so short a time affords a dubious statistical base for projecting the maintenance expense for as many as 200 buses in periods ranging from six to 18 months.<footnotemark>271</footnotemark> Moreover, the staff\u2019s six-cents factor was overwhelmingly contradicted by Transit\u2019s experience data fixing a significantly higher figure.<footnotemark>272</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">Still another problem springs from the manner in which the Commission\u2019s staff, preliminary to application of its per-mile cost factor, undertook to ascertain the mileage which the new buses would travel in place of the old. Transit was unable to respond initially to the Commission\u2019s request for information as to how the new buses would be allotted to scheduled operations because those determinations had not at the time been made. The staff then proceeded to allocate mileages to the new vehicle according to its own views as to the various routes on which Transit could best use them. The record discloses, however, that in the process the staff overlooked requirements which precluded many of the assignments it made.<footnotemark>273</footnotemark> And Transit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>made a convincing demonstration that, with valid assignments, an application of even the staff\u2019s disputed cost-per-mile estimates would have resulted in 1966 maintenance expenses considerably greater than those predicted by the staff.<footnotemark>274</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">The Commission itself concluded that \u201c[t]he staff estimate appears low, due, at least, to bus-assignment difficulty\u201d <footnotemark>275</footnotemark> but, because of alleged deficiencies in Transit\u2019s <em>computation,</em><footnotemark><em>276</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201caccept [ed] as reasonable the estimated maintenance costs projected by the staff.\u201d <footnotemark>277</footnotemark> It was not, however, enough to validate the staff\u2019s \u201clow\u201d opinion, which the Commission incongruously embraced \u201cas reasonable,\u201d simply to refer to claimed shortcomings in Transit\u2019s evaluation, which the Commission rejected. Rather, it was incumbent upon the Commission, if dissatisfied with both, to require whatever more it deemed essential to the performance of its duty to forecast Transit\u2019s bus maintenance expense with all the precision reasonably obtainable.<footnotemark>278</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">We must sustain the Commission\u2019s findings when they materialize as rational deductions grounded on substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.<footnotemark>279</footnotemark> But here the miscalculations to which we have adverted robbed the staff\u2019s estimate of the degree of reliability that separates admissible opinion from ineligible conjecture. We hold that the Commission erred in accepting that estimate as the basis for its finding as to Transit\u2019s expenses of bus maintenance during the future annual period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">1965 Margin of Return</p>\n<p id=\"AZB\">In Order No. 564, the Commission found \u201cthat a margin of return above operating expenses in the amount of about $2 million is fair and reasonable for 1966,\u201d <footnotemark>280</footnotemark> the future annual period. Estimating that under existing fares Transit\u2019s net earnings would be only $648,357, but that the court-ordered reserve could provide the difference, it denied a fare increase and ordered that approximately $1,350,000 be paid to Transit from the reserve.<footnotemark>281</footnotemark> Petitioners in No. 20,201 challenge the adequacy of the Commission\u2019s findings as to margin of return and the related transfer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>funds. We hold that the Commission\u2019s findings do not justify the return the Commission allowed or support the withdrawal from the court-ordered reserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">From the Commission\u2019s discussion we glean the formula by which it set the margin of return at $2,000,000. Additionally to Transit\u2019s estimated debt expense of $960,000, it allowed \u201c$400,000 to $500,000\u201d as an annual dividend<footnotemark>282</footnotemark> and \u201c$550,000 to $650,000\u201d as a \u201ccushion.\u201d <footnotemark>283</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s projection of Transit\u2019s debt service has not been challenged, and it has substantial support in the record,<footnotemark>284</footnotemark> so we have no difficulty with the treatment of that item. But we cannot accept the Commission\u2019s methodology as to the two remaining components of the margin of return it awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">\n<em>Dividend Payout</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">As we said in <em>Transit I, </em>a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate is one that enables the utility, among other things, to \u201cpay dividends sufficient to continue to attract investors.\u201d <footnotemark>285</footnotemark> But there we criticized the Commission\u2019s apparent treatment of an annual dividend payout of $500,000 as a \u201ccost of operation, * * * with no examination of, or conclusion about, its appropriateness.\u201d <footnotemark>286</footnotemark> And elsewhere in this opinion we have noted that the mere fact that annual dividends in a particular amount have been paid in times gone by is m no sense a proper basis for permitting dividend payouts to continue at the same level in future years.<footnotemark>287</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-16\">As its sole reason for including in the margin of return \u201c$400,000 to $500,000\u201d for dividends, the Commission stated that \u201cTransit has paid an annual dividend of $500,000 since 1960 and the testimony tends to show that the market place assumed the continuation of such dividend.\u201d<footnotemark>288</footnotemark> To the extent that the Commission\u2019s judgment as to a suitable dividend rests upon Transit\u2019s traditional dividend payout policy, it continues the approach we disapproved in <em>Transit </em>1<footnotemark>289</footnotemark> and which earlier in this opinion we <em>held to be </em>arbitrary.<footnotemark>290</footnotemark> However, the Commission\u2019s addition \u2014 that \u201cthe market place now assumes the continuation of such dividend\u201d \u2014 poses the question whether that statement is tantamount to a sustainable finding that dividends lower than those paid historically would not be sufficient \u201cto continue to attract investors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-17\">The assertion that the market place \u201cassumes\u201d continuity in the amount of Transit\u2019s dividends could mean that absent the customary yield prudent investors would cease viewing Transit\u2019s stock<footnotemark>291</footnotemark> as a desirable investment, in comparison with other opportunities of similar risk, and thus that Transit would no longer be able to secure the equity capital it needs to assure its continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>vitality.<footnotemark>292</footnotemark> If that were the case, the Commission would have ample justification for concluding that a return less than that required to maintain dividends at former levels would be unreasonably low. On the other hand, the observation that the market place \u201cassumes\u201d the continuation of a $500,000 dividend payout, could be understood as signifying only that a lower dividend yield might affect, to some degree, the market price of Transit\u2019s stock. And to say that the market price of the stock might drop to a price somewhat lower than it was in prior years is not at all to say that the company\u2019s ability to attract the equity capital it needs would be jeopardized.<footnotemark>293</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">A method for determining a fair return or a reasonable dividend yield which looks solely to a pegging of the market price of the company\u2019s stock at past levels is manifestly unacceptable.<footnotemark>294</footnotemark> Past returns may have been unreasonably high, resulting in an inflated market price for the stock; if so, the public interest would not permit, much less require, maintenance of the status quo.<footnotemark>295</footnotemark> And even if past returns were warranted in the light of then existing risks and uncertainties, changed conditions may demand a lower return for the future, even if that results in the market\u2019s revaluation of Transit\u2019s stock.<footnotemark>296</footnotemark> In short, the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>duty is to authorize a return which is sufficient, but not greater than necessary,<footnotemark>297</footnotemark> to preserve the financial integrity of the enterprise, and which is fair and reasonable in the light of current conditions, as distinct from those that may have existed in times past.<footnotemark>298</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">In support of its statement that the market place \u201cassumes\u201d continuation of past dividends, the Commission apparently relied on the testimony of Transit\u2019s expert witness that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-5\">\u201cif the annual payout [of $500,000] was not continued, the adverse effect on the market value of the stock of the parent would be considerable, and the financial stability of Transit would deteriorate in the eyes of the financial community.\u201d <footnotemark>299</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5H\">But this assertion, standing alone, does not provide adequate support for a finding that Transit\u2019s traditional annual dividend payout must persist in order to \u201ccontinue to attract investors\u201d \u2014 even assuming that such a finding was made.<footnotemark>300</footnotemark> Por, as we have said, whether or not a lower dividend would reflect adversely on Transit in the eyes of the financial community and thus affect the market price of its stock, it does not follow inexorably that Transit would thereby be precluded from securing needed equity capital. Whether the latter consequence would flow from a lower dividend yield is something the Commission could not know without at least ascertaining Transit\u2019s financial requirements, assessing the current risks that attend its operation, and examining \u201cearnings on investments carrying comparable risks.\u201d <footnotemark>301</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">As in the 1963 proceeding, both Transit and the protestants presented evidence relating to Transit\u2019s earnings-price ratios, and those of other companies; Transit\u2019s return on equity, and the returns afforded by natural gas and electric utilities, as well as other urban transit companies; and dividend-price and dividend payout ratios for Transit and other utilities. The Commission\u2019s opinion virtually ignores this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\">The Commission did observe that the protestants\u2019 \u201ccost-of-capital method of determining a fair rate of return for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Transit in this proceeding is not wholly applicable to the transit industry generally and to Transit in particular.\u201d<footnotemark>302</footnotemark> What the Commission meant by this is not clear. We can only infer that it had in mind considerations similar to those which led it to reject as \u201cinappropriate\u201d the cost of capital evidence adduced by the protestants in the 1963 proceeding, and we need not repeat our discussion of those reasons here.<footnotemark>303</footnotemark> It suffices to again point out that if a \u201ccost of capital approach\u201d is to be dismissed as \u201cinappropriate\u201d or spurned as \u201cnot wholly applicable,\u201d it is incumbent upon the Commission to say why and to set forth for the record, through analysis and findings, the alternative method it employed to determine fair return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The Commission made no evaluation of Transit\u2019s annual dividend payout or its overall return in the light of dividends and returns of companies of comparable risk.<footnotemark>304</footnotemark> Indeed, the only concrete finding based upon any of the evidence to which we have referred was that the $2,000,000 margin of return it authorized would produce a return on rate base of 7.4% which, it said, was \u201clow.\u201d <footnotemark>305</footnotemark> In view of the Commission\u2019s failure to take into account the evidence we have summarized, and to weigh the considerations essential to a proper determination of a fair return, we cannot credit its finding as to a reasonable dividend yield, resting as it does solely upon past payouts and unsupported inferences as to the market behavior of Transit stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">\n<em>The \u201ccushion\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">We also hold that the Commission has failed to justify its inclusion of \u201c$550,000 to $650,000\u201d as a \u201ccushion\u201d in the margin of return it allowed. The \u201ccushion\u201d, the Commission stated, was the amount \u201crequired to enable Transit to maintain a sufficient surplus to cover contingencies and to assure the financial stability of Transit.\u201d <footnotemark>306</footnotemark> The Commission explained the need for the \u201ccushion\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-11\">\u201cAdmittedly, the commission has been conservative in its estimates for future revenues and expenses. In fact, the difference between the net operating income projections of the commission and Transit amounts to more than $800,000. The commission feels that in prescribing rates under the operating ratio method it should be careful not to' overestimate revenues or expenses since the rate of return is directly geared to these items. If we, even inadvertently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>should include margins of error, in the estimated operating revenues or expenses, we would be allowing a return on such errors. The great possibility of error in estimates and projections, a very real contingency, thus is better given weight here in the margin of return allowed than above the line where the effect would be compounded.\u201d <footnotemark>307</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">The process of fixing rates prospectively necessarily imposes on a rate-making authority the difficult task of estimating the utility\u2019s cost, in future years, of providing service to the public. Even the most intelligent estimate of future expenses, because it is an estimate, does not dispel completely the possibility of some inaccuracy.<footnotemark>308</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the uncertainty that attends all prophesy, a regulatory agency is duty bound to make its forecasts as accurate as it possibly can, and a reviewing court is entitled to assume that it has done so.<footnotemark>309</footnotemark> Nevertheless, without reference to any criteria whatsoever, the Commission here concluded that a \u201ccushion\u201d of from $550,000 to $650,000 was needed to offset the supposed unreliability of its estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">The Commission stated that \u201cin prescribing rates under the operating ratio method it should be careful not to overestimate revenues or expenses since the rate of return is directly geared to these items. If we, even inadvertently, should include margins of error, in the estimated operating revenues or expenses, we would be allowing a return on such errors.\u201d <footnotemark>310</footnotemark> But there is no indication in this case that any undue possibility of error existed. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s estimate of revenue differed from Transit\u2019s by only $173,000<footnotemark>311</footnotemark> on projected revenues of some $33,000,000. Moreover, Transit\u2019s calculations did not take into account significant revenue increases in the second half of 1965,<footnotemark>312</footnotemark> and the Commission projected a smaller increase in passenger volume than Transit had assumed.<footnotemark>313</footnotemark> Thus it would seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>that the revenue estimates, if at all unreliable, tended. to favor Transit.<footnotemark>314</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">The Commission\u2019s concern over the possibilities of additional costs is equally .undocumented. All of the contingencies it identified as potentially enlarging expenses appear to be remote or speculative, and merely variations on the theme that its estimates might be erroneous. For example, even though it made no provision for additional track removal expenditures, the Commission stated that \u201cthe possibility exists that Transit might incur considerable expenses over and above the amount which remains in the track removal reserve in 1966. There is also the risk that the track removal program could be accelerated during the future period.\u201d <footnotemark>315</footnotemark> Similarly, the Commission said that there \u201cis a possibility that the company will incur additional labor costs for the last two months of the year,\u201d<footnotemark>316</footnotemark> without, however, undertaking to gauge the likelihood that its estimates of future labor expenses might be too low, or to quantify the additional cost of an erroneous projection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Resort to a \u201ccushion\u201d cannot relieve the Commission of its duty to explore, and make findings on the probabilities of future occurrence of particular expenses. And the line between those costs that can and those that cannot be projected for ratemaking purposes must at all times be scrupulously observed. Expenses too remote or speculative to be forecast with any reasonable degree of certainty, and those that are extraordinary and not likely to recur in normal periods,<footnotemark>317</footnotemark> should be disallowed. The Commission cannot \u201ccushion * * * [the] company in advance against unforeseen events\u201d which do not constitute \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d expenses.<footnotemark>318</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">The Commission, of course, was at liberty to allow a return which would enable not only the payment of an appropriate dividend, but also an addition to surplus of amounts necessary to insure financial stability and to provide to the equity holder a return which in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>aggregate is fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>319</footnotemark> The error here is that, instead of making allowance for identified capital needs, and for an overall return \"commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks,\u201d <footnotemark>320</footnotemark> the Commission viewed the \u201ccushion\u201d simply as a means of offsetting possible errors in its expense predictions<footnotemark>321</footnotemark> A fair rate of return, properly determined, already includes compensation for the risk that uncrystallized contingencies may later reduce actual earnings.<footnotemark>322</footnotemark> But without comparative data, any determination of added risk in isolation is completely arbitrary.<footnotemark>323</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">In view of the fundamental inadequacy of the method by which the Commission determined the margin of return allowed Transit, we hold that its action in ordering $1,350,000 to be transferred from the court-ordered reserve was unlawful and must be set aside. Since Order No. 564, like Orders Nos. 245 and 563, has been superseded as a result of the Commission\u2019s subsequent approval of new fare schedules,<footnotemark>324</footnotemark> we will not remand the case for a new determination as to the margin of return.<footnotemark>325</footnotemark> However, as was our experience in connection with Orders Nos. 245 and 563,<footnotemark>326</footnotemark> we encounter substantial indications in the record that it would be inequitable to compel Transit to restore the entire amount it obtained from the reserve.<footnotemark>327</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>In Order No. 564, the Commission found that the fares prescribed therein would produce net income of only $648,-357 in the absence of any transfer of funds from the court-ordered reserve.<footnotemark>328</footnotemark> This amount was substantially less than the $1,550,000 proposed by the protestants<footnotemark>329</footnotemark> as a fair return.<footnotemark>330</footnotemark> Moreover, though the protestants recommended a return on equity of from 12'% to 13%,<footnotemark>331</footnotemark> and though we have affirmed the Commission\u2019s 1967 decision permitting a return on equity of 14%,<footnotemark>332</footnotemark> the $648,000 would have been insufficient even to cover Transit\u2019s estimated debt expense of $960,000 <footnotemark>333</footnotemark> for the future annual period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Since it was uncontested that Transit was entitled to a return of at least $1,550,000,<footnotemark>334</footnotemark> and since that sum represents a return to the equity holder nearly identical to that approved by the Commission only one year later, we conclude that Transit should not be directed to make full restitution, if to do so would reduce its return below that level. Accordingly, Transit will be permitted to retain any portion of the funds transferred to it from the court-ordered reserve which is necessary to preserve its actual earnings during the period covered by Order .No. 564 at the level conceded by the protestants to represent a fair return.<footnotemark>335</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-13\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-14\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-15\">We here recapitulate, for the convenience of the parties and the Commission, the major dispositions required by the holdings delineated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-16\">\n<em>Orders Nos. 245 and 568</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-17\">Orders Nos. 245 and 563 are set aside. Transit is directed to make restitution for all amounts collected as a consequence of the fare increase initially authorized by Order No. 245, during the period that order was effective, except that it may retain any portion of the excess fares necessary to preserve its earnings at the level conceded by the protestants to represent a fair return.<footnotemark>336</footnotemark> Restitution in the appropriate amount is to be effected by placing funds in or making non-cash credits to the court-ordered reserve.<footnotemark>337</footnotemark> The parties are requested to seek agreement as to the precise amount of restitution and the details for its accomplishment. Should the parties formulate a plan, they shall make application to the Commission for its approval, and in that event, or if no agreement is reached, the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>shall supervise the execution of our mandate.<footnotemark>338</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\">\n<em>Order No. 564</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">The issue concerning the acquisition adjustment account is remanded to the Commission for a redetermination of the schedule for amortization of the balance thereof on the ch\u00e1ngeover date, and a relating of that schedule to the remaining lives of the properties in service on the changeover date. Any amounts heretofore charged against the account in excess of the amounts found to be proper shall be deposited in the court-ordered reserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">The issue concerning the deficiency in the depreciation reserve is likewise remanded to the Commission for findings as to the extent, if any, to which Transit\u2019s investors have already been reimbursed for the diminution in value of their investment in operating properties devoted to public use over and above accruals to the reserve. The Commission may permit Transit to retain any portion of the total amount of underac-cruals for which its investors have not been compensated in the form of past earnings in excess of fair returns. Any amounts permitted by Order No. 564 to be withdrawn from the court-ordered reserve for which Transit\u2019s investors have already been so compensated shall be restored to the reserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">The Commission on remand is further directed to make findings and conclusions as to the treatment proper for Transit\u2019s investment tax credits, and the amounts, if any, by which Transit\u2019s federal income tax expense should be reduced as a consequence of any such credits.

In addition to the apparent unreliability of stock price stability as an indicator of the appropriateness of a given level of dividend payments, evidence in the record suggests that the market price of D. C. Transit (of Delaware) stock has not been nearly as stable as the- Commission seems to feel. The average yearly market price \u2014 the average of high and low prices in a year \u2014 varied by as much as 14.6% during the years cited by the Commission. Moreover, the Commission has apparently not inquired into the significance of market price fluctuation within the years in question, and petitioners cite in their brief data showing substantial fluctuation within those years. For example, they state that the low for D. C. Transit (of Delaware) Class A public shares in 1960 was 8% while the high in 1961 was 14%. And finally, the Commission, in utilizing figures as to the market price of D.O. Transit (of Delaware) stock in demonstrating the appropriateness of a given level of dividend payout by Transit, has failed to comment on the significance of evidence in the record that of the $500,000 dividend paid by Transit to its parent, see note 26, <em>supra, </em>only $400,000 has historically been passed on to D. C. Transit (of Delaware) stockholders. In a later rate order, the Commission commented on the unreliability of employing market price figures for Transit\u2019s parent in determining a proper return for Transit.

Though the Commission did not so state in its opinion, there may be difficulties in applying to Transit an attraction-of-capital analysis utilizing earnings-price ratios, flowing from, the fact that its stock is wholly owned by its parent Corporation, D. C. Transit of Delaware, and thus has no market price of its own. Other commissions have generally not found this an insuperable obstacle to utilization of an attraction-of-capital approach. See, <em>e. g., </em>authorities discussed in Nichols, Ruling Principles of Utility Regulation \u2014Rate of Return, 250-262 (1955) ; Nichols <em>&amp; </em>Welch, Ruling Principles of Utility Regulation \u2014 Rate of Return, 129-143 (Supp.A.1964). A witness in the 1963 proceeding testified that the publicly traded stock of D. C. Transit of Delaware was a \u201cgood index\u201d of Transit\u2019s cost of capital. A witness in the 1965 proceeding testified that \u201cas of the present * * * it is acceptable to ascertain the relevant data concerning D. C. Transit Company (Del.) and impute from that a cost of equity capital for the local company. This approach is followed in many rate proceedings where the equity capital of the company in question is wholly owned by the parent.\u201d Moreover, though in a later proceeding the Commission declined to place substantial reliance on analyses of the market behavior of the stock of Transit\u2019s parent, see note 31, <em>supra, </em>at a later stage of the same proceeding the Commission adopted an approach which entailed a determination of Transit\u2019s cost of capital, though without reference to earnings-price ratios. Order No. 684, <em>supra </em>note 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">Because of the extraordinary difficulties in determining cost of capital for a corporation which is part of an elaborate holding company structure, the Commission would no doubt be better able to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities were Transit to maintain a separate corporate existence. A suggestion to this effect,' addressed by the Commission to Transit, might well be an appropriate means of alleviating some of the regulatory problems illustrated by this case. In Order No. 564, the Commission referred to the problem posed by integration of Transit\u2019s bus operations with non-transit operations, and urged the company to separate \u201ccompletely its transit and non-transit activities so that Transit\u2019s personnel will not be involved in non-transit functions.\u201d (p. 4) This request was promptly complied with.

One of the \u201cadditional factors\u201d listed, the \u201cability to attract capital,\u201d may simply be another way of denominating the cost of capital as derived from earnings-price ratios. See note 51, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. Others of the factors named \u2014 the degree of risk, \u201cthe economic conditions of both the market place and the community,\u201d the \u201cefficiency of management,\u201d and the need for a contribution to surplus to allow for forcasted capital expansion \u2014 we understand to be considerations which the Commission might weigh in determining whether a particular return derived from an earnings-price analysis or a comparison of earnings of other companies would in fact provide Transit with a fair return. See Nichols, <em>supra </em>note 53, at 195-207; Nichols and Welch, <em>supra </em>note 53 at 78-79. The particular degree of risk borne by Transit\u2019s shareholders, for example, is a factor which must be evaluated by the Commission especially in applying the comparable earnings standard, but probably also in utilizing an attraction of capital approach which looks to eamings-price ratios of other companies. This is a matter requiring the exercise of informed judgment by the Commission, since it is no doubt impossible to find a company whose risk is identical to Transit\u2019s, and averaging figures for a number of companies tends to subsume differences in risk among the companies studied in a manner inconsistent with application of those figures to a particular company. But that does not make such inquiries irrelevant, nor does it relieve the Commission of the responsibility to reveal to a reviewing court the path it has followed, and the manner in which it has quantified its judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b996-6\">. Commentators have differed as to whether the comparable earnings or the attraction-of-capital standard is the approach which should be given primary weight in a rate proceeding.

We perceive no obstacle, and. each of these commentators would apparently agree, to the employment of both methods in a given proceeding \u2014 though, as we have noted, Transit\u2019s status as a subsidiary corporation may be a reason for placing less reliance on earnings-price statistics.

Transit\u2019s capital structure continues to be very heavily weighted in favor of debt, and, in fact, the percentage of debt capitalization apparently is still growing. In 1963, debt capital comprised 73.74% of total capitalization; the corresponding figure for 1965 is 77.68%. In remanding, we observe that \u201cthe desirable ratio of debt to equity\u201d is one of the matters which \u201cmust be prayerfully explored by the conscientious regulator before he can begin to say why he fixed upon 4.87 rather than 6.5 or 3.2.\u201d 121 U.S.App.D.C. at 401, 350 F.2d at 779. A very high debt-equity ratio may have beneficial effects for the ratepayer, since debt capital costs less to acquire than equity capital, and since interest payments are deductible expenses for tax purposes while dividends are not. See In re D. C. Transit Sys., Inc. (Order No. 563), <em>supra </em>note 10, 63 P.U.R.3d at 43. On the other hand, as the Commission recognized, <em>ibid, </em>a very high debt-equity ratio may increase the costs of both debt and equity capital. See note 52, <em>supra. </em>It may be that, on balance, a saving in total capital costs is effected by a high debt-equity ratio. But the Commission has not yet made the findings which would warrant such a conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">. 121 U.S.App.D.C. at 402, 350 F.2d at 780.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b997-9\">. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b997-10\">.

See Leventhal, <em>supra </em>note 49, at 998-1003, 1013-1016.

In remanding, we stressed the need for inquiry by the Commission into \u201cthe cost to Transit of borrowing money,\u201d and \u201cwhat Transit\u2019s future requirements in this regard are likely to be.\u201d 121 U.S.App.D.C. at 401, 350 F.2d at 779. But though the Commission in its supplemental opinion purports to have computed a return sufficient, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201cto enable Transit to service its debt,\u201d In re D.C. Transit Sys., Inc.

The Commission made no finding as to the return on equity which would result from allowance of an overall return of $1,480,000; indeed, since it did not estimate the cost of servicing Transit\u2019s debt during the future annual period, see note 68, <em>supra, </em>it could not, as the following hypothetical example shows: Given a figure for book equity of $4,000,000 and an allowed total return of $1,000,000, the return to the equity holder would be $800,000, or 20%, if debt expense were $200,000; if debt expense were $800,000, the return to the equity holder would be only $200,000, or 5%.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-16\">\u201c[T]he return to each class of security holder is relevant in judging whether a given overall rate of return is reasonable. Due to the relatively low cost of debt financing, an overall rate of return of 5.6 per cent might yield a return to common stockholders of 6 or 7 per cent in a utility with little debt but yield a much higher return to common shareholders of a highly leveraged utility with a high percentage of debt in its capital structure. Neither the Commission nor the courts may ignore this fact.\u201d City of Alton v. Commerce Comm\u2019n, 19 Ill.2d 76, 165 N.E.2d 513, 519 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">Without having estimated Transit\u2019s debt, and having been disabled thereby from computing and evaluating the return to equity holder, we are at a loss to understand how the Commission could conclude that $1,480,786 is a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d margin of return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b998-18\">.

We are aware that in an analogous context language similar to that employed in \u00a7 6(a) (2) of the Compact has been construed to permit new rates to be made effective as of the date the application for a rate increase was filed. See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, <em>supra, </em>336 U.S. at 605, 69 S.Ct. 756, 93 L.Ed. 911, see also United States v. New York Cent. R.R., 279 U.S. 73, 49 S.Ct. 260, 73 L.Ed. 619 (1929). However, the presumption against retroactivity was there found to be rebutted, to that extent by clear indications of legislative intent in the history of the Act, see Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, <em>supra, </em>336 U.S. at 605, 69 S.Ct. 756, 93 L.Ed. 911; Transcontinental &amp; West. Air, Inc. v.

Moreover, there are important differences between mail pay regulation, involved in the above cases, and the setting of rates to be paid by the general public, see Delta Air Lines v. CAB, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 88, 90, 92, 280 F.2d 636, 638, 640, cert. denied 364 U.S. 870, 81 S.Ct. 115, 5 L.Ed. 2d 94 (1960), which militate against giving to the language of \u00a7 6(a) (2) an interpretation similar to that accorded the statutory language involved in Trans AVorld Airlines, Inc. v. CAB, <em>supra. </em>We also note that the Compact provides no mechanism whereby Commission power to adjust retroactively the rates charged to the busriding public could be made effective \u2014 as, for example, by permitting the higher fares sought by the carrier to go into effect immediately subject to a contingent obligation, secured by a bond, to refund any excess of fares collected over those ultimately found to be just and reasonable. See, <em>e. g., </em>Hope Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, <em>supra </em>note 92, 196 F.2d at 805-806; City of New Haven v. New Haven Water Co., 132 Conn. 496, 45 A.2d 831 (1946); <em>of. </em>Natural Gas Act \u00a7 4(e), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c(e). Instead the Compact simply empowers the Commission to suspend the proposed tariff, and provides that the tariff shall \u201ctake effect\u201d unless suspended, or at the termination of the suspension period. Compact, <em>supra </em>note 9, tit. II, art. XII, \u00a7\u00a7 5(e), 6(a)(1), 6(a) (2); see Hope Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, <em>supra </em>note 92, 196 F.2d at 806-807. That no mechanism was provided for retroactive adjustment of rates may well reflect the different problem presented by bus riders on the one hand, and gas or electric customers on the other.

In this connection it is significant, we think, that in conferring power on the Commission to prescribe divisions, between carriers, of joint fares, the Compact expressly authorizes \u201cthe adjustment of divisions * * * from the date of filing the complaint or entry of the order of investigation, or such other date subsequent thereto as the Commission finds to be just, reasonable and equitable.\u201d Compact, supra note 9, tit.

However, in both <em>Morgan </em>and <em>Atlantia Coast Line </em>there existed an independent jurisdiction basis for remand to the Commission, and the only question was the effect which should be given by the Court to the findings and determination of the Commission or administrator pursuant to the remand. The administrator in <em>Morgan </em>\u201cwas free to make an order fixing rates for the future, and for that purpose or any other within the purview of the Act he is now free to determine a reasonable rate for the period antedating any order he may now make.\u201d 307 U.S. at 192, 59 S.Ct. at 800, 83 L.Ed. 1211. To say that a reviewing court may sometimes give some retroactive effect to the eventual Commission order which, in respect of the Commission\u2019s authority is prospective only, is.not at all to say that a remand is appropriate when the Commission\u2019s action could, have <em>no </em>prospective effect. <em>Cf. </em>Montana-Dakota Utils.

This position misconceives the function of this court in reviewing an order of the Commission. We, of course, in rendering our decision, acted within the scope of our authority. Consequently, we determined merely that the Commission had not regularly pursued its authority. Everything else stated in our opinion was in response to contentions of the plaintiff relative to confiscatory rates, arbitrary action by the Commission in respects other than those by ns sustained, etc. But because we in the rationale of the opinion found that such contentions should be overruled, it does not follow that we determined that the rates charged by the utility were unjust, unreasonable or confiscatory.

There, proposed rate increases filed by the carrier pursuant to \u00a7 4(e) of the National Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c (e), had gone into effect at the end of the suspension period, subject to a refund obligation.

By January 1, 1964, the original acquisition adjustment balance of $10,339,-041 had been reduced to $2,519,484. Thus 24.4% of the balance remained un-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>amortized, while 22.7% of the acquired depreciable properties were still in service. And see note 148, <em>infra. </em>It is interesting to note that while the original amoritzation term was fixed to coincide with the ten-year period for accruals to the track removal and street repaving reserve, the unamortized acquisition adjustment balance, on the date of changeover to the new plan, was fairly close to what it would have been had the amortization been tied entirely to the depreciable lives of the acquired assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"148\">\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">. The acquisition adjustment balance on January 1, 1964, was $2,344,990 according to Transit, but $2,519,484 according to the Commission. And while Transit\u2019s calculation would have reduced the annual amortization to $193,011, the figure the Commission arrived at was $199,561.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"149\">\n<p id=\"b1012-13\">. The service lifetimes of certain of Transit\u2019s properties extend beyond the term of its franchise, while the Commission\u2019s change compresses the amortization within the remaining period of the franchise. But according to the testimony of Transit\u2019s vice president and comptroller, this factor would make the percentages we recite only \u201cslightly higher\u201d than they would otherwise be.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"150\">\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">. This divergence would have been avoided had the Commission adopted the procedure recommended by its staff. In Order No. 385 the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-16\">\u201cThe Commission staff has related the balance in the Acquisition Adjustment Account to the properties acquired on August 15, 1956, which are still in service and subject to depreciation at their original cost. The staff then projected retirement dates for these properties and calculated an amortization schedule based on such projections, cutting off at August 15, 1976, as the expiration date of the franchise. This produced an uneven and constantly reducing amount of amortization per year; it also would be subject to change as projected retirements materialized earlier or later than scheduled. These characteristics are the major disadvantages of this plan of amortization; they could be avoided, and the recurring credits smoothed out, if the amortization were placed on a straight-line basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"151\">\n<p id=\"b1012-17\">.

VIII, <em>infra, </em>whereupon the justice of assessing any of the deficiency to the farepayers can be fully restudied. That question touches the public at large, and the Commission should look beyond the immediate concerns of the parties to the more general welfare, even in situations, more exaggerated than that here, where those who might have objected remained completely silent. Indeed, \u201c[t]here may always be exceptional cases or particular circumstances which will prompt a reviewing or appellate court, where injustice might otherwise result, to consider questions of law which were neither pressed nor passed upon by the court or administrative agency below.\u201d Hormel v.

In Order No. 245, the Commission examined the returns earned by Transit and its predecessor companies over a 28-year period for purposes of determining whether Transit\u2019s investors had been compensated for assuming the risk of obsolescence of abandoned rail properties. In the Commission\u2019s view \u201cthe returns earned [during this period] were generally below the rates of return established as being reasonable by the regulatory body\u201d and \u201cthe regulatory authority, in fixing the rates of return * * * did not allow any additional compensation for the risk of obsolescence.\u201d In re D.C.

Transit I, <em>supra </em>note 1, 121 U.S.App.D.C. at 395 n. 47, 350 F.2d at 773 n. 47. We cannot regard the circumstance that the returns earned over a 28-year period were \u201cgenerally below\u201d the levels administratively fixed as reasonable, as a demonstration that, during the particular periods the properties insufficiently depreciated were in service, there were no excesses of earnings over fair returns as would wholly or partially provide reimbursement for the depreciation deficiency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"189\">\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">. As we have observed, see <em>supra </em>note 165, some of the depreciation deficiency represented obsolete equipment that was eliminated from Transit\u2019s accounts. In Washington Gas Light Co. v. Baker, supra note 94, 88 U.S.App.D.C. at 123, 188 F.2d at 19, we pointed out that \u201c[i]t * * * becomes relevant to determine whether or not investors have, during the useful life of [abandoned] property, been compensated for assuming the risk that it would become inadequate or obsolete before the investment in it was entirely recovered.\u201d See also Bebchick v.

This is what the Commission order proposes. Fulfillment of the order will result in the removal of the deferred tax as ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>penditures are made. This will permit the $222,000 to be charged to the ratepayer, if, as, and when the expenditures, for which accruals had been made in the Reserve for Track Removal, materialize. <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgnB\">\u201cThe ratepayer will be charged directly for the tax as and when the Company expends the money that has been accrued for this track removal purpose. This is true even though in some years the expenditures will exceed the taxable income of the Company on its District of Columbia tax return. The order of the Commission was devised to overcome the difficulty that might otherwise have been faced in clearing out the deferred income tax. The order of the Commission ignores the relationship between the Taxable income on the District of Columbia tax return and the amount expended for track removal, with the express purpose of making certain that as expenditures are made, the deferred tax is plowed back as an expense to the ratepayer.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"256\">\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">.

It is not for us, at least in the first instance, to measure the extent of the duplication. We recognize, however, that this would depend partly upon how closely operating costs of buses retired during the historical test period compared with the costs of those the Commission\u2019s staff eliminated for the future annual period, see note 263 <em>supra, </em>and partly upon the degree of coincidence in the number of buses involved in each period. We observe only that, in consequence of the circumstances recited in the text, some duplication was inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">We also note, in this connection, the average age of Transit\u2019s buses is steadily decreasing as a result of the annual infusion of new vehicles. Transit figures denote a reduction from 9.41 years in 1962 to 6.94 at the end of 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"268\">\n<p id=\"b1028-16\">.

An expert testified that the staff \u201cused figures that showed these trends [that increased maintenance expense accompanies aging] right up to the year ending June 30th, [1965,] but somehow, by putting some water in the radiators from the \u2018fountain of Youth,\u2019 [it] managed to stop all that, [it] then went right on through eighteen months without a change.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"270\">\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">. The staff took from Transit\u2019s records a per-mile cost of 5.14 cents for operation of these 20 buses, but this was for operation over only 23,000 miles at the very beginning of service when costs are lowest. With this as its base, the staff raised its estimate to six cents flat, exclusive of labor increases in 1966. But compare the data in notes 271 and 272, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"271\">\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">. By the staff\u2019s plan, 100 of the new buses would travel a total of 4,098,030 miles throughout the full calendar year 1966, and these would be 18 months old at the end of the period; and the other 100 buses would travel a total of $2,040,-973 throughout the last six months of 1966, and these would be six months old at the end of the period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"272\">\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">. By October 30, 1965, actual maintenance costs on the new buses delivered during the previous June and July \u2014 and these were buses the staff estimated six cents per mile would maintain \u2014 had already risen to 7.65 cents per mile. As a matter of long experience, Transit\u2019s maintenance costs on new buses during the first year\u2019s operation have varied between seven and eight cents per mile at times when labor costs were substantially less than in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">From January 1, 1962, when Transit began an all-bus operation, through June 30, 1965, its system cost per mile, see note 260, supra, ranged from a low of 13.31 cents in 1964 to a high of 13.93 cents in 1962, and was 13.23 cents for the six months ending June 30, 1965. During this period, the system cost per mile decreased an aggregate of %0 of a cent, the largest reduction in any year being <em>%0 </em>of a cent in 1963. The staff\u2019s estimate of six cents per mile, converted to Transit\u2019s system cost per mile, would multiply these decreases, as appears from the next paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">As we have said, see the text <em>supra </em>at notes 262 and 263, the staff computed Transit\u2019s bus maintenance cost per mile of operation on a unit basis by groups, and its projected expense did not reflect increased labor costs for 1966, which the staff computed separately. Without the additional labor costs, the staff\u2019s computation was 13.10 cents as of June 30, 1965, and its estimate for 1966 was 11.16 cents. Giving effect to the increased labor costs, the staff\u2019s projection for 1966 would be 11.61 cents. This would amount to a reduction in 1966 maintenance costs per mile of 1.94 cents, an amount almost three times the cumulative reduction over the previous three and one-half years, and almost five times the largest reduction in a single year since 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">There is no evidence in the record indicating that Transit\u2019s historical pattern of maintenance costs was inaccurate, or that it would undergo any dramatic change in 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"273\">\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">. Maryland\u2019s licensing and tax fees for new 51-seat buses are about $1,200 for the first year and about $200 for each year thereafter. These compare with about $75 per year in Virginia and about $35 per year in the District. Because of these differences, Transit used in Maryland only those buses \u2014 more than one-third of its fleet \u2014 already licensed to operate therein. The staff did not take into account the additional costs of licensing buses in Maryland which its reassignments \u2014 apparently in considerable number \u2014 would require.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">In reassigning buses to regular route operations, the passenger capacities of the buses were almost entirely ignored. Thus, in some number of instances, undeter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>mined on the record, it appears, 31-seat buses were reassigned to routes previously served by 51-seat buses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"274\">\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">. This projection resulted in a figure for 1966 bus maintenance costs that was $150,393 higher than the staff\u2019s estimate. Thus, the latter estimate of $574,578 less $148,040 for additional labor or a net of $426,538 in savings would be reduced by $150,393 to $276,145 in savings.</p>\n<p id=\"ANID\">Transit made another projection, likewise applying the staff\u2019s unit maintenance cost factors to buses properly assigned, but considering also the aging of the buses and the decreased miles of operation of older buses. This, for 1966, resulted in a cost per mile of 1.92 cents higher than the staff estimate, and a total annual maintenance cost $674,478 above that computed by the staff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"275\">\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">.

Indeed, though recognizing that payment of dividends \u201crests within the sound discretion of mangement,\u201d he suggested that Transit should consider reduction or elimination of dividends in the future annual period, since, despite excess earnings, the undesirably high proportion of debt in the company\u2019s capital structure had grown even larger in recent years. He added that if management nevertheless did declare a dividend, \u201cobviously no greater amount is required than $400,000\u201d \u2014 since that was the amount historically paid to stockholders of the parent, and \u201cthe relevant data for consideration here is the market performance of the parent\u2019s stock.\u201d See notes 291, 292, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"300\">\n<p id=\"b1033-15\">.

At the commencement of the 1965 rate hearing, neither the Commission\u2019s staff nor Transit had the full results of Transit\u2019s 1965 revenue experience from which to project 1966 revenues. Transit therefore based its revenue estimate for 1966 on revenues earned for the year ending June 30, 1965. However, before the Commission issued Order No. 564, it had before it the complete revenue experience for 1965. Transit\u2019s regular route reve-enue for the year ending June 30, 1965 was $29,837,656, and for the calendar year 1965 was $30,183,559. In re D.C. Transit Sys., Inc.

F.P.C., 128 U.S.App.D.C. 107, 113, 385 F.2d 629, 635 (1967), to the effect that \u201c[a] regulatory agency may, should, and in some instances must, give consideration to objectives expressed by Congress in other legislation * * and the remainder of Part IV implies that the giving of such consideration is appropriate here and that the Commission is to be faulted only because it blindly adopted the policy of Section 203(e) instead of exercising in a meaningful way the \u201cdiscretion\u201d it possessed to do so or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">My disagreement with this part of the opinion stems from my belief that, since Section 203(e) is not applicable, the Commission cannot give any consideration to the policy embodied therein. In other words, the Commission has no \u201cdiscretion\u201d to deny the farepayers the benefits of the investment tax credit savings. I rely specifically on the language quoted by the majority from F.P.C. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 386 U.S. 237, 244, 87 S.Ct. 1003, 1008, 18 L.Ed.2d 18 (1967): \u201c[W]hen the out-of-pocket tax cost of the regulated [taxpayer] is reduced, there is an immediate confrontation with the ratemaking principle that limits cost of service to expenses actually incurred.\u201d As this statement recognizes, basic to all ratemaking is fixing rates in terms of actual costs and that, of course, includes the actual cost of federal income taxes as well. To hold that the Commission has the discretion to fix the rates on the basis of total federal income tax liability without subtracting the amount of the tax credit which Transit is entitled to, and in fact takes, flies in the face of this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">I do not think that anything in our <em>en banc </em>decision in Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. F.P.C., 115 U.S.App. D.C. 8, 316 F.2d 659 (1963), precludes our holding in this case that the Commission does not have the discretion to set a rate which is not based on a total flow-through. Certainly the spirit of <em>Panhandle </em>is that tax benefits should flow through and, although we there affirmed the Commission\u2019s discretion not to give the consumers the total benefit of the revenues generated by Panhandle\u2019s use of Section 167\u2019s authorization of accelerated depreciation, I think that part of the decision turned on the fact that accelerated depreciation is merely a tax deferral and not a tax saving like investment tax credit. We stated in <em>Panhandle:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-8\">\u201c* * -x- The liberalized method provides higher depreciation deductions and therefore lower taxes during the early part of the life of a given property, and lower deductions and higher taxes in the later years of the life of the property. The total depreciation deduction's available to a company over the entire life of a facility are the same using either method. ' * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">115 U.S.App.D.C. at 10, 316 F.2d at 660. In this case giving Transit the benefit of Section 203(e) would result in a rate predicated in part on hypothetical costs not expended \u2014 on taxes never to be paid. This, in my judgment, would be contrary to the fundamental principle of ratemaking.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
