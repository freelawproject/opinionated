U. S.

The first count charged him with taking approximately $25,000 in money from the bank; the second, with taking and carrying away the money, with intent to steal; the third, with receiving and possessing the money, and the fourth, with putting in jeopardy, by use of a pistol, the lives of the bank employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-24\">After the jury returned its verdict, the Court deferred sentence on Counts One, Two, and Three, and imposed a twenty-year sentence only upon Count Four. Hence, we are not concerned with any possible duplicity in Counts One, Two, and Three, which, indeed, have not been raised as points for consideration on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-25\">Appellant\u2019s first contention, that the District Court committed plain error, in failing, on its own motion, to have appellant examined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244, as to his mental condition, clearly is without merit. As a factual basis for this contention, appellant points to excerpts from the trial transcript set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>where appellant, for the first time, revealed that about sixteen years prior to the time the crime allegedly took place, he had been discharged from the Navy for mental reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We need mention only our primary reasons for holding that the trial court did not err. We are particularly impressed that the trial judge, after observing the rather lengthy testimony of appellant, his obvious ability to articulate intelligently, as well as the pertinent testimony of the other witnesses, \u25a0clearly felt that no real question as to appellant\u2019s mental condition existed, either at trial, or when the crime was committed. After carefully considering the record as a whole, we conclude that it sustains the trial court\u2019s action as entirely proper under the circumstances presented.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-31\">Appellant also contends that in his closing remarks to the jury, the Government\u2019s attorney committed reversible error by using the language set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Considering the innocuous nature of these remarks and that appellant\u2019s counsel made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>objection to them at trial, we hold that, unquestionably, no plain, reversible error was committed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Accordingly, the judgment below is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-16\">. At about the middle of the second day of this two-day trial, and after appellant had been examined and cross examined, the following colloquy took place between appellant and bis attorney, on redirect examination :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcE\">Q Francis, were you ever in the Service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-27\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-28\">Q What branch of the Service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-29\">A The Navy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"asv-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Q When was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">A 1952.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALK5\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV-Q\">Q How long were you in the Service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1l\">A Just a short while.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN-\">Q What is the reason for your discharge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ8\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU9\">Q Tell us the reason for your discharge, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Pr\">A I messed up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ara-dedup-1\">Q Don\u2019t you have a medical discharge, Francis ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avq-dedup-0\">A <em>I think so, yes sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amh-dedup-0\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-L\">[As noted, all of this occurred some sixteen years before the crime and trial which resulted in conviction. Moreover, one of appellant\u2019s witnesses, Mrs. Betty Kelly, in effect testified that he \u2014appellant\u2014had implied in conversations with her that he had deliberately misled Navy psychiatrists in order to secure a medical discharge. Tr. 383-384.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6E\">Q You know so, don\u2019t you, Francis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avn-dedup-0\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"as4-dedup-0\">Q What is it for? What is the reason for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxY\">A For being crazy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ah2-dedup-0\">Q Are you subject to epileptic fits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ala-dedup-0\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayc-dedup-0\">Q Are you subject to amnesia, blackouts, and that is all put on your discharge, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-4L\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aud-dedup-0\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aox-dedup-0\">On re-cross examination, the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahn-dedup-0\">Q <em>You are not pleading \u201cNot Guilty\" by reason of insanity?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ7J\">A As a matter of fact, there was no one knew anything about this in this courtroom until awhile ago, probably after my mother maybe told my attorney. He came straight to me. He didn\u2019t even know that I had been in the Service. I didn\u2019t tell him that, because I didn\u2019t want this stuff brought out. <em>I don\u2019t think J am crazy. </em>I know what people tell me, the crazy things I do, that I don\u2019t know anything about. That\u2019s all I can say. I didn\u2019t bring none of this stuff up. The Government, or my attorney or whoever is responsible, brought up about fifteen or twenty minutes ago. During our recess, when we come back in from the recess, it was brought to me, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about this?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APco\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-34\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-35\">.
