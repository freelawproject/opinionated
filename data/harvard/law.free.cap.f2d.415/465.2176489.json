Upon hearing, the Referee granted bankrupt\u2019s motion to dismiss as to the allegation based on \u00a7 32(c) (7), because, at best, it was a mere quotation of the language of that section. The Referee denied bankrupt\u2019s motion to dismiss the allegation based on \u00a7 32(c) (3), relating to the use of a false financial statement, but required the bank to amend this objection to show the transaction to which its, allegation referred. The bank filed its amended specifications of objections to discharge after the last day fixed for filing objections to discharge, but within the time allowed by the Referee\u2019s order. The bankrupt then filed a motion to dismiss or alternatively to strike the amended specifications of objections to discharge. The Referee denied this motion. The bankrupt then sought review by the district court. The district court denied the petition for review adopting and affirming the findings of the Referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">Bankrupt asserts essentially two bases for reversal of the district court: (1) that the original objections to discharge were not amendable, (2) that the objections as amended were insufficient. After considering these arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">The bankrupt appears to contend that the original objection to discharge was so fatally defective that there was, in fact, nothing in the pleadings to amend. A similar argument was rejected in Georgia Jewelers, Inc. v. Bulova Watch Co.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-14\">Of course decisions can be found which talk in terms of \u201cfatally defective\u201d petitions, but we agree with Collier\u2019s that such descriptives are not decisive. \u201cFar more preferable is the view that defects in pleading are not \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 ; that whether or not they may be cured depends upon the power of amendment, and that a bankruptcy court has ample jurisdiction to permit amendments. Aside from a few isolated instances, judicial opinion amply supports these views.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4l\">Allowing the amendment in this case was proper. Even before General Order 37 required the application of Federal Rule 15(a) to bankruptcy procedures, it was recognized that, \u201cThe right of a creditor to amend his specifications in opposition to a bankrupt\u2019s discharge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>a valuable right, and should be freely granted in the interests of justice.\u201d In re Schlesinger.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ag5\">Since the year 1939 General Order 37 has provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACBd\">In proceedings under the Act the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of the United States shall, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act or with these general orders, be followed as nearly as may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a2q-dedup-0\">Bankrupt, however, contends that objections to discharge are not to be judged by the standards of the federal rules because of General Order 32<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>and Official Form in Bankruptcy No. 44.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The provisions require the filing of a \u201cspecification in writing\u201d of such objections, but as the Referee pointed out they contain no suggestion of the type of allegation which must be contained in the specification. They contain no different or more onerous standard of pleading than that imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus by virtue of General Order 37, the standard to be applied in determining whether or not to allow amendment of an objection to discharge is the standard of Rule 15 (a) Fed.R. of Civ.P., which requires that leave to amend be freely given \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d In re Schmerel;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In re Black and White Cab Co.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ap5\">We agree with the Referee that the objection to discharge based on \u00a7 32(c) (3) was sufficient, in its original form, to withstand a motion to dismiss under the simple standard of notice pleading. See Conley v. Gibson.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The contention that the objection to discharge in its amended form is insufficient is frivolous. Bankrupt\u2019s contention that the amendment to the objections to discharge was improper in that it contained new ground not present in the original objections is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"A2j\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">.
