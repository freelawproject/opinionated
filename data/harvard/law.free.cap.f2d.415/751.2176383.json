The port is a general docking, mooring, warehousing, and rail facility. Connecting, interchange, and switching trackage totals some seventeen (17) miles in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>On December 31, 1956, an operating agreement, providing for alternate control and responsibility for switching operations, was consummated between the parties to this litigation. The companies agreed to perform switching operations on a rotating yearly basis. This agreement was terminated on July 4, 1967, pursuant to its provisions, and a new agreement became effective the following day giving the defendant, Texas and Pacific, exclusive switching and maintenance responsibilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Appellant seeks to enjoin or void the 1967 agreement because the <em>appellees</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>failed to procure an ICC certificate pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, Section 1(18), Title 49, U.S.C., Section 1(18). ICA, Section 1(18) requires ICC approval of any abandonment of operation of all or any part of a railway line, i. e. line of railroad. The section also provides that: \u201cNothing in this paragraph * * * shall be considered to prohibit the making of contracts between carriers by railroads subject to this chapter, without the approval of the Commission, for the joint ownership or joint use of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks\u201d. The appellant\u2019s contention simply stated is that the 1967 agreement constituted an abandonment which required ICC approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The trial court found that the Greater Baton Rouge port facility was not a \u201cline of railroad\u201d so as to require ICC approval of the agreement and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding that the port facility was not a \u201cline of railroad\u201d. Whether or not the trackage falls within the \u201cline of railroad\u201d category contained in Section 1(18) or in the excepted category of \u201cspur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks\u201d of that section is for the court rather than the Interstate Commerce Commission to decide. Title 49, U.S.C., Section 1 (20); Powell v. United States, 300 U.S. 276, 57 S.Ct. 470, 81 L.Ed. 643 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">The trial court made the following specific findings of fact: \u201cThe track-age involved in this suit is non-carrier owned and has been for the past twelve years, non-carrier maintained. The rails are of light weight stock and are all located within one parish of the state. There has never been any station, facilities for handling less than carload freight, signaling systems, telephone and telegraph communications systems, or railroad agents located on or along any of the trackage involved. No passenger trains or line-haul freight trains have ever operated over the trackage. Each carrier\u2019s right to use the trackage has been limited for the past twelve years by contract to the performance of switching services every thitd year. The track-age has never been used for any purpose other than switching. It has been used primarily to service only one industry * * *. It is obvious from these facts above that by no stretch of the imagination could this trackage be considered to be a \u2018line of railroad.\u2019 \u201d 288 F.Supp. 320, 323. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-15\">The trackage involved here was properly classified as spur and switching trackage and as such is not subject to the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 1(18)-1(22) of the Act. United States v. State of Idaho, 298 U.S. 105, 56 S.Ct. 690, 80 L.Ed. 1070 (1936). Since there is no contention that the 1956 contract was not validly terminated (other than the abandonment contention previously discussed) or that the 1967 contract was invalid we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the injunctive relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">. The Port Commission entered into the new agreement because it was unable to maintain the trackage properly as was evidenced by prior derailments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-17\">. The appellant brought suit against defendants, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad Company, and the Greater Baton Rouge Port Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
