Urbano, an inmate in the New Jersey State Prison, against the Board of Managers of the State Prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The suit was brought in the form of a class action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on behalf of all of the inmates of the institution who are alleged to be beneficiaries of an inmate trust or welfare fund <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claimed to have been estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>lished under two New Jersey statutes: N.J.S.A. 30:4-15, 30:4-67.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKg9\">According to appellant, the primary sources of the \"trust fund,\u201d which has evidently been in existence for at least twenty years, and possibly longer, have been from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQpQ\">(a) a compulsory deduction from prisoners\u2019 wages up to a maximum of $10,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWU\">(b) profits from the sale of goods at the prison commissary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD-s\">The fund may also have been the beneficiary of gifts from private individuals or groups <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or from state appropriations. The record does not disclose the present value of the corpus of the trust fund.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2V\">In his complaint appellant charges the members of the Board of Managers of the New Jersey State Prison with \u201cmismanagement, waste and expenditures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>contrary to * * * statutory provisions and not for the benefit of the inmate beneficiaries\u201d and alleges that the benefits have not been \u201cequally distributed among the beneficiaries as required by law.\u201d (App. 14a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Then, in his pro se brief, appellant Urbano claims that the members of the Board have used the trust fund moneys to cover \u201cpersonal losses of officers from the Trust because the losses are attributed to the prisoners; subsidization of religious services * * *; purchase of airconditioners [sic] and other luxuries for private offices; use of confiscated food items intended for distribution to prisoners in the officers\u2019 mess of the prison * * *; etc.\u201d (Brief p. 13.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Appellant has asked for extensive relief, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on allegations which, if true, are not insubstantial. However, we choose to affirm the lower court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, but on a different basis, namely, abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>Decision of Lower Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"atg-dedup-0\">The district court dismissed the complaint on three alternative grounds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First, the court held that \u201ca suit seeking to control the performance of the official duties of state officials is, in substance, a suit against the State, and is therefore barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">We have some doubt concerning the appropriateness here of the application of the Eleventh Amendment. The conclusion that must be reached before the Eleventh Amendment may be interposed by appellant is that the state is the real party in interest. Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945) ;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Harris v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm., 410 F.2d 1332, 1333 n. 1 (3d Cir. 1969); Citizens Committee for Hudson Valley v. Volpe, 297 F.Supp. 809, 810-811 (S.D.N.Y.1969); Jackson v. Colorado, 294 F.Supp. 1065, 1071-1072 (D.Col.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">In determining whether an \u201calter ego\u201d status attaches to the instrumentality of a state, it has been said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-19\">* * * [L]ocal law and decisions defining the status and nature of the agency involved in its relation to the sovereign are factors to be considered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>but only one of a number that are of significance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">Among the other factors, no one of which is conclusive, perhaps the most important is whether, in the event plaintiff prevails, the payment of the judgment will have to be made out of the state treasury; significant here also is whether the agency has the funds or the power to satisfy the judgment. Other relevant factors are whether the agency is performing a governmental or proprietary function; whether it has been separately incorporated; the degree of autonomy over its operations; whether it has the power to sue and be sued and to enter into contracts; whether its property is immune from state taxation, and whether the sovereign has immunized itself from responsibility for the agency\u2019s operations. Krisel v. Duran, 258 F.Supp. 845, 849 (S.D.N.Y.1966), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>386 F.2d 179 (2d Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 1042, 88 S.Ct. 1635, 20 L.Ed.2d 303 (1968) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><em>See also </em>the comprehensive treatment of the problems of immunity in S. J. Groves &amp; Sons v. New Jersey Turnpike Authority, 268 F.Supp. 568 (D.N.J. 1967) ; Miller v. Vermont, 201 F.Supp. 930, 932 (D.Vt.1962); and Aerated Products Co. of Philadelphia v. Department of Health of State of New Jersey et al., 59 F.Supp. 652, 655, 660 (D.N.J. 1945), <em>affd, </em>159 F.2d 851 (3d Cir. 1947). The court said in <em>S. J. Groves:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">Counties and municipalities do not partake of the Eleventh Amendment immunity enjoyed by the States * *, although they clearly are public bodies and in many cases perform functions on behalf of the State. * * *, Whether other bodies come under the Amendment depends on their relationship to the State, on the powers and responsibilities, the attributes and limitations, with which they have been endowed. * * * 268 F.Supp. at 574.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Appellant\u2019s claim for money damages, the most significant factor listed in <em>Krisel, </em>is not against the treasury of the state but against the individual members of the Board of Managers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, the requested audit of the books of the trust fund would not seem to encroach directly upon the governmental functions of the state. As will be more fully developed later, however, since the authorizing statutes are not clear as to the status of the fund, and there are no state decisions regarding the \u201cstatus and nature of the agency involved <em>[i. e., </em>the Board of Managers] in its relation to the sovereign * * Krisel v. Duran, <em>supra, </em>the state courts should be given an opportunity to adjudicate these matters before a federal court intervenes.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">We should note that in Kisielewski v. New Jersey, 68 N.J.Super. 258, 172 A.2d 203, <em>pet. for certification denied, </em>36 N.J. 144, 174 A.2d 927 (1961), a comparable agency of New Jersey, the State Home for Girls, was held to be \u201cpurely an administrative subdivision of the government,\u201d and therefore the alter ego of the state for sovereign immunity purposes, in a negligence suit involving a claim for damages for personal injury to an inmate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>We do not believe that <em>Kisielewski </em>is dispositive of the \"alter ego\u201d question. In the first place, in the present action it is not the institution as such that is being sued, <em>i. e., </em>the New Jersey State Prison, but the Board of Managers of the institution. Secondly, this is not a conventional negligence action but a suit charging the instrumentality in control of the New Jersey State Prison with breaches of fiduciary duty in the handling of a trust fund of which the prisoners are claimed to be the beneficiaries. It may be that in its capacity as trustee of an inmate trust fund, the Board of Managers has a different relationship to the sovereign for immunity purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">If it should be concluded that the Board of Managers is not the alter ego of the state, the Eleventh Amendment would probably pose no bar to an action in the federal court. The mantle of protection afforded to the states by the Eleventh Amendment prohibits suits against state officials, unless consent is given, where they operate under the authority granted by law and in accordance with the United States Constitution. Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908); 3 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 27.01 (Supp.1965), \u00a7 27.03 (1958); 1 Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 54.1 (Wright ed. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">The Eleventh Amendment may not be used to shield activity which is lawless.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The allegations contained in appellant\u2019s complaint, which, if true, would indicate at least malfeasance in office, would be sufficient, we believe, to avoid the application of the Eleventh Amendment. At worst, appellant alleges criminal acts by state officials. Without any intimation as to the legitimacy of these charges, such conduct, if proven, cannot be swept under the Eleventh Amendment rug. We are not disposed, therefore, to dismiss this suit on the basis of the Eleventh Amendment. Cf. Whitner v. Davis, 410 F.2d 24, 29-30 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">The second ground for the lower court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint was that a New Jersey statute, N.J.S.A. 30:4-16,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cmay be viewed as an express grant of immunity to defendants from any action seeking to hold them liable for the performance of their official duties.\u201d (App. 10a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">Our research discloses no New Jersey case construing this statute. Although the interpretation of state statutes is generally left to the state courts, unless a constitutional violation is alleged, we perceive the language of the statute to deal primarily with the protection of various officials of state in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>stitutions, engaged in the different phases of the detention of inmates, from suits in the nature of false imprisonment. Whether this statute can also serve to grant immunity to officials alleged to have mismanaged a trust fund established for the benefit of prisoners, even though there is a reference in the act to the \u201cmanagement\u201d of inmates, is far from clear, and we do not believe it is proper to dispose of the complaint on this ground.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As we are constrained to dismiss this action under the doctrine of abstention, it will be up to the state courts, if this suit is pressed further, to gauge the applicability of this statutory grant of immunity to the facts here.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The third ground for the decision below was the court\u2019s hesitancy to interfere with the discipline of state prisoners, in the absence of any allegation of deprivation of constitutional rights, citing Negrich v. Hohn, 379 F.2d 213 (3d Cir. 1967), and Gurzynski v. Yeager, 339 F.2d 884 (3d Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Whether the action of a federal court would result in \u201cinterference with state prison discipline\u201d in the sense of the <em>Negrich </em>and <em>Gurzynski </em>cases requires a careful analysis of the nature of the conditions about which appellant complains. Certain elements of the relief he seeks, note 10 <em>supra, </em>would not seem to interfere with the day-to-day regulated activities of appellant and his fellow prisoners. If the allegations made are true and mismanagement has occurred, an audit of the books of the trust fund, as well as possible recovery of damages for the benefit of the fund and other aspects of the relief requested, may not materially interfere with the institution\u2019s control of appellant or of the inmates generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">\n<em>Abstention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">The interrelationship between the putative trust created by N.J.S.A. 30:4-5 and 30:4-67.1 with the administration of the New Jersey State Prison makes this case singularly fitting for the application of the abstention doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Thus we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint on the basis of the court-developed principle of abstention, Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), and therefore refrain from reaching the merits of this case. In coming to this conclusion we recognize full well that the doctrine of abstention has been narrowly circumscribed when constitutional issues are presented, Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967); Kirkland v. Wallace, 403 F.2d 413 (5th Cir. 1968); Stickgold, Variations of the Theme of Dombrowski v. Pfister: Federal Intervention in State Criminal Proceedings Affecting First Amendment Rights, 1968 Wis.L.Rev. 369, 380-385, and virtually prohibited in diversity cases where the only difficulty is the unsettled posture of the state law, Meredith v. City of Winter Haven, 320 U.S. 228, 64 S.Ct. 7, 88 L.Ed. 9 (1943). <em>See generally </em>Annot., 20 L.Ed.2d 1623 (1969); 1A Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 0.203 (2d ed. 1965). But this is not a case which appears to involve constitutional issues nor is the difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>in deciding the case limited to the uncertainty of the state law. This case involves the sensitive problem of the operation and administration of an alleged inmates trust fund in a prison setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Professor Wright has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">* * * [A]bstention is variously recognized: (1) to avoid decision of a federal constitutional question where the case may be disposed of on questions of state law; (2) to avoid needless conflict with the administration by a state of its own affairs; (3) to leave to the states the resolution of unsettled questions of state law;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and (4) to ease the congestion of the federal court docket. * * * Wright, Federal Courts 169 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The second and third elements of the abstention doctrine, as defined above, are relevant here, <em>i. e., </em>to avoid interference with New Jersey\u2019s administration of its prison system, <em>cf. </em>Gurzynski v. Yeager, <em>supra, </em>and to permit the state courts to determine the status of the trust fund claimed to have been created by the statutes previously discussed and the relationship of the Board of Managers to such fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">Professor Wright has also noted, quite significantly, that \u201cwhere the federal court defers to avoid interference with state activities, <em>dismissal of the action, </em>rather than retention of jurisdiction pending a state determination, <em>is normally appropriate.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 173.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">The American Law Institute\u2019s Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts would also permit a district court in its discretion to apply the abstention doctrine when the following conditions are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-18\">(1) * * * the issues of State law cannot be satisfactorily determined in the light of the State authorities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-19\">(2) * * * abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is warranted * * * by a serious danger of embarrassing the effectuation of State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>policies by a decision of State law at variance with the view that may be ultimately taken by the State court, or by other circumstances of like character ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">(3) * * * a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">(4) * * * the parties\u2019 claims of federal right, if any, including any issues of fact material thereto, can be adequately protected by review of the State Court decision by the Supreme Court of the United States.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u00a7 1371 (c), Final Draft (1969), adopted at the Annual Meeting in 1968. (See Field, Jurisdiction of Federal Courts \u2014 A Summary of American Law Institute Proposals, 46 F.R.D. 141, 152 (1969)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">While the American Law Institute\u2019s proposal speaks in terms of a stay of the action by the district courts rather than outright dismissal (proposed \u00a7 1371 (d)), there is authority for such dismissal, as suggested by Professor Wright. <em>See </em>Burford v. Sun Oil Company, 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In the commentary to the \u00a7 1371 proposal the ALI recognizes the difficulty in achieving complete symmetry in the field of abstention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">* * * There is, then, no wholly satisfactory answer. To litigate these cases entirely through the federal courts strains state-federal relations, may make necessary the premature decision of federal constitutional questions, and requires the federal court to pass on questions of state law in circumstances under which an erroneous decision may seriously interfere with state substantive policies. To litigate such cases entirely through the state courts, with review in the United States Supreme Court, deprives plaintiff of federal fact-finding, and of federal protection during the pend-ency of the state action. To shuttle the cases back and forth from state to federal court, as present doctrines permit, \u201coperates to require piecemeal adjudication in many courts * * * thereby delaying ultimate adjudication on the merits for an undue length of time.\u201d Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 378-379, [84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377.] (1964). Thus, while the proposals put forward in this section are an attempt to improve on the present situation, it is not possible to provide a perfect solution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">* * * It would be anomalous if judge-made notions of abstention were to be applicable beyond the circumstances set forth in those subsections. In particular, the disadvantages of abstention outweigh any conceivable gain in requiring state determination of state questions <em>in routine diversity suits between private litigants involving no issue of public law. </em>Meredith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>v. City of Winter Haven, 320 U.S. 228, [64 S.Ct. 7, 88 L.Ed. 9.] (1943): * * * (Emphasis added.) Final Draft, pp. 285, 296.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">On balance, we conclude that this case is one in which dismissal is justified. While jurisdiction is asserted on the basis of diversity, this is not a \u201croutine\u201d suit and it does involve serious issues of public law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern R\u2019way Co., 341 U.S. 341, 351, 71 S.Ct. 762, 95 L.Ed. 1002 n. 15 (1951), Chief Justice Vinson pointed to language in Chief Justice Stone\u2019s opinion in <em>Meredith </em>which we believe distinguishes the thrust of the latter ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">* * * Decision here does not require the federal court to determine or shape the state policy governing administrative agencies. It entails no interference with such agencies or with the state courts. * * * 320 U.S. at 237, 64 S.Ct. at 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Earlier in the <em>Meredith </em>opinion the Court adverted to the exceptional circumstances which would warrant abstention in a diversity case, including the discretion of the federal court to \u201crefuse to appraise or shape domestic policy of the state governing its administrative agencies, * * 320 U.S. at 235, 64 S.Ct. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">In his dissent in Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25, 79 S.Ct. 1070, 3 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1959), in which the majority required a stay of proceedings pending construction of a state statute by the state courts, Justice Brennan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-17\">* * * Abstention has * * * been sanctioned on grounds of comity with the States \u2014 to avoid a result in \u201cneedless friction with state policies.\u201d * * Thus this Court has upheld an abstention when the exercise by the federal court of jurisdiction would disrupt a state administrative process, * * * or otherwise create needless friction by unnecessarily enjoining state officials from executing domestic policies * * *. 360 U.S. at 33, 79 S.Ct. at 1075.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-19\">In the majority opinion in Allegheny County v. Frank Mashuda Co., 360 U.S. 185, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163 (1959), filed the same day, in which abstention was held improper, Justice Brennan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-20\">* * * Abdication of the obligation to decide cases can be justified under this doctrine only in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the state court would clearly serve an important countervailing interest. * * * 360 U.S. at 188-189, 78 S.Ct. at 1063.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>More recently, Justice Brennan, on the basis of \u201cnarrowly limited special circumstances,\u201d concurred in a per curiam decision of the Supreme Court, reversing the Tenth Circuit, in which abstention was deemed proper in a diversity trespass action involving the novel question of whether a New Mexico statute authorized private coal companies to exercise eminent domain to secure water resources. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W. S. Ranch Co., 391 U.S. 593, 594, 88 S.Ct. 1753, 20 L.Ed.2d 835 (1968).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">As previously noted, we have for the purpose of convenience referred to the fund in dispute here as a \u201ctrust fund\u201d and to the prisoners as \u201cbeneficiaries.\u201d However, there is no adjudication by the state courts of New Jersey to give us guidance as to the legal attributes of the fund and what status the prisoners have in relation to it. We are therefore left without any state judicial assistance, directly or by implication, in determining what position the members of the Board of Managers hold with respect to the fund and to the prisoners.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">Even if we were convinced that this \u201ctrust fund\u201d is governed by the ordinary principles of trust law, it is a most unusual trust, intertwined with the management of the state penal system. It is clear that New Jersey would have an overriding interest in the development of its own policy regarding the establishment of trust funds for inmates of prisons and other state institutions. Normally, when federal courts are called upon to apply trust law in diversity cases, the policies which the state wishes to effectuate are quite clear. Not so here. A decision by a federal court in a barren area of state law that involves several statutes, the New Jersey State Prison and its Board of Managers, as well as general trust principles, may not only embarrass but also severely undercut the effectuation of state policies not yet clearly delineated.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Our decision in no way prejudices the appellant from resorting to the courts of New Jersey to pursue his cause. Indeed, the allegations appellant makes are of such nature that the state\u2019s interest in the integrity of its own officials and the prison system should be sufficient reason for New Jersey to provide a plain, speedy, efficient and unbiased remedy.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">For the reasons expressed at length above, the dismissal of the appellant\u2019s complaint will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\">. Appellant Urbano is presently serving a life sentence in the State Prison for murder. According to his complaint, Urbano was a citizen of Massachusetts prior to his incarceration. In view of the disposition we make of his appeal, we need not reach any definitive conclusion on the presence of diversity jurisdiction here. We do note that, problems of sovereign immunity aside, if the Board of Managers is a \u201ccitizen\u201d of New Jersey, then Urbano\u2019s claimed Massachusetts citizenship is diverse because his presence in New Jersey is not a domicile of choice. <em>See </em>Hiramatsu v. Phillips, 50 F.Supp. 167 (S.D.Cal.1953). Furthermore, the individual members of the Board of Managers, not named in the complaint, against whom relief is in part sought, are all required to be \u201cresidents\u201d (presumably \u201ccitizens\u201d) of New Jersey.

Although for convenience we adhere throughout the opinion to appellant\u2019s characterization of the fund involved in this litigation as a \u201ctrust fund\u201d and to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>prisoners as \u201cbeneficiaries,\u201d we make no holding as to the legal propriety of these labels or as to the correctness of the assertion that the cited statutes do in fact establish a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"atk-dedup-0\">In several opinions of the Attorney General of New Jersey, cited by appellant and referred to in the lower court\u2019s opinion, Appendix (App.) 32a-36a, 6a, the fund has been characterized as an \u201cinmates\u2019 Welfare Fund * * * in the nature of a trust.\u201d (See, e. <em>g., </em>Op.Atty. Gen., September 15, 1950, No. 61, App. 32a-33a.)

Mo.), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom., </em>Zuke v. Mercantile Trust Co., 385 F.2d 775 (8th Cir. 1967). It should be noted, however, that the general denial contained in appellee\u2019s answer (App. 16a) to appellant\u2019s complaint (App. 13a) would seem to contest the establishment of a trust under the statutes hereinafter cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Amq_\">. 30:4-15:</p>\n<p id=\"AWqp\">\n<em>Commissaries for sale of commodities to inmates, visitors and personnel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEYP\">The board of managers of any institution or noninstitutional agency set forth in section 30:1 \u2014 7 of the Revised Statutes may maintain a commissary or store for the sale of commodities to patients, inmates, visitors and personnel under rules adopted by the board.

The Eleventh Amendment provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-25\">The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b312-26\">. * * * [W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants. * * * 323 U.S. at 464, 65 S.Ct. at 350.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\">. As none of the members of the Board of Managers was named in the complaint, F.R.Civ.P. 10(a), it does not appear that the relief demanded of the Board members personally is proper. While individual members of a state agency do not have to be joined as party defendants in order to give a court jurisdiction to enjoin improper action by the <em>agency. </em>McCoy v. Louisiana State Board of Education, 345 F.2d 720 (5th Cir. 1965), it would not seem possible to secure personal relief, such as the punitive damages claimed here, without naming the members of the Board of Managers. In light of our disposition of the appeal, we do not need to resolve this issue directly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b313-16\">. The <em>Kisielewski </em>case did not involve the Eleventh Amendment, of course, but was a state court suit raising the question of whether the State Home for Girls could assert the same sovereign immunity as the State-of New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b314-5\">.

In his answer to appellant\u2019s complaint, the Attorney General did not specifically plead this statute, although the Fourth Separate Defense (App. 17a) did indicate that the members of the Board of Managers \u201cwere performing acts within the scope of their official authority, in good faith, * * * \u201d and are therefore \u201cimmune from any civil liability sought to be imposed upon them by plaintiff.\u201d See note 19, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">. Whether the members of the Board of Managers, if properly named as defendants, would be personally liable for damages may depend upon the application of state law in determining if their duties are discretionary, quasi-judicial or ministerial. <em>See </em>Travis v. Pinto, 87 N.J. Super. 263, 208 A.2d 828 (1965); Kisie-lewski v. New Jersey, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-16\"><em>See also </em>Godfrey v.

This is consistent with the statement of this court in Howell v. Citizens First National Bank of Ridgewood, 385 F.2d 528, 529 (3d Cir. 1967), by Judge Maris that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">* * * [I]t is settled that it may be appropriate for a federal court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction or to postpone such exercise and remit the parties to the state courts in a case which involves a decisive issue of unsettled state law * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Abstention was not applied in <em>Sowell </em>because we concluded after an examination of the federal and state laws relating to the establishment of branch banks that only a federal question was actually involved. See Handler, Jurisdictional Abstention in Federal-State Branch Bank Conflicts, 19 Rutgers L.Rev. 445 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">We do not believe that appellee\u2019s failure to assert the abstention principle below bars our resort to the abstention doctrine on appeal under the circumstances here. In Provident Tradesmen Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968), while concluding that we should not have required the district court to dismiss the declaratory judgment action in that particular diversity case, 365 F.2d 802, 814 (3d Cir. 1966), the Supreme Court did not base its reversal on the fact that we took this action sua sponte. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-21\"><em>While we do not nou&gt; declare that a court of appeals may never on its own motion compel dismissal of an action as an unwarranted intrusion upon state adjudication of state law, </em>we do conclude that, <em>this being a discretionary matter, </em>the existence of a verdict reached after a prolonged trial in which the defendants did not invoke the pending state actions should be taken into consideration in deciding whether dismissal is the wiser course. 390 U.S. at 126, 88 S.Ct. at 746. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-22\">No such considerations are present in the instant case, of course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b316-23\">. Professor Wright follows this by declaring that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-24\">* * * If the state court to which deference is thus shown prejudices any federal rights of the parties, this can be redressed by review of the state decision in the United States Supreme Court. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-26\">For a fuller exposition of Professor Wright\u2019s views, see Wright, The Abstention Doctrine Reconsidered, 37 Tex.L.

While not raising any constitutional issues in his complaint, and expressly disavowing any Civil Rights Act claim, appellant has intimated in his brief that the conduct of the Board of Managers in the \u201cmanagement\u201d of the trust fund may constitute a deprivation of Ms property rights and that of Ms fellow prisoners and that the statutes establishing the trust fund are unconstitutional. If appellant prosecutes his claim in the state courts and raises a federal question at some stage of the proceedings, he would, of course, have a right to seek review of an adverse decision in the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b317-15\">. In Note, Federal Courts\u2019 Disposition of Unsettled Questions of State Law, 48 Col.L.Rev. 575, 586-587 (1948), it is pointed out, quite perceptively, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-16\">* * * [I]n the diversity cases, where no federal question is involved, the practical effect of the two techniques [i.e., stay or dismissal] would be indistinguishable since the state determination of the state questions would be conclusive of the controversy.

See Giorgi v. Pa. Labor Relations Board, 293 F.Supp. 873 (E.D.Pa. 1968), where abstention was applied, in reliance on the <em>Burford </em>and <em>Alabama Public Service Commission </em>decisions, in a case involving the unsettled question of whether employees of mushroom producers were covered by the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b319-18\">. It is not certain, <em>e. g., </em>whether the comprehensive guidelines for the conduct of trustees of nontestamentary trusts set out in Donaldson v. Borough of Madison, 88 N.J.Super. 574, 213 A.2d 33 (1965), which appellant has cited, are applicable to the Board of Managers of the New Jersey State Prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b319-20\">. In Harris v. Yeager, 291 F.Supp. 1015 (D.N.J.1968), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>410 F.2d 1376 (3d Cir. 1969), in which the district court dismissed a civil rights action challenging the compulsory withholding of part of a prisoner\u2019s wages for deposit in a savings account, a practice which as previously noted has been discontinued, the court treated the payment of wages for work performed by prisoners as a wholly discretionary and gratuitous act by the State of New Jersey which gave no vested rights to prison inmates. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the district court opinion, Judge Cohen said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">The moneys under consideration are not wages in a realistic economic employer-employee relationship. They are, rather, a gratuitous payment authorized by the State of New Jersey and made by virtue of an administrative policy prompted and advanced in the best interests of penology and sociology. The plaintiff has no inherent legal right to the payment of this gratuity, nor to determine its form or amount. The State Board [of Control of Institutions and Agencies] has been given full power and authority, in the area of internal prison management, to engage healthy and capable inmates in productive occupations and to provide, in its best judgment, compensation therefor, be it cash or remission of time from sentence, or both. In the exercise of this statutory choice, the Board may establish a policy determining how, when, and if cash be selected, the amount, time and method of payment. The Board may, in its discretion and in the best interest of inmates, reasonably impose an enforced savings of a comparatively nominal amount to await the inmate\u2019s release or discharge from the institution. 291 F.Supp. at 1017-1018 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Perhaps we could likewise decide that the operation and management of the inmates \u201ctrust fund\u201d is wholly discretionary and gratuitous on the part of the State of New Jersey and therefore appellant has no right to challenge the way in which the trust fund is administered. Because of the apparent statutory basis for the establishment of the \u201ctrust fund\u201d and because of the early recognition by the State Attorney General that the fund does partake of the nature of a trust, note 3, <em>supra, </em>we believe this may be a problem different from the payment of compensation for prison work, and we prefer to leave to the New Jersey courts the ultimate determination of the trust issues presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">It should be made clear that we are not predicating our dismissal of this suit on the generally-accepted principle of lack of jurisdiction by the federal courts over the administration of testamentary trusts and decedents\u2019 estates. For a good discussion of the scope and limitations of this principle, see the opinion of Judge Davis in Martz v. Braun, 266 F.Supp. 134 (E.D.Pa.1967). <em>See also </em>Vestal and Foster, Implied Limitations on the Diversity Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 44 Minn.L.Rev. 1, 13, 36 (1956), in which the authors indicate that the federal courts have not been reluctant to deal with cases involving charitable trusts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b320-12\">.
