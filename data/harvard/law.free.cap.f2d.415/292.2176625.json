Both were convicted on a count charging that they conspired to receive and pass counterfeit federal reserve notes in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 472, 473 (1964), and each was convicted on two counts charging substantive violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">On this appeal, Metz raises two points of error. First, he contends that he was denied an adequate opportunity prior to trial, to inspect certain fingerprint and handwriting exhibits which were in the possession of the Government. In a pre-trial order, the district court directed that such exhibits be made available to Metz. Although the exhibits were not made available to Metz\u2019s satisfaction, the trial court found no violation of its order. \u2022 We are not convinced that the court abused its discretion in the handling of this discovery matter. <em>See </em>Gevinson v. United States, 358 F.2d 761, 766 (5th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">Appellant Metz also contends that the court erred in denying his motion for a separate trial. It is settled law that the grant or denial of a motion for severance is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed unless there is a positive showing of abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice to the movant. Blachly v. United States, 380 F.2d 665, 674-675 (5th Cir.1967). It does not appear from the record that Metz was prejudiced by the joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">Appellant White contends that he was denied his sixth amendment right of confrontation by the introduction of an extrajudicial confession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>codefendant Metz. The oral confession of Metz was offered into evidence through the testimony of a Secret Service agent. Nowhere in the agent\u2019s recital of the confession was there any reference to appellant White. The trial court instructed the jury that the witness was called to testify against Metz only and that his testimony should not be considered in determining the guilt or innocence of any other defendant. In the circumstances of the case, the possibility that appellant White was prejudiced by the introduction of Metz\u2019s confession is extremely remote. This case is unlike Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), in which the jury was told that a codefen-dant had confessed, naming the defendant Bruton as an accomplice. Since Metz\u2019s confession did not implicate or inculpate White, it follows that White was not denied his right of confrontation. United States v. Lipowitz, 407 F.2d 597, 601-603 (3d Cir.1969); Wapnick v. United States, 406 F.2d 741, 742 (2d Cir.1969); United States v. Levinson, 405 F.2d 971, 987-988 (6th Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"> A final contention urged by appellant White must also fail. Following the cross-examination of a government witness, White\u2019s counsel requested that the grand jury testimony of the witness be made available to him. Counsel did not articulate any particular need for the testimony and the trial court denied his request. Appellant White\u2019s contention that the denial was reversible error is meritless since it appears well established that a defendant is entitled to examine the grand jury testimony of a trial witness only upon the showing of \u201ca particularized need\u201d for the examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. United States, 360 U.S. 395, 400, 79 S.Ct. 1237, 3 L.Ed.2d 1323 (1959); Stassi v. United States, 401 F.2d 259, 265 (5th Cir.1968); <em>see </em>Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Having examined all the contentions raised by the appellants, we conclude that the judgments of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">. Appellant White\u2019s request was made without allegation or showing that the matter sought was material to preparation of his defense and, therefore, was not within Rule 16(b), Fed.R.Cr.P. Cf. United States v. Hughes, 5th Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 1244.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
