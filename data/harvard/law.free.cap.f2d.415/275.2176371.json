The New York Court of Appeals reversed those convictions. People v. Lane, 10 N.Y.2d 347, 223 N.Y.S.2d 197, 179 N.E.2d 339 (1961). Appellant and one of his codefendants, John Henry Williams, were then retried before a jury in County Court, Orange County, and were again convicted of murder in the first degree. They appealed to the Appellate Division claiming that their confessions which had been introduced against them were involuntary. The Appellate Division directed that a hearing be held pursuant to People v. Huntley, 15 N.Y.2d 72, 255 N.Y.S.2d 838, 204 N.E.2d 179 (1965), to determine the voluntariness of the confessions. People v. Sloan, 23 A.D.2d 892, 260 N.Y.S.2d 248 (1965). The confessions were found to have been voluntary and the Appellate Division affirmed the convictions. People v. Sloan, 26 A.D.2d 656, 272 N.Y.S.2d 970 (1966). The New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Appellant then wrote a letter to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York which that court treated as an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The court rejected appellant\u2019s claim that his confessions had been coerced and denied the writ. This appeal was taken from the order of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Appellant\u2019s contention before this court is that he was denied his sixth amendment right to confrontation by reason of the admission into evidence at their joint trial of his non-testifying codefendant\u2019s confessions implicating him. Appellant relies upon Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), which was made retroactive in Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968). He argues that he exhausted his state remedies by raising the confrontation claim in the state courts before <em>Bruton </em>was decided. On the authority of United States ex rel. Smith v. Follette, 405 F.2d 1199 (2d Cir. 1969), we affirm the denial of his petition for habeas corpus, without reaching the merits, in order to afford the New York courts an opportunity to adjudicate appellant\u2019s <em>Bruton </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\"><em>Smith </em>involved a claim under <em>Bruton </em>that had not been raised in the New York courts. We noted there that in People v. Pohl, 23 N.Y.2d 290, 296 N.Y.S.2d 352, 244 N.E.2d 47 (1968), the New York Court of Appeals established a procedure for hearing <em>Bruton </em>claims. We held that since New York courts would entertain those claims they should be given an opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\"><em>Smith </em>is not properly distinguishable by the fact that there the confrontation claim had not been raised in the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>courts whereas here the claim was raised before <em>Bruton </em>was decided. That the purpose of the decision in <em>Smith </em>was to permit the state courts to consider the claim under the law as established by intervening federal precedent is established by the reliance in <em>Smith </em>on United States ex rel. Martin v. McMann, 348 F.2d 896 (2d Cir. 1965) <em>(en banc) </em>per curiam). 405 F.2d at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 194, 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967), is not helpful to appellant. As we said in <em>Smith:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cThe issue there [i.e., in Roberts] was whether a petitioner who had once exhausted his state remedies should be required to relitigate his claim in the state courts because a subsequent change in the state law made the granting of relief by the state appear more likely.\u201d 405 F.2d at 1201.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Here there was no subsequent change in the state law and the state courts have had no opportunity to consider appellant\u2019s claims under the new standard as set by the Supreme Court. Moreover, unlike the issue in <em>Roberts, </em>the issue here is not \u201cPredetermined by established federal principles.\u201d 389 U.S. at 43, 88 S.Ct. at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The fact that the outcome in the state courts is not predetermined also serves to distinguish United States ex rel. LaBelle v. Mancusi, 404 F.2d 690 (2d Cir. 1968). There this court reversed the conviction but stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cWe emphasize that were there any matters for resolution which might lead to a result other than reversal we would follow the procedure of requiring the district court to defer action until a reasonable time had been allowed for the state courts to further hear and determine the remaining issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Here the statements by his codefendant Williams were similar to those made by appellant. Thus it is by no means clear that appellant was prejudiced by the introduction of Williams\u2019 statements. See United States ex rel. Catanzaro v. Man-cusi, 404 F.2d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1968) where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cThe reasoning of <em>Hill </em>and <em>Bruton </em>is not persuasive here. Both of those cases involved a defendant who did not confess and who was tried along with a codefendant who did. In our case Catanzaro himself confessed and his confession interlocks with and supports the confession of McChesney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">Where the jury has heard not only a codefendant\u2019s confession but the defendant\u2019s own confession no such \u2018devastating\u2019 risk attends the lack of confrontation as was thought to be involved in <em>Bruton. </em>See 391 U.S. at 136, 88 S.Ct. 1620.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
