McFadden has refused induction and presumptively is awaiting indictment. Bowen and McFadden assert that their Roman Catholic faith requires them to decline military service if their \u201cindividual consciences dictate that their country is now engaged in an unjust war.\u201d This, they say, is the doctrine of their church.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-23\">McFadden and Bowen have been joined by twelve individual Catholic priests in attacking selective service statutory provisions. The priests say the doctrine upon which Bowen and McFadden will apparently rest any criminal defense is what, as priests, they counsel and advise their young parishioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-24\">So it was contended, in this civil action for a declaratory judgment and for an injunction which would prevent prosecution of the civil plaintiffs. A three-judge district court was demanded because they were asserting constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>tional issues. All relief was denied by the district court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">It would seem intolerable to permit Bowen to run civil proceedings for declaratory judgment parallel to his criminal charge when he is on the eve of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Declaratory judgments in the federal system are often discretionary. In our view, discretion could not be properly exercised now in favor of Bowen. Thus, we affirm the dismissal as to Bowen. If Rule 54(b), F.R.Civ.P., is applicable here, we find there is no reason for delay. Our judgment as to Bowen shall be applicable now and the mandate as to him shall issue now. Accordingly, it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">The case as to all other appellants is withdrawn from submission, to be resubmitted on order of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
