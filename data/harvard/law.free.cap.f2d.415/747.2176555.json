Two judgments were entered in favor of appellees Munitions Carriers Conference, Inc., and several other motor carriers, enjoining appellants American Farm Lines, and two of its employees, from continuing certain carrier operations. The other judgment was entered in favor of the appel-lee Interstate Commerce Commission which intervened in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">Munitions Carriers is an association of motor carriers licensed to transport Classes A and B explosives under authority granted by the Interstate Commerce Commission, an agency of the United States Government. The other appellees herein are motor carriers engaged in the same occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">American Farm Lines is a cooperative marketing association incorporated under the laws of the State of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">At the time of the initial action American Farm Lines was engaged in hauling government freight and Classes A and B explosives on government bills of lading in interstate commerce. American Farm Lines is authorized to transport farm to market and market to farm products for the use and benefit of it agrarian members.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">The initial action was filed on December 8, 1967, and the resulting judgment permanently enjoined American Farm Lines, its General Manager, Howard McCormack, and its government division director, E. E. Strohfield, from transporting in interstate or foreign commerce as motor carriers over and upon the public highways for compensation, the following commodities: (1) Classes A or B explosives on government bills of lading in roundtrip (back-to-back) movements ; (2) Classes A or B explosives on government bills of lading in connection with the transportation of other freight shipped on government bills of lading in roundtrip (back-to-back) movements; (3) freight shipped on government bills of lading in roundtrip (back-to-back) movements. The judgment proscribed these operations until such time as authorized by the I.C.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">Approximately three months later the court granted the I.C.C.\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the same case and permanently enjoined appellants from transporting explosives for the government in connection with the movement of non-exempt, non-member traffic in the reverse direction in interstate or foreign commerce for compensation unless authorized to do so by the I.C.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">Thereafter, on April 16, 1968, the plaintiffs (appellees herein) and three additional motor carriers filed the succeeding action against the defendants (appellants herein). The I.C.C. again intervened. This action terminated in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>summary judgment filed May 28, 1968, which enjoined American Farm Lines and their named employees from the for-hire transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of any products other than those products mentioned in 12 U. S.C. \u00a7 1141j except when proceeding outbound to pick up and transport market to farm products or in returning from farm to market delivery with an otherwise empty vehicle. As in the preceding judgments this proscription was conditioned upon subsequent authorization of the enjoined transportation by the I.C.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">On January 24, 1968, prior to the challenged judgments, the I.C.C. filed notice of institution of administrative proceedings in relation to American Farm Lines and its identified employees. The notice purported to exclude from consideration, in the administrative hearings, the issues then before the trial court. I.C.C. briefs filed herein also proclaim this intent. The contemporaneous construction placed by the Commission upon the provisions of the I.C.C. Act are entitled to great weight and respect and will not be overturned unless they are arbitrary or plainly erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Appellants challenge the jurisdiction of the court on the grounds that the acts complained of were not a clear and patent violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Jurisdiction in both actions is based upon 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 322(b) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This statute gives the court jurisdiction over \u201cclear and patent\u201d violations of certain sections of the Interstate Commerce Act requiring certification or licensing of motor carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b) (5) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is the provision in the I.C.C. code which excludes from regulation motor vehicles controlled and operated by cooperative associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">The provisions applicable at the time of trial and the 1968 amendment to \u00a7 303(b) (5) each limit the application of the exemption to \u201ca federation [possessing] no greater powers or purposes than cooperative associations so defined, * \u00ab * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">The definition of cooperative association is found in the Agricultural Marketing Act of June 15, 1929. The definition, now contained in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141j (a), establishes that a cooperative association must be an association (1) \u201cin which farmers act together in processing, preparing for market, handling, and/or marketing the farm products of persons so engaged * * (2) \u201cThat [is] operated for the mutual benefit of the members thereof as such producers or purchasers * * *.\u201d and (3) \u201c[that] conform[s] to one or both of the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-19\">First: That no member * * * is allowed more than one vote * * * Second: That the association does not pay dividends * * * in excess of 8 per centum per annum. And in any case to the following: Third. That the association shall\u2019not deal in farm products, farm supplies, and farm busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>ness services with or for nonmembers in an amount greater in value than the total amount of such business transacted by it with or for members. All business transacted by any cooperative association for or on behalf of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof shall be disregarded in determining the volume of member and nonmember business transacted by such association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Appellants rely heavily on the last sentence of the third requirement above set out and contend that this provision exempts them under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b) (5) as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The \u201cincidental and necessary\u201d test recently adopted by this court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> teaches \u201cthat the transportation activities of a cooperative must be incidental to its primary statutory activity and necessary to the effective performance of that activity.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The primary statutory activity of producing and purchasing of farm products is set out in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141j (a) above quoted. Section 1141j(a) also provides that cooperative associations must be operated for the mutual benefit of the members as such producers or purchasers. In addition, such associations must conform to the three requirements set out in \u00a7 1141j(a) including the requirement containing the provision relied upon by appellants. These three requirements are not the primary statutory activities but are limitations. Therefore the incidental and necessary test as applied directs itself to an examination and conclusion of whether or not the exclusive carrying of explosives or other government property for the government is incidental and necessary to the defined activities of the cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The order of the trial court permits the transportation of government property for either an outbound or an inbound trip of a carrier when its farm to market or market to farm produce is carried on the other half of the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">We recognize the economic advantage to the appellant\u2019s transportation business by permitting the exclusive transportation of government property in both directions. However, we cannot find it described in the primary activities described in the provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">Justification for the favored position of farm marketing cooperatives is based upon the necessity of making the cooperative efforts of the agrarian community competitive in the market place.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, we have said, \u201cback-to-back hauling of general commodities for nonmembers throughout the United States by motor vehicles on a for-hire basis * * * [is] not incidental to the [business of the cooperative.]\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Transportation of government commodities not incidental to the agrarian well-being cannot be said to be a primary activity of the cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">We conclude, from a review of the record of the first proceeding, that no genuine issue as to any material fact existed. Accordingly, the I.C.C. was entitled to a summary judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">The transportation proscribed by the trial court was not exempted under \u00a7 303(b) (5), therefore, the clear and patent violation of \u00a7 322(b) (2) is made evident by the above recited conclusion of this court. The trial court\u2019s conclusion of initial jurisdiction is therefore affirmed and its judgment and findings are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">. I. C. C. v.
