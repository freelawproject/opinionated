The Board\u2019s Decision and Order are reported at 164 NLRB No. 10.(1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-15\">Respondent, a manufacturer of work clothing and casual wear, operates a warehouse in Columbus, Ohio. In mid-July, 1966, the union commenced a drive to organize the employees at this warehouse. The union\u2019s efforts were successful and five of the six warehouse employees signed authorization cards designating it their collective bargaining representative.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, on July 21, the union sent a telegram to respondent apprising it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-16\">\u201c * * * that Drivers and Ware-housemen\u2019s Union Local 3027 AFL-CIO represents an over whelming (sic) majority of your employees. Demand is here with (sic) made to negotiate working agreement between the parties. Awaite (sic) your prompt reply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-18\">After receiving this request for recognition, the company embarked on an anti-union campaign which, according to the findings of the Board, consisted of various unfair labor practices designed to dissipate the union\u2019s support. Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>cifically, the Board found that respondent violated Section 8(a) (1), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1): (a) by threatening to close the Columbus warehouse rather than recognize the union; (b) by interrogating employees about their union sympathies; (c) by telling employees they would jeopardize their jobs if they joined the union; and (d) by promising and withholding wage increases. The Board also found that respondent violated Section 8(a) (3), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (a) (3), when it discharged three employees because of their union activity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, the Board determined that respondent violated Section 8(a) (5), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (5), by refusing to recognize the union despite its majority status<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and by unilaterally granting wage increases while the union was the employees\u2019 bargaining representative.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">A review of the record as a whole convinces us that there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings with respect to the violations of Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3). However, the Board\u2019s determination that the company violated Section 8(a) (5) by unlawfully refusing to bargain with the union was made prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co., Inc. et al., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), and was based on a finding that the refusal was not motivated by a good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">In <em>Gissel Packing </em>the Supreme Court concluded that an employer\u2019s subjective motivation in rejecting a request for recognition is \"largely irrelevant.\u201d The important inquiry in determining the legality of the refusal to bargain is whether the employer also committed serious unfair labor practices which tend \u201cto undermine majority strength and impede the election processes.\u201d 395 U.S. at 597, 89 S.Ct., at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-13\">Although it may be implicit in the Board\u2019s decision that the unfair labor practices engaged in here are sufficiently serious to support the finding of an unlawful refusal to bargain, the Board made no express finding concerning the effect of these unfair labor practices. In particular, the Board did not find that the \u201cpossibility of erasing the effects [of the violations] and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co., Inc. et al., 395 U.S., at 597, 89 S.Ct., at 1940. Under these circumstances we remand this ease to the Board for reconsideration and further findings in light of <em>Gissel Packing.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-14\">Of course, whether respondent\u2019s unilateral wage increase violated Section 8(a) (5) depends on whether respondent was obligated to bargain with the union at the time it was granted. N.L.R.B. v. Downtown Bakery Corp., 330 F.2d 921, 927 (6th Cir. 1964). Accordingly, this issue cannot be decided until the Board determines whether respondent\u2019s refusal to bargain violated Section 8(a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-15\">The Board\u2019s order is enforced with respect to the violations of Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3). The cause is remanded for further findings with respect to the violations of Section 8(a) (5).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1196-19\">. The sixth warehouseman signed an authorization card two days after the union\u2019s demand for recognition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">. These discharges occurred on July 28, 1966. The <em>next </em>day respondeat offered immediate reinstatement to all three employees and they returned to work on August 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">. The company rejected the union\u2019s demand for recognition by a telegram dated July 25 in which it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-11\">\u201cRe your telegram. Suggest you proceed through Labor Relations Board for determination of whether you represent our employees. Several years ago a union claimed representation and Board election proved otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1197-16\">. The wage increases, granted between July 28 and August 3, implemented the earlier promises of such increases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1197-17\">. This is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s action in Thrift Drug Co. v. N.L.R.B., 395 U.S. 828, 89 S.Ct. 2125, 23 L.Ed.2d 737 (1969), and Lou DeYoung\u2019s Market Basket, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 395 U.S. 828, 89 S.Ct. 2125, 23 L.Ed.2d 737 (1969), both of which were remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Gissel Packing.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
