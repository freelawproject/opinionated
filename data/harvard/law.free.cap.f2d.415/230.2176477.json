In his pretrial motions, filed after a plea of not guilty and before entering a guilty plea, Black did make a general objection to the admission against him of \u201cany evidence based on any purported admissions or confessions by him\u201d on the ground that the same were not voluntarily given. However, at the hearing on these motions this specific one was not argued, and it was not raised again before the trial court thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Even if there were sufficient evidence of the existence of some confession which had- been made by Black, we would be compelled to hold that Black could not justifiably claim that it was involuntarily given, in light of the searching inquiry made by the trial judge pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to ascertain the voluntariness of the guilty plea, and in light of the admonitions given to Black which were, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-24\">\u201cIf you have any contention that any statement given by you to the FBI, the Secret Service, the postal inspectors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>any city, county or state police officer or anyone in authority was not given freely and voluntarily by you, without the use of violence or threats or promises or hope of any reward from you, then you have the obligation to give him [defense counsel] all of that information and, if such is the case, you should not, in all probability, enter a plea of guilty because in all probability that evidence could not be introduced against you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-29\">Following these admonitions, the judge offered Black the unqualified opportunity to take a recess to discuss any such matters further with his counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
