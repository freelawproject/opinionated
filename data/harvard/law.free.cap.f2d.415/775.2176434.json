The district judge allowed him to file and proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, but granted a motion to dismiss on the ground that the action was frivolous and dismissal was required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d)..</p>\n<p id=\"b837-25\">Because of violation of prison regulations, certain law books and materials were taken from appellant\u2019s possession in his cell. The record shows that \u201cpaper, both legal and regular size\u201d was confiscated, and other books and materials placed in storage but apparently still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>accessible to appellant for use in the prison library. The prison regulations concerning law books was upheld in Hatfield v. Bailleaux (9 Cir. 1961), 290 F.2d 632, cert. denied 368 U.S. 862, 82 S.Ct. 105, 7 L.Ed.2d 59 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The denial of an injunction against further acts of the appellees rested in the sound discretion of the district judge. There is no suggestion that the confiscated \u201clegal and regular size\u201d paper did not, and does not, remain available for appellant\u2019s use under reasonable regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">There was not alleged nor shown any denial of access to the courts, and the extensive briefs filed by appellant in this proceeding, and the voluminous citations contained therein demonstrate no such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The trial court properly dismissed the action as frivolous. Williams v. Field (9 Cir. 1968), 394 F.2d 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
