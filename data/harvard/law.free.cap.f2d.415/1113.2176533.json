We granted leave and requested the Government to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">The only point raised which merits discussion is that, in light of Chimel v. California, decided June 23, 1969, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), the address books containing Jessup\u2019s telephone numbers and the business card of Austin Burke found in various parts of Thomas\u2019 bedroom after his arrest and the letter found in Joyce Hoffman\u2019s pocketbook in the bedroom closet, see 409 F.2d at 895-897, should not have been received in evidence. It may be, as the Government suggests, that the warrantless search for and seizure of some or even all of these items would have been allowable under <em>Chimel. </em>However, we are not required either to decide on the Government\u2019s contention, which might necessitate further development of the facts, or to consider the possible application of the doctrine of harmless error as most recently explicated in Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). For, despite the Court\u2019s reluctance to decide the issue last spring, see Van Cleef v. New Jersey, 395 U.S. 814, 89 S.Ct. 2051, 23 L.Ed.2d 728 (1969), and Shipley v. California, 395 U.S. 818, 89 S.Ct. 2053, 23 L.Ed.2d 732 (1969), we'do not regard <em>Chimel </em>as applicable to searches (other than that in <em>Chimel </em>itself) prior to June 23, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-15\">In Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), the Court explained that in determining how far a newly announced constitutional rule of criminal procedure would be made prospective only, attention should be given to \u201c(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of retroactive application of the new standards.\u201d All three considerations point to making <em>Chimel </em>prospective in the full sense of <em>Stovall </em>and Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969), namely, \u201conly to the petitioner involved in the case in which the new rule is announced and to all future cases in which the proscribed official conduct has not yet occurred.\u201d Desist v. United States, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 257, 89 S.Ct. at 1038 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan). See United States v. Hutto, 393 F.2d 783, 784 &amp; n. 3 (4 Cir. 1968). The purpose to be served by <em>Chimel </em>is deterrent; law enforcement officers had justifiably relied upon Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399 (1947), and United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950) ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the effect of retroactive application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>of <em>Chimel </em>on the administration of justice would thus be substantial even if this were limited to cases where the judgment had not become final. In contrast there is little to be said in favor of retroactivity under the standards the Court has announced. As pointed out in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 638, 639, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1742, 1743, 14 L.Ed. 2d 601 (1965), \u201cthere is no likelihood of unreliability or coercion present in a search-and-seizure case\u201d; the exclusionary rule is but a \u201cprocedural weapon that has no bearing on guilt\u201d; and \u201cthe fairness of the trial is not under attack.\u201d See Desist v. United States, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 250-252, 89 S.Ct. 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">The petitions for rehearing are denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1176-13\">. Although the <em>Chimel </em>opinion notes that the Court\u2019s decisions on the permissible scope of a warrantless search \u201chave been far from consistent,\u201d 395 U.S. at 755, 89 S.Ct. 2034, the Court recognized that <em>Harris </em>and <em>Rabinowitz </em>were generally accepted as setting out the applicable standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1177-14\">.
