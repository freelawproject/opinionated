He denied an application for adjustment of status under Sec. 245 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. He also denied an application for voluntary departure by petitioner, relying on Sec. 244(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(e) and Sec. 101 (f) (2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f) (2), on the ground that the requirements of good moral character for eligibility had not been met in that petitioner had committed adultery within five years prior to the application for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-15\">As to the first decision, we affirm the Board. The burden was on the petitioner to establish that his application for adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident was meritorious. On the record which contained numerous facts not set forth herein, the Special Inquiry Officer found lack of merit and the Board affirmed. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-16\">As to the denial of the application for voluntary departure, we reach a different result. The Special Inquiry Officer stated that because of the adultery, he was \u201crequired\u201d to find petitioner was not a person of good moral character; that petitioner was \u201cnot eligible\u201d for voluntary departure and that an order for departure \u201cwill have to be entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-17\">The Board in dismissing the appeal took the same approach, stating \u201c* * * respondent\u2019s conduct with a woman not his spouse <em>compels </em>us to affirm the decision of the Special Inquiry Officer * * respondent is clearly <em>precluded </em>from showing he is a person of good moral character.\u201d [Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-18\">In Wadman v. Immigration and Naturalization Service (9 Cir. 1964) 329 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>F.2d 812, this court considered the effects of adultery on an application for voluntary departure and whether adultery became a bar as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">The Special Inquiry Officer, and the Board in dismissing the appeal did not exercise their discretionary function in deciding the issue as to voluntary departure. They apparently believed their decision was compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">The case as to the issue of voluntary departure is remanded to the Board for further consideration in the light of <em>Wadman, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">Affirmed in part, remanded in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
