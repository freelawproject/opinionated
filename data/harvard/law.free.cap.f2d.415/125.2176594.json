Pleasant store (petitioner operated three grocery stores in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) and not staying in business if union got in the store; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>petitioner at his Greensburg store employees meeting saying that he would \u201c* * * like to know who those people are that did that to me\u201d which the Board held \u201cimplied that employees whose participation in union activities became known might be made to suffer harmful consequences as a result thereof\u201d (in violation of Section 8(a) (1)). The Board also directly held that the above found course of conduct by petitioner \u201cevinces a rejection of the collective bargaining principle.\u201d The Board, therefore, concluded that petitioner\u2019s refusal to recognize and bargain with the union was not motivated by good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority, and was violative of Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act. Petitioner, asserting that the Board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence, asks that it be set aside and enforcement thereof denied. The Board has a cross-application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Petitioner\u2019s first point is that he was denied due process of law. This is based upon the allegation in the Board\u2019s complaint that petitioner by his attorneys had \u201csuggested to employees that they withdraw their union authorization cards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The record shows that petitioner\u2019s charge of denial of due process is groundless. The Board, on the basis of testimony it credited, did hold that petitioner through his lawyers had not violated the Act by their questioning of employees. Nevertheless there was some evidence of' the attorneys suggesting that employees withdraw their authorization cards. There was also inferential proof, pointing to that practice by petitioner directly and on his behalf. There was nothing in the complaint or Board action which in any way prevented petitioner\u2019s attorneys from legitimately representing petitioner in his defense to the Board\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Petitioner admits that he refused to bargain with the union. He asserts that he was entitled to refuse to bargain on the theory that he \u201chad a good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority status.\u201d He states categorically in his brief that his doubt was based upon the following factors: He immediately expressed his doubt to the union and filed a representation petition. He says his response to the union\u2019s demand for recognition was a denial of the union\u2019s majority status. When the union organizer demanded of him that he recognize the union he alleges that \u201che told him (the organizer) that I didn\u2019t think he represented a majority of my people.\u201d He makes the blanket declaration that \u201cHe had knowledge of threats, bribes and intimidation of his employees by the union in its attempt to obtain signed authorization cards.\u201d He claims previous attempts to organize his employees had failed. He said that he believed that the union did not represent a majority of all his employees as the union had warranted to him. He further states that he was not aware that a majority of his employees had signed authorization cards. He specifically says he was informed that his employees did not want a union. He concludes his reasons for what he calls \u201cgood faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority status\u201d by the pronouncement that \u201cHe knew that authorization cards are an unreliable indication of union support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Petitioner\u2019s above noted last statement of why he contends he \u201chad a good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority status\u201d is very clear and was never changed in the slightest degree. Forty-nine employees signed authorization cards to the union as bargaining representative of the employees of petitioner\u2019s three stores. The employee bargaining unit as found by the Board consisted of eighty-three employees. Those who had signed the cards constituted a heavy majority of all the employees. At least twelve employees testified at the hearing in support of the complaint. Other employees attended the hearing. None of the authorizations was repudiated. The petitioner\u2019s evidence consisted of his own, his assistant, his managers, an assistant manager and three of his lawyers. Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>a single union eligible was a witness supporting the petitioner\u2019s views.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Petitioner\u2019s theory as expressed in his brief is that even assuming \u201carguendo that the union possessed authorization cards from a majority of the employer\u2019s employees at the time of the demand and assuming further that this demand was clear and unequivocal, an employer cannot be found guilty of refusing to recognize the union if the employer has a good faith doubt about the union\u2019s majority status.\u201d With this in mind let us examine petitioner\u2019s other reasons for his alleged \u201cgood faith doubt\u201d. The union organizer presented petitioner with copies of forty-nine authorization cards<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and advised him that the union represented the majority of his employees and therefore requested recognition by him as bargaining representative of said employees. Petitioner' refused to take the cards and flatly denied the union\u2019s majority status. As above mentioned he, without qualification, said this was his response to the demand for recognition. Refusing to even look at the cards in front of him (or later when they were mailed to him) he told the organizer \u201cthat I didn\u2019t think he represented the majority of my people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Petitioner, next in his brief, sets out that \u201cHe had knowledge of threats, bribes and intimidation of his employees by the union in its attempt to obtain signed authorization cards.\u201d There is no authentication of this by any of the employees who authorized the union to be their representative nor is there employee evidence in any respect corroborating petitioner\u2019s deliberate accusation. The one mention at the hearing on that issue is petitioner\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Asked why he told the union official he doubted the union majority he answered, \u201cI told him because I was told or heard that my people were intimidated to sign a card and they were being coerced in doing so.\u201d He said \u201cOne of the ladies came to me and said she had been contacted and they wanted her to sign up and join a union and she said she wanted nothing to do with it. Another lady was telling me that they came to her and she closed the door and didn\u2019t even let them in the house * * Asked by his lawyer \u201cYou mentioned previously about having information concerning intimidation and bribery. Could you explain this more clearly?\u201d The witness answered \u201cYes. * * * Mrs. Helen Buczek told me herself that she was bribed, that she was pestered four or five times<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and another lady * * * I have the lady in the bakery that she told me that she was annoyed and threatened along the streets to sign a card and she was walking between the store and her home.\u201d His lawyer asked him \u201cWhat employee, if any, told you that they were bribed to sign a card?\u201d Witness, \u201cI had an employee tell me that they were offered 60 cents an hour if they would sign a card.\u201d The Examiner inquired \u201cIs it someone who has 'a card?\u201d The attorney answered \u201cI will have to ask the witness.\u201d The latter said \u201cI could name the individual who told me, yes. It was told to me by people in the Meat Department. Jim Gyurke was talking about it and he said that the boys were told that they were \u2014.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Examiner noted the hearsay element and asked the attorney to \u201cpresent the case properly.\u201d The lawyer answered \u201cAll right\u201d and put the following question to the petitioner, \u201cMr. Krystyniak, did you receive any information that concerned what success these organizers were having with your people?\u201d Answer, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d Q. \u201cWhat type of information?\u201d A. \u201cThat the people were being contacted and they wanted nothing to do with it.\u201d Q. \u201cWere there any other reasons to substantiate your doubt as to the union\u2019s claims?\u201d A. \u201cYes: I have had experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ence with unions trying to organize my people before. * * * They have had a difficult time getting even 30 per cent, which is necessary to file a petition.\u201d Asked \u201cDid this particular union fail in the past at your place?\u201d A. \u201cYes. My older employees have been with me for a long time and they have rejected it before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The only other testimony as to petitioner\u2019s doubt of a majority was \u201cSubsequent to the 31st (January 1967), I was told by a couple of employees that they thought that when they signed this card, that they didn\u2019t realize that they were giving away their right to vote and they really thought that this was a change to express how * * The Examiner struck this testimony as \u201cnot the type of evidence which either the Board or the Court has said will affect the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">There is no further evidence from petitioner or other witness in connection with petitioner\u2019s accusation of threats, bribes and intimidation of his employees. The above referred to testimony also covers all the evidence given on petitioner\u2019s behalf respecting petitioner\u2019s remaining named reasons for what he describes as his \u201cgood faith doubt\u201d of the union majority, i.e. that previous attempts to organize his employees had failed; that he was not aware that a majority of his employees had signed authorization cards and that he was informed that his employees did not want a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">It is of the utmost significance that throughout petitioner\u2019s grossly tendentious eighty-three pages of testimony he does not ever really challenge his own assumption \u201carguendo that the union possessed authorization cards from a majority of the employer\u2019s employees at the time of the demand and assuming further that this demand was clear and unequivocal * * In the same category is the major fact that not one of the accredited eighty-three employees, including those who did not sign authorization cards, or indeed, any of the other assorted petitioner witnesses (assistant to petitioner, managers, assistant manager and three of petitioner\u2019s lawyers) give any support whatsoever to those grounds advanced by petitioner for his \u201cgood faith doubt\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Petitioner\u2019s basic proposition here is <em>\u201cHe knew that authorization cards are an unreliable indication of union support.\u201d </em>He is totally wrong in that far-reaching, far-fetched edict which is typical of the defense offered. The acceptance of authorization cards and other means than a Board election to invoke a bargaining obligation has been in existence at least since 1940. N.L.R.B. v. Bradford Dyeing Ass\u2019n, 310 U.S. 318, 339-340, 60 S.Ct. 918, 84 L.Ed. 122 (1940); Franks Bros. Co. v. N. L. R. B., 321 U.S. 702, 64 S.Ct. 817, 88 L.Ed. 1020 (1943); United Mine Workers v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., 351 U.S. 62, 76 S.Ct. 559, 100 L.Ed. 941 (1956). In the recent Supreme Court decision in N. L. R. B. v. Gissel, Packing Co., Inc., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (June 16, 1969) it had been decided below that authorization cards are such inherently unreliable indicators of employee desires that they may never be used to determine a union\u2019s majority and to support an order to bargain. The Court, 89 S.Ct. p. 1934, in reversing that holding ruled \u201cThat the cards, though admittedly inferior to the election process, can adequately reflect employee sentiment when that process has been impeded, needs no extended discussion, for the employer\u2019s contentions cannot withstand close examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">The Board\u2019s proofs at the hearing revealed <em>most </em>substantial evidence that the bargaining process had been impeded. Union officials Novotny and Richey testified that they had advised petitioner that the union had a majority of employees authorization cards; had offered him personally and later by mail complete copies of same; that petitioner had refused to look at them or accept those mailed. It is not denied that No-votny and Richey cautioned petitioner not to threaten or coerce his employees in their right to organize. Petitioner himself said that as soon as the organiz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>er walked out he told his attorney to file a representation petition, this without examining the cards or otherwise checking the formal notification that the majority of his employees had authorized the union to act as their bargaining representative. Union organizer Lutty was successful in seeing petitioner on January 31, 1967. He asked petitioner to recognize the union as the employees representative. Petitioner\u2019s attorney who was with petitioner said the latter would not recognize the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">At least eleven employees were called as witnesses by the Board. The first of these, Josephine Sarafine, told of a meeting of mostly all the employees of petitioner\u2019s Mt. Pleasant store with petitioner and his assistant Craig. She testified that petitioner told the employees that \u201cif the union got in he don\u2019t know how long he would be able to go along according to the union.\u201d He didn\u2019t know \u201chow long he could keep his doors open. It may only last six months\u201d and then he said \u201cWhere would your job security be then? * * * that the union representatives would be making $700 a month on dues that we would have to pay and they would spend their time in a place like the Romer Room [a tavern].\u201d Petitioner told his employees that the executives had a meeting in December \u201cto figure out a way on how to get us raises.\u201d He said he was paying minimum wages when he only had to pay 85% of that. He was asked about employee breaks. He told his assistant \u201cto figure a way to have us a break\u201d. He also directed the assistant to chalk up for two hours at time and a half for the employees which was the first time the employees had been paid time and a half for a meeting. This witness said that she was called into the office about January 24, 1967 and given a rise. She was told that petitioner was considering another paid holiday and picking up an additional percentage of hospital insurance. On January 31, petitioner talked with the witness and four other girls. He told them that the union organizers had said they had the majority of people signed up and he didn\u2019t believe it and he\u2019d had his attorney file a petition for an election. He then said to them \u201cthose of you who have signed cards know who you are and at the election you can do the same if you wish.\u201d In February 1967, Frank, one of the employer\u2019s lawyers, questioned her as to whether she had signed a card. She answered yes. He asked her what the card meant to her. She said the purpose of the card was to organize the Red and White (title of petitioner\u2019s stores) employees. \u201cHe asked me did I ever think of asking for my card back and I told him no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Another employee, Mrs. Borgo, was at the Greensburg store meeting on January 20, 1967 when petitioner told the employees he was going to enlarge the store and planning on giving them a raise in February. He stated that \u201cIf a union would come in there would have to be some cuts.\u201d He said that the union men had visited him that morning, offered him the union cards, asked him for recognition because of having 51% of the cards, that he refused to recognize them and that he was going to fight it. On February 9, 1967, another of petitioner\u2019s attorneys, Vaccaro, had interviewed her. He asked if anybody had approached her about returning her card. She answered \u201cNo\u201d. He asked \u201cIf I had ever considered returning it?\u201d Her answer was \u201cNo\u201d. In January 1967, the Greensburg store manager showed her he had her listed as a \u201cgenerally good worker\u201d. He told the witness she would get a 15 cents raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">A Mt. Pleasant store employee, Mary Czekaj, testified that the assistant manager, Garstecki, had told her \u201cif the union would get into the store, John (petitioner) would fold up.\u201d In January 1967 he told her John couldn\u2019t afford to pay higher wages and therefore part timers would be laid off. During that month petitioner\u2019s assistant, Craig, asked her who was working for the union and she refused to tell him.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">James Pravlick, a Mt. Pleasant store employee, testified that at the January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>19th meeting, petitioner had said that if the union got into the store he doesn\u2019t see how he could stay in business very long \u2014 that union representatives were not interested in us but just the dues that could be collected and that they would be up in the Romer Room, smoking cigars.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Mary Biller, cashier at the Greens-burg store, testified that petitioner on January 31, 1967 had said that two men had walked into the store today and told him they had 51% of the employees signed up and would like him to recognize the union. Petitioner said he did not want to see the authorization cards. Interviewed by an employer attorney who asked, did the union promise benefits? The witness answered \u201cThey didn\u2019t promise anything.\u201d Then queried the attorney \u201cIf anyone would approach you, would take back your union card?\u201d The witness answered \u201cNo\u201d. Said the attorney \u201cWould you take it back now?\u201d \u201cThe witness again answered \u201cNo.\u201d Romayne Matthews, Greensburg store cashier, testified that an employer attorney asked her early in 1967, if she had signed a union card. She answered \u201cYes\u201d. Next he asked did she want to change her mind and withdraw her card and she answered \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The balance of the employee witnesses mostly testified about signing authorization cards themselves and having other employees sign them. Apparently all of the employee witnesses had executed affidavits, copies of which had been given to the employer\u2019s attorneys or were so given at the hearing. Two or three of those witnesses after stating they had signed authorization cards and it had been established that the employer\u2019s attorneys had copies of their affidavits, were not examined further or cross-examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We find that the hearing evidence in this matter strongly supports the findings of the Board above outlined. That evidence on the whole case completely justifies the Board\u2019s decision that petitioner did interfere with, restrained and coerced his employees in the exercise of their organizational rights in violation of Section 8(a) (1) of the Act, Universal Camera Corporation v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 491, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); N.L.R. B. v. Walton Mfg. Co., 369 U.S. 404, 405, 82 S.Ct. 853, 7 L.Ed.2d 829 (1962) ; N. L.R.B. v. Nina Dye Works Co., 203 F.2d 849, 852 (3 Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">As to the Section 8(a) (5) finding and the bargaining order, it is the fact that between the time this case was briefed and decided by this court, the United States Supreme Court filed its opinion in N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co. et al., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). That decision vitally affects refusals to bargain and bargaining orders. In the light of this situation the Board, while it believes an 8(a) (5) finding and a bargaining order are well supported by the record before us, requests the opportunity to reconsider the 8(a) (5) portion of its decision and order herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">The petition to review will be denied. The Board\u2019s order as to violations of Section 8(a) (1) of the Act will be enforced. The bargaining order portion of the Board\u2019s order will be remanded to the Board for its further consideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">.
