Veterans Admin., 187 F.Supp. 723 (D.N.J.1960), aff\u2019d, 298 F.2d 445 (3rd Cir. 1962), cert. den., 371 U.S. 186, 83 S.Ct. 266, 9 L.Ed.2d 228 (1962);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-25\">3. contrary to plaintiff\u2019s request, an attorney would not be appointed for plaintiff because his claims were frivolous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-26\">Treating the matter as having been disposed of by the district court on summary judgment, we conclude that the record adequately supports the determinations of the district court both legally and factually. We are told that plaintiff may still proceed to assert his basic claim before the Veterans Administration. Our determination will in no wise prejudice such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-27\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
