Neate were divorced on June 16, 1958 in Virginia, and he was required to pay her $40.00 per week as support for their two children and as alimony. In January 1964 Martha married James Brown, but Neate nevertheless continued the weekly payments of $40.00 throughout that year. The law of Virginia declares that alimony shall cease upon remarriage of the recipient. Code of 1950, as amended, \u00a7 20-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">For 1964 Martha Brown filed a joint tax return with her new husband, but she did not report the total of $2,080.00 received during 1964 from her former one. For this omission, the Commissioner assessed a tax deficiency against her, but the Tax Court cancelled it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Section 71 Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">(a) <em>General </em>rule.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">(1) <em>Decree of divorce or separate maintenance. </em>\u2014 If a wife is divorced or legally separated from her husband under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance, the wife\u2019s gross income includes periodic payments * * * received after such decree in discharge of * * * a legal obligation, which, because of the marital or family relationship, is imposed on or incurred by the husband under the decree or under a written instrument incident to such divorce or separation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0H\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-14\">\u201c(b) <em>Payments to support minor children. </em>\u2014 Subsection (a) shall not apply to that part of any payment which the terms of the decree, instrument, or agreement fix, in terms of an amount of money or a part of the payment, as a sum which is payable for the support of minor children of the husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">Thus, a wife must treat as income periodic payments made by her divorced husband pursuant to the legal obligations recognized in 71(a) (1), unless the instalments are \u201cfixed\u201d as child-support. In the Tax Court Martha asserted that inasmuch as the State statute had terminated the ex-husband\u2019s alimony-duty, the moneys paid in 1964 by Neate were wholly child-support and exempted from her income by 71(b). See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Lester, 366 U.S. 299, 81 S.Ct. 1343, 6 L.Ed.2d 306 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-16\">The Tax Court concluded that because the Virginia law had discharged the husband of a further accounting for alimony, and there was no property settlement or like written instrument, the remittances after the wife\u2019s remarriage were not pursuant to a legal obligation and thus were not income to the wife. We agree, and affirm the opinion of the Tax Court, 50 T.C. 865 (September 16, 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
