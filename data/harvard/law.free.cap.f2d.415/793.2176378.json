The Secretary denied Martin\u2019s claim on the grounds that Martin\u2019s \u201cdiagnosed impairments, either singularly or in combination, did not preclude him from performing his usual occupation,\u201d and that Martin \u201cwas not precluded from engaging in substantial gainful activity by an impairment * * *.\u201d Section 205(g) of the Act provides in part that \u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive * * 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1964). The function of this Court, therefore, \u201cis not to re-weigh the evidence but to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision.\u201d Rome v. Finch, 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 1329, 1330; Labee v. Cohen, 5 Cir., 1969, 408 F.2d 998. The District Court granted summary judgment in this ease in favor of the Secretary. We agree with the District Court that there is substantial evidence in the agency record which supports the Secretary\u2019s finding of no \u201cdisability,\u201d as that term is now defined in sections 216(i) and 223(d) (1)-(3) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i), 423(d) (1)-(3) (Supp. IV, 1969). Therefore, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Martin, who is fifty-two years old, claims that he is unable to engage in \u201cany substantial gainful activity\u201d because of the numerous impairments from which he suffers. These impairments, Martin states, include nosebleeds when he works, chronic back sprain, traumatic arthritis, and hypertension. Other than the claimant\u2019s own self-serving testimony respecting the existence of these impairments, only the reports of a Dr. Morris, Martin\u2019s personal physician, tend to substantiate the claim of disability. Dr. Morris was of the opinion that Martin\u2019s hypertension, in combination with his back condition, left the claimant unable to work. The Secretary rejected the diagnosis of hypertension, however, on the ground that \u201cit is totally unsupported by acceptable findings.\u201d See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1524,- .1526 (1969) (Social Security Administration regulations pertaining to medical evidence of, and conclusion by physician regarding, a claimant\u2019s disability.) Instead the Secretary found that Martin suffers from minimal osteoarthritis and the residuals of a medial menisectomy to the right knee, \u201cneither of which has resulted in any significant dysfunction of the musculoskeletal system.\u201d These findings were based upon the reports of two doctors who, in addition to Dr. Morris, examined Martin. As the District Court concluded, these two \u201ccompetent doctors who examined plaintiff indicated that in their opinion he was able to work. One of these doctors, Dr. Enger, a highly qualified orthopedic surgeon, had treated the plaintiff for one of the conditions on which he relied to establish disability. Surely his diagnosis is entitled to great weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">When we view the medical testimony in the light most favorable to Martin, see Labee v. Cohen, 5 Cir., 1969, 408 F.2d 998, 1000, we find substantial evidence that Martin is, as the Secretary concluded, \u201cin remarkably good condition for his age.\u201d We do not disregard the opinion of Dr. Morris. This opinion, however, at best presents merely a conflict in the evidence which the Secretary resolved against Martin. See Green v. Gardner, 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 606, 607. That the medical evidence is conflicting does not entitle a claimant to either a period of disability or disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Martin argues before this Court that his stated inability to find work is evidence that he is unable to engage in \u201cany substantial gainful activity.\u201d Within the context of this case, this argument is devoid of merit. Since Martin\u2019s claim was pending before the Secretary on January 2, 1968, the amendments to sections 216(i) and 223 of the Social Security Act which became effective on that date are applicable to this claim. Pub.L. No. 90-248, \u00a7 158(e), 81 Stat. 821. Work of a \u201creasonable character\u201d is not the proper criterion, and the job area is not confined to Martin\u2019s locality. Social Security Act \u00a7 223(d) (2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) (2) (Supp. IV, 1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>fore, Martin\u2019s arguments based upon the vocational standards of disability which were applicable before January 2, 1968, are of no use to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-20\">.
