He alleges that, for violating this regulation, he has been placed in solitary confinement, deprived of good time credits, demoted to third class inmate status, and held incommunicado without visiting privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-24\">The district court held, without an ev-identiary hearing, that this was a matter of prison administration within the discretion of prison officials. Since the date of that ruling however, similar prison regulations have been held invalid in Johnson v. Avery, 1969, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718; Beard v. Alabama Board of Corrections, 5th Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 455 and Wainwright v. Coonts, 5th Cir.1969, 409 F.2d 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-25\">The appellant is confined in Ellis Unit of the Texas Department of Corrections, located at Huntsville, in the Houston Di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>vision of Texas. Therefore the judgment is reversed and the case remanded with instructions to transfer it to the district court in Houston for adjudication on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
