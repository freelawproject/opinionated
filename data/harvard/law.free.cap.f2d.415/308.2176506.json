CARTER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">This is an appeal from the judgment of the district court sentencing appellant following a jury verdict of guilty on two counts of a three count indictment. Count I charged that appellant knowingly concealed and facilitated the transportation and concealment of illegally imported narcotics. Count III charged that appellant conspired to knowingly conceal and facilitate the transportation, concealment and unlawful sale of illegally imported narcotics. Both counts charged a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">Appellant\u2019s only contention is that the prosecution\u2019s introduction of evidence concerning prior offenses was prejudicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">The pertinent facts may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-19\">On September 5, 1967 Figueroa, a Federal Narcotics Agent, and Oscar Palm, an informant, met appellant and his brother in Glendale. Palm and Figueroa had a conversation with appellant and his brother concerning the purchase of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">On November 24, appellant\u2019s brother telephoned Palm. Thereafter, Palm contacted Figueroa and other government agents and, the next day, went with them to San Ysidro. Pursuant to instructions from appellant\u2019s brother, Palm rented a motel room and waited with Figueroa for the delivery of heroin. Some time after 5:00 p. m. appellant arrived at the motel room. He told Figueroa and Palm that \u201cthe old man\u201d was coming from Mexico with the \u201cstuff.\u201d While waiting for the delivery, appellant had a conversation with Figueroa which included an offer by appellant to Figueroa to go into the heroin business with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-21\">When \u201cthe old man\u201d arrived he pulled the heroin from his pants and handed it to appellant, who handed it to Figueroa. Appellant was then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-22\">At the trial, agent Figueroa gave testimony concerning his conversation with appellant in the motel room. He stated that appellant \u201cmore or less bragged to us about his \u2014 I would say narcotic dealings in the San Diego and Los Angeles area.\u201d After this statement the court immediately recessed. The next morning Figueroa resumed his testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-23\">\u201cGOTT: [Assistant United States Attorney] Mr. Figueroa, at the recess yesterday afternoon we were talking about what was going on in the motel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>room, as I recall; Benny [Appellant] had already arrived, I think. Now, what further happened in the motel room after the initial conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">\u201cFIGUEROA: You mean after he came in and we started to talk? He hold me about his episodes in the Los Angeles and San Diego area \u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cCHAPMAN: [Counsel for appellant] I object Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cGOTT: Wait a minute. We don\u2019t want to go into those areas. Just say what else happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cCOURT: The objection is sustained. The last answer of the witness will be stricken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Appellant contends that the admission of testimony concerning his narcotic dealings in Los Angeles and San Diego was prejudicial misconduct. In appellant\u2019s view this amounted to evidence of prior criminal activity, which was inadmissible. In support of this proposition appellant cites Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Granted, the <em>general </em>rule is, as appellant asserts, that evidence of prior criminal conduct is inadmissible. However, one well established exception to this rule is that such prior criminal conduct can be introduced to show state of mind or intent, design, knowledge or lack of innocent purpose. Craft v. United States, 403 F.2d 360 (9 Cir. 1968); Metheany v. United States, 390 F.2d 559 (9 Cir. 1968); Asher v. United States, 394 F.2d 424 (9 Cir. 1968). Even <em>Michelson, </em>cited by appellant, acknowledged the fact that the rule is subject to exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u201cThere are also well-established exceptions where evidence as to other transactions or a course of fraudulent conduct is admitted to establish fraudulent intent as an element of the crime charged.\u201d 335 U.S. at 475-476, 69 S.Ct. at 218 f. n. 8.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">An element of the criminal conduct proscribed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 is scienter. Appellant contended at trial that he \u201cwas merely delivering a message\u201d when he went to the motel room. Therefore, it was appropriate for the Government to introduce evidence tending to show the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
