The Court held a hearing on July 20, 2016. The primary issues are: (i) whether Defendants JWS of New Mexico, Inc. and K.P. Kauffman Company, Inc. (collectively, \"the Defendants\") are entitled to summary judgment on the Second Claim of the Collective Action Complaint for Unpaid Overtime Wages, filed October 12, 2015 (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\"), which alleges that the Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff Richard Corman and the proposed class members, all former JWS New Mexico truck drivers, overtime wages in violation of the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2050-4-22\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 50-4-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D) (\"NMMWA\"), on the grounds that Corman and the Class (\"the Plaintiffs\") were exempt from the NMMWA's overtime pay requirements under NMMWA \u00a7 50-4-21(C)(5); and (ii) whether, alternatively, the Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on JWS New Mexico's and Kauffman Co.'s asserted exemption defense, because the Defendants are liable for unpaid overtime wages. After carefully reviewing the record, the Court concludes that because JWS New Mexico compensated the Plaintiffs on a commission basis, NMMWA \u00a7 50-4-21(C)(5) overtime pay requirements do not apply to the Plaintiffs. The Court concludes that JWS New Mexico and Kauffman Co. are entitled to summary judgment on the Complaint, and the Plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment on the Defendants' exemption defense. The Court grants the MSJ and denies the Cross MSJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court draws the factual background from the parties' undisputed material facts in the MSJ; Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of His Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Defendants' Exemption Defense, filed June 17, 2016 (Doc. 41-1)(\"Cross Memo.\"); and Defendants JWS' and KPK's Response to Plaintiff's Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed July 1, 2016 (Doc. 46)(\"Cross MSJ Response\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   JWS New Mexico offers oilfield services to oil production companies in southeast New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross Memo. \u00b6 1, at 4 (asserting this fact)(citing Complaint \u00b6 12,\n   at 3); Answer \u00b6 12, at 3, filed December 18, 2015 (Doc. 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   JWS New Mexico is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kauffmann Co.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross Memo. \u00b6 2, at 4 (asserting this fact)(citing Complaint \u00b6 11, at 2; Answer \u00b6 11, at 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Corman and the other Plaintiffs drove trucks for JWS New Mexico; Corman drove for JWS New Mexico from July 20, 2011, to April 6, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross Memo. \u00b6 3, at 4 (asserting this fact)(citing Deposition of Richard Corman at 7:23-8:7 (taken May 3, 2016), filed June 17, 2016 (Doc. 41-2)(\"Corman Depo.\").

The Court began the hearing by explaining its impression that the commission exemption applies largely to sales work; the piecework exemption is implicated generally when an employee receives pay for items produced, and the flat rate exemption applies when an employee is compensated for a task, like fixing a car, regardless the time required to complete the task.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Hearing at 4:11-5:11 (taken July 20, 2016)(Court)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court directed the parties to clarify how JWS New Mexico paid the Plaintiffs, because the Court surmised that JWS New Mexico paid the Plaintiffs hourly, with a commission in addition to the hourly rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:22-6:16 (Court). The Court also inquired whether it could write one factual section for both the MSJ and the Cross MSJ, because the parties did not dispute many facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:17-7:10 (Court). The parties opined that a single opinion would be appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:16-18 (Johnson);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 34:24-35:3 (Milstein).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Defendants clarified that JWS New Mexico paid the drivers twice a month based solely on twenty-five percent \"of the transportation charge to the customer,\" regardless the bid on which JWS New Mexico charged the customer. Tr. at 7:19-8:5 (Johnson). The Defendants described the three bid categories, which the Defendants listed in the MSJ, and noted that they disagreed with the Plaintiffs, because for hourly bid jobs, JWS New Mexico charged the customer for the hours to perform the job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:2-10:11 (Johnson). The Defendants explained that JWS New Mexico frequently wrote down the hours for the hourly bid rate jobs, thus the payment program resembled the automobile repair cases, which courts treat as cases about commission systems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:11-11:15 (Johnson). The Defendants further noted that the exemption applies to employees other than sales employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   at Tr. at 11:16-12:18 (Johnson). The Defendants responded to the Plaintiffs' statements describing the write downs as unlawful by noting that JWS New Mexico wrote down the charges to the customer, thus the hourly bid rate was more \"a target number of hours,\" and the Plaintiffs' arguments miss the point. Tr. at 13:22 (Johnson).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 12:19-16:9 (Johnson). Further, the Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs cite Corman's deposition testimony as evidence that JWS New Mexico did not frequently write down the Plaintiffs' time, but Corman has no personal knowledge how JWS New Mexico calculates jobs other than his.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 14:2-14:14 (Johnson). According to the Defendants, the Plaintiffs also cited a deposition exhibit showing only a selective sampling of job tickets to support their argument that JWS New Mexico only infrequently wrote down the hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 15:9-21 (Johnson). The Defendants also contended that JWS New Mexico did not provide contradictory statements, because the Plaintiffs' counsel did not ask questions related to the actual hours worked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:10-25 (Johnson). Regarding \"yard time,\" the Defendants noted that the\n   Plaintiffs provide no evidence to show that the yard time is more than de minimis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:1-24 (Johnson). The Defendants reiterated that piecework \"can apply to being by the job.\" Tr. at 18:16 (Johnson). Finally, the Defendants argued that while many cases which the Plaintiffs cited consider the FLSA and that, given this emphasis, the Plaintiffs cannot support their contention that a job rate system is not exempted under the NMMWA or that hours must be decoupled from pay under the NMMWA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:17-20:7 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court asked whether a payment system could fit into more than one exemption in the NMMWA, and the Defendants stated that this could happen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:10-21:8 (Court, Johnson). Answering the Court's questioning, the Defendants clarified that about fifty percent of the Plaintiffs' pay was based on hourly rate jobs, which are charged to the customer based on the time to complete the jobs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:1-23 (Johnson). The Defendants further explained that JWS New Mexico told its drivers that they would receive twenty-five percent of the charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 25:15-20 (Johnson). The Defendants agreed that the amount which the Plaintiffs make is irrelevant to whether an exemption applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:4-15 (Court, Johnson). In response to the Court's questions, JWS New Mexico clarified that it does not convert the Plaintiffs' pay to pay per hour and that it paid the twelve dollars per hour for de minimis time the Plaintiffs spent in the yard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:16-27:19 (Court, Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue that JWS New Mexico's pay program is similar to that in\n   <em>\n    Casanova v. Gold's Texas Holdings Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , which involved personal trainers, because the Plaintiffs are \"paid that percentage based on each hour they worked.\" Tr. at 28:10-11 (Milstein).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:8-12 (Milstein). The Plaintiffs contended that JWS New Mexico informed the Plaintiffs that they would receive between $17.18 and $22.50 an hour, and that the yard time plus the hourly rate jobs constituted more than fifty percent of the Plaintiffs' pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:23-29:11 (Milstein). The Plaintiffs averred that other companies serving the oil industry pay their employees by the hour, and that JWS New Mexico's practice allows JWS New Mexico to compete unfairly and raises safety concerns because of potentially tired drivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 29:12-30:10 (Milstein). The Plaintiffs then reiterated the arguments from their Cross MSJ and MSJ Response why the compensation program does not fall under an NMMWA exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 30:11-33:9 (Milstein).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court queried what policy would lead New Mexico to prevent employers from \"com[ing] up with a creative generous way of paying their employees.\" Tr. at 33:18 (Court). The Plaintiffs replied that overtime laws encourage employers to hire more employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:25-34:12 (Milstein). In response to the Court's question whether a payment program could fit more than one exemption, the Plaintiffs replied that \"employees who are compensated in part upon [one] of these three exemptions\" are not exempted. Tr. at 35:14-16 (Misltein).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35:4-36:10 (Court, Milstein). The Court asked: \"What I understand Mr. Johnson to be explaining to me ... is that only 2 percent is based on a 12 dollar an hour rate. And that 98 percent of their income is 25 percent of the job.\" Tr. at 36:16-18 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded that JWS New Mexico did not pay the Plaintiffs for all yard time, so the two percent might be inaccurate, and that, regardless the Defendants' description, the Plaintiffs received $22.50 per hour for hourly rate jobs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36:20-37:16 (Milstein).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court posed a hypothetical to the Plaintiffs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Let's say you had a company that was going out to an oil rig and telling Chevron, okay[, w]e're going to charge you $50 an hour to haul this brine water away from the rig. We're going to charge you $50 an hour, and we estimate that it's going to take eight hours so we're going to charge you a flat rate of $450 plus tax. If they did that, that's clearly based upon hours[,] but they turn around to their employees and say, \"We're going to give you 25 percent of the job[;] we're going to give you 25 percent of $450. So we're going to give you [$112.50].\" I could ignore what the company is saying to the purchaser of the product. Even though they're clearly calculating on an hour, [they] could clearly be paying the employee based upon you know, just a flat commission.... Would you agree that ... a company could do that[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Tr. at 37:21-38:16 (Court). The Plaintiffs opined that JWS New Mexico did with hourly bid jobs what the Court described, but, for hourly rate jobs, JWS New Mexico charged the customer for the hours worked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 38:17-40:10 (Milstein, Court). The Defendants averred that JWS New Mexico told the employees that they would receive twenty-five percent of what JWS New Mexico charged the customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 44:6-45:12 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Responding to a question from the Court, the Plaintiffs clarified that the New Mexico Legislature's concerns about safety related to all overworked employees -- not simply truck drivers -- because the NMMWA applies to all employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 40:11-41:6 (Court, Milstein). The Defendants noted that the DOT regulates the drivers, thus the policy concerns about safety are not as strong as the Plaintiffs would suggest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:13-24 (Johnson). The Defendants also disputed the idea that they were \"trying [to] get a leg up on the competition.\" Tr. at 46:1 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In response to the Court's question about the exemption that most concerned the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs identified the flat rate exception, which includes employers who paid employees for the estimated hours to complete a task.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 41:13-42:7 (Court, Milstein). The Defendants admitted that they do not know which exemption best fits JWS New Mexico's payment program, but they noted that more cases exist discussing the commission exemption, because the FLSA incorporates the same exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 47:11-48:7 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court asked whether the parties had found other states with similar statutes, and the Plaintiffs responded that New Mexico's statute is broader than other statutes, because the exemptions seem to apply when employees receive partially exempt pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 42:8-43:4 (Milstein). According to the Plaintiffs, \"absurd\" results would come from reading the exemption to apply to when an employee received any amount of exempt pay. Tr. at 43:7 (Milstein).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 43:7:24 (Milstein). According to the Defendants, no other state has a statute with language comparable to the NMMWA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 48:8-48:22 (Johnson, Court). The Plaintiffs clarified that the Alaska statute provides an exemption for flat rate mechanics in the automobile industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 51:21-52:6 (Milstein). At the Court's prompting, the Plaintiffs agreed with the Court that, in interpreting the NMMWA, the Court should look to cases discussing the FLSA, but the Plaintiffs reminded the Court that the State of New Mexico passed the NMMWA to \"be more protective than FLSA.\" Tr. at 52:18-19 (Milstein).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 52:7-53:2 (Court, Milstein). The Plaintiffs agreed with the\n   Court that, because the NMMWA includes \"flat rate\" and \"piecework\" exemptions, the NMMWA has broader exemptions than the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 53:3-53:19 (Court, Milstein).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Regarding flat rate systems, the Plaintiffs explained that, in\n   <em>\n    Burch v. Foy\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of New Mexico indicated that it could not determine whether flat rate systems existed outside the automobile industry, and, in\n   <em>\n    Yi v. Sterling Collision Centers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Klinedinst v. Swift Investments, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , federal courts agreed that flat rate systems were commission systems, thus, flat rate systems have to satisfy the tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 53:20-54:18 (Court, Milstein). The Court inquired why flat rate systems would be limited to the automobile industry, and the Plaintiffs admitted: \"I don't know of a printed reason why.\" Tr. at 55:25-26:1 (Milstein).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 55:14-56:4 (Court, Milstein). At the Court's prompting, the Plaintiffs reiterated, in closing, that the Plaintiffs' pay was not decoupled from their hours, thus no exemption applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 56:5-56:20 (Court, Milstein).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states: \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In contrast, putting on special protective gear that was \"heavy and cumbersome,\" and required \"physical exertion, time, and a modicum of concentration to put them on securely and properly,\" was compensable, as this donning differed in kind rather than merely degree. 38 F.3d at 1126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Because mandatory pre-shift briefings may be integral and indispensable to an employee's principal activities, they may form the basis of an FLSA overtime violation.

Regarding the staff's hours, the Seventh Circuit noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   It would be impossible in these circumstances to arrange things so that every banquet waiter worked 40 hours every week.

A team of mechanics is then assigned to the job. Each member of the team keeps track of the hours he works on the job. When it's completed and the hours of the team members are added up, Sterling determines each member's compensation by multiplying (1) the number of booked hours for the job by (2) the ratio of the team member's actual hours worked to the total hours worked by the team, and then by (3) a wage, per booked (not actually worked) hour, based on the skill or quality of the individual team member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896882\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/505/#p508\">\n    480 F.3d at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Judge Posner describes commission systems generally:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   The essence of a commission is that it bases compensation on sales, for example a percentage of the sales price, as when a real estate broker receives as his compensation a percentage of the price at which the property he brokers is sold. Although his income is likely to be influenced by the number of hours a week that he works, the relation is unlikely to be a regular one. In one week business may be slow; he may make no sales and thus have no income for that week. The next week business may pick up and by working overtime that week he may be able to make up the income he lost because of slack business the previous week. Over a year his hours of work\n   may be similar to those of regular hourly employees. So if he had to be paid overtime, his annual income would be higher than theirs even though he hadn't worked more hours over the course of the year than they had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <em>\n    Yi v.

Judge Posner explained the compensation program:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   When CCS receives a window-washing order, it calculates the number of \"points\" to assign to the job based on the job's complexity and the estimated number of hours that the window washers will take to complete it; usually each worker assigned to the job gets the same share of the points allocated to it. CCS pays each window washer the number of points allocated to him multiplied by a rate, specific to each worker, that is specified in the company's collective bargaining agreement with the union that represents the employees, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). CCS also uses the number of points assigned to a job to determine the price it charges to customers; naturally it uses a higher ratio of dollars per point for setting its price for customers than for compensating its employees, so that it can make a profit. And CCS regularly makes price adjustments, such as adding the costs of permits and equipment rentals, rounding the price to the nearest $25 increment, and reducing the price because of competition or a desire to maintain good relations with customers. These adjustments cause the percentage of the price attributable to window washers' compensation to vary from job to job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053146\" index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/365/#p367\">\n    782 F.3d at 366-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Regarding the irregular hours, Judge Posner wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   An employee who is paid by the sale is not a commission worker if his sales are made at a uniform rate (e.g., one sale per hour), so that the ratio of his hours worked to his pay is constant. For in that case his pay is effectively hourly. That's why piece-rate workers are not within the commission exception: because they keep producing even when no sale is imminent, the relation between the hours they work and their output tends to be constant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Alvarado v.

The Plaintiffs do not try to dispute that the irregularities exist; rather, the Plaintiffs contend that the irregularity conflicts with the NMMWA's purpose. The Court does not accept the Plaintiffs' invitation to conclude, based on theories about the NMMWA's purposes, that the Plaintiffs' hours were not irregular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   According to the Plaintiffs, the NMMWA's purpose counsels against determining that the Plaintiffs' hours are irregular in the manner characteristic of a commission system. The Plaintiffs worked more than forty hours every week, but, the Plaintiffs contend, the commission exemption\n   accounts for employees who work less than forty hours in some weeks and more than forty hours in other weeks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response at 7-9. Such a work pattern would balance to forty hours on average a week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response at 7-9. In\n   <em>\n    Yi v. Sterling Collision Centers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Judge Posner mentions as one rationale for the commission exemption: \"Over a year his hours of work may be similar to those of regular hourly employees. So if he had to be paid overtime, his annual income would be higher than theirs even though he hadn't worked more hours over the course of the year than they had.\"\n   <em>\n    Yi v.

No court has created such a cap, and, in one case in which a court determined that a commission system existed, the employees, like the Plaintiffs, worked over forty hours a week.\n   <em>\n    Walton v. United Consumers Club, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1556614\" index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/786/303/#p307\">\n    786 F.2d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312 (7th Cir. 1986) (stating that one employee, \"for example, claimed that she had worked from 1:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. every Monday through Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. every Saturday, and every Sunday for four months\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Court therefore declines the Plaintiffs' invitation to disregard the irregular hours, solely because the Plaintiffs worked many hours.

The Plaintiffs argue that the hourly rate jobs resemble the training jobs in\n   <em>\n    Casanova v.

According to the Plaintiffs, JWS New Mexico \"keyed\" the Plaintiffs' pay to their hours. Cross Memo. at 17. The Plaintiffs contend that, as in\n   <em>\n    Casanova v. Gold's Texas Holdings Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \"a one-to-one correlation existed between the hours a[n employee] worked and his or her compensation.\" MSJ Response at 5-6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Casanova v. Gold's Tex.

According to the Plaintiffs, because, only fifty percent of the Plaintiffs' jobs were hour bid rate and barrel bid rate jobs, and hour rate jobs constituted the other fifty percent, JWS New Mexico's compensation system as a whole does not qualify as a commission system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross Memo. at 15; MSJ Response at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The Defendants contend that JWS New Mexico still decoupled hours from pay when it calculated the customers' charges according to the Plaintiffs' actual hours for jobs. According to the Defendants, JWS New Mexico wrote down the Plaintiffs' hours to charge the customer for reasonable hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross MSJ Response at 8-10. According to the Defendants, this writing down illustrates that it charged customers for reasonable times for jobs rather than for actual times.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross MSJ Response at 9-10. The Defendants aver that JWS New Mexico therefore calculated the customers' price, while considering the actual and reasonable time to complete the job, and then compensated the Plaintiffs according to the price charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross MSJ Response at 9-10; Tr. at 13:19-23 (Johnson). The Defendants analogize the compensation system to writing down attorneys' time; a firm might charge a client for reasonable time worked on a matter rather than the full hours input on it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:18-11:3 (Johnson). In this analogy, if a lawyer received a commission based on the amount charged the client, the lawyer would not receive hourly pay; a lawyer receiving hourly pay would be compensated for his or her time, regardless the value charged the customer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Court concludes that JWS New Mexico decoupled the Plaintiffs' hours from their pay. Because JWS New Mexico wrote down hours, the Plaintiffs' pay, unlike the trainers' compensation in\n   <em>\n    Casanova v. Gold's Texas Holdings Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , did not correlate one-to-one with their hours. Even if JWS New Mexico wrote down hours only occasionally, that JWS New Mexico wrote down hours illustrates that JWS New Mexico decoupled the Plaintiffs' pay from their hours by calculating reasonable hours when charging customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   This emphasis on reasonableness does not differ significantly from payment programs, like that in\n   <em>\n    Alvarado v. Corporate Cleaning Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in which an employer calculates customers' costs according to a jobs' complexity and expected duration. While some correlation existed between the Plaintiffs' hours and pay, how JWS New Mexico charged customers and\n   how JWS New Mexico paid the Plaintiffs are different considerations. JWS New Mexico asked customers to pay for reasonable hours worked, and JWS New Mexico gave the Plaintiffs twenty-five percent of that requested charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Such a compensation system incentivizes efficiency. While the Plaintiffs state that the Defendants did not use the compensation system to \"incentivize their drivers to work more efficiently,\" Cross MSJ at 14, caselaw does not suggest that employers must intend to motivate their employees. The court in\n   <em>\n    Casanova v. Gold's Texas Holdings Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , describes the incentive element as resulting from decoupling pay from time worked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201241548\">\n    2016 WL 1241548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (\"Second, a bona fide commission is decoupled from actual time worked, so that there is an incentive for the employee to work more efficiently and effectively[.]\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klinedinst v.

In particular, unions' efforts to negotiate for overtime provisions in collective bargaining agreements would be undermined if competing, non-union firms were free to hire workers willing to work long hours without overtime. The second purpose was to spread work and thereby reduce unemployment, by requiring an employer to pay a penalty for using fewer workers to do the same amount of work as would be necessary if each worker worked a shorter week. The third purpose was to protect the overtime workers from themselves: long hours of work might impair their health or lead to more accidents (which might endanger other workers as well).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   825 F.2d at 1176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Plaintiffs rest their arguments partly on statements about the FLSA's purposes.

Further, in explaining the employees' compensation system, Judge Black describes what other courts, and the Wage and Hour Handbook, characterize as a flat rate system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yi v.

Accordingly, the Court gives\n   <em>\n    Olivo v. Crawford Chevrolet Inc.\n   </em>\n   's connection between \"piecework\" and compensation \"by the job\" limited weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The Court is persuaded that \"piecework\" involves payment for production, disassociated from sales. The Court agrees with Judge Posner's comments in\n   <em>\n    Alvarado v. Corporate Cleaning Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , and everyday parlance associates \"piecework\" with production in the manner described. Accordingly, the NMMWA exemption applies where employers tie employees' compensation to work done, disconnected from hours worked and sales to consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   JWS New Mexico linked the Plaintiffs compensation to the amounts charged the customers. Like the window washers in\n   <em>\n    Alvarado v. Corporate Cleaning Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiffs received payment only on a sale's completion. The \"piecework\" exemption does not, therefore, apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     THE \"YARD TIME\" DOES NOT REMOVE THE PLAINTIFFS FROM THE EXEMPTION\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   The Court concludes that the \"yard time\" does not make the Plaintiffs' work non-exempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties do not seriously dispute that the yard time makes the exemption inapplicable. The Plaintiffs cite the yard time for which JWS New Mexico compensated the Plaintiffs hourly as evidence that JWS New Mexico did not wholly compensate the Plaintiffs with exempt pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross MSJ Reply at 6-7. The hourly compensation for yard time would not satisfy the requirements for a commission system, because the yard time, which JWS New Mexico paid at an hourly rate for time washing or maintaining\n   trucks, was not tied or proportional to a transaction with a customer or decoupled from the hours that the Plaintiffs worked. Similarly, because JWS New Mexico compensated at an hourly rate the Plaintiffs for the yard time, the payments constituted neither a flat rate or piecework. Nevertheless, although the Plaintiffs contend that the NMMWA does not exempt employees paid on a partially exempt basis, the Plaintiffs do not seriously argue that the \"yard time\" alone removes the Plaintiffs from an NMMWA exemption. The Plaintiffs emphasize instead that the NMMWA \"does not exempt employees who are paid more than half of their compensation on a non-exempt hourly basis.\" Cross MSJ at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The yard time compromises a de minimis amount of the Plaintiffs' pay.

A blanket statement that the NMMWA exempts partial-commission, flat rate, or piecework employees opens opportunities to undermine the NMMWA's aims to maintain minimum wages and overtime compensation. If any employer could gain an exemption by paying a minimal exemption, most employers would likely seek such an advantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   On the other hand, the FLSA and several states' statutes reflect agreement that asking for pure commission compensation is too demanding; they ask that individuals receive only part, usually fifty percent, of their income from commissions. Such decisions suggest that partial exemptions can satisfy the goals of ensuring reasonable wages and decreasing hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"539\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i) ; Ca.

Code \u00a7 49-46-130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(j)(3)-(4). Even partial commission compensation may accompany irregular hours and encourage efficiency in the workplace. If commissions decouple pay from hours, only the maximum forty-nine percent of an employees' pay may be regular. Similarly, no worker treats fifty-percent of his pay, likely half of his income, as irrelevant, and he will, if he desires, pursue efficiency in seeking his commissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Nevertheless, importing such a fifty-percent-of-earnings-or-more requirement into the NMMWA significantly alters the statute. The Court refrains from so changing the New Mexico Legislature's statement. The New Mexico Legislature chose not to\n   include such a qualification when enacting the NMMWA seventeen years after Congress enacted the FLSA, and the Court will not do so now. The New Mexico Legislature instead chose to enact an exemption broader than the FLSA's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The Court concludes that common sense requires a de minimis exception for the statute, but a de minimis rule is the only rule that the Court will apply to the NMMWA exemption. Pure common sense dictates that the statute should not mean that employees regularly paid on a commission, flat rate, or piecework basis, should be removed from the exemption, because they receive de minimis hourly amounts for tangential tasks. The Plaintiffs are employed and paid for driving trucks. The yard time is only incidental. In comparison to driving, it is minor time and minor pay for minor tasks.\n   <em>\n    Olivo v. Crawford Chevrolet Inc.\n   </em>\n   's order supports this conclusion. That the fifty-percent-or-more requirement exists in other states and in the federal statutes strengthens the Court's confidence that recognizing the Plaintiffs as exempt despite the de minimis yard time compensation will not undermine the NMMWA. Common sense is not inconsistent with the statute. Statutory interpretation requires common sense. Reading a blanket fifty-percent-of-earnings-or-more requirement into a statute without that rule is is not common sense. It is rewriting the statute. The \"yard time\" is a de minimis amount for tasks tangential to the jobs for which JWS New Mexico hired the Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs are exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Thus, the Court grants the MSJ and denies the Cross MSJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The Court ordered that: (i) Defendants JWS's and KPK's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed June 17, 2016 (Doc. 39), is granted; (ii) the Plaintiff's Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Defendants' Exemption Defense, filed June 17, 2016 (Doc. 41), is denied; and (iii) the Second Claim of the Collective Action Complaint for Unpaid Overtime Wages, filed October 12, 2015 (Doc. 1), is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    JWS New Mexico, Kauffmann Co., and the Plaintiffs agreed that the Court could, for the MSJ and Cross MSJ, issue a single opinion with a Factual Background section that dealt jointly with the undisputed facts from the MSJ and Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Defendants' Exemption Defense, filed June 17, 2016 (Doc. 41-1).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Draft Transcript of Hearing at 4:11-5:11 (taken July 20, 2016)(Court)(\"Tr.\") at 7:16-18 (Johnson);\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2049-46-130\">\n      id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2049-46-130\">\n     . at 34:24-35:3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Milstein).

Courts should, obviously, be reticent to formulate an\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    prediction that conflicts with state-court precedent; even if the prediction turns out to be correct, such predictions produce disparate results between cases filed in state and federal courts, as the old state supreme court precedent usually binds state trial courts. The factors to which a federal court should look before making an\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    prediction that a state supreme court will overrule its prior precedent vary depending upon the case, but some consistent ones include: (i) the age of the state supreme court decision from which the federal court is considering departing -- the younger the state case is, the less likely it is that departure is warranted; (ii) the amount of doctrinal reliance that the state courts -- especially the state supreme court -- have placed on the state decision from which the federal court is considering departing; (iii) apparent shifts away from the doctrine that the state decision articulates, especially if the state supreme court has explicitly called an older case's holding into question; (iv) changes in the composition of the state supreme court, especially if mostly dissenting justices from the earlier state decision remain on the court; and (v) the decision's patent illogic or its inapplicability to modern times.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pe\u00f1a v.

In short, a state supreme court case that a federal court\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    predicts will be overruled is likely to be very old, neglected by subsequent state-court cases -- perhaps because it is in a dusty corner of the common law which does not get much attention or have much application -- and clearly wrong.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"48\">\n   <p id=\"p-277\">\n    The Supreme Court has addressed what the federal courts may use when there is not a decision on point from the state's highest court:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n    The highest state court is the final authority on state law, but it is still the duty of the federal courts, where the state law supplies the rule of decision, to ascertain and apply that law even though it has not been expounded by the highest court of the State.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit -- or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves -- would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point -- regardless whether it accurately reflects state law -- at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long as federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-284\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination -- the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants -- if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion -- have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-285\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' decisions are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. Accordingly, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind state law developments -- developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states. The Tenth Circuit used to follow this rationale in applying a clearly erroneous standard of review to district judge decisions of state law with no controlling state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weiss v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560510\" index=\"561\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/518/#p525\">\n     787 F.2d 518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 525 (10th Cir. 1986) ;\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

Since the mid-1980s, however, the Tenth Circuit has abandoned that rationale and applied a de novo standard of review to district judge decisions applying state law with no governing state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

The Court regrets the Tenth Circuit's retreat from the clearly erroneous standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-286\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding -- what the state law was on the day the opinion was published -- but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-287\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x.\n    </em>\n    Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive -- interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions --\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law -- in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-288\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This statement may not be the most precise formulation if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court -- the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Laboratories v.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court -- considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law -- may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-289\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time -- forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous) -- federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases -- even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law -- alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-290\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree. In\n    <em>\n     Wankier v. Crown Equipment Corp.\n    </em>\n    , the Tenth Circuit said that,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n    [w]here no controlling state decision exists, the federal court must attempt to predict what the state's highest court would do. In performing this ventriloquial function, however, the federal court is bound by ordinary principles of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis.\n    </em>\n    Thus, when a panel of this Court has rendered a decision interpreting state law, that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit, and on subsequent panels of this Court, unless an intervening decision of the state's highest court has resolved the issue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-292\">\n    <em>\n     Wankier v.

From this passage, it seems clear the Tenth Circuit permits a district court to deviate from its view of state law only on the basis of a subsequent case \"of the state's highest court.\"\n    <em>\n     The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n    </em>\n    1402 (William Morris ed., New College ed. 1976)(defining \"unless\" as \"[e]xcept on the condition that; except under the circumstances that\"). A more aggressive reading of the passage -- namely the requirement that the intervening case \"resolv[e] the issue\" -- might additionally compel the determination that any intervening case law must definitively and directly contradict the Tenth Circuit interpretation in order to be considered \"intervening.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-293\">\n    It is difficult to know whether Judge McConnell's limitation of \"intervening decision\" to cases from the highest state court was an oversight or intentional.
