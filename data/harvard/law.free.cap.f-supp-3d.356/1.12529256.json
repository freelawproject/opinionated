INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In an order dated July 2, 2018, the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas transferred this matter to this court under the Fifth Circuit's first-to-file rule. The court in Texas found that there is a \"likelihood of substantial overlap\" between this case and\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association of America v. FDA\n   </em>\n   , which has been pending before this court since July 2016. Plaintiffs are Texas-based stakeholders in the premium cigar industry. They now ask the court to retransfer the case to the Eastern District of Texas, where they originally filed this action. Plaintiffs assert that retransfer is appropriate because there is not substantial overlap between the two cases, and further, because the interests of justice and convenience obligate this court to respect Plaintiffs' choice of forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the court declines to retransfer this case. Instead, the court consolidates this matter with\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association of America v. FDA\n   </em>\n   and directs the parties to meet and confer and propose a summary judgment briefing schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As to Option 2, the FDA noted that while \"all cigars are harmful and potentially addictive, it has been suggested that different kinds of cigars may have the potential for varying effects on public health, based on possible differences in their effects on dual use, youth initiation[,] and frequency of use by youth and young adults.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023%2C142\">\n    at 23,143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FDA sought comment on both options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After receiving and considering comments, on May 10, 2016, the FDA published a final rule \"deeming\" all categories of cigars subject to the TCA, including premium cigars, pipe tobacco, and certain other products (for example, e-cigarettes), as proposed in Option 1 described above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Final Rule\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deeming Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C974\">\n    81 Fed.

Mem. at 2, overstates the transferee court's role in the first-to-file analysis under Fifth Circuit law. Plaintiffs' understanding rests largely on a portion of the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , in which the court stated that \"the ultimate determination of whether there actually was a substantial overlap requiring consolidation of the two suits\" rests with the transferee court,\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"755237\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/439/403/\">\n    439 F.2d at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   's \"ultimate determination\" language). Plaintiffs apparently read that text to mean that this court must independently determine whether the two cases \"lack[ ] the actual overlap that would justify [\n   <em>\n    En Fuego\n   </em>\n   's] retention in this court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. But\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   itself and subsequent Fifth Circuit cases clarify that the transferee court's main function is to determine how the second case should proceed in that court after it has been transferred, not to reapply first-to-file principles and potentially override the transferor court. In a footnote, the court in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   stated that \"regardless of whether or not the suits here are identical, if they overlap on the substantive issues, ... the [transferee] court is the proper forum to determine if the [second] suit ... actually overlaps to the extent\n   <em>\n    requiring consolidation\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"755237\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/439/403/\">\n    439 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   408 n.6. (emphasis added). A later Fifth Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    Sutter Corp. v.

Thus, the function of the transferee court is not to reassess whether there is \"substantial overlap\" justifying retention under the Fifth Circuit's first-to-file principles; rather, its role is to decide the fate of the second-filed case as it deems appropriate. The court therefore declines to retransfer this case on the ground that it does not \"substantially overlap\" with\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Most significantly, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, the\n   <em>\n    En Fuego\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs do not concede that \"the content of the warnings is [ ] purely factual and uncontroversial as applied to premium cigars.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-72; Pls.' Mem. at 4, 8-9. In other words, the\n   <em>\n    En Fuego\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs believe that the warnings regime is subject to strict scrutiny or at least intermediate scrutiny under\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   .

Additionally, the\n   <em>\n    En Fuego\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs advance an argument that the\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs deferred: that the FDA acted arbitrarily and capriciously by subjecting premium cigars to the same warnings requirement as other cigar products.\n   <em>\n    Compare En Fuego\n   </em>\n   , Am.

Finally, the\n   <em>\n    En Fuego\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs assert claims that the\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs do not. Specifically, they maintain that (1) the warnings plan pre-approval requirement constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint; (2) promulgation of the Deeming Rule by a career FDA employee violated the Appointments Clause and the APA; and, perhaps, (3) the FDA's failure to stay the warnings requirement pending the ongoing rulemaking process concerning premium cigars was arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 97-107, 130-49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The foregoing differences do not, however, diminish the commonality of the legal issues presented in both cases. At their core, both cases involve constitutional and administrative law challenges to the FDA's decision to require cigar products to carry health warnings. The fact that one set of plaintiffs advances different claims or theories does not, without more, defeat the benefits of a single judge deciding related challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Mortg.

Mem. at 11. It is true that the two cases are in different places. A portion of\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   has been resolved and certain rulings are on appeal.\n   <em>\n    En Fuego\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, is fully briefed, yet remains unresolved on the merits. In other circumstances, these differences might warrant non-consolidation. But here, both cases involve cross-motions for summary judgment largely on an administrative record. There is no real gain or loss of efficiency by consolidating the matters, as opposed to keeping them on separate tracks. Indeed, consolidation does not extinguish the independent nature or status of different cases and therefore permits the court to treat them individually.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank Markazi v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595688\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1310/#p1327\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1327,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595688\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1310/#p1327\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (\"[A]ctions do not lose their separate identity because of consolidation.\") (quoting 9A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2382, p. 10 (3d ed. 2008) ). In short, notwithstanding their different postures, consolidating\n   <em>\n    En Fuego\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   is appropriate under Rule 42(a), because both involve common questions of law and fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether to Stay the\n    <em>\n     En Fuego\n    </em>\n    Matter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Having decided to retain this matter and consolidate it with\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   , the court now turns to Defendants' request that the court stay these proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp. at 14-17. The court will not issue a stay. Defendants did not move to stay this matter, but rather introduced the request in their Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Retransfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595688\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1310/#p1327\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For that reason alone, the court denies the requested stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nor is a stay otherwise warranted. Defendants argue that the court should stay this case because the \"D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   will likely control\n   the outcome of the central claims raised in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Perhaps it will; perhaps it won't. Whatever the outcome of the D.C. Circuit proceedings, it would be patently unfair to the\n   <em>\n    En Fuego\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs to further delay reaching the merits of their challenges. They have waited long enough, having filed this action nearly one year ago. Moreover, as Plaintiffs point out, staying this matter could put them in the difficult position of having to litigate this case on an expedited basis if the D.C. Circuit rules against the\n   <em>\n    Cigar Association\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs on appeal, as a negative ruling would start the clock on dissolving the present stay of the warnings requirement. In the face of this risk to Plaintiffs, Defendants have shown no hardship attendant to moving forward.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landis v. North Am.
