(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 122 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Complaint\n   </strong>\n   \").) The Court previously granted Defendant City of Apopka's (\"\n   <strong>\n    City\n   </strong>\n   \") motion to dismiss (Doc. 128) and dismissed all of Plaintiff's claims against the City. (Doc. 133 (\"\n   <strong>\n    MTD Order\n   </strong>\n   \").) Plaintiff then appealed the MTD Order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded (\"\n   <strong>\n    Opinion\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Second, application of the \"arguable probable cause\" standard to evaluate the sufficiency of Plaintiff's false arrest allegations against the City instead of the correct \"actual probable cause\" standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 620-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff's Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Turning again to the plausible allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint, accepted as true, the Court finds that the relevant\n   facts are as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Altercations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2011, Plaintiff resided in a home with his family-his wife Tarsha Davis (\n   <strong>\n    \"Mrs. Davis\"\n   </strong>\n   ), a nine-year-old daughter (\"\n   <strong>\n    Minor Daughter\n   </strong>\n   \"), a ten-year-old son (\"\n   <strong>\n    Minor Son\n   </strong>\n   \"), and twenty-two-year-old Timothy Allen Davis, II (\"\n   <strong>\n    Timmy\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 122, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22.) Timmy had recently returned to the home after leaving college, where he had played football. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Timmy weighed approximately 280 pounds, stood 6'1? tall, and was the father of a young child (\"\n   <strong>\n    Child\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of a multi-day visit between Timmy and the Child, the Child's mother (\"\n   <strong>\n    Mother\n   </strong>\n   \") arrived at the home to retrieve the Child on October 1, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23.) Timmy refused to surrender the Child to the Mother, a dispute ensued, and Plaintiff attempted to reason with Timmy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25.) While Timmy argued with Plaintiff, Mrs. Davis placed the Child in the Mother's car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.) This action allegedly incensed Timmy, who \"charged after Mrs. Davis, yelling and cursing her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To prevent physical harm to Mrs. Davis and the Mother, Plaintiff intervened, and Timmy \"walked off down the street\" after he threatened to \"beat\" Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Approximately fifteen minutes after the initial altercation, Timmy returned to the home and was advised by Plaintiff and Mrs. Davis that he had to \"move out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Timmy responded by going upstairs \"angrily\" and breaking down in tears. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff-who was on his way to join his Minor Daughter outside-went upstairs to \"calm Timmy down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Timmy was not calmed; rather, he yelled at Plaintiff and \"brutally attacked\" him by\n   <strong>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n   head-butt[ing],\" \"football-tackl[ing],\" and \"slamming\" Plaintiff to the tile floor in the upstairs bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Timmy then straddled a \"completely defenseless\" Plaintiff and repeatedly punched him in the face until Plaintiff bled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) During this attack, Plaintiff's head struck the toilet, he landed on the back of his head, his \"eyeglasses\" were broken and tossed from his face, and his knees were severely injured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mrs. Davis heard this second altercation, ran upstairs, attempted to pull-then eventually coaxed-Timmy off Plaintiff, and finally assisted Plaintiff off the bathroom floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Visibly bruised and swollen around his eyes, jaw, and lips, Plaintiff instructed Mrs. Davis to \"call the paramedics for his severely injured knees\" and face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 36, 49.) Attempting to distance himself from Timmy and \"avoid continued violence,\" Plaintiff then stumbled downstairs to sit and \"wait for the paramedics.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Timmy allegedly followed Plaintiff downstairs, so Plaintiff walked to the garage to get away from Timmy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) Because Timmy continued to follow him and was \"evidently enraged,\" Plaintiff then \"limped out of the garage\" to the driveway where his car was parked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hoping that the mere sight of a firearm \"would scare [Timmy] from attacking him again,\" Plaintiff retrieved a firearm from his car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) From less than ten yards away, Plaintiff observed Timmy pace back and forth inside the garage, remove his sweatshirt, throw it to the ground in a\n   \"fighting gesture,\" and then walk \"aggressively\" toward Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Panicked, Plaintiff fired a shot in Timmy's direction to \"scare him off,\" but \"Timmy continued to advance toward\" him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) In \"self-defense\" Plaintiff fired again, and the second shot struck Timmy in the chest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Plaintiff then saw \"blood coming from Timmy's upper chest area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff called to Mrs. Davis for help and attempted to escort Timmy to Plaintiff's car for transport to the hospital; however, when they neared the car, \"Timmy collapsed to the ground.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44, 48, 53.) Timmy's collapse caused Plaintiff's injured knees to buckle, and Plaintiff \"lost his balance,\" fell on top of Timmy, and was \"unable to move because of his injured knees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mrs. Davis then called 9-1-1 to report Plaintiff's \"confrontation with\" Timmy where \"she believed\" Plaintiff had \"shot.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 46.) Some of Plaintiff's neighbors-who came to the home in response to the loud noises-allegedly witnessed Plaintiff's position on top of Timmy and the \"visible injuries\" to Plaintiff's face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Police Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A few minutes after Mrs. Davis's 9-1-1 call, Officers Mark Creaser and Rafael Baez of the Apopka Police Department (\"\n   <strong>\n    APD\n   </strong>\n   \") arrived at the home, followed a few minutes later by Chief Manley. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18, 19, 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Meanwhile, Plaintiff was transported to a different hospital (\"\n   <strong>\n    FHA\n   </strong>\n   \"), again at Chief Manley's direction, where Plaintiff remained handcuffed, \"under guard,\" and ignorant of the fact that Timmy was deceased for almost two hours.

Then, without providing Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings or advising him that Timmy was dead, another officer, Detective Andrew Parkinson, interrogated Plaintiff at FHA and learned the circumstances that explained Timmy's\n   violence and established that the shooting was justified (\"\n   <strong>\n    Parkinson Interrogation\n   </strong>\n   \").

So in the absence of allegations of eye witnesses to the shooting, the Complaint fails to reveal that there was more Chief Manley could have done to obtain easily available information conclusively establishing that Plaintiff's use of force was not unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5674352\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/307/354/#p358\">\n    307 F.

And even if Chief Manley had conducted the investigation Plaintiff contends was required, the Complaint fails to include allegations that any of those steps would have-or even could have-conclusively established the defense of justified force in the absence of eyewitnesses to or recordings of the shooting.

Plaintiff's plausible allegations, construed most favorably and accepted as true, demonstrate the presence of actual probable cause for his arrest. Actual probable cause is not conclusively negated by the totality of the circumstances. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a factual backdrop that would permit the police to\n   <em>\n    conclusively establish\n   </em>\n   the sufficiency of the defense so as to negate actual probable cause in the context of a false arrest claim, short of witnessing the event themselves. After all, even eyewitness testimony can be, and often is, unreliable. The credibility of witnesses is untested by the crucible of cross examination at the scene. Perhaps there is a set of facts that would suffice, but they do not exist here.

Then, if there is probable cause to believe that the person committed a felony, law enforcement is authorized to immediately effectuate the arrest ... and should clearly do so when there is probable cause to believe that a person has committed a serious crime of violence against another. Probable cause to arrest for a crime of violence would include probable cause to believe that the suspect was not acting in self-defense; and, suspects will often claim self-defense even when the facts would not appear to support such a claim. This means that in most potential self-defense cases, a post-arrest and post-charging immunity determination, made when a defendant's counsel requests that determination, will be the best that we can do-procedurally-considering the well-established body of law detailing the responsibilities of law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <em>\n     Kumar\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12369951\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/227/557/#p559\">\n     227 So.3d at 559-60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Plaintiff relies heavily on the case of\n    <em>\n     Cozzi\n    </em>\n    for the relatively unremarkable proposition that \"in evaluating probable cause, an officer may not 'unreasonably disregard[ ] certain pieces of evidence' by 'choos[ing] to ignore information that has been offered to him or her' or 'elect[ing] not to obtain easily discoverable facts' that might tend to exculpate a suspect.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517200\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1288/#p1294\">\n     892 F.3d at 1294\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (alterations in original) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Kingsland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2190374\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/1220/#p1229\">\n     382 F.3d at 1229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1233 ).
