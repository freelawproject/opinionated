The affidavit averred that: the unauthorized accesses at the Postal Service were linked to a Dell computer bought on eBay by a user whose recovery email and phone number matched those on Iyamu's visa application; undercover investigators received phone calls about the fraudulent scheme from Iyamu's phone number; the electronic devices used for the fraud were readily transportable; Iyamu was seen transporting his mobile phone in his vehicle; and Iyamu and his vehicle were frequently at the Acworth house.

To the contrary, the audio recording and transcript of the interrogation establish that the tone of the interrogation was conversational and the agents did not use threats or violence. Although the agents initially entered the home with their guns drawn, there is no argument, nor any evidence, that they used their guns in a threatening manner during the interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Additionally, there is no indication that Iyamu's status as a relatively recent immigrant prevented him from voluntarily waiving his Miranda rights. The agents informed Iyamu of his rights orally and in writing. Iyamu asked contextually appropriate questions about his rights before stating orally and in writing that he understood them. Significantly, Iyamu later did invoke his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights during the interrogation, further demonstrating that he knew and understood those rights and that his will to exercise them was not overborne. The Court thus agrees with the conclusion in the R &amp; R that Iyamu voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

R &amp; R at 13-15. The R &amp; R concluded that under these circumstances, a reasonable officer could have believed that Iyamu was merely asking whether he had a right to counsel, rather than actually requesting counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206467\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/625/#p633\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Iyamu has not objected to these conclusions and the Court agrees that these references were not clear requests for counsel under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The R &amp; R further found that Iyamu's statement that he would like to talk to his attorney before answering questions concerning the fraud was a clear invocation of the right to counsel. R &amp; R at 16. However, the R &amp; R found that the invocation was limited because Iyamu stated that he was willing to answer questions on other topics.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206467\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/625/#p633\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court respectfully disagrees that Iyamu's invocation of his right to counsel at this point in the questioning was limited. The sole reason the agents searched the home and arrested Iyamu was because they believed he was participating in a \"sprawling financial fraud scheme.\" Ashcraft Aff. \u00b6 34. During the interrogation, the agents confirmed that their purpose for being there was to investigate the fraud. When Agent Sims asked Iyamu to \"[t]ell us what you think this is all about,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Iyamu answered, \"Well, it's not - I understand it's about a fraud,\" and Agent Sims responded, \"Right.\" Interrogation Tr. at 38. Because the interrogation was \"all about\" the fraud, Iyamu's invocation of counsel for questions \"concerning the fraud\" was all-inclusive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38, 44. Although Iyamu also stated \"if there's any other questions, I will ... give you my answers,\" there was no motivation for officers to ask \"other questions\" if the agents could not ask about the fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. Thus, when Iyamu stated that he wanted to talk to his lawyer concerning the fraud, the agents should have ceased questioning him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Iyamu's broad invocation covering the full scope of the interrogation is distinguishable from cases where defendants were found to have invoked only a limited right to counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219506\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/523/#p529\">\n    479 U.S. at 529-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219506\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/523/#p529\">\n    107 S.Ct. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649483\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/275/#p280\">\n    97 F.3d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In those cases, the limitations on the invocation were clearly delineated and applied only to discrete portions of the interrogations. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   , the suspect told officers that he was unwilling to make a written statement without his lawyer present, but had \"no problem\" talking about the incident.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219506\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/523/#p529\">\n    479 U.S. at 525-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219506\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/523/#p529\">\n    107 S.Ct. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court held that the suspect's limited invocation applied only to written statements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219506\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/523/#p529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219506\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/523/#p529\">\n    at 529-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219506\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/523/#p529\">\n    107 S.Ct. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly in\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   , the suspect stated that if he were to be given a polygraph test he wished to have counsel present.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649483\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/275/#p280\">\n    97 F.3d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eighth Circuit held that this limited invocation did not extend to the suspect's interrogation because he was not given a polygraph test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649483\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/97/275/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, the purpose for which Iyamu requested counsel-the fraud-covered the entire scope of the interrogation. Accordingly, all statements made after this invocation must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Even if Iyamu's invocation could somehow be construed as limited, the agents undeniably ignored this limitation and continued to ask him about the fraud for nearly two additional hours. It is impossible to know whether Iyamu would have made any of the statements elicited in the 13 excerpts if the agents had respected the boundaries of Iyamu's invocation and reined in their interrogation to conform to those limits. Based on the officers' clear and repeated disregard for the limits Iyamu placed on his willingness to speak without counsel, all post-invocation excerpts must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The 13 post-invocation excerpts must be suppressed for the additional reason that nearly all of them do relate to the fraud. Some of the excerpts involve a discussion about Iyamu's application for a visa, including whether the phone number and email address listed on the application were his. Interrogation Tr. at 55-57. This discussion concerns the fraud because the search warrant affidavit prepared by Agent Ashcraft states that the email and phone number associated with the fraudulent activity matched the email and phone number on Iyamu's visa application. Ashcraft Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 62, 65-66. Several excerpts involve questions about suspected co-conspirators, including Iyamu's ex-wife, an individual named Endurance \"Eddie\" Balogun, and others. Interrogation Tr. at 55-60, 65-69, 73-75, 85-87, 120-122, 152-53. Another excerpt concerns Iyamu's education in computers, which is relevant to the allegations that Iyamu was using his computer to commit fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80-83. Yet another excerpt involves questions about Iyamu's purchase of a Mercedes, which is relevant because the agents believed the car may have been purchased with fraudulent proceeds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For the above reasons, all statements made after Iyamu's invocation of his right\n   to an attorney for matters concerning the fraud must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
