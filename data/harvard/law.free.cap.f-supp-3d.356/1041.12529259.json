No. 35) and Defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 60). The motions were argued on October 16, 2018. Jennifer Selendy of Selendy &amp; Gay PLLC argued for Plaintiffs. She was accompanied by Steve Levitas of Plaintiff Cypress Creek Renewables Development, by Daniel P. Mach of Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP, and by Brianne C. McClafferty of Holland &amp; Hart LLP. Phillip J. Roselli of Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP argued for Defendants. He was accompanied by Justin Kraske, Chief Legal Counsel for the Montana Public Service Commission and Defendant Commissioner Roger Koopman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against the Montana Public Service Commission and Commissioners Bob Lake, Travis Kavulla, Brad Johnson, Roger Koopman, and Tony O'Donnell in their official capacity (collectively MPSC or Montana Commission) on January 12, 2018. Plaintiffs claim that the Montana Commission has violated Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3 and regulations enacted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 13, 2018, the MPSC filed a motion to stay the proceeding pending their ongoing rulemaking and to dismiss Plaintiffs' \"as-applied\" challenge for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. (Doc. 29). On April 19, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 35). Rather than responding to the motion for summary judgment, the Montana Commission filed a motion to hold the summary judgment motion in abeyance until the Court ruled on the MPSC's motion to stay and motion to partially dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint. The Court set a hearing on the MPSC's motions for June 4, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 5, 2018, the Court issued its order denying Defendants' partial motion to dismiss and motion to stay. The Court held that Plaintiffs' complaint pled an implementation claim pursuant to PURPA sufficient to give the Court subject matter jurisdiction. The Court denied the MPSC's motion to stay the proceedings while the MPSC completed a new rulemaking process, noting that the MPSC could have begun its amendment process as early as January of 2017, after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued its declaratory order on December 15, 2016. The Court also denied the MPSC's Motion to Hold in Abeyance Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and set a briefing schedule requiring the MPSC to file its answer, response to Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion, and any cross-motion for summary judgment on or before June 27, 2018. The MPSC's reply brief on its cross-motion for summary judgment was filed on August 1, 2018. The Court has reviewed the parties' briefs and received argument and is prepared to rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a) permits a party to seek summary judgment \"identifying each claim or defense-or the part of each claim or defense-on which summary judgment is sought.\" Summary judgment or adjudication is appropriate when the movant shows \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a) ;\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

(Doc. 1). In their single claim for relief, Plaintiffs allege that MPSC Order 7500 (and subsequent Orders 7500a-d) are inconsistent with and violate Plaintiffs' rights as QFs under PURPA and FERC's regulations. (Doc. 1 at 36, \u00b6 80). In Part A of their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment consistent with FERC's December 2016 ruling in\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FLS Energy, Inc. et al\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=157%20FERC%20P%2061211\">\n    157 FERC P 61211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (F.E.R.C.),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207381091\">\n    2016 WL 7381091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In clause 1 of Part B of their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction \"directing Defendants to implement PURPA in a lawful manner by adopting a standard for establishment of a Legally Enforceable Obligation that is consistent with PURPA, FERC's December 2016 ruling, and this court's declaratory orders ....\" (Doc. 1 at 37). In clause 2 of Part B of their claim for relief, Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction \"directing Defendants to allow any QFs that satisfied that standard on or before June 16, 2016, including the QF Plaintiffs, to contract with and sell their output to NorthWestern under the Prior QF-1 Tariff's avoided-cost rate of approximately $66/MWhr.\" (Doc. 1 at 37 - 38). In Part C of their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs seek \"attorneys' fees, costs, and interest\" to the extent available under law and equity. (Doc. 1 at 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The MPSC conceded in its Brief in Support of Its Partial Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Stay that the relief sought by Plaintiffs in Part A and the first clause of Part B of its Prayer for Relief constitutes a \"proper implementation challenge of the Commission's\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   LEO standard.\" (Doc. 30 at 28). Although the MPSC acknowledged during oral argument that the Court has jurisdiction to decide whether the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard complies with PURPA, (doc. 78 at 12), the MPSC argues that the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard no longer exists, mooting Plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief. (Doc. 61 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that the MPSC's recently completed rulemaking did not moot their case because the MPSC did not \"revise Order 7500's flawed safe harbor provision\" and instead \"adopted a\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   rule offering no remedy for those QFs who were denied the appropriate Prior QF-l Tariff rate....\" (Doc. 67 at 25)(emphasis in original). Plaintiffs argue that the MPSC violated PURPA by including a flawed LEO standard (the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard) in Order 7500 and are continuing to violate PURPA by applying the unlawful\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard to an entire class of QFs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207381091\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"The party asserting mootness bears a 'heavy' burden: a case is not moot if\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   effective relief may be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Karuk Tribe of California v.

In October of 2016, FLS Energy filed a petition asking FERC to initiate an enforcement action against the Montana Commission and NorthWestern\n   for their violations of FERC's regulations implementing PURPA. FERC issued a \"Notice of Intent Not to Act and Declaratory Order\" on December 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although FERC chose not to bring an enforcement action, it found that the MPSC's LEO standard was inconsistent with PURPA and FERC regulations. As this Court noted in its order denying the Montana Commission's motion to dismiss, the Montana Commission could have started the \"amendment process as early as January, 2017, after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued its declaratory order on December 16, 2016.\" (Doc. 51 at 3). The MPSC not only failed to start the amendment process, it chose to ignore FERC's declaratory order. In response to a request to reconsider Rule 7500 in light of FERC's declaratory order, the Montana Commission issued Order No. 7500d, in which it states: \"FERC's declaratory order is advisory only and is non-binding unless and until it is upheld by a federal district court.\" (Doc. 1-7 at \u00b6 107).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs responded by bringing the instant case. Shortly after this case was filed, the Montana Commission voted to initiate a rulemaking regarding the LEO standard. Having belatedly started the amendment process, the MPSC moved this Court to stay this action pending its completion of the process. Although the Court denied the MPSC's motion to stay, it gave the Montana Commission until June 27, 2018 to respond to Plaintiffs' pending motion for summary judgment and file its own cross-motion, thus giving the Montana Commission sufficient time to complete its rulemaking process on June 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is clear from the timing of the the MPSC's actions, as outlined above, that this case meets the \"evading review\" prong of the exception to the mootness doctrine. The Court must therefore consider whether there is \"a reasonable expectation that the plaintiffs will be subjected to the challenged action again.\"\n   <em>\n    Karuk Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886234\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1006/#p1017\">\n    681 F.3d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   While the MPSC may have implemented a new standard, it has not made any change to Order 7500 and has failed to address the argument that the MPSC's reliance on the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard in Order 7500 continues to adversely impact Plaintiffs and similarly situated QFs. Indeed, the Montana Commission continues to insist that the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard does not violate PURPA, arguing, in its response to Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, that \"Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that Montana's standard for establishing a LEO, first articulated by the Commission in\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   , is impermissible under PURPA.\" (Doc. 59 at 3). The MPSC's continued defense of the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard and its refusal to defer to FERC's declaratory order creates a strong possibility that the MPSC may return to the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction to decide whether the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard violates PURPA.

QFs may petition FERC to enforce PURPA and the rules promulgated by FERC, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(h)(2)(B), which is what FLS Energy did when it filed a petition on October 17, 2016, asking FERC to initiate an enforcement action against the Montana Commission and NorthWestern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although FERC declined to initiate an enforcement, thus paving the way for Plaintiffs to file their complaint in this Court, FERC also issued a Declaratory Order setting out its position on the issues raised by the petition.

In its declaratory order, the Commission found that the MPSC's LEO standard, commonly referred to as the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard, as used in Order 7500 was inconsistent with PURPA and FERC's regulations because \"the Montana Commission's requiring a signed interconnection agreement is no different than requiring a utility-signed contract, and equally impermissible.\" (Doc. 1-1 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs ask this Court to defer to FERC and enforce its order because FERC is entitled to deference when interpreting its own regulations. (Doc. 36 at 17). The Montana Commission contends that FERC's declaratory order is \"entitled only to\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   deference - that is, the declaratory order is 'entitled to respect' but only to the extent that it is persuasive.\" (Doc. 59 at 13, citing\n   <em>\n    Exelon Wind 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199952\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/380/#p388\">\n    766 F.3d at 392-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2014) ). For purposes of this motion, the Court accepts the position advanced by the MPSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having reviewed FERC's declaratory order and the parties' arguments, the Court finds the reasoning of the declaratory order persuasive and agrees that the standard relied on by the Montana Commission in Order 7500 violates PURPA and FERC's regulations by allowing the utility unilateral control over the creation of a legally enforceable obligation. While the standard relied on by the MPSC has been replaced, the MPSC's continued insistence that the standard is acceptable under PURPA requires this Court to address the\n   issue. The Court therefore grants Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to Part A of their prayer for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     MPSC's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs' Request For Injunctive Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Having decided to grant Plaintiffs' request for a declaratory judgment, the Court turns to Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief. The Montana Commission argues that the Court need not enter an injunction ordering it to implement PURPA in a lawful manner by adopting a standard for establishment of a Legally Enforceable Obligation that is consistent with PURPA and FERC's December 2016 ruling because it has already done so. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs' request for an injunction ordering the Montana Commission to adopt a new standard has been mooted by the completed rulemaking process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The next issue to be decided is whether the Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief requested in the second clause of Part B of Plaintiffs' request for relief, in which they seek a permanent injunction \"directing Defendants to allow any QFs that satisfied that standard on or before June 16, 2016, including the QF Plaintiffs, to contract with and sell their output to NorthWestern under the Prior QF-1 Tariff's avoided-cost rate of approximately $66/MWhr.\" (Doc. 1 at 37 - 38). The Montana Commission having presumably adopted an LEO standard that complies with PURPA and FERC's December 2016 order as part of its rulemaking, the Court could grant the request Plaintiffs seek by ordering the Montana Commission to apply its newly created standard retroactively and allow any QF that satisfied that standard on or before June 16, 2016, including the QF Plaintiffs, to contract with and sell their output to NorthWestern under the Prior QF-1 Tariff's avoided-cost rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Montana Commission characterized the additional relief sought by Plaintiffs as \"contracts for their individual projects with a specific rate of $66 per megawatt hour (MWh).\" (Doc. 69 at 3). The Montana Commission argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant this request because it raises an as-applied challenge. The Court agrees that \"a request for a specific contract at a specific price is an as-applied challenge that does not belong in this forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Winding Creek Solar LLC v.

Cal. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs are not asking for a specific contract at a specific rate - they are asking the Court to declare that Order 7500 is invalid to the extent that it relied on the LEO standard commonly known as the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   standard. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that this constitutes a proper implementation claim because Order 7500 applies generally to all QFs that interconnect with NorthWestern. In granting the relief sought by Plaintiffs, the Court would order the MPSC to apply its new LEO standard retroactively to any QF that met that standard on June 16, 2016, not just to Plaintiff QFs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   By ordering this relief, however, the Court would be imposing a burden on the Montana Commission to determine which projects established an LEO on or before\n   June 16, 2016 under its new standard and would be ordering retroactive relief, raising an Eleventh Amendment issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Montana Commission admits that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar a QF plaintiff from seeking prospective declarfatory or injunctive relief under PURPA, citing\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 61 at 21). Although Plaintiffs make a valiant effort to convince the Court that the relief they seek is prospective, they cannot overcome the fact that they are asking the Court to order the Montana Commission to turn back the clock and re-write Order 7500 in such a way that each QF Plaintiff could benefit from the Prior QF-1 Tariff rate. The relief sought by Plaintiffs is not prospective in nature and does not fall within the\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception to the Eleventh Amendment. The Court therefore grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Part B of Plaintiffs' claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiffs' case here, in the simplest of terms, is that they answered our nation's call for new energy at a clearly agreed and effective compensation only to find ultimately, after expending hundreds of thousands of dollars in performance, that the agreed upon payment had been cut in half. In the rulings hereinfore made, this Court has exhausted its jurisdiction. Plaintiffs may or may not be able to take this matter to a state court for relief, and the Court makes no comment on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (Doc. 35) is granted as to Part A of its claim for relief. Let Judgment enter in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendants in the form of a declaratory judgment holding that the\n   <em>\n    Whitehall Wind\n   </em>\n   test utilized by Defendants in Order 7500 for determining QFs' continued eligibility to sell at rates under the Prior QF-1 Tariff violates PURPA and its implementing regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Doc. 60) is denied as to Part A of Plaintiffs' prayer for relief and granted as to Part B of Plaintiffs' prayer for relief. Let Judgment enter in favor of Defendants in an order dismissing Part B of Plaintiffs' prayer for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Although Plaintiffs requested attorneys' fees and costs in Part C of their prayer for relief, they did not argue this issue in their briefs or during oral argument. Given that Plaintiffs prevailed only as to Part A of their claim for relief, the Court finds that neither party is entitled to fees or costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment in accordance with this order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Many of these facts are taken from Plaintiffs' Reply to Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts.

Plaintiffs filed their Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts on April 19, 2018, and the Court gave Defendants until June 27, 2018, to file their response.
