RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Contrary to popular superstition, there is no such thing as \"natural\" wheat, as farmers have been selectively breeding this staple since Neolithic times. But something of a race is now on to see who can develop genetically modified wheat with health benefits and commercial advantages. The instant case, arising from that competition, involves an international patent dispute over just such modified wheat. Specifically, plaintiff Arcadia Biosciences, Inc. (\"Arcadia\") alleges that it invented a kind of genetically modified wheat that has various health benefits and that, in the hope of fostering its commercial development, it shared this invention with defendants - who also develop agricultural products - in a series of meetings that were protected by a nondisclosure agreement. Defendants then allegedly used the information Arcadia shared, in violation of the nondisclosure agreement, to file three patents and develop other product lines. Arcadia now brings federal patent claims for correction of inventorship, as well as a welter of state contract and tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 4, 2018, Arcadia filed its initial complaint against defendants Vilmorin &amp; Cie (\"Vilmorin\"), Limagrain C\u00e9r\u00e9ales Ingr\u00e9dients SA (\"LCI\"), and Arista Cereal Technologies Pty Limited (\"Arista\"). ECF No. 1. On October 17, Arista moved to dismiss Arcadia's complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim. ECF No. 23. On the same day, Vilmorin and LCI moved jointly to dismiss Arcadia's complaint for failure to state a claim. ECF No. 27. On October 26, Arcadia filed its First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), ECF No. 33, and on November 5, defendants filed supplemental briefs in support of their motions to dismiss, ECF Nos. 36, 37, which Arcadia opposed, ECF Nos. 40, 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After receiving full briefing from the respective parties, the Court held oral argument on January 7, 2019. Thereafter, upon careful consideration, the Court issued\n   a \"bottom-line\" Order on January 11. ECF No. 53. The Order granted Arista's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and it dismissed all of Arcadia's claims against Arista without prejudice. The Order also granted Vilmorin and LCI's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and it dismissed all of Arcadia's claims against Vilmorin and LCI with prejudice. This Opinion sets forth the reasons for the Court's rulings and directs the Clerk of Court to enter final judgment dismissing the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following factual allegations are taken from the FAC and any documents incorporated there by reference. They are viewed in the light most favorable to Arcadia:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Arcadia is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in California. FAC \u00b6 2, ECF No. 33. \"Arcadia's business is the development of agricultural products, including crops with enhanced productivity and quality traits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Vilmorin is a French company that, among other things, is \"involved, either directly or indirectly through its affiliates [,] in ... researching, developing, and breeding plants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Defendant LCI is a French company that, along with Vilmorin, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Groupe Limagrain Holding SA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Defendant Arista is an Australian joint venture that was formed in 2006 by LCI and two Australian entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. At present, LCI has a majority interest in Arista.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2006, scientists at Arcadia began researching and developing a high amylose wheat technology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Amylose is one of two components of starch that - along with amylopectin - is present in the endosperm of wheat grains.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Amylose is digested more slowly than amylopectin, thereby giving rise to various health benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. To promote these benefits, scientists at Arcadia conceived of, and reduced to practice, genetic mutations of wheat grain with high amylose-to-amylopectin ratios.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Specifically, Arcadia's scientists caused mutations in a bread wheat gene called the\n   <em>\n    SBEIIa\n   </em>\n   gene, which produces a protein product that helps form amylopectin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Bread wheat has three genomes - A, B, and D - each of which has an\n   <em>\n    SBEIIa\n   </em>\n   gene - SBEIIa-A, SBEIIa-B, and\n   <em>\n    SBEIIa\n   </em>\n   -D - with two copies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. By mutating each copy of the\n   <em>\n    SBEIIa\n   </em>\n   -A,\n   <em>\n    SBEIIa\n   </em>\n   -B, and\n   <em>\n    SBEIIa\n   </em>\n   -D genes so that they lost their protein-producing function, Arcadia was able to reduce the amount of amylopectin produced in the grain's endosperm, thereby increasing the amylose-to-amylopectin ratio.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 13, 2009 - after it had reduced its invention to practice - Arcadia entered into a Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement (\"NDA\") with Vilmorin to promote potential collaborative opportunities between the parties. The NDA is binding on both Vilmorin and its \"affiliates,\" where \"affiliates\" is defined to include \"any existing or future corporation, firm, limited liability company, partnership, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with\" Vilmorin. NDA \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 3.5, ECF No. 29, Ex. 1. Over the course of several years, and under the protections of the NDA, Arcadia shared details of its high amylose wheat technology with Vilmorin and LCI employees, including Elisabeth Marie-Anne Ida Chanliaud, who was employed by Vilmorin or LCI but is described in the FAC as an \"Arista Project Manager.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 14, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Between 2011 and 2013, Arista filed three U.S. patent applications that later issued as patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The first application, the '884 Application, was filed on\n   November 4, 2011 and issued on June 23, 2015 as a patent - the '533 Patent - entitled \"High Amylose Wheat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The second application, the '177 Application, was filed on November 2, 2012 and issued on June 7, 2016 as a patent - the '722 Patent - entitled \"High Amylose Wheat-II.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The third application, the '456 Application, was filed on August 6, 2013 and issued on March 7, 2017 as a patent - the '413 Patent - entitled \"Food Ingredients Produced from High Amylose Wheat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   All three patents were assigned to Arista and were issued to Ahmed Regina, Pierre Georges Louis Berbezy, Elisabeth Marie-Anne Ida Chanliaud, Bernard Duperrier, and Matthew Kennedy Morell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Arcadia alleges that some of the information it disclosed under the protections of the NDA is claimed in Arista's patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Arcadia also alleges that other information it disclosed under the protections of the NDA, while not claimed in Arista's patents, is nevertheless likely being misused and misappropriated by defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Arcadia, Arista made clear in a provisional patent application filed on November 4, 2010 - the '288 Provisional - that it had been unable to obtain a viable version of the mutated wheat grain that Arcadia had succeeded in developing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Arcadia alleges that Arista was able to overcome its failures only because of the confidential information that Arcadia disclosed to defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By filing Arista's patent applications, Arcadia alleges, defendants breached their obligations under the NDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. Furthermore, Arcadia alleges, by obtaining Arista's patents in violation of Arcadia's rights, and by using those improperly obtained patents, defendants have unfairly competed against and interfered with Arcadia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. As a result, Arcadia alleges, \"Defendants have injured and tarnished Arcadia's business, reputation, brand, and goodwill, and thereby have undermined and damaged Arcadia's business through improper conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 4, 2018, Arcadia filed its initial complaint against Arista, Vilmorin, and LCI, ECF No. 1, and on October 26, Arcadia filed the FAC, ECF No. 33. In the FAC, Arcadia brings federal patent claims against Arista for correction of inventorship of the '533, '722, and '413 Patents. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 102-10, 175-83. Arcadia also brings state law claims against all defendants for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition, misappropriation of confidential information, unjust enrichment, conversion, and tortious interference.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 111-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 17, Arista moved to dismiss Arcadia's initial compliant for lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim. ECF No. 23. On the same day, Vilmorin and LCI jointly moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. ECF No. 27. On November 5 - after Arcadia filed the FAC - the defendants filed supplemental letter briefs in support of their motions to dismiss. ECF Nos. 36, 37. Arcadia opposed. ECF Nos. 40, 42. For the following reasons, Arista's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as is Vilmorin and LCI's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Arcadia alleges that the Court has jurisdiction over Arista on the sole basis that the NDA between Arcadia and Vilmorin contains a mandatory New York forum selection clause. FAC \u00b6 11; NDA \u00a7 7 (\"Any legal action which may be brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or which may arise from or be related to this Agreement, shall be brought in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York.\"). But Arista is not a party to the NDA. Nevertheless, Arcadia argues that Arista is bound by the forum selection clause because the NDA provides that \"all [Vilmorin's] Affiliates shall be deemed to have assented to the terms and conditions of this Agreement notwithstanding the lack of any additional written agreement to that effect.\" NDA \u00a7 3.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As noted above, the term \"affiliate\" is defined as \"any existing or future corporation, firm, limited liability company, partnership, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with a Party to this Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399012\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/1351/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.1. \"Control,\" in turn, is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [O]wnership, directly or through one or more Affiliates, of fifty percent (50%) (or such lesser percentage which is the maximum allowed to be owned by a foreign entity in a particular jurisdiction) or more of the shares of stock entitled to vote for the election of directors in the case of a corporation, or fifty percent (50%) (or such lesser percentage which is the maximum allowed to be owned by a foreign entity in a particular jurisdiction) or more of the equity interests in the case of any other type of legal entity, or status as a general partner in any partnership, or any other arrangement whereby a Party controls or has the right to control the board of directors or equivalent governing body of a corporation or other entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399012\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/1351/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It is undisputed that Groupe Limagrain Holding SA owns a majority of the stock of\n   both Vilmorin and LCI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corporate Disclosure Statement Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7.1 of Defendants Vilmorin &amp; Cie and Limagrain C\u00e9r\u00e9ales Ingr\u00e9dients SA, ECF No. 20. It is also undisputed that LCI came to own a majority of the stock of Arista in 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Eric Vaschalde in Support of Defendant Arista Cereal Technologies Pty Limited's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint Pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) (\"Vaschalde Decl.\"), ECF No. 26, at \u00b6 2. Accordingly, Arcadia argues, Vilmorin and Arista came under common control at least as early as 2017, and Arista thereby came to be an affiliate bound by the NDA, including the forum selection clause. Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Arista Cereal Technologies Pty Limited's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), and Failure State a Claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), at 3-5 (\"Arcadia A-Opp.\"), ECF No. 40.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Arcadia is undoubtedly correct that the NDA, by its terms, purports to bind not just existing affiliates, but also entities that become affiliates of Vilmorin's in the future. NDA \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 3.5. The Court must determine, however, whether the enforcement of the NDA's forum selection clause against a party that was not an affiliate of the parties to the NDA at the time it was signed comports with New York contract law (which governs the NDA) and federal due process. The Court holds that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Beginning with New York contract law, it is axiomatic that \"[a] contract cannot bind a non-party unless the contract was signed by the party's agent, the contract was assigned to the party, or the signatory is in fact the 'alter ego' of the party.\"\n   <em>\n    Glob.

But the better reading of the\n   <em>\n    Ellington\n   </em>\n   court's statements is that \"explicit language demonstrating the parties' intent\" was necessary to bind future affiliates, not that it was sufficient. As discussed above, there are cases in which parties can bind non-parties to a contract, such as when the parties are agents of the non-parties. It seems clear that the court in\n   <em>\n    Ellington\n   </em>\n   was contemplating such cases, rather than introducing a new rule of contract law that would give contracting parties broad discretion to bind non-parties. Indeed, in explaining\n   why EMI's predecessor did not include language in the agreement that would have bound future affiliates, the trial court stated that the predecessor \"could not represent that [it] had the authority to bind entities that did not yet exist or were not yet affiliated with\" it.\n   <em>\n    Ellington v.

Sup. Ct. 2011). As there is no evidence that Arcadia had the authority to bind Arista to the NDA,\n   <em>\n    Ellington\n   </em>\n   has no bearing on this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Arcadia's fallback position is that, even if the above decisions (and others cited by Arcadia\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) do not support the general enforcement of contracts against future affiliates, a separate line of cases authorizes the enforcement of forum selection clauses against non-signatories. In the Second Circuit, this line started with\n   <em>\n    Aguas Lenders Recovery Group v. Suez, S.A.\n   </em>\n   , in which the court held that, \"for the purposes of the doctrine of forum non conveniens, a non-signatory to an agreement may be bound by a forum selection clause and forum non conveniens waiver contained in contracts entered into by an entity alleged to be a predecessor in interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480551\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/696/#p697\">\n    585 F.3d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (2d Cir. 2009). Notably, the court in\n   <em>\n    Aguas\n   </em>\n   assumed that the defendant - against which enforcement was sought - was bound by \"successorship doctrine\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to its predecessor's contractual obligations. \"[I]f successorship doctrine binds a non-signatory to the obligations of a contract,\" the court reasoned, \"such a non-signatory/successor is ... subject to the ... presumption of the enforceability of mandatory forum selection clauses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480551\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/696/#p697\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480551\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/696/#p697\">\n    at 700-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court stated that it saw \"no reason to treat forum selection provisions differently from other contractual obligations,\" and it noted \"ample support for the conclusion that the fact a party is a non-signatory to an agreement is insufficient, standing alone, to preclude enforcement of a forum selection clause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480551\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/696/#p697\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480551\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/696/#p697\">\n    at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Clearly,\n   <em>\n    Aguas\n   </em>\n   stands for the narrow proposition that a non-signatory can be bound by forum selection provisions to the same extent that it can otherwise be bound to a contract under standard principles of contract law. But, as discussed above, Arcadia has failed to show how Arista can be bound to the NDA under such principles. However, the\n   <em>\n    Aguas\n   </em>\n   court also cited with approval several decisions from other circuits (and not involving New York law) addressing additional situations in which forum selection clauses may be enforced against non-signatories. As relevant here,\n   the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    TAAG Linhas Aereas de Angola v. Transamerica Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   held that defendants could enforce a forum selection clause against a non-signatory plaintiff who was a third-party beneficiary to a contract.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541105\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/915/1351/#p1354\">\n    915 F.2d 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1354-55 (9th Cir. 1990). And the Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Marano Enterprises of Kansas v. Z-Teca Restaurants, L.P.\n   </em>\n   held that defendants could enforce a forum selection clause against a non-signatory plaintiff who was \" 'closely related' to the disputes arising out of the agreements.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090959\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/753/#p757\">\n    254 F.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757 (8th Cir. 2001). A non-signatory was determined to be \"closely related,\" in turn, if it was \"foreseeable that it [would] be bound\" to a forum selection clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090959\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/753/#p757\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   That a forum selection clause can be enforced against a non-signatory plaintiff who is a third-party beneficiary is consistent with the general \"law of contracts, which has long recognized that third-party beneficiary status does not permit the avoidance of contractual provisions otherwise enforceable.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal Steel Corp. v.

Similar logic may justify the enforcement of forum selection clauses against \"closely related\" non-signatory plaintiffs, as these parties' interests are often \"completely derivative of those of the [signatory] plaintiffs - and thus directly related to, if not predicated upon the interests of the [signatory] plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Lipcon v.
