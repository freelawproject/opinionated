P. 73(b), the parties have consented to me serving as the presiding judge and entering final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Docs. 8, 9, 10.\n   </em>\n   Having reviewed the submissions of the parties and the relevant law, and having conducted oral arguments, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Specifically, the Court finds that a contingency fee agreement for lobbying before the County Commission would be unenforceable as in contravention of New Mexico's public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Midway is a real estate agency and developer, while Defendant Wagner is a business that assembles, sells, and leases construction equipment. According to Midway, the parties entered into an agreement in 2015 in which Midway would assist Wagner in securing the approval of Industrial Revenue Bonds (\"IRBs\") to be issued by Bernalillo County. Plaintiff maintains that an unwritten IRB agreement reached in October 2015 requires that each year Wagner incurs property tax savings from the IRB awards, Wagner must pay Midway 18% of such savings. Wagner denies that the parties entered into the IRB agreement as described by Midway. Nevertheless, for purposes of this partial summary judgment motion only, Wagner \"will accept as true Midway's allegation that the parties agreed to a fee based on a percentage of the tax savings Wagner will enjoy as a result of the IRBs.\"\n   <em>\n    Doc. 34\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Midway's suit against Wagner sets forth the following theories for recovery of damages: (1) breach of contract, (2) unjust enrichment, and (3) quantum meruit. Wagner now moves for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim based on its affirmative defense that the contingency payment term of the parties' contract, as alleged by Midway, is unenforceable on public policy grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In June 2015, Midway and Wagner entered into a consulting agreement whereby Midway would perform advisory services in connection with Wagner's development of its new property in Bernalillo County. UMF E. On July 29, 2015, Midway and Wagner reached an additional agreement, beyond the initial consulting agreement, for Midway to assist Wagner in obtaining IRBs from the County for Wagner's new property. UMFs J, K. As compensation, Midway asserts that Wagner agreed to pay it 18% of the property tax savings from the IRB awards each year for the succeeding 30 years. UMFs W, X. Midway's calculation for the value of its services on the IRB project is \"the present value of the agreed percentage of actual tax savings realized by Wagner over the life of the IRBs.\" UMF CC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Midway described its duties on the IRB project as both administrative and political.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   UMF O. Midway's administrative duties included coordinating Wagner's provision of information to the County to facilitate the County's evaluation of Wagner's IRB application. UMF P. Midway's political duties included working to obtain three votes of the Bernalillo County Commission in order to ultimately obtain IRBs from the County of Bernalillo. UMFs Q, S. Midway did this by communicating with Commissioners, providing them information, answering their questions, and persuading them that Wagner's project was a good use of the County's IRB incentives. UMF Q. These political activities clearly fall within the definition of lobbying.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990) (stating that \"lobbying\" means \"[a]ll attempts including personal solicitation to induce legislators to vote in a certain way or to introduce legislation\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   NMSA \u00a7 2-11-2(D) (stating that the definition of \"lobbying\" includes \"attempting to influence ... an official action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Midway's principal, D.

Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    K.R.

In\n   <em>\n    K.R. Swerdfeger\n   </em>\n   , the relevant statute dealt with an owner's responsibility to mark underground facilities before another party began excavation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. When an arbiter found that an owner could delegate that duty, the plaintiff argued that such a finding violated New Mexico public policy because the statute at issue did not expressly or impliedly permit delegation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10. The court declined to find a violation of public policy \"based simply on the absence of language [in the statute] expressly allowing delegation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. In contrast here, Wagner is not requesting the Court find a public policy violation based on the absence of language, but rather on the clear language of Section 2-11-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At oral arguments, Midway posited that the New Mexico legislature could have made Section 2-11-8 apply to local governments, if that had been its intention. But since it did not, Midway maintains that this Court should not expand the scope of the public policy expressed in Section 2-11-8. To illuminate this argument, Midway pointed to Section 10-16-13 on the New Mexico statutes, which prohibits state agencies\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   local government agencies from accepting certain kinds of bids. In contrast, the legislature wrote Section 2-11-8 to apply to lobbying before the state government without any reference to local governments. However, Section 10-16-13 falls under general rules of conduct for all public officers and employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2010-16-1\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-16-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to -18. In comparison, Section 2-11-8 is part of a set of rules governing conduct in the state legislature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-1-1\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2-1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 2-20-2. It therefore follows that Section 2-11-8 would not address local governments when the chapter is specific to the state legislature. Thus, the Court is persuaded that the public policy expressed in Section 2-11-8 can apply beyond the four corners of the statute, to local governments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armijo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1987-NMSC-006\">\n    1987-NMSC-006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8-9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1599039\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/105/324/\">\n    105 N.M. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1599039\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/105/324/\">\n    732 P.2d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While this Court has previously declined to expand public policy beyond the plain language of a statute (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herndon v.

Aug. 12, 2014) ), the public policy before the Court now presents a quite different circumstance. At issue in\n   <em>\n    Herndon\n   </em>\n   was a statute concerning the retaliatory discharge exception to at-will employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The Court found that expanding public policy beyond the plain language of the statute at issue - New Mexico's Criminal Offender Employment Act - would \"in effect, severely limit at-will employment in New Mexico, an at-will employment state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast here, applying the public policy behind Section 2-11-8 beyond the statute's plain\n   language does not severely limit the freedom to contract. Rather, it creates a narrow exception to that freedom in a very specific circumstance - when a contingency fee agreement for lobbying is at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although New Mexico favors the freedom to contract, lobbying contingency fee agreements are clearly contrary to New Mexico's public policy. That Bernalillo County has not addressed contingency fee agreements in an ordinance, or that the penalty for violating Section 2-11-8 is relatively minor, does not undermine New Mexico's public policy against such agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Midway does not dispute that under the alleged IRB agreement providing for a contingency fee, it engaged in lobbying the Bernalillo County Commission to issue the IRBs. Because the Court finds such lobbying pursuant to a contingency fee agreement to contravene New Mexico's public policy, Wagner has shown that it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on its affirmative defense to Midway's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Wherefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Affirmative Defense Based on Public Policy (\n   <em>\n    Doc. 33\n   </em>\n   ) is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   .
