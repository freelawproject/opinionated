(Dkt. No. 18.) Having considered the parties' briefs and having had the benefit of oral argument on June 14, 2018, the Court GRANTS the motion to stay and DENIES the motion to dismiss as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state action is substantially related to this action and the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Amended Complaint (FAC) Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jeremy Goodin is the sole director and member of Urban Flowers, Inc., which owns and operates a licensed cannabis dispensary, Urban Pharm, in San Francisco, California. (FAC (Dkt. No. 14) at \u00b6 1.) Since December 2015 Plaintiffs, Goodin and Urban Flowers, Inc., have used the mark URBAN PHARM and the URBAN PHARM SAN FRANCISCO UP &amp; Design Mark (collectively \"the Marks\") in connection with cannabis products and brick-and-mortar and online retail stores for both cannabis and non-cannabis products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.) Plaintiffs have also used the Marks in connection with merchandise, memorabilia, smoking accessories, entertainment services, and online charitable services, as well as online information, education, and resources related to medical cannabis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.) To this end, Plaintiffs have invested substantially in promoting the Marks and have developed substantial goodwill in California and throughout the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) Plaintiffs have developed common law rights in the Marks and own a registered trademark No. 4,992,372 for use in \"apparel, namely hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts, and beanies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Urban Pharm was founded, Plaintiffs registered the domain names: urbanpharm.org, urbanpharmcollective.org, urbanpharmcollective.com, urbanpharmsf.com, urbanpharmsf.org (the \"UP Domains\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14.) Since 2015, Plaintiffs offered Urban Pharm services in connection with the Marks on \"the UP website.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jeffrey Vendley was a member of the Urban Pharm Board of Directors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18.) In late May or early June 2016, Vendley was forced to resign his position on the board and leave Urban Pharm following \"multiple wrongful acts that breached his fiduciary duties and that adversely affected the dispensary and the goodwill associated with the UP Brand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 27) After he was forced to resign, Vendley contacted the domain host for the UP Domains, GoDaddy, and re-registered the UP Domains under this own name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.) As a result, Plaintiffs lost all access and control over the UP Domains and the UP website which caused the website to shut down. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs have not been able to obtain control over the domains, and instead, created a whole new website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Vendley left UP, his authorization to access company computers was terminated and his credentials to the computer system and point of sale (\"POS\") software system were deactivated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) He nevertheless logged into and accessed the POS system following his termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.) The POS system contains trade secrets and sensitive data including patient names, patient contact information, patient medical records, sales data, product markup data, vendor lists, and employee records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A little over two years later, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant Vendley alleging claims for (1) computer fraud and abuse under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., and (2) cybersquatting under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (Dkt. No. 1.) Vendley responded by filing a motion to dismiss or stay under the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   doctrine and motion to strike under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). (Dkt. No. 8.) In response to the motion, Plaintiffs indicated that they intended to file an amended complaint which they did on May 3, 2018. (Dkt. Nos. 12 &amp; 14.) Vendley again moved to dismiss or stay under the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   doctrine. (Dkt. No. 18.) That motion is fully briefed and came before the Court for hearing on June 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The State Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Five months before filing this action, Plaintiffs filed an action in San Francisco Superior Court alleging claims for: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) intentional interference with economic relations; (3) conversion of funds; (4) conversion of domain name; and (5) misappropriation of trade secrets. (Dkt. No. 19-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) These claims are based on Vendley's alleged misappropriation of UP funds and from the hostile and disruptive work environment that he created at UP, as well as Vendley's subsequent \"misappropriat[ion of] UP's trade secrets by logging onto UP's point of sales system without authorization [and take] over of UP's domain registration, shutting down UP's website without authorization.\" (Dkt. No. 19-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 12; 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 16, 2018, Vendley filed a cross-complaint alleging claims for (1) removal of director; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4) conversion; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) declaratory relief; (7) accounting; (8) violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 502 ; and (9) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. No. 19-2.) Shortly thereafter, Vendley suggested that Plaintiffs amend their state court complaint to bring the claims alleged here and agreed that he would waive his right to remove the action to federal court. (Dkt. No. 19 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) Plaintiffs declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) The parties thereafter exchanged initial discovery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-10.)\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    All parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c).

Cal. Nov. 28, 2006) (same). This rationale applies equally here. Resolution of Plaintiffs' state court claims based on the same allegations alleged in this action will resolve the legal question of whether Defendant's conduct amounts to misappropriation and unauthorized use under state law. As such, there is no doubt-let alone substantial doubt-that resolution of the state claims will resolve the federal claims in this action. The Court will nonetheless stay, rather than dismiss this action, so \"that the federal forum will remain open if for some unexpected reason the state forum.... turn[s] out to be inadequate.\"\n    <em>\n     Montanore Minerals Corp. v.

All of the factors here-except for the rule of law factor-weigh in favor of granting a stay or are neutral (in the case of the rem, convenience of the forum, and forum shopping factors).
