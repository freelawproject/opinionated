W.J.L. Was Persistently Bullied as a Student at Altoona Junior High School and AASD Failed to Adequately Respond\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   W.J.L. attended Altoona Junior High School during the 2016-2017 school year as a seventh-grade student. (ECF No. 36 \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the school year, W.J.L. was subjected to \"intense, persistent and malicious bullying\" by other students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The bullying took various forms, including \"ridicule, physical actions, threats of violence and intimidation, emotional trauma, and psychological attacks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The bullying was not limited to school hours nor to school grounds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) W.J.L. was also bullied on social media and while he walked to his father's house after school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   W.J.L. experienced bullying in the presence of both Altoona Junior High faculty and students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) \"It was well known throughout the school that W.J.L. was persistently picked on by his peers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In one instance, W.J.L. was being bullied in a male teacher's classroom and requested to be excused to see the guidance\n   counselor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Instead of permitting W.J.L. to see the guidance counselor, the male teacher responded by telling W.J.L. that he \"needed to stop being a baby.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lansberry alleges that this male teacher directly participated in the bullying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Despite the fact that students and school personnel knew about the severe and persistent bullying that W.J.L. suffered, Defendants failed to take any action to address the issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Furthermore, in violation of school policy, school officials never notified W.J.L.'s parents of the bullying their son experienced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 18, 2017, W.J.L. committed suicide \"after a particularly brutal day of bullying\" at school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Detective Worling of the Altoona Police Department investigated W.J.L.'s suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Detective Worling's Incident Report indicates \"bullying and harassment appeared to be a factor in the suicide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, the investigation was coordinated with AASD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Altoona School District Police conducted a preliminary investigation into W.J.L.'s suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Officer Shields served as Detective Worling's point of contact with the Altoona School District Police. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Shields indicated to Detective Worling that the preliminary investigation found that \"multiple students observed W.J.L. being bullied.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Detective Worling's investigation revealed W.J.L. had sought assistance from school counselors on multiple occasions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Michelle Saylor\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   told Detective Worling about a specific bullying incident that occurred when W.J.L. was a fifth or sixth grade student. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) School administrators never notified W.J.L.'s parents of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The investigation revealed also that another student witnessed W.J.L. crying in the office of an administrator or counselor on the date of his suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Also, a search of W.J.L.'s iPhone and iPad revealed several conversations in the days preceding the suicide in which W.J.L. told other students that he had a desire to harm himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 22, 2017, Detective Worling contacted Officer Shields and requested Altoona Junior High School's security surveillance footage from May 17, 2017 and May 18, 2017. Officer Shields informed Detective Worling that there is no video surveillance for May 17, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) On May 24, 2017, Detective Worling met with Assistant Superintendent Hatch, Principal Mangan, Officer Shields, and others to collect evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) W.J.L.'s locker contents (other than certain personal items returned to W.J.L.'s mother) and pass book for the school hallways were not turned over, despite Detective Worling's requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, on August 30, 2017, Detective Worling was permitted to view video footage from May 18, 2017, but the video footage from other dates was never produced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Detective Worling interviewed students who witnessed W.J.L. enter Guidance Counselor Connell's office on various occasions prior to his suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) One student, K.G., witnessed W.J.L. enter Guidance Counselor Connell's office while \"crying and visibly upset\" three weeks prior\n   to W.J.L.'s suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This was one of two times K.G. witnessed W.J.L. enter Guidance Counselor Connell's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Another student, J.K., witnessed W.J.L. enter Guidance Counselor Connell's office \"roughly two weeks prior to his suicide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Detective Worling interviewed R.G., a student, who confirmed that R.G. told W.J.L. to \"go home and shoot himself\" shortly before W.J.L. committed suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Detective Worling also interviewed three other students - T.B., B.B., and Z.B. - who each witnessed another student, B.C., \"routinely harass W.J.L.\" for \"being a ginger\" and physically assault him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The students told Detective Worling that these incidents visibly upset W.J.L. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   J.K. also witnessed a group of boys physically assault W.J.L. in Stairway H at the Altoona Junior High School on three separate occasions in one week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) These assaults took place approximately three weeks prior to W.J.L.'s suicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) J.K. assisted W.J.L. after the assaults. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) W.J.L. told J.K. that he had informed a teacher, Mrs. Zerbee, of the incidents and that he had also gone to Principal Bogle's office to report the physical assaults, but that ultimately no action was taken. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   AASD held a special public meeting to address W.J.L.'s suicide and bullying issues on May 25, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-31.) At this meeting, AASD acknowledged their bullying and harassment policy was deficient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Superintendent Prijatelj responded to an outraged crowd by saying, \"[y]ou're right. There are issues that need addressed and things that we need to investigate, even though I hate that word. There are things we have to learn about what we do ...\". (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also, at this meeting, AASD voted to hire external counsel to review their policies with a \"focus on student services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) During the meeting, Superintendent Prijatelj offered his condolences to Lansberry's counsel and his staff, mistaking them for the Lansberry family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   AASD held a second public event on April 18, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) At this meeting, a member of AASD's Board of Directors stated that bullying remains a problem at the Altoona Area Junior High. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The board member also acknowledged that AASD received the external policy recommendations from the external counsel it hired, but that these recommendations were \"contained in a thick binder\" that was \"collecting dust\" because the Board of Directors had not reviewed them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Other Students Were Persistently Bullied at Altoona Junior High School and AASD Failed to Adequately Respond\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    a. R.G.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   R.G. was a student who attended Altoona Junior High School who experienced bullying at school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) R.G. was called \"ginger,\" told that \"he ha[d] no soul\" because he is a \"ginger,\" called \"gay,\" and told that he had no friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) R.G.'s parents made several attempts to contact school administrators regarding R.G. being bullied, but school administrators took no action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) School personnel later confirmed to Detective Worling that R.G. was frequently bullied and that school officials took little action in response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The school did not contact R.G.'s parents about the bullying until after they inquired with school officials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Despite school policy to the contrary, the school did not discipline the bullies or contact their parents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    b. J.K.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   J.K. was a student at Altoona Junior High School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) J.K. was bullied\n   and harassed on three occasions by three separate male students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) J.K. reported the incidents to Guidance Counselor Connell but no action was taken against the bullies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And, contrary to school policy, the school did not contact J.K.'s parents or the bullies' parents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    c. An Anonymous Student\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   During the public meeting on May 25, 2017, the mother of an Altoona Junior High School student recounted her daughter's issues with bullying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) The mother stated that her daughter was \"forced to take matters into her own hands\" because school officials never intervened to prevent the bullying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The mother described one instance where bullying caused her daughter to have a \"meltdown.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The teacher responded by mocking her daughter and telling other students to give her \"a round of applause for their [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Oscar winning performance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The mother arrived at the school after her daughter called her during an anxiety attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A school official warned the mother of the consequences of her daughter violating a school rule against cell-phone usage and asked the daughter, \"What? Are you gonna call mommy every time you have an issue?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The mother asked whether the school disciplined the students who bullied her daughter, but administrators would not answer her questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    d. B.R.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B.R. was an Altoona Junior High School student on the autism spectrum who experienced bullying and harassment at school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The first incident occurred on August 8, 2012, when B.R. had her cellphone stolen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The second incident occurred on August 10, 2012, when B.R. was knocked to the ground and had her school identification card stolen by the same individual who stole his cellphone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The third incident occurred in November of 2013, when B.R. was knocked unconscious by another student while walking home with a group of peers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) B.R. reported each of these three incidents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After each report, school officials responded by stating that \"boys will be boys.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, in the spring of 2014, B.R. was bullied in front of a teacher, Mr. McDowell, for wearing a leather jacket and \"My Little Pony\" keychain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When B.R. sought help, Mr. McDowell derided his choice of attire, stating: \"[T]ough guy with a leather jacket and a My Little Pony keychain? What did you think was going to happen?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In February of 2018, B.R.'s bullying resulted in a physical altercation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) School officials punished B.R. rather than the bully. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    e. R.G.K.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   R.G.K. was a student at Altoona Junior High School who suffered from dyslexia and had an Individual Education Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) In November of 2016, R.G.K. submitted a written complaint to Guidance Counselor Starr stating that a male student inappropriately touched R.G.K.'s private areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 17, 2017, R.G.K. experienced a similar incident involving the same male student. R.G.K. reported this incident to a teacher and filed a second written complaint with Guidance Counselor Starr and Principal Bogle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite the written complaint that R.G.K. submitted to school officials, school officials never contacted R.G.K.'s parents and did not take any action against the perpetrator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) School officials did not explain why they failed to take action upon learning about these incidents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   R.G.K.'s mother inquired about these incidents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Her inquiry revealed a widespread lack of knowledge about Title\n   IX among school officials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A school security guard did not know who served as the Title IX coordinator and referred R.G.K.'s mother to Guidance Counselor Starr. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Guidance Counselor Starr did not know who served as the Title IX coordinator and stated that she did not know what Title IX was. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, R.G.K.'s mother met with Principal Bogle and Principal Mangan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Neither of them knew who served as the Title IX coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) R.G.K.'s mother also contacted the AASD Police, who similarly did not have information about the school's Title IX protocol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) R.G.K.'s mother also contacted the offices of Superintendent Prijatlj and Assistant Superintendent Hatch in an attempt to determine who served as the Title IX coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Neither superintendent's secretary knew what Title IX was, who the coordinator was, or the school's Title IX protocol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Eventually, R.G.K.'s mother reached Assistant Superintendent Burlingame, who identified herself as the Title IX coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Assistant Superintendent Burlingame told R.G.K.'s mother that other administrators should have been aware that she serves as the school's Title IX coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Assistant Superintendent Burlingame stated that all school personnel should know the Title IX protocol and that Burlingame should have been \"immediately advised\" about R.G.K.'s assaults. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   R.G.K.'s mother reviewed the 2016-17 Student Code of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) She discovered that school policy requires the placement of red boxes outside the guidance counselor offices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The red boxes are supposed to allow students to relay concerns or seek assistance from a counselor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But, according to R.G.K.'s mother, there were no red boxes in the school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) R.G.K.'s mother asked a secretary in the guidance counselors' office about the red boxes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The secretary told R.G.K.'s mother that there were never red boxes outside the guidance office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Similarly, the Student Code of Conduct provided for a text-message service that students could use to confidentially report issues to administrators. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, the Student Code of Conduct did not provide a phone number to which the students could send messages.

On April 17, 2017, Mike Kazup of the Pennsylvania Department of Education determined that the unwanted touching of R.G.K. constituted child abuse under Pennsylvania law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kazup noted that school personnel are required to report child abuse under 23 PA. CONS. STAT . \u00a7 6311. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36). R.G.K. reported this incident to Guidance Counselor Connell, who was serving as the faculty lunch monitor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Connell told R.G.K. that \"she would be fine\" and took no further action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The next day, on April 12, 2017, R.G.K.'s mother contacted Assistant Superintendent Burlingame regarding this incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) School officials told R.G.K.'s mother that the male student would be moved to another lunchroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) However, the male student was in the same lunchroom the next day and continued to harass R.G.K. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) R.G.K's mother unsuccessfully attempted to contact Assistant Superintendent Hatch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Then, R.G.K.'s mother attempted to contact Sherry Campbell, Director of Special Education, but instead reached her husband, Eighth Grade Principal David Campbell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) R.G.K.'s mother told Principal Campbell that her daughter's situation required immediate action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, Assistant Superintendent Hatch contacted R.G.K.'s mother and told her that the incident resulted from a misunderstanding about changing R.G.K.'s lunchroom arrangements.

However, R.G.K. was prevented from leaving class early the next day and was subjected to more unwanted touching of her private areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, the male student was in the same lunchroom but was removed after R.G.K. complained to the faculty lunch monitor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 20, 2017, the male student once again approached R.G.K. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The male student stood within one foot of R.G.K. and smirked at her but did not touch her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) R.G.K. reported the incident to a teacher and was permitted to go to Guidance Counselor Starr's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After R.G.K.'s mother contacted Superintendent Prijatelj, R.G.K. left school early.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) On June 22, 2018, M.Z. and his friend were approached by a male student who showed them a semiautomatic firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The armed student proceeded to remove the clip to show M.Z. and his friend that the firearm was loaded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The armed student also informed M.Z. and his friend that he \"had a bullet for each\" of them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After this conversation, the armed student proceeded into the school with the loaded firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In a classroom later that day, the armed student again showed M.Z. the firearm and told M.Z. that he \"had bullets for his head.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There was no teacher present nor any cell phone reception in the classroom, which prompted M.Z. to evacuate the classroom where the second incident occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After evacuating the classroom, M.Z. held the door shut on the armed student while another student sought help from school staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The responding teacher initially did not believe M.Z.'s report about the armed student but later determined that M.Z. was telling the truth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The armed student passed the firearm to another student, who escaped the building and attempted to dispose of\n   the firearm in the bushes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Police and a S.W.A.T. team arrived and apprehended the armed student and the student who disposed of the weapon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   AASD Police took a statement from M.Z. without consent from or the presence of a parent or guardian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Assistant Superintendent Hatch was present for M.Z.'s statement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, M.Z.'s parents were not contacted until M.Z.'s counselor from a private company, who happened to be present that day, contacted M.Z.'s mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) M.Z.'s mother retrieved M.Z. from the school upon learning of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Afterwards, M.Z.'s mother constantly inquired about whether the school took disciplinary or legal actions against the threatening students, but never received an update. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) M.Z.'s mother contacted both the Tenth Grade Principal and Assistant Superintendent Hatch regarding M.Z.'s continued exposure to the threatening students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A special education counselor contacted M.Z.'s mother to change M.Z.'s schedule so that M.Z. could avoid the threatening students. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nonetheless, school officials never changed M.Z.'s schedule.

Put differently, the cases are in agreement that students do not have a constitutional right to be free from bullying and harassment from other students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Here, the Court is obligated to reach the same conclusion - Lansberry's Second Amended Complaint does not sufficiently allege the violation of a constitutional right. Lansberry only alleges that AASD officials were deliberately indifferent to W.J.L.'s right to bodily integrity by failing to prevent other students from bullying W.J.L. The Court recognizes that the bullying W.J.L. was subjected to at AASD was appalling and that it created a truly dreadful experience for W.J.L. at Altoona Junior High School. The Court further recognizes that school bullying is a pervasive problem nationally and the possibility that bullying might eventually result, as it did here, in tragic harm to the bullied student. And finally, the Court recognizes that AASD officials have consistently failed to stop bullying and therefore allowed a toxic bullying environment to flourish. If that situation was recognized as a constitutional violation then the ruling of this Court would be contrary to the result of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   However, harm caused by student-on-student bullying is not a constitutional harm that\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   protects against. Regardless their obligations under school policy and the common sense proposition and public expectation that school officials should keep students safe from known risks, AASD officials had no recognized constitutional obligation to protect W.J.L. from his peers. The Fourteenth Amendment right to bodily integrity protects individuals against harm caused by state actors, and not harm caused by third parties. Here, Lansberry does not allege that AASD officials directly violated W.J.L.'s right to bodily integrity. Rather, Lansberry alleges that AASD officials failed to prevent third parties-W.J.L.'s classmates-from violating W.J.L.'s right to bodily integrity. And while the persistent bullying ultimately resulted in W.J.L.'s deciding to take his own life, Lansberry does not allege that any AASD official played a direct role in this tragic decision, or that any AASD official had notice that W.J.L. planned to harm himself. Therefore, AASD officials' failure to intervene before W.J.L.'s suicide does not establish that those same officials violated W.J.L.'s constitutional right to bodily integrity by failing to protect W.J.L. from bullying at school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, because at least some of the bullying occurred after school and through electronic means, it is not clear that AASD officials would have been able to prevent the bullying completely, even if they had exercised extreme diligence in enforcing Altoona Junior High School's anti-bullying policy. Lansberry alleges that a portion of the bullying occurred \"off school property while on his walk to his Father's residence and through social media.\" (ECF No. 36 \u00b6 10.) In his investigation, Detective Worling found messages where other students at Altoona Junior High School sent harassing messages to W.J.L.'s iPhone and iPad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) These messages could have been sent to W.J.L.'s iPhone and iPad after school hours. Thus, it is not clear that AASD officials could have completely prevented the W.J.L.'s bullying, and the harm that it ultimately caused, even if they had aggressively enforced the school's anti-bullying policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Accordingly, the Court is obligated to find that Lansberry does not sufficiently allege the violation of a constitutional right. The Court is sensitive to the tragic situation that the Lansberry family has been forced to endure and strongly condemns the repeated failure of AASD officials to prevent bullying in the time leading up to W.J.L.'s death. The Court also believes that bullied students and their families should have some recourse against school officials who fail to create a safe learning environment and repeatedly fail to protect students from known dangers. However, prior case law does not allow bullied students and their families to hold school officials accountable through constitutional litigation in the federal courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court is obligated to dismiss Lansberry's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
