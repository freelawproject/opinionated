FRIEDRICH, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 1, 2017, a lone gunman fired several hundred rounds of ammunition at a crowd gathered for an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the gunman used multiple \"bump stocks\" in the attack, which increased\n   his rate of fire. In response to this tragedy, the President, Members of Congress, and others urged ATF to reconsider its prior position that a bump stock is not a \"machinegun\" within the meaning of the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA). On December 26, 2018, ATF issued a final rule amending the regulatory definition of \"machinegun\" to include \"bump-stock-type devices.\" As a result, if the rule becomes effective on March 26, 2019, as scheduled, bump stocks will be banned under the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To prevent the rule from taking effect, the plaintiffs-Damien Guedes, the Firearms Policy Coalition, David Codrea, and their co-plaintiffs-filed three motions for a preliminary injunction in which they raised overlapping statutory and constitutional challenges. All of the plaintiffs contend that ATF violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) when it promulgated the rule. Guedes also argues that ATF violated certain procedural requirements in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20926\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which grants the agency rulemaking authority. Codrea further argues that the rule violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. And all of the plaintiffs contend that then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker lacked authority to promulgate the rule under either the Appointments Clause of the Constitution or\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20508\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the AG Act), a succession statute specific to the Office of the Attorney General. Because none of the plaintiffs' arguments support preliminary injunctive relief, the Court will deny all three motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Most of the plaintiffs' administrative law challenges are foreclosed by the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   doctrine, which permits an agency to reasonably define undefined statutory terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron v. Nat. Res. Def. Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Here, Congress defined \"machinegun\" in the NFA to include devices that permit a firearm to shoot \"automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205845\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), but it did not further define the terms \"single function of the trigger\" or \"automatically.\" Because both terms are ambiguous, ATF was permitted to reasonably interpret them, and in light of their ordinary meaning, it was reasonable for ATF to interpret \"single function of the trigger\" to mean \"single pull of the trigger and analogous motions\" and \"automatically\" to mean \"as the result of a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that allows the firing of multiple rounds through a single pull of the trigger.\" ATF also reasonably applied these definitions when it concluded that bump stocks permit a shooter to discharge multiple rounds automatically with a single function of the trigger. That this decision marked a reversal of ATF's previous interpretation is not a basis for invalidating the rule because ATF's current interpretation is lawful and ATF adequately explained the change in interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court also rejects the plaintiffs' procedural challenges. ATF adequately responded to the objections raised by the plaintiffs during the comment period, and ATF was not required to disclose evidence on which it did not rely when it promulgated the rule. Nor did ATF violate \u00a7 926(b) by refusing to hold an oral hearing. Finally, any error ATF may have committed by failing to extend the comment period by five days because of technical glitches was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As for the Takings Clause challenge, the plaintiffs have not shown that preliminary injunctive relief rather than future compensation is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional challenges to Whitaker's authority fare no better. As a statutory matter, the\n   plaintiffs argue that the AG Act requires the Deputy Attorney General to serve as Acting Attorney General when there is a vacancy and that nothing in the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA) empowers the President to change that result. The plain text and structure of both statutes, however, demonstrate that they were intended to coexist: the AG Act provides a line of succession, and the FVRA gives the President discretion to depart from that line, subject to certain limitations met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a constitutional matter, the plaintiffs argue that the Appointments Clause generally requires an acting principal officer to be either the principal officer's first assistant or appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. But that theory is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent and historical practice, both of which have long approved temporary service by non-Senate confirmed officials, irrespective of their status as first assistants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Separately, the plaintiffs argue that the Appointments Clause at a minimum requires the role of an acting principal officer to be filled by an inferior officer and not a mere employee. Whitaker, the plaintiffs contend, was not an officer because the FVRA did not authorize the President to \"appoint\" him and because his role as an acting official was temporary. The Court disagrees. Whitaker's designation under the FVRA was a Presidential appointment. And if the temporary nature of Whitaker's service prevented him from becoming an officer, then the President was not constitutionally obligated to appoint him at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205845\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Congress later passed the FOPA, which generally makes it \"unlawful for any person to transfer or possess\" a newly manufactured \"machinegun,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o), and incorporates the NFA's definition of that term,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(23) (\"The term 'machinegun' has the meaning given such term in ... the National Firearms Act.\"). The FOPA also amended a previous grant of rulemaking authority to provide that \"[t]he Attorney General may prescribe only such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20926\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Rifle Ass'n v.

The key\n   question here is whether the NFA's definition of \"machinegun\" encompasses devices that are colloquially referred to as \"bump stocks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties do not dispute the basic mechanics of standard bump stock devices. A bump stock replaces a semiautomatic rifle's standard stock-the part of the rifle that rests against the shooter's shoulder-and enables the shooter to achieve a faster firing rate. To use a bump stock as intended, the shooter must maintain forward pressure on the barrel and, at the same time, pull the trigger and maintain rearward pressure on the trigger. Once the shooter pulls the trigger, a bump stock helps harness and direct the firearm's recoil energy, thereby forcing the firearm to shift back and forth, each time \"bumping\" the shooter's stationary trigger finger. In this way, the shooter is able to reengage the trigger without additional physical manipulation, though the process may cause small involuntary movements of the trigger finger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ATF first began to regulate bump stocks in 2006 when it determined that the term \"machinegun\" encompassed the \"Akins Accelerator,\" a specific bump stock model with an internal spring that pushed the firearm forward after the shooter pulled the trigger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akins v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/#p198\">\n    312 F. App'x 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam). ATF initially determined in 2002 and again in 2004 that the Akins Accelerator did not qualify as a \"machinegun\" because it did not permit a shooter to discharge multiple rounds with a \"single function of the trigger.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/#p198\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/#p198\">\n    at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the agency reversed course in 2006, when it reinterpreted a \"single function of the trigger\" to mean a \"single pull of the trigger.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/#p198\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/#p198\">\n    at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under that new interpretation, ATF determined that the Akins Accelerator qualified as a \"machinegun\" because the device enabled the shooter to discharge multiple rounds with only one \"pull,\" even though the trigger mechanically reset between rounds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/#p198\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Eleventh Circuit later upheld ATF's decision, reasoning that ATF's interpretation of \"single function of the trigger\" was \"consonant with the [NFA] and its legislative history.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/#p198\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For years, ATF declined to classify as \"machineguns\" other standard bump stock models that did not include an internal spring. 83 Fed.

ATF reasoned that, although standard bump stock devices permit a shooter to discharge multiple rounds with a single function of the trigger, they do not operate \"automatically.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But ATF's interpretation of the term \"automatically\" remained unclear. At times, ATF focused on whether a given bump stock device \"initiate[d] an automatic firing cycle that continue[d] until either the finger [wa]s released or the ammunition supply [wa]s exhausted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66518 (internal quotation marks omitted).

And after ATF issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, President Trump released a memorandum urging the Attorney General, \"as expeditiously as possible, to propose for notice and comment a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66517 (quoting\n   Application of Machinegun to 'Bump Fire' Stocks and Other Similar Devices,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207949\">\n    83 Fed.

Neither definition sheds any light on the key question here: whether, as the plaintiffs argue, a \"single function of the trigger\" means a mechanical act of the trigger, or whether, as ATF argued in the rule, a \"single function of the trigger\" means a single pull of the trigger from the perspective of the shooter. Under the first interpretation, each trigger function ends when the trigger resets.

To be sure, the interpretation offered by the plaintiffs is reasonable. But the same is true of ATF's interpretation. Indeed, in 2009, the Eleventh Circuit upheld ATF's decision to treat Akins Accelerators as machine guns because \"a single application of the trigger by a gunman\"-a single pull-caused the gun with the affixed bump stock to \"fire continuously ... until the gunman release[d] the trigger or the ammunition [wa]s exhausted.\"\n   <em>\n    Akins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/#p198\">\n    312 F.

In support, Guedes cites the Crime Control Act of 1990, which defines \"semiautomatic rifle\" to mean \"any repeating rifle which utilizes a portion of the energy of a firing cartridge to extract the fired cartridge case and chamber the next round, and which requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge.\" Pub.

Although this is a closer question, the Court also concludes that it was reasonable for ATF to determine that a bump stock relieves a shooter of enough of the otherwise necessary manual inputs to warrant the \"automatic\" label. To be sure, a firearm with an affixed bump stock requires\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   manual inputs: the shooter must \"maintain[ ] constant forward pressure with the non-trigger hand on the barrel-shroud or fore-grip of the rifle, and maintain[ ] the trigger finger on the device's extension ledge with constant rearward pressure.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207949\">\n    83 Fed.

But as noted, the definition of \"automatically\" does not mean that an automatic device must operate spontaneously without any manual input.

By comparison, the AG Act's use of the word \"shall\" when listing a\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   -in-line successor provides little reason to adopt a \"disfavored construction\" of an irreconcilable conflict between the two statutes.\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285587,4341260\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/430/\">\n    775 F.3d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Faced with the text and structure of the FVRA and the AG Act, the Coalition cannot argue that the FVRA\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   applies to the Office of the Attorney General. Instead, it argues that the AG Act imposes an exhaustion requirement such that the FVRA applies if and only if none of the successors identified in the AG Act are available. According to the Coalition, this miniscule role for the FVRA explains why, for example, Congress did not list the Office of the Attorney General in \u00a7 3349c, the \"applicability\" provision that excludes certain offices from the FVRA. But the Coalition's interpretation lacks textual support and relies primarily on inapplicable contextual and substantive canons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As evidence of textual support, the Coalition stresses that the FVRA's exclusivity\n   provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203347\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , includes the word \"designates,\" which means to \"choose.\" Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Br. at 28 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   541 (10th ed. 2014) ). According to the Coalition, the FVRA must be inapplicable because the AG Act automatically \"chooses\" the acting official. But the Coalition's own theory proves that the word \"designates\" cannot bear that weight. Under the Coalition's interpretation, the AG Act would always \"designate\" or \"choose\" the First Assistant-or another successor listed in the AG Act-and the FVRA would never apply, even when all of the AG Act successors are unavailable. The Coalition concedes that, at least in those circumstances, the text of the FVRA permits the President to select an Acting Attorney General, but it cannot explain why. The more sensible interpretation of \u00a7 3347 takes into account the \"exclusive ... unless\" structure and recognizes that the FVRA is\n   <em>\n    nonexclusive\n   </em>\n   , but not\n   <em>\n    inapplicable\n   </em>\n   , when read in conjunction with an agency-specific statute, such as the AG Act. The President may elect to fill a vacancy by invoking the FVRA, or, if he fails to do so, the successors listed in the AG Act may serve as Acting Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Coalition also invokes the \"well established canon of statutory interpretation\" that \"the specific governs the general,\"\n   <em>\n    RadLAX Gateway Hotel v.

Each of the statutes imposes unique requirements that provide alternative mechanisms for filling a vacancy. The AG Act establishes a specific order of succession based on title and does not limit the length of time an individual may serve in an acting capacity. By contrast, the FVRA defines eligibility based on other criteria. For example, under the FVRA, a nominee to fill a vacancy is generally prohibited from serving in an acting capacity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203345\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and any individual appointed under \u00a7 3345(a)(3) of the FVRA must have served in the agency for 90 of the preceding 365 days in a position that receives pay equal to or greater than the minimum rate for GS-15 of the General Schedule.

The Coalition argues that \"there is no serious reason Congress would want to permit the President\" to override the AG Act by invoking the FVRA. Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Br. at 30. It further contends that the \"purpose\" of the FVRA was to limit the President's authority to select acting officers, not to expand it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609970\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/929/#p934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And it states that had Congress desired to give the President a choice between two statutory schemes \"it would have done so expressly,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Reply at 18, Dkt. 17, No. 18-cv-2988, or at least indicated as much in some piece of legislative history,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Regardless of the myriad policy reasons that might support or oppose the result here, Congress spoke clearly enough in the text of the FVRA. The exclusivity provision and the statutory history of the FVRA show that Congress understood, when it enacted the FVRA, that it was creating a new vacancies statute with its own allowances and restrictions that would apply to the Office of the Attorney General. Moreover, Congress did discuss this very issue in a Senate Report that accompanied a failed 1998 bill that preceded the FVRA. In considering language similar to the current exclusivity provision, the Report stated that the bill would retain several agency-specific statutes but that \"the Vacancies Act would continue to provide an alternative procedure for temporarily occupying the office.\" S. Rep. No. 105-250, at 17 (1998). The legislative history not only speaks to the issue; it confirms the government's interpretation. Agency-specific statutes like the AG Act were expected to operate alongside the FVRA, not to displace it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Coalition accuses the government of misrepresenting the Senate Report because the cited statement refers to what \"would\" occur if Congress were \"to repeal [agency-specific] statutes in favor of the procedures contained in the Vacancies Act.\" Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Reply at 23 (quoting S. Rep. No. 105-250, at 17 ).

In context, it is clear that the cited statement from the Report refers to the 1998 bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Coalition next cites an introductory section of the Senate Report that refers to a variety of \"express exceptions\" to the FVRA and states that \"current [agency-specific] statutes ... are maintained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The Coalition argues that by referring to these statutes as \"exceptions,\" the Report suggests that the FVRA does not operate alongside agency-specific statutes. Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Reply at 23. But this interpretation does not even comport with the Coalition's own theory, which purports to retain a role for the FVRA if and when the individuals in the AG Act's line of succession are unavailable. Regardless, this general and vague discussion is a weak basis for discounting more specific language in the same Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In passing, the Coalition also mentions that a footnote from a 2001 White House Counsel memorandum adopted the Coalition's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum from Alberto R.

In the government's view, as long as an official performs the duties of a principal office only temporarily, in an acting capacity, the official may do so without actually becoming the principal officer. This understanding, the government argues, is reflected not only in binding Supreme Court precedent but also in the longstanding historical practice of the political branches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Coalition acknowledges the same precedent and history but seeks to explain it in terms of\n   <em>\n    supervision\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Br. at 20-21. According to the Coalition, what matters is not how long the temporary service lasts but who performs it. In the Coalition's view, the Appointments Clause does not permit just any individual to serve, even temporarily, as an acting principal officer. Rather, it permits one specific person to do so: the first assistant who is generally supervised by the principal officer and whose pre-defined job responsibilities include stepping in when the principal officer becomes unavailable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.

It follows, according to the Coalition, that the FVRA becomes unconstitutional if and when the President uses it to displace an available first assistant and directs someone who is neither a first assistant nor a Senate-confirmed appointee to perform the duties of a principal office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   These competing explanations lead to different results in this case because, although Whitaker's service as Acting Attorney\n   General was temporary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whitaker was neither the first assistant to the previous Attorney General nor Senate confirmed at the time of his designation under the FVRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Important as this debate may be, it has long been settled by Supreme Court precedent and historical practice.

But to the extent\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   involved a first assistant at all, it involved one only in the most superficial and formalistic sense. Eaton was a missionary with no evident prior government experience who was sworn in as vice consul for the sole and express purpose of assuming the consul general's duties when the consul left for America less than a month later. There is no hint in the Court's decision that Eaton was ever subjected to the consul general's direction or control, or that the potential for such supervision played any role in the Court's analysis.

This \"unlimited\" authority, granted at such an \"early day in the\n   history of the federal constitution,\" was considered \"safely ... entrusted to [the President]\" not because it was subject to unspecified further limits under the Appointments Clause but because the President was \"in the daily exercise of higher and much more important powers\" and could therefore be trusted to fill temporary vacancies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1857%20WL%204155\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Eventually, Congress did set limits on whom the President could appoint as an acting principal. But even then, it did not require the President to choose the first assistant. In 1863, Congress narrowed the President's options from \"any person,\" Act of May 8, 1792, \u00a7 8, 1 Stat. at 281, to any department head or \"other officer\" whose \"appointment is vested in the President,\" Act of Feb. 20, 1863, ch. 45, \u00a7 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Stat.%20656\">\n    12 Stat. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 656.

And for the first time, Congress provided that the first assistant would automatically perform the duties of the department head in the event of a vacancy.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1. But like its predecessors, the Vacancies Act still authorized the President to choose someone other than the first assistant if he wished, specifically, any department head or other Senate-confirmed officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   This new pool of already-confirmed candidates may have been narrow, but the Coalition's theory cannot explain it. Although an officer's prior appointment may have been important to Congress, it would have been irrelevant for purposes of the Appointments Clause unless the officer's new acting duties were somehow \"germane to the office[ ] already held.\"\n   <em>\n    Shoemaker v.

That would plainly not be the case for department heads tapped to lead other, unrelated departments, which the Vacancies Act expressly allowed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of July 23, 1868, \u00a7 3, 15 Stat. at 168. Nor could the President's authority to direct department heads to lead other departments be explained in terms of supervision or pre-existing duties. By definition, a department head is not supervised by anyone but the President. And the remote possibility of filling in for a fellow principal officer at the President's request cannot plausibly be considered one of the routine responsibilities of leading a department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Over the next 130 years, Congress made minor adjustments to the President's temporary appointment authority, for the most part expanding the length of acting service.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Act of Feb. 6, 1891, ch. 113,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20Stat.%20733\">\n    26 Stat. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 733 (extending ten-day limit to thirty days); Presidential Transitions Effectiveness Act, Pub.

When chief clerks sought compensation for their acting service in federal court, the resulting decisions made clear that the position of Acting Secretary was viewed neither as a continuation of the chief clerk's duties as chief clerk nor as an appointment to become the Secretary, but as a unique and temporary office that arose solely from the President's exercise of discretionary authority under the relevant vacancy statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1857%20WL%204155\">\n    1857 WL 4155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4.

Moreover, the contemporaneous justification for this accepted practice was found not in the role of chief clerk but in the role of Acting Secretary and its temporary nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Given this understanding, it is no surprise that Presidents frequently looked beyond chief clerks to fill temporary vacancies. Indeed, they regularly designated other cabinet members and department heads as acting principal officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Designating an Acting Attorney General\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206131923\">\n    2018 WL 6131923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (reporting that during the Washington, Adams, and Jefferson Administrations, other cabinet members and Chief Justice John Marshall \"were used as temporary or 'ad interim' officials\"); Letter from James Buchanan, President of the United States, to the Senate of the United States (Jan. 15, 1862), in 5\n   <em>\n    A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents 1789-1902\n   </em>\n   , at 3191 (James D.

Doctrinally, it relies on the premise that first assistants are \"generally\" supervised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Firearm Pol'y Coal.'s Br. at 4, 21. By that, the Coalition appears to mean that they are supervised before and after they serve as acting principal officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that is just another way of stating that they are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   supervised during the one window that counts: when carrying out their acting appointment. Although a loose form of ongoing supervision might be said to apply when the principal officer is merely ill or absent, surely any such supervision ceases when the principal officer dies or resigns. Perhaps in these situations the next principal is able to exercise a form of retroactive supervision by ratifying or rejecting the acting official's actions after the fact. But if such anticipated, backward-looking supervision could cure a first assistant's temporary service, it could cure anyone's. It therefore provides no basis for distinguishing first assistants from any other person approved for acting service under the FVRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Coalition's position admits of exceptions that lack a coherent or persuasive justification. For example, the Coalition appears to accept that the President can displace an available first assistant with any Senate-confirmed official,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, but it does not explain how that can be the case when the officer's previous position was not \"germane\" to his new, acting duties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shoemaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565758\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/147/282/#p301\">\n    147 U.S. at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565758\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/147/282/#p301\">\n    13 S.Ct. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a prior appointment cannot justify the performance of new responsibilities \"dissimilar to, or outside the sphere of\" an officer's previous \"official duties\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the Coalition appears to suggest that the President may ignore the Appointments Clause altogether if the first assistant is unavailable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Br. at 4,\n   12, 25-26 n.2. But, again, it is not clear why. If the legal fiction justifying the first assistant's temporary service is that the temporary service is merely a continuation of the first assistant's existing inferior office,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4, that justification vanishes once the President chooses some other subordinate in the same department whose predefined job responsibilities cannot realistically be stretched to include stepping in as the acting principal in the event of a vacancy. The Coalition suggests that the unavailability of the first assistant triggers an \"exigency\" that excuses what would otherwise be a constitutional violation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26 n.2, but the Court is hesitant to embrace a freestanding \"exigency\" exception with no basis in the constitutional text.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Coalition insists that adopting the government's interpretation will wreak havoc on the Separation of Powers,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, but the Court is not persuaded.

Whitaker's temporary service as the Acting Attorney General satisfies that test.

First, it argues that the text of the FVRA authorizes the President to \"direct\" an individual to serve in an acting capacity but does not authorize the President to \"appoint\" that individual to become an inferior officer. Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Br. at 17-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, it argues that an employee can never be \"appointed\" to serve in an acting capacity because an acting position is temporary and an officer must hold a permanent position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Neither argument is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Assuming without deciding that Whitaker was an employee before his designation and that an employee's service as Acting Attorney General first requires an appointment, the FVRA authorized such an appointment and the President carried it out. As Justice Thomas recently explained, at the time of the framing, \"the verb 'appoint' meant 'to establish anything by decree' or 'to allot, assign, or designate.' \"\n   <em>\n    SW Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609970\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/929/#p934\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Thomas, J., concurring) (alterations adopted and internal citations omitted).

It stressed that in the first set of statutes, Congress used the term \"appoint,\" but in \"[t]he sections of the UCMJ relating to military judges,\" it \"sp[oke] explicitly and exclusively in terms of 'detail' or 'assign'; nowhere in these sections [wa]s mention made of a separate appointment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"This difference negate[d] any permissible inference that Congress intended that military judges should receive a second appointment, but in a fit of absentmindedness forgot to say so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232514\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/163/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Coalition seizes on this case to argue that the FVRA does not permit the appointment of an acting official because Congress did not use the word \"appoint\" in the FVRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Br. at 18-19; Firearms Pol'y Coal.'s Reply at 5. But the discussion in\n   <em>\n    Weiss\n   </em>\n   turned on the specific text of various military statutes and placed particular weight on the\n   use of the words \"assigned\" and \"detailed,\" neither of which are at issue here. Moreover, the question in\n   <em>\n    Weiss\n   </em>\n   was whether Congress intended to impose an additional appointment requirement on military judges, not whether a statute designed to permit such appointments failed because it lacked certain magic words. Congress clearly contemplated that the FVRA would confer appointment authority on the President, and its use of the word \"direct\" was sufficient to confer that authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The Coalition's separate argument that Whitaker cannot be an inferior officer because his duties are only temporary fails for a more elementary reason: if the temporary nature of Whitaker's duties prevented him from becoming an officer, then the temporary nature of his duties also prevented him from needing an appointment at all-under the FVRA or otherwise. The Coalition relies primarily on\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court explained that \"an individual must occupy a 'continuing' position established by law to qualify as an officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2051.

In any event, Eaton makes clear that the temporary nature of acting duties cures any constitutional problem; it does not create one. To the extent the Coalition contends that officers must hold permanent positions and that there is no exception for acting principal officers, then acting officials are not officers and Whitaker did not need to be appointed at all.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206313534\">\n    2018 WL 6313534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 n.11 (\"[T]he Supreme Court's delineation of constitutional 'Officer' characteristics suggests that an 'Acting' official could be considered a 'lesser functionar[y]' employee for which 'the Appointments Clause cares not a whit about who named them.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2051 ) ).
