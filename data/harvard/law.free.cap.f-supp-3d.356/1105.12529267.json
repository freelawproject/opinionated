For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS the Government's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States brought this action seeking to revoke the citizenship of Mr. Zazi. Mr. Zazi is a naturalized American citizen, originally from Afghanistan. According to the Government's Complaint, prior to naturalizing, Mr. Zazi committed multiple acts that rendered him ineligible for naturalization pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201427\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), which requires a person seeking to obtain United States citizenship to show good moral character during the requisite five-year period preceding application for naturalization through the time of admission to citizenship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Specifically, the Government alleges Mr. Zazi failed to comply with this statutory prerequisite for naturalization, rendering his certificate of naturalization \"illegally procured,\" because he provided false statements and testimony on immigration benefits applications submitted to the United States and at interviews in support of these applications. The United States also asserts that Mr. Zazi committed crimes for which he had not been arrested or convicted at the time he provided representations and testimony in support of his citizenship application. According to the Government, each of these acts rendered Mr. Zazi ineligible to naturalize under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201427\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).

In the Form 1-130, Mr. Zazi falsely represented\n   that his nephew was, in fact, his biological son\n   <em>\n    (id.\n   </em>\n   Part A. 1).

According to the indictment, Mr. Zazi previously had caused to be filed a Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition on behalf of his nephew that also falsely represented his nephew was his biological son (Dkt. # 1-2 at 2), and that he also caused his attorney to file two affidavits in support of the Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition, in which two affiants attested they were friends of Mr. Zazi, and they had personal knowledge that Mr. Zazi's nephew was his biological son because they were present at his birth (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   11.

At the beginning of the naturalization interview, Mr. Zazi took an oath or affirmed he would answer all questions truthfully.

Mr. Zazi committed the fraudulent acts of which he was later convicted prior to the time that he filed his N-400 form, prior to his appearance for his naturalization interview, and during the statutory period where he was required to demonstrate \"good moral character\" in connection with his application for naturalization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   26.

The One Factual Allegation challenged by Mr. Zazi.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mr. Zazi, in his Opposition (Dkt. # 31), disputes only one factual assertion made by the Government. Specifically, Mr. Zazi takes issue with the Government's assertion that at Mr. Zazi's naturalization interview, \"the USCIS interviewing Officer asked [Mr. Zazi] Question 15 on Part 10.D. In response, Defendant confirmed his written response that he had never committed a crime or offense for which he was not arrested\" (Dkt. # 31 at 1-2). Mr. Zazi disputes that the Government has established that this specific oral question and answer exchange occurred at the naturalization interview, pointing out that the only document which states that this question was asked orally is an affidavit by special Agent John Fiordalis (Dkt. # 1-1, mV.A.3-4), who was not present at the interview conducted by Adjudicating Officer Florentina Preda. Thus, per Mr. Zazi, there is no admissible evidence in the record from which the Court could appropriately conclude that Question 15 was asked or answered in the manner articulated in Fiordalis' affidavit. The Government cites to cases recognizing a standard practice on the part of immigration officers to annotate the naturalization application during interviews with check marks next to questions that were orally verified with the applicant. But what may have been established in other cases, has not yet been established in this case, especially without an affidavit of someone with personal knowledge of the specific procedures used by Mr. Zazi's interviewer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court agrees that this alleged fact is disputed, and does not rely on it in making its decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
