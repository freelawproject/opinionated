(\"Alliance\") and Hamilton County Coal, LLC (\"Hamilton\"), alleging violations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the \"WARN Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Leeper alleges that Defendants violated his rights and a class of similarly situated persons' rights under the WARN Act by failing to provide timely notice to workers who suffered an employment loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Leeper was a full-time employee of Hamilton (Doc. 136-3, p. 27).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hamilton is a subsidiary of Alliance (Doc. 153, p. 24; Doc. 153-2, p. 5-6). Leeper specifically worked at the Hamilton County Coal Mine # 1, which is an underground mining complex located near the city of Dahlgren in Hamilton County, Illinois (Doc. 37, p. 3; Doc. 136-3, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During a meeting held on February 5, 2016, Hamilton delivered written notice to 158 full-time employees stating that \"due to operational considerations,\" the employees\n   would be placed on a \"temporary layoff for the period commencing on February 6, 2016 and ending on August 1, 2016 (\"Layoff Period\").\" (Doc. 71-2, p. 7). Hamilton explained that \"[o]n August 1, 2016, [the employees] may return to [their] at-will employment with Hamilton County Coal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The written notice further advised that \"[d]uring the Layoff Period, and beginning effective February 6, 2016, [the employees] will not be employed by Hamilton County Coal\" and \"are free to pursue other endeavors ... [the employees] will receive additional information related to any separation benefits to which [they] may be entitled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Along with this notice, employees received a document entitled \"Frequently Asked Questions Concerning the Temporary Layoffs\" (\"FAQs\") (Doc. 71-2, p. 9). This document stated that \"[a] temporary layoff is treated as a termination of employment for purposes of wages and benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It explained, among other things, that the employees' health care coverage would end, an advance would be withheld from their final paycheck (if they elected to receive a pay advance), disability benefits would end, life insurance would end, and accrued and unused vacation days would be paid out in a lump sum (Doc. 71-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The employees were also given a pamphlet setting forth their rights regarding unemployment benefits (Doc. 153-1, p. 14-17) and a contact form to fill out so Hamilton could reach the employees for return to work purposes (Doc. 71-2, p. 19; Doc. 71-2, p. 3; Doc. 71-4, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Less than six months later, by August 1, 2016, 61 full-time employees had returned to work at Hamilton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of those employees, 56 employees returned to their prior wages, and 5 employees returned to work at reduced wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These employees were not required to submit applications for employment, nor where they required to interview for their positions (Doc. 71-2, p. 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sixteen full-time employees voluntarily declined the opportunity to return to work, and one employee was discharged for cause because he tested positive during a drug screen. Out of all 158 full-time employees that received the notice, 80 employees did not receive offers to return to work within six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 8, 2016, Leeper filed this lawsuit on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals alleging that Defendants failed to provide a \"60-day advanced notice of a 'mass layoff' of nearly 200 employees that occurred at its Hamilton County Coal Mine # 1 on February 5, 2016\" in violation of the WARN Act (Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1). Leeper alleges that Defendants instead provided less than twenty-four hours' notice that they were terminating their employment and that all benefits would cease as of the date of termination (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On January 4, 2017, Leeper filed an Amended Complaint, alleging an alternative theory that Defendants' actions on February 6, 2016 constituted a mass layoff because the employees experienced a reduction in hours of work of more than 50% during each month between February 6, 2016 and August 6, 2016 (Doc. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Leeper's First Amended Class Action Complaint brings claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), 23(b)(1), 23(b)(3), and 23(c)(4), and the WARN ACT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). On March 21, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 71) and a preemptive Motion to Oppose Plaintiff's Proposed Class Certification or to Stay Class Certification Pending Resolution of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 72). On March 27, 2018, Leeper filed a Motion to Certify Class (Doc. 82) seeking to certify the following classes and subclasses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Class 1\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   All persons: (a) to whom Hamilton delivered the form letter attached hereto as Exhibit 14; or (b) whose employment at the Complex was terminated without cause within 90 days of February 6, 2016, without 60-days' advance written notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Subclass 1\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   All persons: (a) in Class 1(a) who: (i) did not work at the Complex between February 6, 2016 and August 6, 2016; or (ii) were rehired at the Complex between February 6, 2016, and August 6, 2016, at a salary or regular hourly wage less than the person's salary or regular hourly wage at the Complex as of February 5, 2016; or (iii) were rehired at the Complex between February 6, 2016, and August 6, 2016, but worked fewer hours per week than the person's hours per week worked at the Complex as of February 5, 2016; or (b) in Class 1(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Class 2\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   All persons who: (a) are in Subclass 1; or (b) experienced a reduction in hours of work at the Hamilton County Coal Mine # 1 Complex of more than 50 percent during each month of the 6-month period between February 6 and August 6, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Doc. 82, p. 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 22, 2018, Defendants filed another Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 136). On that same date, Leeper also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 138). On August 7, 2018, Leeper filed a Motion to Amend Proposed Class Definitions (Doc. 157), seeking to amend the class definitions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Class 1 (the \"Termination Class\")\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The 182 persons identified on the list attached hereto as Exhibit ___, to whom Defendant Hamilton delivered the RIF Notice on February 5, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Class 2 (the \"Reduction in Hours and Termination Class\")\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The 165 persons identified on the list attached hereto as Exhibit ___, to whom Defendant Hamilton delivered the RIF Notice on February 5, 2016, and:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (A) who were not on leave for disability or workers' compensation as of February 5, 2016 and were offered reemployment starting August 1, 2016;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (B) to whom Defendant issued form letters dated July 26, 2016 stating that they were not going to be rehired beginning August 1, 2016, or whom Defendants rehired between February\n   5 and July 31, 2016, at a lower wage than as of February 5, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Doc. 157).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Leeper asserts that Defendants' actions with respect to Leeper and the Class 1 Members constituted a \"mass layoff\" because 182 full-time employees experienced an employment loss by way of a termination under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A). Leeper alternatively argues that Defendants' actions constituted a \"mass layoff\" with respect to Leeper and the Class 2 Members because 165 employees experienced a termination or reduction in hours of work of more than 50 percent during each month of the six-month period between February 6 and August 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On August 13, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the motions (Doc. 160) and took the motions under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    PRELIMINARY MATTER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court must first address the order in which to resolve the various motions. Generally, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require courts to rule on the issue of class certification \"at an early practicable time,\" which is usually before deciding any merits questions. FED. R. CIV. P. 23(c). The Seventh Circuit has acknowledged, however, that there are situations where it might be appropriate to rule on summary judgment prior to addressing class certification.\n   <em>\n    Cowen v.

But 'usually' is not 'always,' and 'practicable' allows for wiggle room.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At the hearing, defense counsel asked the Court to take up the motions for summary judgment prior to the motion for class certification. \"In moving for summary judgment before the motion for class certification has been resolved, the defendant loses the advantage of a judgment that has preclusive effect against all putative suitors but saves the heavy expense of defending against a class action.\"\n   <em>\n    McCarter v.

Specifically, Leeper argues that the employment loss he and the proposed class suffered was a\n   <em>\n    termination\n   </em>\n   as set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A).

If the Court finds that the undisputed facts show that the employment loss was a termination, then the termination was effective as of February 6, 2016, it affected all 158 full-time employees, and the subsequently rehired employees do not change that conclusion. If the Court finds that the undisputed facts show that the employment loss suffered was a layoff then, as Defendants argue, the layoff did not exceed six months, because 61 full-time employees returned to work within the six-month period (56 were fully restored to pre-layoff wages and 5 returned to work at reduced wages).

Thus, the Court must look to whether it was a termination involving the \"permanent cessation of the employment relationship\" or a temporary layoff involving the \"temporary cessation of that relationship.\" Of the 158 employees that received the written notice, 56 were fully restored to pre-layoff wages within six months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, there was no permanent cessation of the employment relationship as to these 56 employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rifkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94729\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1277/#p1282\">\n    78 F.3d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (\"An employee cannot be defined as 'terminated' if he or she is, in fact, rehired in the same position.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because 56 of the 158 full-time employees who received the written notice returned to work within six months, Leeper cannot establish that more than 33 percent of the 315 full-time employees experienced an employment termination.

This differs from a situation in which employers could string workers along by continuing to regularly occupy their time while significantly reducing their work hours on an indefinite basis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Subsection (C) also would encompass a layoff exceeding 5 \u00bd months, but falling short of 6 months, which many of the employees experienced in this case. That is because the moment the layoff exceeds 5 \u00bd months, the employee would have experienced a reduction in work hours of more than fifty percent in each month of a six-month period. Thus, if the Court construes the statute as Leeper suggests, employers would be told under subsection (B) that they need to give advanced notice under the WARN Act of a layoff expected to exceed six months, and they would have to read between the lines to learn under subsection (C) that they\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    need to give advanced notice under the WARN Act for a layoff expected to exceed 5 \u00bd months. The Court does not believe that Congress intended the WARN Act to operate in such a manner.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Section 2101(b)(1) provides: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any person who is an employee of the seller (other than a part-time employee) as of the effective date of the sale shall be considered an employee of the purchaser immediately after the effective date of the sale.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The Court grants this motion only to the extent it relies upon the revised and corrected numbers as argued by counsel and agreed to by both sides at the hearing on August 13, 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
