Specifically,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018041\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provides \"[n]othing in this title shall be construed to preempt any State\n   law that does not prevent the application of the provisions of this title.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant further contends the evidence it produced conclusively establishes that the plans it offers are controlled by federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To support this proposition, Defendant points to its Marketplace Choice Bronze Plan, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Your covered services include essential health benefits as required by the Affordable Care Act.... The Affordable Care Act provides certain rules for essential health benefits.

As set forth above, \"the presence of a federal question ... in a defensive argument does not overcome the paramount policies embodied in the well-pleaded complaint rule-that the plaintiff is the master of the complaint, that a federal question must appear on the face of the complaint, and that the plaintiff may, by eschewing claims based on federal law, choose to have the cause heard in state court....\"\n   <em>\n    Caterpillar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    482 U.S. at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court further finds Defendant's \"Greatest of Three\" rule proposition without merit. Under the Greatest of Three rule, an insurer is required to pay an out-of-network provider of emergency services the highest rate according to the following three measures: (1) the median in-network rate; (2) the rate \"calculated using the same method the plan generally uses to determine payments for out-of-network services;\" or (3) the Medicare rate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202590.715\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590.715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -2719A(b)(3)(A)-(C). As Plaintiffs correctly argue, the Greatest of Three rule was enacted by the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services. Of significance, those agencies recently noted the Greatest of Three rule does not preempt state law. As the agencies explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Under the GOT [Greatest of Three] regulation, the three prongs work together to establish a floor on the payment amount for out-of-network emergency services, and each state generally retains authority to set higher amounts for health insurance issued within the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As such, the Court finds further support for its determination that the Affordable Care Act was not enacted to preempt state law. Therefore, the Court finds that the doctrine of complete preemption is not applicable to the matter now before the Court. In the Court's view, Defendant has attempted to assert a federal preemption defense, therein attempting to form the basis of federal question jurisdiction. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion to Remand is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as it relates to issue of preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Doctrine of Substantial Federal Question Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under the substantial federal question doctrine, \"the question is, does a state-law claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial,\n   which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v.

Fifth Circuit precedent holds that \"federal question jurisdiction exists where (1) resolving a federal issue is necessary to resolution of the state-law claim; (2) the federal issue is actually disputed; (3) the federal issue is substantial; and (4) federal jurisdiction will not disturb the balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Singh v.

As set forth above, \"[u]nder the [Greatest of Three] regulation, the three prongs work together to establish a floor on the payment amount for out-of-network emergency services, and each state generally retains authority to set higher amounts for health insurance issued within the state.\" As noted by Plaintiff, that is exactly what the Texas Legislature has done; it has decided to require Health Maintenance Organizations to protect their insureds by paying out-of-network providers for their services at the usual and customary rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At any rate,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018041\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provides that \"[n]othing in this title shall be construed to preempt any State law that does not prevent the application of the provisions of this title.\" A review of the Texas Insurance Code Section at issue indicates that it abides by the requirements of federal law-it simply does not prevent the application of Affordable Care Act. Accordingly, the Court is of the opinion Defendant fails to satisfy the first requirement necessary to invoke the doctrine of substantial federal question jurisdiction. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the alternative, the Court further finds Defendant fails to satisfy the remaining three elements necessary to invoke the doctrine of substantial federal question jurisdiction. First, Defendant has failed to establish that a federal issue is actually at dispute. A review of the briefing submitted guides the Court to conclude that Defendant has failed to establish a dispute as to the federal issue it attempts to raise, the Greatest of Three rule. Further, the Court is of the opinion that Defendant has attempted to establish, in a rather conclusory fashion, the existence of a substantial federal interest. The Court finds the four reasons Defendant asserts to support its proposition of the existence of a substantial federal issue unpersuasive. Last, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs assertion that \"insurance is an area of law that the federal government has largely left to the states to regulate.\" Pl.'s Mot. to Remand p. 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that exercising jurisdiction of Plaintiffs' state law claims would disturb the balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities. Therefore, Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand is further\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   on the grounds that Defendant has failed to satisfy the remaining elements necessary to invoke the doctrine of substantial federal question jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Defendant has failed to satisfy its burden of showing\n   that federal jurisdiction exists and that removal was proper.
