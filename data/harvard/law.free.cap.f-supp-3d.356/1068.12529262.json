PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This slip and fall negligence action arises out of an injury sustained by Plaintiff Jennifer Trujillo (\"Ms. Trujillo\") while at a Wal-Mart store in Puyallup, Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 6, 2017, Ms. Trujillo filed a complaint in the Pierce County Superior Court for the State of Washington. Dkt. 1-2. Ms. Trujillo asserts a negligence action as a business invitee of Wal-Mart.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . On November 2, 2017, Wal-Mart removed the action to this Court. Dkt. 1. On September 12, 2018, Wal-Mart moved for summary judgment. Dkt. 23. On October 15, 2018, Ms. Trujillo responded. Dkt. 27. On October 18, 2018, Wal-Mart replied.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 6, 2015, Ms. Trujillo was at the Wal-Mart store shopping for groceries with her family when she slipped and fell in the soup aisle. Dkt. 27 at 3-4. Ms. Trujillo testified that while shopping in the soup aisle, she walked around an abandoned shopping cart that was in her way. Dkt. 27-1, Declaration of John Acken (\"Acken Decl.\"), Ex. 13 (Deposition of Jennifer Trujillo (\"Trujillo Depo.\") at 43).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that the cart contained merchandise, but that she could not identify the items.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After walking around the cart, she slipped and fell in water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She did not see the water on the floor before falling in it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. Ms. Trujillo testified that she knew she fell in water because it was clear and on her clothes, her feet, and the floor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wal-Mart's incident report confirms the presence of water on the floor. Acken Decl., Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Wal-Mart surveillance video leading up to Ms. Trujillo's fall shows six Wal-Mart employees walking past the shopping cart, and a customer moving the shopping cart a short distance down the aisle. Acken Decl., Ex. 12 at 43-44. Ms. Trujillo also observed a young male employee in the area stocking shelves. Dkt. 25, Declaration of Colin J. Troy (\"Troy Decl.\"), Ex. 1, Trujillo Depo. at 43. After she fell, this employee came and cleaned up the water with paper towels.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-57. Micah Roth (\"Mr. Roth\"), Store Manager on the day of the incident, submitted a declaration informing the Court that this Wal-Mart did not \"stock, store, or sell water\" in the canned soup aisle. Dkt. 26, Declaration of Micah Roth (\"Roth Decl.\") at 1. Mr. Roth declared that this Wal-Mart has many policies and procedures focused on prevention of slip and fall accidents, and that \"Wal-Mart employees at Store #2403 visually inspect the floor constantly while they are working for the purpose of identifying and remediating potential hazards, including spilled items.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Mr. Roth also declared that at this Wal-Mart, if an employee notices a foreign substance or hazard on the floor, \"the employee remains by the substance until a cone is placed or until the substance is cleaned up,\" and affirms that these policies were in place on September 6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wal-Mart's Safety Toolkit instructs employees that they should \"return empty shopping carts to the front\" and not \"leave carts unattended on the salesfloor.\" Acken Decl., Ex. 6. Mr. Roth testified at his deposition that this cart\n   policy is to \"keep the store neat and clean ... to keep it neat and clean and free of hazards, I guess.\" Acken Decl., Ex. 11 at 37. Mr. Roth also declared that the store employs maintenance associates specifically tasked with store cleanliness, including floor maintenance, and affirmed that a maintenance associate was working on September 6. Roth Decl. at 2. Finally, Mr. Roth declared that the canned soup aisle \"was not in the direct vicinity of the produce department, self-checkout stations, or any other areas that may create a heightened risk of spilled items.\" Roth Decl. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Trujillo was seventeen weeks pregnant at the time of her fall, and sought medical attention for left knee pain which radiated to her hip and lower leg.

Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is proper only if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The Court must resolve any factual issues of controversy in favor of the nonmoving party only when the facts specifically attested by that party contradict facts specifically attested by the moving party.

The circumstances described in\n   <em>\n    Pimentel\n   </em>\n   are referred to as the 'self-service exception,' and require the jury to determine \"whether the proprietor has taken all reasonable precautions necessary to protect his invitees from these foreseeable risks.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20P.2d%20888\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wal-Mart moves for judgment, arguing that Ms. Trujillo failed to establish Wal-Mart had actual or constructive notice of the water, and the self-service exception does not apply. Dkt. 23 at 1, 7. Ms. Trujillo makes a number of counterarguments, including that notice should be inferred because of Wal-Mart's spoliation of video evidence. Dkt. 27 at 2. Because Ms. Trujillo presents evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude her case satisfies the self-service exception, the Court denies Wal-Mart's motion on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

She argues Wal-Mart had constructive notice of the water, or that Wal-Mart and its associates caused the unsafe condition. Dkt. 27 at 13.

Dkt. 27 at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   , 75 Wash.3d at 397-98 ). However, as Wal-Mart points out, the housekeeping practices in\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   were assessed in the context of an item from the store's own display, and here, Ms. Trujillo has not provided evidence to show the water came from a Wal-Mart display or otherwise resulted from Wal-Mart's operations such that Wal-Mart should have been aware of it.

Dkt. 27 at 3-4 (citing Acken Decl., Ex. 11 at 37-38). Ms. Trujillo argues \"there is sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Wal-Mart and its associates caused the unsafe condition, and that based on the facts and circumstances surrounding Trujillo's fall, Wal-Mart associates should have discovered the dangerous condition in its aisle.\" Dkt. 27 at 13. Ms. Trujillo does demonstrate that six Wal-Mart employees walked past the cart, Acken Decl., Ex. 12 at 43-44, but presents no evidence other than the circumstantial evidence of the presence of water on the floor near the cart to suggest water came from the cart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Circumstantial evidence in the record could support an inference that the water came from merchandise in the cart. The surveillance tape shows at least fifty-four minutes of activity in the soup aisle prior to Ms. Trujillo's fall, including six Wal-Mart employees passing the cart. Dkt. 27 at 6-7. Neither party argues anything in the video suggests a source of water during that period other than items in the cart. It is possible the water was concealed by the cart until the customer walking past pushed the cart further down the aisle, Acken Decl., Ex. 12 at 43-44, but it is similarly possible that some liquid dislodged in the cart and spilled when the customer, the last person to pass through the aisle before Ms. Trujillo, pushed it. Dkt. 27 at 14. Even considering this circumstantial evidence, Ms. Trujillo has not met her burden to provide specific evidence from which a jury could evaluate whether any of the six employees actually passed a cart at a time when water was near it such that they could have discovered it.\n   <em>\n    Wiltse,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1376187\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/116/452/#p458\">\n    116 Wash.2d at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=805%20P.2d%20793\">\n    805 P.2d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, if Wal-Mart enacts a policy stating that safety cones should be located in certain areas as preventative maintenance, then an injured plaintiff can identify the policy as a concession that Wal-Mart considers that particular location as one where unsafe conditions are reasonably foreseeable. Such an implicit rule could influence self-service operations to forgo safety policies in anticipation of potential litigation. Thus, the Court invites a subsequent\n   motion on this issue if additional evidence exists to establish that this particular spill was not reasonably foreseeable in this particular area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Linehan v.

Moreover, Wal-Mart may be able to establish that it is unreasonable to infer from the cited policy that water spills were reasonably foreseeable in this aisle.

Ms. Trujillo does not explain how much additional surveillance from earlier in the day would be required to adequately demonstrate the points she wishes to make, or whether the additional surveillance would have been expected to show a different camera angle, making it difficult for the Court to evaluate the degree of prejudice she may experience. The first two points, whether employees were performing safety sweeps or performing them correctly, could likely be developed through cross examination of Wal-Mart representatives about the behavior of the six employees who walked past the abandoned cart in the available footage. For the third and fourth points, the length of time water was on the floor and the length of time the cart was abandoned, earlier video footage may not provide much additional relevant information, particularly if Ms. Trujillo's theory is that the water came from the cart. On the available record, the Court reasons that the degree of prejudice Ms. Trujillo would experience may be minimal. Further, Ms. Trujillo appears to request a sanction of a rebuttable presumption that she has satisfied the requirement to prove notice. Dkt. 27 at 20-21.
