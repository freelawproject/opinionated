RUSSELL, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action arises out of a pileup on March 31, 2012, involving multiple vehicles. The underlying tort liability of the various participants is the subject of multiple federal and state court actions and certain of the involved persons have settled their claims. National Casualty Company filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the limits of its liability under a policy of insurance issued to Defendant Western Express. Presently before the Court are three motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff National Casualty argues that based on the language of the Policy its liability is limited to $1,000,000 and further seeks a declaration that its limits of coverage were exhausted by the settlement of certain claims arising from the accident and thus it has no further obligation thereunder (Doc. No. 90). Defendants Butler, Cardenas, Chmil, Crittenden, Factor, Fisher, and Ori (hereinafter \"injured-party Defendants\") responded in opposition to the motion and filed their own motion seeking a declaration that the Policy issued by Plaintiff provides the full amount of coverage for each person injured or killed in what they consider a series of accidents. (Doc. Nos. 93 and 104). Each injured-party Defendant was either involved in or is the personal representative of a person killed in the March 31, 2012 incident. Defendant Schneider and his employer, Defendant Western Express, the insured, seek summary judgment as well. They argue that despite the number of impacts, there was but a single \"accident\" under the Policy, giving rise to only a single $900,000 self-retention obligation under the Policy. (Doc. Nos. 88, 102, and 103). Western Express and Schneider responded to the Plaintiff's motion and to that of its co-defendants. (Doc. Nos. 103, 106). The Court has considered the parties' various positions and finds as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At the outset the Court disposes of the suggestion by the injured-party Defendants that this Court await the termination of proceedings in the state court regarding the enforceability of an alleged settlement of the claims in the underlying tort litigation,\n   <em>\n    Western Express v. Factor\n   </em>\n   , Case No. DF-114498. The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals issued its decision on May 11, 2018, overturning and vacating the order of the District Court of Oklahoma County wherein that court concluded that a valid and binding settlement had been reached. On October 22, 2018, the Oklahoma Supreme Court denied Adam Factor's Petition for Writ of Certiorari, thereby mooting any argument that this Court should abstain from considering the instant motions. Accordingly, the injured-party Defendants' request that this Court await a decision from the Oklahoma state courts is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party demonstrates that there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact\" and that it is \"entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In applying this standard, the court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to\n   the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Adler v.

R. Civ. P. 1 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Generally, the facts underlying the March 31, 2012 incident are not disputed. At approximately 8:27 a.m. while driving through fog in the westbound lanes of Interstate 40 near the Oklahoma/Texas border, Defendant Schneider's truck hit a BMW being driven by Gorgis Ori. The two vehicles pulled off into the center median, although there are contentions that Defendant Schneider's vehicle was not completely cleared from the inside westbound lane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless, James Crittenden, who was behind Schneider, hit Schneider's truck, which pushed Schneider's trailer into the roadway further. This relocation set off a chain reaction of impacts that took place over the course of minutes, not all with Schneider. Schneider was employed by Western Express, the insured herein, giving rise to this declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   National Casualty Company issued Policy Number CTO0124407 to Western Express, Inc. of Nashville, Tennessee for the period October 1, 2011 through October 1, 2012, providing commercial auto coverage. (Doc. No. 90-1, p. 3). The Policy included a \"Commercial Auto Coverage Part Motor Carrier Coverage Form Supplemental Declarations\" page, which contained a list of coverages. Id. at p. 9. The Policy includes liability coverage for 61 covered autos and identified the limit, that is, \"[t]he Most We Will Pay for Any One Accident or Loss\" as $1,000,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dispute herein revolves around certain Policy language, set forth in more detail below, because the parties disagree regarding how many \"Accidents\" resulted from the events on March 31, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff argues the initial impact between Defendant Schneider and the BMW driven by Ori as well as all subsequent impacts constitute a single \"Accident\" and therefore its exposure is limited to $1,000,000. The injured-party Defendants argue that National Casualty's exposure under the Policy is $1,000,000 per injured or deceased person, because each is a separate \"Accident\" when viewed from the standpoint of the injured or deceased.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff National Casualty and Defendants Western Express and Schneider contend the Declaration establishes the limits of coverage for all events of March 31, 2012 between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Policy under \"Section II - Liability Coverage, A. Coverage\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   We will pay all sums an \"insured\" legally must pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance applies, caused by an \"accident\" and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered \"auto\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Doc. No. 90-1, p. 15. It provides for a \"Limit of Insurance:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Regardless of the number of covered \"autos\", \"insureds\", premiums paid, claims made or vehicles involved in the \"accident\", the most we will pay for the total of all damages and \"covered pollution cost or expense\" combined, resulting from any one \"accident\" is the Limit of Insurance for Liability Coverage shown in the Declarations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All \"bodily injury\", \"property damage\" and \"covered pollution cost or expense\" resulting from continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same conditions will be considered as resulting from one \"accident.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Id. at p. 19. \"Accident,\" \"includes continuous or repeated exposure to the same conditions resulting in 'bodily injury' or 'property damage'.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before addressing the interpretation of the Policy, the Court addresses the admissibility of certain evidence submitted by the parties. The injured-party Defendants would have the Court adopt\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   a report submitted to the District Court of Oklahoma County in certain of the underlying tort litigation drafted by a court-appointed Special Master, former United States District Judge Michael Burrage. Plaintiff insurer and Defendant insured, Western Express and its employee Thomas Schneider, object to the Court's consideration of the Special Master's report. The injured parties do not address the admissibility of the Special Master's report in any of their briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court will not adopt the legal opinion of the Special Master and the facts as set forth therein are based on allegations, not evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 91-1, pp. 13, 15-16 (\"it is alleged by plaintiffs (and denied by defendants)\").

The Court is unwilling to abdicate its role to either the Special Master appointed by the District Court of Oklahoma County or the expert witness, Richard Dykstra, whose report the injured-party Defendants also submitted in support of their position. (Doc. No. 93-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Additionally, the opinion offered by the Special Master has no legal effect in Oklahoma state court following the decision of the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals and the denial of certiorari by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [F]rom our finding that the district court erred in determining there was an enforceable agreement between Factor and Western Express to settle the lawsuit, it necessarily follows that it was also error to appoint a special master and refer issues related to policy limits.

Defendant Western Express and Thomas Schneider agree with Plaintiff, but also argue that the public policy exception applies. The injured-party Defendants argue that Tennessee has the most significant relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Policy here was issued by the Illinois office of National Casualty to Western Express, an interstate trucking company with a Tennessee address. Oklahoma's only connection to this action is that the pileup occurred in Oklahoma. The Court's review of the pleadings in the underlying actions reveals that two individuals, Larry Barnes and Carol Newell, who settled their claims, were residents of Oklahoma. Additionally, there are allegations in at least one filing that McKinley Ranches, whose truck was involved in the pileup, was domiciled in Oklahoma. The parties advocating for Oklahoma law, however, rely primarily on the location of the accident to argue that Oklahoma has the most significant relationship to the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bohannan\n   </em>\n   , the Oklahoma Supreme Court considered whether to apply the law of Oklahoma or California to determine the effect of uninsured motorist provisions in an insurance policy. The accident occurred in Oklahoma between two Oklahoma drivers, one of whom had a California resident as a passenger. The passenger had UM coverage under a policy issued in California. The court was called upon to consider whether the UM benefits for the California insurance policy should be construed under California or Oklahoma law. The court enunciated the test set forth above.

The Court finds the involvement of three Oklahoma residents in the sixteen-vehicle pileup combined with the fact that the accident occurred in Oklahoma insufficient to give Oklahoma law the most significant relationship. Accordingly, Oklahoma law would apply to the exclusion of Tennessee law, only if Tennessee law violates the public policy of Oklahoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Neither the insurer nor the insured directly argues that application of Tennessee law would violate Oklahoma public policy. The mere existence of a conflict with Oklahoma law is not tantamount to a violation of public policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants Western Express and Schneider argue that the NCC Policy was required to comply with Oklahoma\n   law to the extent that its policy is called upon to afford coverage to its insureds in Oklahoma. Although Western Express is an insured, it is not an insured in Oklahoma. There is no contention that the Policy does not provide the minimum coverage mandated by Oklahoma law. That the Policy specifically provides that limits of coverage will be increased to meet the compulsory or financial responsibility law of the jurisdiction where the covered auto was being used does not mean that there is anything in the application of Tennessee law that would violate Oklahoma public policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, to the extent there is a conflict, Tennessee law would apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, the Court must discern Tennessee law and whether it conflicts with Oklahoma law.

Therein the court considered the extent of an insurer's liability for two collapsed buildings. The first, adjacent to the east of the insured property, collapsed the day excavation work was performed on the insured building. The second, to the west of the insured property, collapsed two days later. The court noted that the May 27, 1952 excavation work on the insured property was the proximate cause of both collapses. The first question presented was whether an exclusion exempted the insurer from coverage for personal property loss caused by excavation. After answering the first inquiry in the negative, the court was called upon to assess the amount of coverage available. The court's single-paragraph analysis provides little insight into the rationale behind its decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If the losses complained of by the complainant were for one accident, the liability would be $10,000, but if there were two separate accidents, then complainants would be entitled to recover twice the amount.

At the time of the second impact, the rear wheels of the trailer were situated on the line diving the two northbound lanes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Two separate, distinct collisions occurred five minutes apart[,] ... there was no single force, nor an unbroken or uninterrupted continuum that, once set in motion, caused multiple injuries [and] ... the second collisions did not result from continuous or repeated exposure either to the same or to substantially the same conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=542%20N.E.2d%2090\">\n    Id. at 91, 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The facts as set forth by the parties do not establish liability among those involved in the accident nor should they, given the pending federal and state court litigation; questions of contributory negligence abound given the conditions on the date of the accident. However, there are sufficient undisputed facts from which the Court can conclude that as to bodily injury/property damage caused by the impact between Defendant Schneider and the car driven by Ori with Isso as a passenger, there is a $1,000,000 coverage limit. The remaining impacts share $1,000,000 in available coverage contingent upon a finding of liability as to Defendants Western Express/Schneider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The cases regarding the \"cause\" approach often address the issue of the tortfeasor's control over the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Progressive Preferred Ins.

The injured-party Defendants argue that, if the Court uses the \"cause\" test, the control approach and the separation by time approach mandate that more than one accident occurred for coverage purposes. Even if this Court considered control and timing as the dispositive issues, the result would be the same. From the parties' submissions, Mr. Schneider was in control at the time he impacted the BMW, and at best maintained control until he was hit from behind by Mr. Crittenden. After the impact between Mr. Schneider's semi-truck and the Crittenden vehicle, his ability to avoid additional impacts was not dependent on his ability to maintain control of his vehicle; his vehicle was at that time relocated into the westbound lanes of traffic by the collisions. Although he may have had the ability to control his vehicle until he was hit by Crittenden, he never gained control of the situation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at * 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   If timing is considered, the outcome remains the same. According to the testimony of Jana Harris, representative from South Western Oklahoma Development Authority, the first 911 call regarding the incident was received at 8:27:52 a.m. on March 31, 2012, indicating an accident between a truck and a car. (Doc. No. 88-2, p. 9). By 8:30:18 a.m., the impacts between the vehicles had ended. Thus, there was no significant passage of time between Mr. Crittenden hitting Mr. Schneider and the vehicle at the end of the pileup, Mr. Thomas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Family Mut.

The court considered it a single occurrence even though the contaminated food originated from two locations, a restaurant and a catered event at a church. The court adopted the position of the insurer that the injuries were caused by the continued preparation and service of contaminated food, that there was but one proximate cause of all the injuries, which was contamination originating at the restaurant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=493%20Fed.%20Appx.%20907\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=493%20Fed.%20Appx.%20907\">\n    at 911-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Oklahoma utilizes the same cause test the Court predicts would apply in Tennessee, and as a result, there is no conflict, the principles set forth above would apply, and as the Court concluded, there would be two \"accidents\" and $2,000,000 in coverage available from the National Casualty Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   National Casualty asks the Court to enter a declaratory judgment finding that the limit of coverage is $1,000,000, which is subject to the $900,000 self-insured retention obligation of Western Express under the Policy, that the coverage has been exhausted by virtue of the settlement of certain claims arising from the March 31, 2012 impacts and that it has no further obligation under the Policy. The facts presented to the Court do not permit the Court to determine whether Plaintiff's obligations under the Policy have been fulfilled. Although certain claims were settled, there is no indication in the record as to the amount of the settlements so as to fully grant Plaintiff's motion. Additionally, with regard to the issue of the self-insured retention, the parties' briefs are inadequate to permit the Court to draw any conclusions. The Court finds that the maximum amount of National Casualty's liability for bodily injury with regard to the incidents of March 31, 2012 is $2,000,000.00 because there were two \"accidents\" under the terms of the Policy, without consideration of the self-insured retention.
