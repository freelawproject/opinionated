Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2013, Candelario was found guilty of violent crimes in aid of racketeering activity, drug trafficking offenses, and thirteen conspiracy-related murders pursuant to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") by a death-qualified jury. (Docket No. 985.) At the penalty phase of trial, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision as to whether Candelario should receive the death penalty. (Docket No. 1051.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2013, Candelario received a life sentence. (Docket No. 1145.) Candelario appealed his sentence, and the First Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded Candelario's case to the district court.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Candelario contests the requirement that grand and petit jurors must be able \"to read, write, and understand the English language with a degree of proficiency sufficient to fill out satisfactorily the juror qualification form.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201865\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). He argues that \"the English language requirement excludes almost significantly more than 70% of the otherwise eligible population for jury service in death penalty cases in Puerto Rico,\" and that \"[t]his systematic exclusion effectively guarantees the composition of potential federal juror venires as more affluent, conservative, pro-Government, and pro-death penalty, with a significantly less diverse racial and ethnic composition than a fair cross-section of the community.\" (Docket No. 1489 at pp. 8, 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to Candelario,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The defense recognizes that beginning with\n   <em>\n    Benmuhar\n   </em>\n   , ... the First Circuit has repeatedly held that \"the overwhelming national interests served by [the] use of English in a United States Court justifies conducting proceedings in the District of Puerto Rico in English,\" so as not to violate the fair cross-section and equal protection requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012190486\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Candelario, nevertheless, requests that the Court depart from precedent because \"a sentence of death [was not] a potential jury option\" in those cases. (Docket No. 1489 at p. 9.) Candelario argues that \" 'death is different,' \" and that \"death penalty cases-by their very nature-require a jury to make 'a highly subjective, unique, individualized judgment regarding the punishment that a particular person deserves.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

According to Candelario, \"a jury in a death case must 'express the conscience of the community on the ultimate question of life or death,' and a jury in Puerto Rico from which all non-English speakers are excluded 'cannot speak for the community.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Witherspoon v.
