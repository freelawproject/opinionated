Defendant overstayed this period by approximately two and one-half years. In February 2006, Virginia State Police arrested defendant for possession of fraudulent identity documents in Fairfax County, Virginia. During the same month, defendant was charged in the Eastern District of Virginia with Identity Fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201028\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7) and (c)(3). Defendant pled guilty to this charge on October 19, 2006 and was thereafter sentenced to twelve months imprisonment and two years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 22, 2007, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") gave defendant a Notice to Appear (\"May 2007 Notice\"), requiring defendant to appear before an immigration judge to respond to the allegation that defendant had overstayed his B-2 visa without authorization. The May 2007 Notice notified defendant of this allegation and that this allegation, if true, warranted defendant's removal or deportation from the United States. Additionally, the May 2007 Notice stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Representation: If you so choose, you may be represented in the proceeding, at no expense to the Government, by an attorney or other individual authorized and qualified to represent persons before the Executive Office for Immigration Review, pursuant to 8 CFR 3.16. Unless you so request, no hearing will be scheduled earlier than ten days from the date of this notice, to allow you sufficient time to secure counsel. A list of qualified attorneys and organization who may be available to represent you at no cost will be provided with this notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The May 2007 Notice stated that the date and time of the hearing would be set later. No list of available pro bono legal services providers was attached to the May 2007 Notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 7, 2007, ICE moved defendant from Arlington, Virginia to Harlingen, Texas. On June 12, 2007, the immigration court sent a Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings (\"June 2007 Notice\") to defendant in the Willacy County Detention Center in Texas. This June 2007 Notice advised defendant of the date, time and location of the removal hearing and stated: \"You may be represented in these proceedings, at no expense to the Government, by an attorney or other individual who is authorized and qualified to represent persons before an Immigration Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the scheduled and noticed hearing on June 15, 2007, an immigration judge ordered defendant removed from the United States to Honduras (the \"June 2007 Removal Order\"). Defendant, who was present for the hearing and proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , waived his appeal of the June 2007 Removal Order. On July 18, 2007, ICE then removed defendant from the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, at some unknown time, defendant illegally re-entered the United States. Then, on August 3, 2012, defendant was found in the United States and was charged with Illegal Re-entry after a Conviction for a Felony, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(1). On September 2, 2012, ICE reinstated defendant's June 2007 Removal Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 11, 2013, defendant pled guilty to the illegal\n   re-entry charge, and on April 12, 2013, pursuant to the June 2007 Removal Order, ICE once again removed defendant from the United States to Honduras.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At some unknown time after this removal, defendant once again re-entered the United States illegally. Thereafter, on July 16, 2018, Virginia state police arrested defendant in Fairfax County, Virginia for Felony Hit and Run with Injury in violation of Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-894, Drunk in Public in violation of Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-388, and Reckless Driving in violation of Va. Code \u00a7 46.2-852. These charges remain pending. On or about July 29, 2018, ICE placed a detainer on defendant, who then fell to the ICE detainer on or about August 22, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the motion to dismiss, defendant argues that because the May 2007 Notice failed to include the date and time of defendant's removal proceeding, the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to order defendant's June 2007 removal and hence defendant claims that the June 2007 Removal Order is invalid. Accordingly, defendant argues, the Indictment must be dismissed because defendant has not re-entered the United States subsequent to the entry of a valid order removing defendant from the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because defendant is barred from collaterally attacking the June 2007 Removal Order and related proceeding and because, alternatively, the immigration court did have jurisdiction to order defendant's June 2007 removal, defendant's motion to dismiss the Indictment must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As an initial matter, defendant's motion must be denied because, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), defendant is barred from challenging the June 2007 removal proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, \"where the defects in [the removal] proceeding foreclose[d] judicial review of that proceeding,\" the alien must have access to collateral judicial review of the alien's removal order in the alien's subsequent criminal proceeding under \u00a7 1326.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , Congress enacted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), which provides that an alien charged with illegal re-entry may, in a criminal proceeding under \u00a7 1326, challenge the validity of the underlying removal order if the defendant demonstrates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) the [defendant] exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the [defendant] of the opportunity for judicial review; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thus, Congress has made clear that an alien who demonstrates these three prerequisites has been denied meaningful judicial review in the initial removal proceeding and thus has the right to attack collaterally the prior removal order and related proceeding under \u00a7 1326(d). Importantly, the three prerequisites are listed in the conjunctive, and thus, as the Fourth Circuit has recognized, the defendant must satisfy all three prerequisites in order to be able to challenge collaterally the underlying removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, defendant here may not challenge the June 2007 Removal Order unless he meets all three \u00a7 1326(d) requirements. But if defendant meets all three requirements, the Indictment's illegal re-entry charge under \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1) must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   An alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies, and thus fails to satisfy the first \u00a7 1326(d) requirement, if the alien knowingly waived the right to appeal an immigration judge's order of deportation in the prior deportation proceedings.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On the other hand, if the alien failed to appeal the immigration judge's order because the government did not give the alien proper notice of the removal hearing, the alien has met the exhaustion requirement.\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n    434 F.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The record in this case reflects that defendant knowingly chose to waive his right to appeal the June 2007 Removal Order to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, defendant does not contend that he lacked notice of the hearing or otherwise unknowingly waived his right to appeal. Instead, the record demonstrates that defendant was fully aware of and attended the June 2007 proceeding. And, as explained more fully,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the government gave defendant proper notice of the June 2007 hearing through the May 2007 Notice and the June 2007 Notice sent to defendant, which together informed defendant of the time, place, and date of the hearing. Thus, defendant, by knowingly waiving his right to appeal the June 2007 Removal Order, failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and cannot meet the first requirement of \u00a7 1326(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Similarly, the second \u00a7 1326(d) requirement is satisfied only where the alien in the prior deportation proceeding was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review of the immigration judge's deportation order. For example, an immigration judge deprives an alien of his opportunity for judicial review if the judge fails to give the alien an adequate explanation of the\n   alien's right to appeal the deportation order and to apply for suspension of removal.\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n    481 U.S. at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As already discussed, the record in this case makes clear that defendant was given notice of the June 2007 removal proceeding and indeed defendant attended that proceeding and waived his right to appeal the June 2007 Removal Order stemming from that hearing. And there is no evidence that the immigration judge failed to follow the requirements for properly advising defendant of his right to appeal the deportation order and to apply for suspension of removal. Thus, defendant cannot meet the second \u00a7 1326(d) requirement because defendant was not deprived of the opportunity for judicial review of the June 2007 Removal Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, defendant also fails to satisfy the third \u00a7 1326(d) factor, as there is no evidence in this record that the immigration judge's entry of the June 2007 Removal Order was fundamentally unfair. An alien can demonstrate that entry of a removal order is fundamentally unfair only if the alien shows, as did not occur here, that \"(1) his due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding, and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.\"\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n    434 F.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotes omitted). And due process in this context requires an alien facing removal to be provided with \"(1) notice of the charges against him, (2) a hearing before an executive or administrative tribunal, and (3) a fair opportunity to be heard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant does not contend that he was not provided with notice of the charge against him-overstaying his visitor visa without authorization-nor does he argue that he was denied a hearing before an appropriate tribunal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, defendant argues that his due process rights were violated because the government hindered defendant's ability to retain counsel for the removal proceeding, in violation of governing immigration law and regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this respect, defendant correctly observes that Congress has provided that an alien in a removal proceeding has the right \"of being represented, at no expense to the Government, by counsel of the alien's choosing who is authorized to practice in such proceedings.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(4)(a). Furthermore, immigration regulations require the immigration judge in a removal proceeding to \"[a]dvise the respondent of the availability of pro bono legal services for the immigration court location at which the hearing will take place, and ascertain that the respondent has received a list of such pro bono legal service providers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.10\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The record in this case indicates that (i) the government failed to provide defendant with a list of available pro bono legal services providers and that (ii) the government re-located defendant from Arlington, Virginia to Harlingen, Texas sixteen days after serving defendant with the Notice to Appear. Thus, it is clear that the immigration court in defendant's June 2007 removal proceeding failed to ensure that defendant had received the list of available pro bono service providers to which he was entitled under the regulations. And it is possible that defendant's removal from Virginia to Texas further hindered defendant's ability to retain counsel for the immigration proceeding. Nonetheless, it is unnecessary to decide whether, on this record, defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair hearing because it is clear that defendant suffered no prejudice from these alleged defects in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To show actual prejudice, an alien must demonstrate that but for the violation of his due process rights, there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the alien would not have been deported.\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n    434 F.3d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, defendant has made no showing that he would not have been deported had defendant received a list of available pro bono attorneys or more time to find an attorney. To the contrary, the record persuasively indicates that defendant could not have produced any evidence to contradict the charges that defendant had overstayed his B-2 visitor visa, with or without counsel. Defendant's visa permitted defendant to remain in the United States only until June 30, 2003, and defendant was found and arrested in Virginia in February 2006. Moreover, because defendant's presence in Virginia was discovered through his arrest and conviction for identity fraud, there is no reason to believe that his removal would be canceled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even if, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , defendant's due process rights were violated during the June 2007 removal proceeding, it is clear that defendant suffered no prejudice as a result. Accordingly, defendant cannot satisfy the third \u00a7 1326(d) requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the reasons stated above, defendant has failed to meet not just one of the \u00a7 1326(d) requirements, but all three. It follows, therefore, that defendant is not entitled to challenge collaterally the validity of the June 2007 Removal Order and associated removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Next, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that defendant could clear the hurdle imposed by the three \u00a7 1326(d) requirements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant's\n   motion to dismiss the Indictment must nonetheless be denied because, contrary to defendant's argument, the immigration court did have jurisdiction to order defendant's removal in the June 2007 proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   An immigration court is vested with jurisdiction over an immigration proceeding \"when a charging document is filed with the Immigration Court\" by the government.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The latter view-that \u00a7 1326(d) bars an alien from collaterally attacking a removal order on jurisdictional grounds unless the alien can satisfy the three 1326(d) requirements-is the better-reasoned approach because the mandate of \u00a7 1326(d) is clear and unequivocal: \"In a criminal proceeding under this section, an alien may not challenge the validity of the deportation order... unless the alien demonstrates that\" the three statutory requirements are met.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Moreover, as the Supreme Court made clear in\n    <em>\n     Mendoza-Lopez\n    </em>\n    , due process requires a court to review an alien's removal order in a \u00a7 1326 prosecution where the prior removal proceeding \"effectively eliminate[d] the right of the alien to obtain judicial review.\"\n    <em>\n     Mendoza-Lopez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n     481 U.S. at 839\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n     107 S.Ct. 2148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The alien's due process rights are therefore not violated by \u00a7 1326(d)'s clear mandate that an alien may not collaterally attack a removal order, including on jurisdictional grounds, where the alien waived his opportunity for judicial review of the removal order and associated proceeding.
