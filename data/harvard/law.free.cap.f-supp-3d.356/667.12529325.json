Mich. June 7, 2017). Now before the Court is ExpressJet's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 33). Plaintiff has filed a Response (ECF No. 36) and ExpressJet has filed a Reply (ECF No.37). The Court held a hearing on November 6, 2018. For the reasons that follow, ExpressJet's motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Employment and Termination From Express Jet\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff began working as a flight attendant for Express Jet on January 31, 2013. (ECF No. 33, Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. C, January 29, 2018 Deposition of Charee Stanley 56:8-12; Def.'s Mot. Ex. B, May 30, 2018 Declaration of Daniel J. Curtin \u00b6 4.) As an Express Jet Flight Attendant, Plaintiff was a member of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\"the IAM\" or \"the Union\"), and a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") governed the relationship between Express Jet and its Flight Attendants. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A, ASA-AFA 2008 CBA.) Plaintiff was a practicing Christian when she began the interview process for the job with Express Jet, but during the interview process in mid-December, 2012, she met \"a young gentleman who talked about Emirates\" and expressed the view that if he was to live abroad, he would work for Emirates. (Stanley Dep. 24:9-21, 51:5.) Plaintiff became curious about the possibility of living abroad and working for Emirates and \"went home and looked it up.\" (Stanley Dep. 24:20-24.) She learned that she could \"live in Dubai, and [ ] work overseas, and [ ] make tax-free money, and [ ] could travel the world.\" (Stanley Dep. 24:23-25:1.) Plaintiff researched Emirates and applied for a job with them and \"knew that Dubai was a Muslim country but didn't know what that meant.\" (Stanley Dep. 25:1-4.) Plaintiff began to research the Muslim faith and \"fell in love with it\" and took her \"shahada,\" or \"confession of faith,\" on January 2 (or 3), 2013. (Stanley Dep. 25:4-7, 51:4.) So Plaintiff was not a practicing Muslim when she interviewed for the job with Express Jet but once she started her training on January 21, 2013, she had converted to the Muslim faith. (Stanley Dep. 25:11-14, 51:3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During her training, Plaintiff made a request of one of her trainers to be permitted to wear her hijab (head scarf). (Stanley Dep. 65:14-22,67:6.) That verbal request\n   was initially declined but Plaintiff submitted a written a request shortly thereafter, on or about August 26, 2013, which was granted by Express Jet. (Stanley Dep. 66:3-20, 70:8-71:6, 75:1-16; ECF No. 33-6, Stanley Dep. Attach. 9, PgID 1153.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff understood that serving beverages was part of her job responsibilities and she understood that alcohol was one of the beverages that was available to passengers to request as part of that beverage service on Express Jet flights. (Stanley Dep. 87:11-23.) Plaintiff testified that the Flight Attendant Manual (\"FAM\") was a flight attendant's \"bible\" and was required to be carried at all times and updated as necessary. (Stanley Dep. 89:4-8. 92:13-24; Stanley Dep. Attachment 11, Flight Attendant Manual Excerpts.) The FAM outlines an Express Jet Flight Attendant's job responsibilities, obligates a Flight Attendant to \"perform[ ] all duties as outlined in the Express Jet Flight Attendant Manual, Company Policy Manuals, and duties as assigned by the Captain,\" and specifically references the responsibility of a Flight Attendant to \"attend to all passenger requests, including beverages, alcohol and/or other snacks.\" (FAM Service Policy, PgID 1158, 1170.) Plaintiff understood that she was responsible for performing all of the duties as outlined in the FAM. (Stanley Dep. 93:17-23.) The FAM also outlines the \"normal chain of command\" on an Express Jet aircraft as follows: \"1. Captain, 2. First Officer, 3. Flight Attendant \"A\", 4. Flight Attendant \"B\".\" (FAM Chain of Command, PgID 1166.) The Chain of Command further provides that \"[t]he most senior Flight Attendant at duty-in shall either assume the A position or assign the A position to the other assigned Flight Attendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Stanley understood this hierarchy and also understood that the more senior Flight Attendant could choose whether he or she wanted position \"A\" or position \"B\" and that Flight Attendant \"A\" would be positioned in First Class and Flight Attendant \"B\" would be positioned in the main cabin. (Stanley Dep. 95:8-24.) Ms. Stanley specifically testified to her understanding that seniority \"gave you better choices,\" and that as the senior Flight Attendant \"[y]ou have the pick of what position you want on an aircraft.\" (Stanley Dep. 117:4-118:19.) Ms. Stanley understood that there was this division of responsibilities and that the Flight Attendants were expected to \"work as a team,\" and perform the other Flight Attendant's duties when necessary to get the job done. (Stanley Dep. 96:9-97:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The FAM contains specific detail regarding the duties of a Flight Attendant assigned as the Flight Attendant on a one-Flight Attendant aircraft and the duties assigned to the \"A\" and \"B\" Flight Attendants when two Flight Attendants are on board an aircraft. (FAM Phases of Flight Overview PgID 1160-64.) Ms. Stanley also recalled having received, or been given access online to, the Flight Attendant Handbook. (Stanley Dep. 100:9-11; Stanley Dep. Attach. 12, 4/24/15 ExpressJet Flight Attendant Handbook.) The Flight Attendant Handbook (\"FAH\") outlines many employment related guidelines, including general serving guidelines and parameters, and specifically guidelines regarding the service of alcohol. (FAM \u00a7 3-6.1, PgID 1206-11.) The FAM also outlines the general guidelines for service in Delta First Class cabins. Specifically, the FAM provides, among other guidelines, that: \"FA \"A\" is responsible for conducting a pre-departure beverage service to all First Class customers, to include a full selection including alcoholic beverages.\" (FAM \u00a7 3-4.1, PgID 1196.) The FAM further provides that: \"FA \"B\" should assist with First Class pre-departure service. For example, FA \"A\" may take orders, hang coats and serve beverages, while FA \"B\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   remains in the galley to greet boarding customers, prepare beverages and control boarding traffic to allow FA \"A\" to move about the First Class cabin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The FAM provides that Flight Attendants are primarily responsible for their \"A\" or \"B\" duties but are \"encouraged to work together and assist each other with completing all required service on the aircraft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As far as the serving of alcohol, Ms. Stanley testified that \"[t]here are flights that no one asks for it, and there are flights when everybody seemingly asks for it,\" and \"everything in between.\" (Stanley Dep. 123:13-15.) The job posting for the Flight Attendant position that was in effect when Plaintiff applied for a job and to which Plaintiff would have responded in applying for a position as an Express Jet Flight Attendant, expressly stated that the job duties of Flight Attendant required the selling of \"food and alcoholic beverages to passengers....\" (Stanley Dep. 76:10-77:6; Attachment 3, Job Posting for Flight Attendant.) Ms. Stanley recalled reading the job posting online for the Flight Attendant position, although she could not remember the specific details of the posting. (Stanley Dep. 80:21-81:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   And Ms. Stanley performed all of her job responsibilities, and did serve alcohol, through the first year and a half of her service as an Express Jet Flight Attendant, and was considered very professional and attentive and a good employee, with no history of customer complaints. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. F, April 10, 2018 Deposition of Melanie Brown 39:13-41:1. 36:23-37:11.) However, sometime in early June, 2015, Plaintiff learned that she was prohibited not only from consuming alcohol, but also from preparing and/or serving alcohol. (Stanley Dep. 119:7-120:12.) Plaintiff testified that she learned of this prohibition during a conversation with an Imam with whom she discussed questions that would arise as she studied Islam and read the Quran. Plaintiff explained to the Imam that she was required to serve and sell alcohol at work and he told her that she was not supposed to drink or serve/sell alcohol, but told her \"don't quit your job ... you can't quit your job ... you just pray to Allah to give you something better.\" (Stanley Dep. 119:22-120:5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following this discussion with her Imam, on or about June 2, 2015, which was the next time she went to work and had an opportunity to speak to Melanie Brown, the chief flight attendant at the Detroit Express Jet base, she explained to Ms. Brown that she had learned from her Imam that she was not supposed to serve or sell alcohol. (Stanley Dep. 118:24-119:6, 121:21-122:2.) Plaintiff explained to Ms. Brown what she had learned from the Imam and according to Plaintiff, Ms. Brown told her that it shouldn't be a problem for Plaintiff to \"just make an arrangement with the other flight attendant,\" to serve any alcoholic beverages that customers requested from the Plaintiff. According to Ms. Stanley, Ms. Brown implied that it was \"an easy fix.\" (Stanley Dep. 122:9-23.) Plaintiff did testify that Ms. Brown told her that Ms. Brown would \"have to look into it\" but that Plaintiff should go ahead and \"make an arrangement\" with the other flight attendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During this conversation with Ms. Brown, Plaintiff mentioned that the month of Ramadan was about to start and she did not want to go into that holy month doing something that she now knew she was not supposed to do. Ms. Brown also mentioned to Plaintiff, who wanted to take time off for Ramadan, that Plaintiff could take Time Off Without Pay (\"TOWOP\") for the month of Ramadan, which Plaintiff decided to do. (Stanley Dep. 124:12-125:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Brown memorialized this conversation with Plaintiff in a \"daily note\" log for entry in the \"crew resource management\n   system.\" Ms. Brown would have made this entry in her daily log and asked Ms. Holland, identified as the \"creator\" on the entry, to enter it into the crew resource management system so that it could be placed in Plaintiff's profile. (Stanley Dep. 64:22-68:15, 98:8-99:22.) Ms. Holland would have copied and pasted Ms. Brown's daily note memorializing the June 2, 2015 meeting with the Plaintiff, which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   M. Brown DN 6-2-15 as we enter the season of Ramadan, FA raised concerns about not being able to serve alcohol as a tenant [sic] of her faith. We discussed the options she has and ultimately the decision regarding her continued employment rests with her. I explained TOWOP for the month of July, which if awarded will assist, however it is not a permanent solution. I suggested she work with her fellow FAs on board to assist during service, suggested she work the main cabin where alcohol is purchased thus potentially limiting her interaction. Recommended she look at our Careers tab to see if there was another position within the company she may be able to apply for. I also sought guidance from Kaylee Davis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Brown Dep. Attachment 6.) Ms. Davis was an individual from Express Jet's Human Resource Department and Ms. Brown could not recall if she called Ms. Davis or emailed her but she did recall that she also spoke with Mr. Curtin, Director of In Flight Operations, who directed her to Ms. Davis to see about any special accommodation form that might be available to Plaintiff and what to do if Plaintiff submitted such a request. (Brown Dep. 103:10-107:11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Brown understood Plaintiff to be asking about how to handle her inability to serve and sell alcohol on a particular upcoming flight due to the observance of the Ramadan holiday. Ms. Brown stated that Plaintiff explained in the June 2, 2015 meeting that she had just learned \"she could not serve alcohol because she was going into Ramadan and she did not feel comfortable on\" the flight she was about to board and Plaintiff \"didn't speak beyond that flight.\" (Brown Dep. 91:2-21.) \"It was regarding that specific flight, and [Plaintiff] was beginning to observe Ramadan.... Ramadan was the catalyst for that.\" (Brown Dep. 92:3-8.) Ms. Brown testified: \"My advice to her because we were within minutes of that flight departing was to speak to her fellow flight attendant, express her concern and ask if he would assist her on that flight.\" (Brown Dep. 94:22-25.) Ms. Brown did not interpret that Plaintiff was making a formal accommodation request when she came to speak with Ms. Brown on June 2, 2015, about how to handle her problem with serving alcohol on a flight that was about to depart. (Brown Dep. 164:3-165:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff left the June 2, 2015 meeting with Ms. Brown with a different impression: Plaintiff thought that the arrangement whereby she would ask fellow Flight Attendants to perform Plaintiff's alcohol service duties was a permanent arrangement and that going forward, after Plaintiff returned from her TOWOP for the month of Ramadan, she would \"just pick up and do the same,\" and just \"work with the other flight attendants,\" and she did not walk away from the June 2, 2015 meeting with Ms. Brown thinking it was a temporary arrangement. (Stanley Dep. 127:13-130:18.) Plaintiff never thought the arrangement suggested by Ms. Brown, whereby Plaintiff would ask the other Flight Attendant with whom she was assigned to fly that day whether they would serve alcohol for the Plaintiff, was \"temporary.\" (Stanley Dep. 182:16-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On Friday, June 7, 2015, Ms. Brown received an email from Chief Flight Attendant Amy Cain, who reported a call she received from Flight Attendant Abdel Aafifi, complaining about Plaintiff's refusal to help him assist with the beverage service in First Class due to her inability \"to pour or serve alcohol during this time due to her religion.\" (Brown Dep. 115:16-116:15; Brown Dep. Attachment 7.) Ms. Cain reported that \"as the senior FA, he is requesting assistance with first class but she is refusing.\" (Brown Dep. Attachment 7.) Ms. Brown forwarded this email to Mr. Rick Berry, employee relations manager, and subsequently met with Mr. Aafifi regarding this complaint. Mr. Aafifi he explained that there was \"a lot of extra work\" that he was required to do when he was flying with Ms. Stanley and he felt it was \"unfair.\" Mr. Aafifi never filed a formal complaint regarding Ms. Stanley. (Brown Dep. 116:19-119:16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. Stanley was then away on TOWOP for the remainder of Ramadan and Express Jet received no further complaints about Ms. Stanley until Express Jet received an Irregular Operations Report (\"IOR\") from Flight Attendant Katie Hice on August 2, 2015, after Plaintiff had returned from her TOWOP for Ramadan. Ms. Hice's IOR read in full as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I worked with flight attendant Charee Stanley who refused to do her flight attendant duties and failed to follow ExpressJet policies. I was asked by FA Charee Stanley to serve ALL alcoholic beverages on flights DL5319 dtw/orf, DL5319 orf/dtw, DL5237 dtw/yul, DL 5025 yul/dtw because she said she had since being hired converted to a different religion which is now Muslim and she isn't allowed to serve alcohol now. She said she knows she is supposed to serve alcohol but she can't/won't serve alcoholic beverages. Several times Charee Stanley was in the galley reading a small book with foreign writing in it. It was extremely hard to do both FA A and FA B duties. I served the alcoholic beverages to first class on the ground, completed FA B duties, served first class alcoholic beverages once in the air, served economy comfort and economy and then when bringing the cart back to the galley first class needed to be attended to again. I don't know what she was doing while I was busy with passengers and serving. When I would get to the galley she had out her food, her phone, her book with foreign writings or taking things in and out of her bags. Once when the captain said to close the main cabin door she hesitated because she was having a conversation with a ramper about where she should move to in Detroit (good area) and didn't close the door until her conversation was complete. The captain had even got me to tell her to close the door and I did but she did what she wanted and finished her conversation first. Charee also wore a headress upon her head. Twice Charee came to switch with me so I could serve alcoholic beverages to first class while I was serving in the back. First class needed more than just alcoholic beverages as I ended up giving other drinks as well and tidying up as they handed me things they wished to discard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Stanley Dep. Attachment 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff testified that indeed Ms. Hice did perform all of Plaintiff's alcohol serving duties on four different flights and Plaintiff explained that she and Ms. Hice would \"swap\" positions, like this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q: So you would swap positions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q: You would go to first class. She would come to the main cabin?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: And then once she serves, I would go back to main cabin so she can go back to first class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: So she would come to you, she would make the drinks. In the meantime you'd go up to the first class passengers?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: And you were just, at that point, I assume walking through the first-class cabin and making sure everyone's okay, seeing if they need anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: Did it ever - did you ever have first-class passengers ask you for alcohol when you swapped places and went up to first class?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A: Maybe they did, and I took the order and I left it for her when she came back. Because it doesn't take long to make a drink, so once she makes it ... we were swapping back out. And I would - if there was a request, I would put 1A would like this [alcoholic drink] ... [s]o that she would know when she came back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Stanley Dep. 151:4-152:9.) Plaintiff testified that she gave Ms. Hice \"the same spiel [she] gave every flight attendant [she] worked with: As a Muslim, I'm not permitted to do so. Do you mind serving on my behalf....\" (Stanley Dep. 153:16-19.) Plaintiff testified that she was never required to work a single Flight Attendant plane so she had never considered what would have occurred had she been the sole Flight Attendant and refused to serve alcohol. After initially not responding to further questions about this issue, Plaintiff eventually responded that Express Jet would have to pull someone from the reserves to take over that flight for the Plaintiff. (Stanley Dep. 174:11-182:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 18, 2015, a meeting was held with Plaintiff, Ms. Brown, a Union representative (Nate Wysong), and a human resources representative (Tracy Hassell), to discuss Ms. Hice's IOR and to get \"Plaintiff's side of the story.\" (Brown Dep. 150:15-160:21; Brown Dep. Attachments 9, 10.) The focus of the concern at the meeting was Plaintiff's refusal to serve alcohol and her request to fellow Flight Attendants to additionally perform her alcohol service duties for her. (Brown Dep. 162:21-163:5, Brown Dep. Attachment 10, Melanie Brown 8/18/15 Meeting Notes.) Tracee Hassell explained to Plaintiff at the August 18, 2015 meeting that serving alcohol was a job requirement for a Flight Attendant and that Express Jet could not guarantee Plaintiff that she will always fly with another Flight Attendant who will be willing to perform Plaintiff's alcohol service duties. (Brown 8/18/15 Meeting Notes.) Ms. Brown's meeting notes reflect that Ms. Brown explained to Plaintiff that she had three options: (1) take a personal leave for a period of time to seek another position in the company; (2) make the decision to serve and sell alcohol; or (3) voluntarily resign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff similarly recalled that she was given these options. (Brown Dep. Attachment 13, Plaintiff's 8/18/15 Personal Statement, PgID 2025.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the close of the August 18, 2015 meeting, Plaintiff presented Express Jet with a formal request for a religious accommodation not to serve alcohol. (Brown Dep. Attachment 11, Stanley Religious Accommodation Request Form.) Plaintiff also presented a letter from her attorney, Ms. Lena Masri, explaining that Express Jet's refusal to accommodate Plaintiff's sincerely-held religious belief that prohibited her from serving alcohol was a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (Brown Dep. Attachment 12, 8/18/15 Masri Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 19, 2015, before Plaintiff had the opportunity to elect one of the three options presented to her at the August 18,\n   2015 meeting, Express Jet informed Plaintiff that she had been placed on a 90-day non-disciplinary, unpaid administrative leave of absence, which was later extended to a year, to allow her to seek another position with Express Jet. (Curtin Decl. \u00b6 38.) Express Jet placed Plaintiff on this 90-day leave before she had an opportunity to select one of the three options presented to her at the August 18, 2015 meeting because she was scheduled to work the day after the meeting and \"ExpressJet needed to categorize her status in its scheduling and payroll systems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also on August 19, 2015, Plaintiff received a call from ExpressJet informing her that the leave had been extended to a 12-month leave. (Stanley Dep. 184:6-14; Brown Dep. Attachment 15, PgID 2040.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 25, 2018, Express Jet sent Plaintiff a letter informing her that serving alcoholic beverages to customers on their request was \"an essential function of the Flight Attendant position,\" and that it would be \"unrealistic and operationally difficult for the Company to require Flight Attendants, with whom [Plaintiff] might be flying [ ], to assume this duty on [her] behalf, while still performing their duties as outlined in the Flight Attendant Manual.\" Furthermore, ExpressJet noted that it could not guarantee that Plaintiff would always be assigned to a two (2) flight attendant aircraft. Therefore, ExpressJet found Plaintiff's request for an accommodation \"to be unreasonable and [not able to be] honored.\" (Brown Dep. Attachment 15, 8/25/15 Denial Letter.) The 8/25/15 Letter encouraged Plaintiff to take advantage of her one-year administrative leave to find another position with ExpressJet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff testified that there was \"no discretion\" within the Islamic faith for her to serve alcohol under any circumstance and she stated that she was not willing to violate that proscription. (Stanley Dep. 187:21-188:3.) But in Plaintiff's opinion, Express Jet had already granted her an accommodation that was \"their idea\" - that being Ms. Brown's verbal suggestion to Plaintiff on June 2, 2015, as to how she should handle the impending situation with her upcoming flight - and as a result of her doing what they told her to do, they unjustifiably took her job away. (Stanley Dep. 240:19-241:15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Provisions of the Governing Collective Bargaining Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , as a member of the IAM Union, Plaintiff's employment with Express Jet was governed by a CBA. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A, ASA-AFA 2008 CBA.) Pursuant to that CBA, a Flight Attendant's monthly work schedule is arranged through a Preferential Bidding System (\"PBS\") set forth in the CBA. (CBA \u00a7 7.C, PgID 766.) Flight schedules are \"constructed preferentially, in order of seniority....\" (CBA \u00a7 7.C.3.) The CBA expressly provides: \"The senior Flight Attendant may choose the \"A\" or \"B\" position on the aircraft.\" (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A, ASA-AFA 2008 CBA \u00a7 7.W.1., PgID 779.) The CBA further provides: \"Seniority shall govern all Flight Attendants in the case of bidding rights, filling of vacancies ... vacation preferences, and domicile assignments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11.E.1., PgID 798.) If a 2 (two) Flight Attendant aircraft is downgraded to a 1 (one) Flight Attendant aircraft, the senior Flight Attendant has the right to accept or decline the downgrade: \"If more Flight Attendants than needed are scheduled for and report for the same trip (as a result of scheduling error, downgrade, etc.) the choice to remain on the trip from amongst the reporting regular lineholders shall be on a seniority basis.\" (CBA \u00a7 7.W.2.) If the senior Flight Attendant declined the downgrade, the junior Flight Attendant would be required to accept the trip. (Curtin\n   Decl. \u00b6 15.) If the junior Flight Attendant refused to accept the downgrade, and no reserves were available to fill the spot, the senior Flight Attendant would be recalled, which would violate Section 7.W.2 of the CBA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Express Jet has never granted a Flight Attendant a permanent accommodation that violated the seniority provisions of the CBA. (Curtin Decl. \u00b6 27.) If the senior Flight Attendant refused to voluntarily perform Plaintiff's alcohol service responsibilities for her, or refused to accept a downgrade, and Express Jet forced the senior Flight Attendant to perform those duties, Express Jet would be subject to a grievance by the Union claiming that Express Jet violated the seniority provisions of the CBA, as evidenced by Mr. Aafifi's complaint that as the \"senior\" Flight Attendant, he had the right to request Plaintiff's assistance with serving alcoholic beverages to First Class. (Curtin Decl. \u00b6 33.) The Union concedes that providing Plaintiff with an accommodation not to be placed on a single flight attendant aircraft could violate seniority and a grievance could be filed for violation of the CBA seniority provisions.

However, this rule no longer applies if the federal claim asserted by the plaintiff depends for its resolution on the interpretation of a CBA. Such claims are not \"independent\" of the CBA regardless of their source, and are therefore precluded by the RLA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   We close by stressing the limited scope of our holding. A claim brought under an independent federal statute is precluded by the RLA only if it can be dispositively resolved through an interpretation of a CBA. This occurs \"only when a provision of the collective bargaining agreement is the subject of the dispute or the dispute is substantially dependent upon an analysis of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.\" Therefore, an employer cannot ensure the preclusion of a plaintiff's claim merely by asserting certain CBA-based defenses to what is essentially a non-CBA-based claim, or by arguing that the action challenged by\n   the plaintiff is \"arguably justified\" by the terms of a CBA. Nor will a claim be precluded merely because certain provisions of the CBA must be examined and weighed as a relevant but non-dispositive factor in deciding a claim or a defense. Therefore, Brown's claim would not have been precluded if either the parties did not dispute the interpretation of the relevant CBA provisions (and Brown had merely argued that he was entitled to a certain reasonable accommodation under the ADA notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the CBA), or if the disputed provisions of the CBA were relevant but not dispositive of Brown's claim (as the CBA's provisions describing job functions are in relation to the ADA \"essential function\" determination). However, because in this case the interpretation of the CBA's seniority provisions could dispose of Brown's entire ADA claim as a matter of law, his claim is not truly \"independent\" of the CBA and is precluded by the RLA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090383\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/654/#p658\">\n    254 F.3d at 667-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.

As a threshold matter, the Court clarifies the Plaintiff's requested accommodation: despite what Plaintiff may now suggest about her flexibility to consider \"other accommodations,\" she testified in her deposition that under no circumstances would she be willing to violate the tenet of her faith that precludes her from preparing/serving/selling alcohol. (Stanley Dep. 187:21-188:3.) Thus, Plaintiff requests an accommodation that would: (1) guarantee Plaintiff that every senior Flight Attendant would agree on every flight to perform her alcohol service duties, thus foregoing that Flight Attendant's seniority rights under the CBA to only perform the duties of Flight Attendant \"A\" or \"B\" at his or her election (which ExpressJet argues would violate the governing CBA seniority provisions), (2) guarantee Plaintiff the right to refuse to assist a more senior Flight Attendant with alcohol service duties, despite the requirements of the CBA and FAM that require such cooperation (which ExpressJet argues would violate the governing CBA seniority provisions), (3) guarantee Plaintiff that if a multi-attendant flight to which Plaintiff was assigned was downgraded to a single Flight Attendant flight, the senior Flight Attendant would be required to forego his or her right under the CBA to decline the downgrade, or at the last minute ExpressJet would have to call up a reserve to immediately work the flight (which ExpressJet argues would violate the governing CBA seniority provisions); and (4) guarantee that Plaintiff would never be assigned to a single Flight Attendant aircraft (which ExpressJet argues would violate the governing CBA seniority provisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   seek an accommodation that would be observed only insofar as it does not interfere with ExpressJet's seniority system or only insofar as fellow Flight Attendants are agreeable to her request. In fact Plaintiff testified that if a Flight Attendant refused her request at the outset of a flight, Plaintiff could take an unexcused \"no show\" and the departure could be put on hold while ExpressJet endeavored to call up a reserve (who may or may not be on-site at that time and who may or may not agree to perform Plaintiff's job duties for her). Plaintiff sought an \"upfront\" guarantee from ExpressJet that she would\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   be required to prepare or serve alcohol, and expected that other more senior Flight Attendants would surrender their bargained-for rights and agree to perform that duty for her or that ExpressJet would alter operations, delay flight departures, call up reserves, or otherwise figure out a way to accommodate a last minute operational roadblock caused by her refusal to perform her alcohol service duties. While Plaintiff suggests now that ExpressJet could somehow determine in advance a fellow Flight Attendant's agreement to perform Plaintiff's job duties for her, ExpressJet rightly responds that it could never be certain that an \"agreeable\" Flight Attendant would be available in the event of an unplanned operational event such as a downgrade of equipment or in the event of an \"agreeable\" Flight Attendant's unplanned unavailability. An \"employer [is] not required to make an effort to accommodate the plaintiff, where any attempt at doing so would be fruitless inasmuch as the rights of other employees would be violated, and providing the accommodation would therefore pose an undue burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Virts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9445843\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/508/#p516\">\n    285 F.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tepper v.

Ill. 2018) (observing that a \"disputed past practice under [a] CBA g[ives] rise to [a] minor dispute requiring interpretation of CBA in light of disputed past practice,\" and acknowledging that in deciding the preemption issue, \"the court may look beyond the explicit terms of the written agreement ... [and] must interpret the agreement to include recognized past practices\"). Thus, when determining whether a dispute requires interpretation of the CBA, and whether preemption is required, past practice and other written materials related to those practices also must be examined to resolve the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The CBA dictates, and the Plaintiff agrees, that the more senior Flight Attendant gets to choose whether he or she wants the \"A\" or \"B\" position. While there are instances of voluntary collaboration and cooperation in performing the duties of both the \"A\" and \"B\" positions, Plaintiff's requested accommodation mandates her control over the two positions. Both the FAM and FAH, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , contain specific detail regarding the duties of a Flight Attendant to serve alcohol, including an express directive that Flight Attendant \"B\" should assist Flight Attendant \"A\" with the pre-departure service of beverages, including alcoholic beverage preparation and service, which Plaintiff refused to do - prompting Mr. Aafifi's complaint. (FAM \u00a7 3-4.1, PgID 1196.) ExpressJet argues that the job duty of Flight Attendants to participate in the service of alcoholic beverages is an established past practice. In fact, Flight Attendant Aafifi's complaint regarding Plaintiff was based upon her refusal to help him (the senior Flight Attendant) service First Class alcoholic beverages pre-flight. Interpretation of the CBA in light of past practices is inherently a task for the system board.\n   <em>\n    VanSlyck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20F.R.D.%20266\">\n    323 F.R.D. at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"it is for the System Board to evaluate this past practice in the context of CBA interpretation; not the Court\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In this case, the CBA provides that the more senior Flight Attendant may choose whether to assume the \"A\" or \"B\" position on a flight, and the FAM and the FAH contained express instruction that all Flight Attendants are to help with the preparation and serving of alcoholic beverages. ExpressJet argues that if Plaintiff is granted an accommodation by ExpressJet relieving her of her duties to prepare and serve alcohol, and guaranteeing that she will never be called upon to prepare and serve alcohol, the seniority provisions of the CBA are necessarily implicated (and according to ExpressJet violated) because\n   the more senior Flight Attendant will be forced to fully perform (not just \"help out\" occasionally with hot water or tea or extra peanuts, Cooper Dep. 92:5-19) the alcohol service duties of both the \"A\" and \"B\" Flight Attendants, in violation of the more senior Flight Attendant's rights under the CBA to elect either the \"A\" or \"B\" positions for the flight. Plaintiff's Union representative, Ms. Cooper, conceded that Plaintiff's requested accommodation could violate the seniority provisions of the CBA and could result in the filing of a grievance against ExpressJet under the CBA's seniority provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiff disagrees that her requested accommodation has any effect on the seniority rights of other Flight Attendants because \"everyone has been happy to accommodate her.\" But the undisputed evidence demonstrates that in the short period of time (approximately three weeks) that she operated under the \"duty swapping\" arrangement, at least two Flight Attendants verbalized to their supervisors that they were not at all happy to assume Plaintiff's alcohol service duties for her and Mr. Aafifi expressly complained that \"as the Senior FA, he is requesting assistance with first class, but [Plaintiff] is refusing.\" (Brown Dep. Attach. 7, PgID 2014.) And importantly Plaintiff's Union representative, Ms. Cooper, conceded that she had received comments from \"a few\" Flight Attendants regarding Plaintiff's refusal to serve alcohol, some of whom were concerned that it would violate seniority rights and others who indicated they would be willing to work with Plaintiff and serve alcohol for her.

After taking TOWOP for the holy month of Ramadan, Plaintiff returned to work and apparently operated under that procedure for a period of a few weeks and considered that she had been granted a permanent accommodation not to serve alcohol in her role as an ExpressJet Flight Attendant. ExpressJet disagrees that this was a permanent accommodation, and submits that it was a temporary solution to Plaintiff's then-immediate problem of having to serve alcohol on her upcoming flight and to address Plaintiff's concerns about serving alcohol during the approaching holy month of Ramadan. But this factual dispute is not material because it is undisputed, and ExpressJet does not deny, that ExpressJet did permit Plaintiff to proceed with the swap requests until it received two separate complaints from fellow Flight Attendants who complained that they were being required to perform Plaintiff's alcohol service duties. One of those complaints, the IOR from Ms. Katie Hice, objected to having to perform Plaintiff's alcohol service duties for her but also contained remarks regarding \"books with foreign writings\" that Plaintiff was reading and comments on Plaintiff's hijab, that were interpreted by Plaintiff to be bigoted and charged with racial animus toward Plaintiff's Muslim religion. Plaintiff's counsel explained at the hearing on ExpressJet's motion to dismiss the Plaintiff's \"theory\" of retaliation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [T]he revocation of the religious accommodation in response to a colleague's complaints is the factual basis for plaintiff's retaliation claims. The colleague's complaints indicate[s] a level of animus that if ratified by the defendant becomes the basis of the employment action. And here, paragraph 31 of the complaint makes it clear that plaintiff's allegations are that the withdrawl of the religious accommodation was motivated by animus against Miss Stanley because of her faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (ECF No. 31, Transcript of May 17, 2017 Hearing 25:22-26:5.) Paragraph 31 of Plaintiff's Complaint alleges: \"This revocation of her religious accommodation was purportedly in response to complaints by a flight attendant about the fact that Ms. Stanley wore her hijab; possessed religious books in Arabic (\"foreign writings\"); and because she did not want to personally serve alcohol.\" (Compl. \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff's counsel stated further at the hearing on the motion to dismiss: \"[W]e believe that when we get ahold of their internal records regarding how this religious accommodation was revoked, that will indicate the level of animus that makes the revocation of the religious accommodation independently actionable regardless of whether the accommodation should have been given\n   in the first place.\" (5/17/17 Hr'g Tr. 32:5-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiff's retaliation claim fails for several reasons. First, Plaintiff's retaliation claim is premised on comments made by a fellow Flight Attendant. In constructing her retaliation theory, however, Plaintiff has not identified\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   \"protected activity,\" leaving the Court and ExpressJet to fill in this blank for her. Therefore, Plaintiff fails to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the first element of her\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case. Second, discovery has simply failed to bear out the factual premise for this claim as Plaintiff has failed to unearth even a scintilla evidence to support the contention that ExpressJet denied Plaintiff's request in response to Ms. Hice's allegedly bigoted remarks, rather than in response to the issues raised by Ms. Hice's and Mr. Aafifi's (the more senior Flight Attendants) complaints about being forced to perform Plaintiff's duties to serve alcohol. The evidence reveals that ExpressJet received two complaints from Flight Attendants in the relatively short period of time (a few weeks) that Plaintiff was operating under the swapping of duties procedure, prompting ExpressJet to investigate the legal and operational implications of granting Plaintiff a permanent guarantee that would relieve her of her alcohol service duties on each of her ExpressJet flights. There is not one piece of evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that ExpressJet \"ratified\" (whatever that might mean in this context - Plaintiff certainly cites no case law explaining such \"retaliation by ratification\" theory) Ms. Hice's comments or in any way acted on or even considered Ms. Hice's allegedly bigoted remarks in denying Plaintiff's request that she be relieved of her duties to serve alcohol. In fact, ExpressJet granted Plaintiff's request to wear her hijab in November, 2013, long before Plaintiff sought an accommodation that would permit her to refuse to serve alcohol to passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   And Plaintiff ignores the undisputed fact that ExpressJet had also received and was responding to Mr. Aafifi's complaint, which specifically referenced Plaintiff's refusal to comply with his request, as the senior Flight Attendant in the \"A\" position, that she assist him with serving alcohol to first class passengers in the pre-departure phase of the flight. In addition, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's Union representative, Ms. Cooper, testified that she received commentes from \"a few\" Flight Attendants regarding Plaintiff's refusal to serve alcohol, some of whom viewed it as violating seniority rights. (Cooper Dep. 194:19-195:10.) Thus, the complaints appear to have been more widespread than just those formally reported to ExpressJet. There is simply nothing in this summary judgment record, beyond pure speculation, on which a jury could conclude that ExpressJet made the decision to deny Plaintiff's requested accommodation because of Ms. Hice's unsolicited remarks regarding Plaintiff's \"foreign reading materials\" and her hijab. Even assuming there is a legal theory that would allow such a \"retaliation by ratification\" theory to proceed, there is simply no factual basis for imputing Ms. Hice's allegedly discriminatory remarks to ExpressJet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Plaintiff has devoted little effort to developing a retaliation argument, and indeed doesn't even endeavor to address the basic elements of the claim. Issues \"adverted to ... in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\" are deemed waived.\n   <em>\n    Clemente v.

Plaintiff has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on her retaliation claim and ExpressJet is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   ExpressJet reads Plaintiff's retaliation claim more generously, and assumes for sake of argument that the \"protected activity\" was Plaintiff's request for an accommodation. ExpressJet submits, and the Court agrees, that such a claim also would also be preempted by the RLA because it would require interpretation of the CBA's seniority provisions in analyzing ExpressJet's proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to grant Plaintiff's accommodation and placing her on leave. If the system board were to determine that Plaintiff's requested accommodation would violate the seniority provisions of the CBA, this would be dispositive of any retaliation claim because a \"reason cannot be proved to be 'a pretext for discrimination' unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Virts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9445843\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/508/#p516\">\n    285 F.3d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A determination pursuant to the RLA arbitral process that the requested accommodation would in fact violate the CBA would preclude a finding that ExpressJet's proffered reason was false. Accordingly, the retaliation claim could not be decided without interpreting the CBA and an interpretation of the CBA could be dispositive of Plaintiff's retaliation claim, regardless of any evidence of ExpressJet's motive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emswiler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3509211\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/782/#p792\">\n    691 F.3d at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monroe v.
