He stated that \"[t]he claimed methods are not directed to a natural phenomenon - a difference in size of the maternal and fetal DNA in maternal blood plasma do not result in a natural phenomenon.\" He claimed that \"the DNA in maternal blood plasma is not the size discriminated fraction produced by the claimed methods\" and that \"[t]he fetal and maternal DNA found in nature is structurally different and does not exhibit the discussed new utility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.

The size distribution of the DNA from maternal blood plasma substantially changed after this size discrimination was performed: certain DNA fragments mostly of maternal origin were preferentially removed and were no longer present in the sample. The difference in structure is directly related to and demonstrated by the new utility for the altered DNA of maternal blood plasma in the claimed methods: detection of certain fetal genetic loci.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In sum, plaintiffs contend that changing the concentration of fetal DNA relative to maternal DNA in the sample creates a \"difference in structure\" which is not naturally occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The PTO originally rejected plaintiffs' applications stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Nothing is added by identifying the techniques to be used in selecting nucleic acids based on size because such techniques were the well-understood, routine and conventional techniques that a scientist would have thought of when instructed to enrich fetal DNA from a cell-free sample of maternal blood plasma or serum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs responded that \"it was thought the similarity of the fetal and maternal genomes and the complex mixture of fetal and maternal fragments, in terms of fragment sizes and diversity of sequences exhibited for a given fragment size, were insurmountable\" in isolating fetal DNA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.

The independent claims require three phases: extraction, size production, and selective removal. Each of the steps is described as well-known and conventional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 61. Plaintiffs suggest that the novelty of their invention is in the use of routine and conventional steps to isolate and analyze smaller DNA fragments. However, the Court finds that the 'inventive concept' is the application of the well-known routine and conventional techniques for extraction and removal. For example, the patents require \"extracting DNA,\" \"producing a fraction of DNA\", and discuss \"discrimination\" and \"removal steps.\" These broad terms are \"well-understood, routine, conventional activities previously known to the industry,\" particularly given that the claims provide them no more explicit definition.\n   <em>\n    Broadband iTV, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178442\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/135/1175/#p1188\">\n    135 F.Supp.3d at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiffs' evidence does not raise genuine issues of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The \"novelty\" of an idea is not enough in itself to confer patentability, where the novelty does not exceed the \"inventive concept\" limitations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamond v.

The claimed combination of elements lacks an inventive concept because the combination was well-understood, routine and conventional at the time of invention.\n   <em>\n    Exergen Corp. v.
