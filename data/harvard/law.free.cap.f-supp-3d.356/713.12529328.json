Defendant has responded (Doc. 255), and Plaintiffs have replied (Doc. 258). For the following reasons, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT IN PART\n   </strong>\n   the motion by Plaintiffs for attorney's fees and costs. (Doc. 252.) Accordingly, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n   Defendant to pay Plaintiffs $342,545.75 in attorney's fees and $6,703.75 in costs, totaling an amount of\n   <strong>\n    $349,249.50\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Also before the Court is a motion filed by Plaintiffs to file a supplemental declaration regarding Plaintiffs' petition for attorney's fees. (Doc. 262.) Because the Court considered Plaintiffs' requested rate to be reasonable based on memoranda filed regarding Plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees and costs, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion to file a supplemental declaration regarding Plaintiffs' petition for attorney's fees. (Doc. 262.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   L.H. is a fifteen-year-old boy with Down Syndrome. From 2009 to 2013, L.H. attended Normal Park Elementary School, a public school operating under the Hamilton County Department of Education (\"HCDE\"). In May 2013, L.H.'s parents rejected the individualized education program (\"IEP\") which had been developed by HCDE, instead deciding to enroll him at The Montessori School of Chattanooga (\"TMS\") for the 2013-2014 school year, L.H.'s third grade in school. L.H. has remained at TMS through the eighth grade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While L.H. received his education at TMS, his parents filed a complaint under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which requires states that receive federal funds to provide a \"free and appropriate education\" (a \"FAPE\") to every disabled child. Plaintiffs also brought claims under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Section 504\"), and other causes of action. (Doc. 64.) In November 2015, this\n   Court granted a motion by HCDE to sever Plaintiffs' IDEA claims from their other claims. (Doc. 121.) In December 2015, this Court approved a settlement agreement entered into between Plaintiffs and then-Defendant the Tennessee Department of Education (\"TDOE\"). (Doc. 138.) TDOE paid the sum of $65,000.00 into a special needs trust for the benefit of L.H, $75,000.00 to reimburse Plaintiffs D.H. and G.H. for expert and attorneys' fees, and $45,000.00 to Gilbert, Russell, McWherter, Scott &amp; Bobitt, PLC, for attorneys' fees incurred to that date. (Doc. 112 at 2-3.) HCDE was, afterwards, the only remaining Defendant. Ultimately, on the merits of Plaintiffs' IDEA claims, this Court determined that placement in accord with HCDE's 2013 IEP was more restrictive than necessary-and therefore improper. (Doc. 173.) This Court also determined that L.H.'s alternative private placement at TMS did not satisfy the IDEA, so L.H.'s parents were not entitled to reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both parties appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed that placement in accord with HCDE's 2013 IEP was more restrictive than necessary. (Doc. 249.) The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found, however, that the educational program at TMS satisfied the IDEA and that L.H.'s parents were therefore entitled to reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The appellate court accordingly observed that Plaintiffs' claims under the ADA and Section 504 were \"redundant\" and therefore pretermitted those claims in the appeal.

Gilbert has been named to the\n   <em>\n    Best Lawyers in America\n   </em>\n   List for 2018 and is AV rated by Martindale Hubbell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Former associate Jessica Solonus, a nine-year attorney who now has her own special education law firm, seeks her regular rate of $275 per hour. (Doc. 253-2.) Solonus declares that her prior firm set this rate in 2016 for billing in contingency-fee cases, and that the rate is consistent with billing rates for complex federal court civil rights matters in the Eastern District of Tennessee for a full-time associate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Solonus also has particular skill, experience, and reputation in the special education field. Her legal work primarily involves representing children with special needs in federal court and due process proceedings regarding issues under the IDEA, ADA, and Section 504. She is also a staff attorney for a national non-profit organization that advocates nationally for the rights of children with disabilities under the IDEA, ADA, and Section 504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Dean Hill Rivkin\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   declares that in view of the skill, experience and reputation of\n   the lawyers for Plaintiff, the fees fall \"well within the customary fees charged by lawyers with comparable credentials\" and are \"reasonable under all applicable standards.\" (Doc. 253-3.) Rivkin declares that in recent years, Gilbert has represented clients in path-breaking special education cases. In his opinion, Gilbert is the leading lawyer in the special education field in Tennessee. He states that Gilbert and Solonus exemplify the best of the legal profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Donna Mikel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a plaintiff's civil rights attorney and partner at the law firm of Burnette, Dobson, and Pinchack in Chattanooga, Tennessee, declares that the rates sought by Gilbert and Salonus \"are reasonable and well within the acceptable range for the Eastern District.\" (Doc. 253-5.) Donna Mikel references similar awards of attorney's fees in cases she has litigated. She also references the Laffey Matrix and the United States Attorney's Fees Matrix, which she attaches to her declaration. The Laffey Matrix reflects a rate of $864 for Justin Gilbert and $636 for Jessica Solonus for 2017-18.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adcock-Ladd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189098\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/343/#p349\">\n    227 F.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying in part of the Laffey Matrix). The United States Attorney's Fees Matrix reflects a rate of $543 for Justin Gilbert and $395 for Jessica Solonus for 2016-17. In determining whether the rates sought by Gilbert and Solonus were reasonable, Mikel declares that she took into account the fact that the work in this matter was more complex than a typical employment law or civil rights matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant argues that the declarations of Plaintiff's proffered legal professionals are inadequate because those individuals are not in a position to \"accurately assess what precisely constitutes a customary rate in a case such as this.\" (Doc. 255 at 19.) Defendant instead submits the affidavits of Melinda Jacobs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   an attorney who was active in special education law for thirty-two years, and Scott Bennett, a twenty-four-year attorney. (Docs. 255-3, 255-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Melinda Jacobs attested that, effective September 1, 2017, she raised her hourly rate from $250 per hour to $275 per hour, and that based on her expertise in education law and experience, she believed that to be a reasonable rate for an attorney in Tennessee with a level of experience comparable to hers in the special education field. Jacobs stated that since September 1996, she had exclusively represented school agencies in special education law matters. Beginning in 1999, she owned and operated her own law firm, the Law Office of Melinda Jacobs, in Townsend, Tennessee and Franklin, Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Scott Bennett, a twenty-four-year attorney in the Chattanooga, Tennessee area, attests that his hourly rate for his highest paying education law client is $195 per hour, but that $170 per hour is his normal rate for most litigation work. Bennett has been lead counsel for HCDE in this case\n   since its inception. He attests that, over time, his practice has developed to the point that education law and representation of local boards of education accounts for almost the entirety of his practice. On this particular case, Bennett and his law partner, Mary C. DeCamp, both worked for $150 to $170 per hour. Bennett adds that, prior to seeing Gilbert at the due process hearing in October 2013, Bennett had never heard of Gilbert, or his firm, in the special education context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs point out that Defendant does not offer a single parent-side practitioner to disagree with the rates sought by Plaintiffs' counsel. That distinction is important, Plaintiffs argue, in that a school-side practitioner can rely upon a school district to seek legal services as a \"repeat player.\" School-side practitioners do not undertake the substantial risk that parent-side attorneys take by engaging clients via contingent fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamlin v.

[T]he reasonable hourly rate may be adjusted upward to account for the risk of non-payment inherent in a contingency fee arrangement\"). Here, at the outset, Plaintiffs paid their lawyers a total of $75,000, $15,000 of which was to cover expert fees and $60,000 was to cover the beginning of attorney's fees. Plaintiffs' lawyers agreed to carry the case beyond that stage based on the uncertain prospect of obtaining statutory attorney's fees. Gilbert declares he knew when taking on the case that his law firm was certain to have to bill time beyond what the original $60,000 could cover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff also cites cases where the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has approved of $400 requested hourly rates, or where courts within the Circuit have approved rates nearing $400.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waldo v.

Dolgencorp\n   </em>\n   , which awarded a $350 fee to an attorney in Knoxville who had requested a $400 rate, and who had similar experience to lead counsel here. He declares that a major reason cited for the $50 deduction in that matter was the belief that $350 an hour was sufficient to attract competent counsel to an employment discrimination case. (Doc. 253-3 at 5.) Rivkin argues that the same reasoning should not apply to a special education case, where lawyers are not \"flocking\" to the smaller, niche practice area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Donna Mikel notes that in 2017, she was awarded a $400 uncontested fee when serving as local counsel for a California law class action case.\n   <em>\n    Tami Long v.

Considering inflation, that award would be considerably more than a $400 rate today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to Salonus's rate of $275, she attests that her prior law firm set her 2016 billing rate at $275 for contingency-fee cases. In 2012, she was approved by the Middle District of Tennessee in a contested fee dispute for $250 per hour. Again, considering inflation, that award would be more than a $275 rate today. And in 2016, she was compensated in a fee petition at the rate of $275 per hour in the Western District of Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs' remarks regarding the contingent nature and risk of being a parent-side practitioner in the special education context, in particular, are well-taken. Through Plaintiffs' collective evidence, and having considered Defendant's arguments regarding it, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating that each of the rates claimed by Plaintiffs' counsel are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.\n   <em>\n    Blum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338115\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/886/#p888\">\n    465 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   806 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338115\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/886/#p888\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant makes two additional arguments regarding the span of years that this matter has remained in litigation. Defendant contends that, even if this Court were to determine that the rate of $400 per hour is a reasonable rate for Gilbert's compensation, the Court should not assign that rate for any tasks dated prior to January 2017-when Gilbert raised his rate to $400 per hour. Defendant also argues that, for the duration of Jessica Salonus's involvement in this matter, she was a four-to six-year attorney and should not be compensated at her current market rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The decision to apply historic or current billing rates is within a district court's discretion \"so long as it explains how the decision comports with the ultimate goals of awarding reasonable fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonter v.

Plaintiff's counsel began conferring with L.H.'s parents regarding possible representation in October 2013. (Doc. 253-1.) The lawsuit was initially filed in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee in February 2014. (Doc. 1-1.) It has lasted nearly five years, involved a bench trial and multiple dispositive motions, and has resulted in a published opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L.H. v.

Gilbert attests that he does not know of any other parent-side attorneys in Tennessee who would have accepted the risk of litigating a least-restrictive-environment case for a child with an intellectual disability. He also attests that the case was\n   not only trying for his law firm, but that it was emotionally and physically tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A special education case like L.H.'s is usually financially impractical for parents to carry beyond an initial due process hearing, absent the willingness of a lawyer to gamble upon his or her ultimate success and the fee shifting provisions of the civil rights laws. The Court is mindful that if \"no compensation were provided for the delay in payment, the prospect of such hardship could well deter otherwise willing attorneys from accepting complex civil rights cases that might offer great benefit to society at large.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213071\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/274/#p284\">\n    491 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213071\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/274/#p284\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Taken together, the lodestar calculation would result in $483,831.25 in attorney's fees, exclusive of costs. Plaintiffs instead request $378,831.25 in attorneys' fees, exclusive of costs. This amount includes an offset of $105,000.00 for fees TDOE already paid to Plaintiffs as part of its settlement. Gilbert declares that the full credit is somewhat of a disadvantage to his law firm, as some of the work included in that $105,000.00 related to issues unique to TDOE, but that he is giving the full credit to HCDE in order to avoid further argument on the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant takes issue with two main aspects of Plaintiffs proffered timesheet, arguing (1) it includes time spent on Plaintiffs' claims under the ADA, Section 504,\n   and other causes of action, under which Plaintiffs did not prevail and which were superfluous, and (2) it uses quarter-hour billing increments which improperly inflate the amount of billable hours worked and documented. In addition, Defendant conducted a line-by-line review of Plaintiffs' timesheet, objecting on various different grounds to approximately 187 of Plaintiffs' 616 time entries. (Doc. 255-2.) The Court will address each of Defendant's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, Defendant argues Plaintiffs did not prevail on their ADA, Section 504, and other various claims, and that they are, thus, not entitled to any fees for time spent working on them. The Court is not convinced by this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This Court granted Plaintiffs judgment on their ADA and Section 504 claims. (Doc. 212.) The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit briefly addressed those claims in a footnote, stating that it would not analyze them on the merits since Plaintiffs were already due the full relief they requested under their IDEA claims. It is difficult to conceive how this exercise in judicial restraint could be characterized as Plaintiffs being \"unsuccessful\" on those claims. Instead, Plaintiffs were so successful that the appellate court did not have to resort to exploring Plaintiffs' further theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Regardless, \"a civil-rights plaintiff need not succeed on every claim in order to recover attorney's fees.

Plaintiffs have been particularly successful in this litigation. When Plaintiffs' counsel took on L.H.'s case, L.H. had lost at the state due process level. Now, L.H.'s right to be mainstreamed, avoiding placement in a full time, segregated classroom located in a different school outside of his neighborhood zone, has been vindicated. L.H.'s parents' right to appropriate reimbursement for payments made to TMS has also been vindicated. This case has resulted in multiple opinions favorable to Plaintiffs regarding issues such as application of the\n   <em>\n    Roncker\n   </em>\n   factors as to a child with an intellectual disability and the schooling of a child with an intellectual disability at a Montessori school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' counsel also notes that L.H. helped to galvanize Hamilton County in making reforms for integrating more children who have special needs. Counsel notes that after L.H. prevailed before this Court, Hamilton County's Director of Special Education presented plans to the school board to provide more opportunities for children with disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Factors such as the time and labor involved, the novelty and difficulty of the questions, and the skill requisite to perform the services also point in favor of Plaintiffs. As previously mentioned, this case has lasted nearly five years, and has resulted in over 250 docket entries at the district court level, a seven-day trial at the district court level, and an oral argument before the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. This lawsuit involved issues regarding Down Syndrome generally and L.H.'s progress in school specifically, three different relevant schools (Normal Park, Red Bank CDC, and TMS), the standard for mainstreaming disabled students, the roll of experts, teachers, and educational staff members in IDEA cases, as well as appropriate private placement for purposes of reimbursement under the IDEA, among other issues. This Court has previously commented that this was a difficult case, and that the evidence, when considered as a whole, was \"extremely close.\" (Doc. 172.) Plaintiffs' counsel additionally comments that HCDE was represented by seasoned and experienced lawyers. Plaintiffs' counsel remarks he agrees with the\n   opening comment of opposing counsel during oral argument before the Sixth Circuit, where he stated, \"Judges, the case before you this morning is arguably the most important special education case that the Sixth Circuit has considered in the past thirty-five years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As to the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case, Plaintiffs' counsel declares that the complexity of L.H.'s case prevented him from taking on at least twenty other education or employment law cases. The Court has no reason to disbelieve this assertion, as this averages approximately four lost cases per year. Defendant asks too much in arguing that Plaintiffs' counsel should have described cases which were lost in detail and offered information in support. Because this is a significant number of cases, this factor weighs in favor of awarding the full lodestar value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Most of the remaining\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   factors-such as the customary fee, whether the fee is fixed or contingent, the experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys, and awards in similar cases-have already been addressed, above. Two additional factors-the undesirability of the case and the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client-also favor Plaintiffs. When Plaintiffs' counsel took on the case, L.H. had already lost at the due process level, and as discussed above, Plaintiffs' counsel was wary of the potential for significant monetary losses. Plaintiffs' counsel states that the attorney client relationship in this case has held tight, L.H.'s parents having recently traveled to Cincinnati to watch oral arguments in person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The final factor which has not yet been addressed-time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances-likely weighs in favor of Defendant. Plaintiffs do not make any argument they were under a time limitation or constraint in this matter after the initial due process phase. Mindful, however, that the degree of success obtained is the most important factor in determining the reasonableness of the fee award, and in light of many of the other factors weighing in Plaintiffs' favor, the Court declines to adjust the lodestar value based on this single factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hobby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925002\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/103/#p114\">\n    506 U.S. at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925002\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/103/#p114\">\n    113 S.Ct. 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   factors do not present an occasion to deviate from an award of the previously calculated lodestar value in this case, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n   an award of $342,545.75 in attorney's fees to Plaintiff's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In support, Plaintiffs have submitted invoices for photocopies, litigation support services, and court filing fees. (Doc. 253-1 at 42-47.) In response, Defendant states that Plaintiffs provided appropriate documentary support for the costs they incurred. (Doc. 255 at 28.)

Accordingly, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n   Defendant to pay Plaintiffs $342,545.75 in attorney's fees and $6,703.75 in costs, totaling an amount of\n   <strong>\n    $349,249.50\n   </strong>\n   .

In response to each motion, Defendant argued that the Sixth Circuit order was stayed because HCDE had filed a timely petition for rehearing\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    with the Sixth Circuit. Plaintiffs acknowledged that a request for rehearing\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    had been filed, but did not wish to waive a twenty-one-day deadline set by this Court to refile a motion for attorney's fees. (Doc. 248 at 2-3.) Because a mandate has since issued, jurisdiction before this Court is now proper.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Rivkin is the Williford Gragg Distinguished Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of Tennessee College of Law in Knoxville, Tennessee.
