The parties then filed their first set of motions for summary judgment. Dkt. 15; Dkt. 16. After considering those submissions, the Court ruled in favor of the SEC on some issues and in favor of Edelman on others. The Court agreed with the SEC that Edelman had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to one of his six requests.\n   <em>\n    Edelman I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345758\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/133/#p138\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d at 142-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court ruled in Edelman's favor, however, on three issues. The Court first held that the SEC should have broadly construed one of Edelman's FOIA requests to seek \"consumer complaints,\" and not simply records reflecting the SEC's responses to those complaints.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345758\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/133/#p138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345758\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/133/#p138\">\n    at 155-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Court held that the SEC erred in treating attorneys' notes as categorically beyond the scope of FOIA and, instead, should have determined on a case-by-case basis whether the notes were exempt from disclosure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345758\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/133/#p138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345758\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/133/#p138\">\n    at 147-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the Court held that it could not determine whether one document was properly redacted pursuant to Exemption 5 and, accordingly, ordered that the SEC produce an unredacted version of the document to the Court for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345758\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/133/#p138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345758\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/133/#p138\">\n    at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Edelman I\n   </em>\n   , the SEC released 1,446 pages of consumer complaints, 71 pages of attorney notes, and (without the need for further judicial intervention) an unredacted version of the document that the Court had directed the SEC to submit for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    Edelman II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267688\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/45/#p48\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   50 n.3. The parties then renewed their cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26; Dkt. 28. This time, the Court rejected Edelman's contentions that the SEC had conducted an inadequate search for \"consumer complaints\" and that it had improperly invoked the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    Edelman II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267688\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/45/#p48\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at 51-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, however, was unable to resolve the question whether the SEC had permissibly redacted the names of seventy individuals who had filed consumer complaints with the agency because\n   the existing record lacked \"sufficient information for the Court to conduct the required balancing, and because the SEC ... should conduct the relevant balancing in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267688\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/45/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267688\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/45/#p48\">\n    at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, accordingly, denied both parties' motions for summary judgment with respect to that one issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267688\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/45/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The SEC subsequently disclosed the identities of thirty-four of the seventy complainants and withheld the names of the remaining thirty-six complainants.\n   <em>\n    Edelman III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524496\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/421/#p423\">\n    302 F.Supp.3d at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the SEC explained, the thirty-four complainants whose identities were disclosed had, elsewhere, engaged in public activity relating to the ESRT transaction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524496\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/421/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the remaining thirty-six complainants had not publicly associated themselves with the issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524496\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/421/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties once again moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 37; Dkt. 39. The third time around, the Court ruled in the SEC's favor, holding that the unidentified complainants had a substantial privacy interest in nondisclosure and that the public's interest in disclosure was\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Edelman III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524496\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/421/#p423\">\n    302 F.Supp.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
