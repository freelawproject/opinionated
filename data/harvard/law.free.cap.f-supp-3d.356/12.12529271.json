KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Scattered across the United States, telecommunications sites support the ubiquitous phone and internet services on which customers increasingly rely. Crown Castle GT Company, LLC (\"Crown\") operates a telecommunications site in New Mexico, on federal land managed by Defendant Bureau of Land Management (BLM). In 2003, Alamosa Properties LP (\"Alamosa\")-a subsidiary of Plaintiff Sprint Corporation (together with Alamosa, \"Sprint\")-entered into a sublease with Crown that permitted it to place antennas on Crown's existing cellular tower and designated a lease area upon which Sprint planned to install items known as cellular cabinets. A few years later, BLM promulgated a regulation requiring any subtenant on a telecommunications site that owns an \"equipment shelter\" present there to obtain a separate BLM authorization for it and pay a related fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case concerns BLM's subsequent application of this regulation and the relevant authorizing statute to Sprint's cellular cabinets. In 2013, BLM initiated a trespass action against Sprint, assessing penalties against it for failing to obtain a BLM authorization for its cellular cabinets, on the theory that the cabinets qualified as \"equipment shelters\" under the regulation. Sprint appealed this determination to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA or \"Board\"), arguing that it did not trespass and that, even if it did, BLM lacked statutory authority to impose the penalties in question. The IBLA largely sided with BLM. Through this action, Sprint appeals the IBLA's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that (1) the IBLA's determination that Sprint trespassed on public land because its cellular cabinets qualified as equipment shelters under the relevant regulation was not arbitrary and capricious, and (2) the IBLA's assessment of penalties against Sprint for its failure to obtain a right-of-way authorization for the cellular cabinets did not exceed its statutory authority. Therefore, the Court will deny Sprint's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 23) and grant Defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The 2008 Site Plan \"govern[ed] development and management of\" the Site, AR 544, and was \"incorporated into all leases, grants, and reservations issued\" for the Site, AR 547. It included pictures of Sprint's cellular cabinets and labeled them on a diagram of the Site. AR 568, 590.

As a result, BLM issued a trespass notice (\"the Trespass Notice\") to Sprint on May 29, 2013. AR 655-58. The Trespass Notice stated that BLM had discovered equipment operating at the Site that it believed belonged to Sprint. AR 655. On July 2, 2013, Sprint responded to the Trespass Notice, making the case that it was not trespassing because it was occupying the Site pursuant to its Sublease with Crown. AR 659-61. On July 23, 2013, BLM issued a trespass decision (the \"Trespass Decision\") against Sprint. AR 670-78. It concluded that Sprint had violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202808.10\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2808.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the regulation defining trespass, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202806.36\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2806.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Second, it contends that even if it needed a separate right-of-way authorization, BLM did in fact repeatedly authorize it to place its cellular cabinets on the Site. Third, Sprint asserts that, in light of BLM's purported authorizations of the cabinets and the agency's delay in bringing the trespass action against it, the Court should invoke equitable estoppel against Defendants to find in its favor.

A shelter is defined as \"something that covers or affords protection [especially] from the elements.\" Webster's Third International Dictionary, 2093 (1986). This definition includes the cellular cabinets at issue here. Indeed, at oral argument, Sprint's counsel acknowledged that its cabinets store communications equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. at 14:4-6 (The Court: \"[The cabinets] do store equipment inside them. That's fair to say; right?\" Counsel: \"Right.\"). And photographs in the record show that the cabinets\n   are large enough to easily \"afford protection\" to equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 590, 626 (Photo D), 644-47. Moreover, neither party has pointed to any authority suggesting that the cabinets cannot be\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   equipment and \"equipment shelters\" under the 2005 Regulation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oral Arg.

Thus, the IBLA's conclusion that Sprint's cellular cabinets \"fall under the regulation's purview\" because they \"clearly house equipment\" was not arbitrary and capricious, irrespective of whether it receives deference.\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   , 186 IBLA at 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nonetheless, both parties seem to assume that the term \"equipment shelter\" is in fact ambiguous.

And Sprint appears to suggest as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 20 (recognizing that \"the IBLA acknowledged that the regulations do not specifically mention 'cabinets,' i.e., that they are ambiguous in that regard\").

But the fact that a contract between two private parties used the word \"equipment\" says nothing about how the 2005 Regulation should be interpreted by BLM. Similarly, Sprint points out that the Sublease had \"Special Conditions\" that included specifications for \"cabinets.\" Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 21. But these \"conditions\" were part of a generic form outlining the standards for installing many different items at the Site ranging from connectors to antennas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 977-90.

BLM's Purported Authorization of the Cellular Cabinets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, Sprint argues that even if BLM had to authorize its cabinets, the administrative record demonstrates that it in fact did so. Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 25-28. Specifically, Sprint identifies four documents that it argues authorized the cabinets: (1) the 2003 Sublease between Crown and Sprint; (2) a 2004 \"estoppel\" letter that BLM signed for Crown stating that Crown was not in default under the Prime Lease; (3) the renewal of the Prime Lease between Crown and Sprint in December 2005; and (4) the 2008 Site Plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596027\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/452/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In Sprint's view, the IBLA Decision was \"arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, and premised on clear errors of law and fact\" because it failed to account for these authorizations. Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But none of these documents comes close to authorizing Sprint's cabinets. Thus, they provide no basis for this Court to set aside the IBLA decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, the record is devoid of support for the proposition that Sprint properly sought, much less obtained, a BLM right-of-way authorization for the cabinets. The FLPMA requires an applicant seeking authorization from BLM to submit \"plans, contracts, agreements, or other information reasonably related to the use, or intended use, of the right-of-way, including its effect on competition.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201761\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). BLM regulations further specify what must be included in such an application, and direct applicants to file a Standard Form 299 (\"SF-299\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202804.12\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2804.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sprint does not contest the government's assertion that it never submitted such a form for its cellular cabinets on the Site. Thus, it did not seek or obtain authorization for them as instructed by the statutory and regulatory framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, the documents on which Sprint relies do not materially undermine the IBLA's conclusion that BLM did not authorize its cellular cabinets. The first two documents Sprint identifies-the Sublease and the estoppel letter-clearly do not authorize its cabinets. The Sublease is a contract to which BLM was not even a party. In addition, the Sublease merely authorized Sprint to place antennas on Crown's tower and designated a \"lease area\" on the Site for Sprint's use. AR 962, 997. The\n   Sublease does not specifically refer to Sprint's cabinets, nor does it purport to grant Sprint its own right-of-way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, it does not appear that Crown even had the authority to authorize the cabinets, since its subleasing authority was \"subject to the terms and conditions of the original ROW grant,\" \"[a]ll applicable regulations in 43 CFR 2800,\" and \"[s]tipulations agreed to by holder in the original ROW grant.\" AR 366. And nothing in Crown's original grant suggests that it could have authorized Sprint's cabinets, which are also not referenced therein.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 59-60. The estoppel letter fares no better as a purported authorization. BLM sent the estoppel letter to Crown, not Sprint, and the letter states only that Crown was not in default under the Prime Lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 413-16. Like the Sublease, the estoppel letter does not refer to or address the authorization of Sprint's cabinets at all. Finally, both the Sublease and the estoppel letter were executed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the 2005 Regulation was promulgated, making it difficult to construe them as guaranteeing Sprint's compliance with a regulation that did not yet exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The next document Sprint identifies-the 2005 renewal of the Prime Lease-also provides it no help. Sprint notes that the renewed lease, executed in December 2005, required Crown to provide BLM with an annual inventory of customers and tenants. Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 26 (citing AR 487). Sprint also points out that the renewed lease required that \"[a]ll ... equipment located [on] the property must be in accordance with stipulations in the communications site plan approved by the authorized officer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202804.12\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting AR 487). In Sprint's view, these terms show that BLM was aware of, and therefore authorized, the cellular cabinets. The Court disagrees. The 2005 renewal does not mention the cabinets, and as explained below, the \"communications site plan\"-the 2008 Site Plan-makes clear that it is not a substitute for an authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Sprint also argues that its cabinets were listed on a table as \"Authorized Facilities\" in the 2008 Site Plan. Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 26-27;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 570. The 2008 Site Plan, however, is a general guidance document that by its own terms \"must be used in conjunction with [a] granting authorization.\" AR 547. As such, it cannot provide the authorization that the 2005 Regulation requires. In fact, the 2008 Site Plan explicitly reemphasizes Sprint's obligation to submit a SF-229 to BLM to obtain an authorization. It states that \"[t]enants ... may not construct their own equipment shelter (building, shelter or cabinet).\" AR 548. And \"[i]f that is not possible, a separate SF-229 application ... and authorization are required,\" which \"will also result in the use being a tenant/customer of the original lease/holder in addition[ ] to being a separate facility for billing purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202804.12\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the table to which Sprint cites undermines its argument that the 2008 Site Plan authorized its cabinets. The table lists various structures and their authorization numbers-but the entry for Sprint's cabinets noticeably does not include any such number.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 570 (showing \"Auth\n   # NMNM xxxxxx\" for \"South Facility # 4 Alamosa (Sprint)\"). Thus, if anything, the table confirms that Sprint's cabinets were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   authorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In short, the IBLA's conclusion that BLM did not authorize the placement of Sprint's cabinets on the Site is supported by more than substantial evidence, and there is no basis for the Court to set it aside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

BLM's Statutory Authority to Assess the Penalties Against Sprint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, Sprint argues that, even if its cellular cabinets constitute an illegal trespass, BLM exceeded its authority under the FLPMA in assessing penalties against it. Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 16-20. The FLPMA provides that \"[t]he holder of a right-of-way shall pay in advance the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Secretary granting, issuing, or renewing such right-of-way.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201764\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Relying on this provision, Sprint argues that BLM exceeded its statutory authority because Sprint was charged for both rent as Crown's tenant and for Sprint's own separate right-of-way authorizing its cellular cabinets. In Sprint's view, these charges, taken together, violate the statute because they require it to pay more than \"fair market value\" for its use of the Site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Significantly, however, Sprint does not challenge the individual formulas through which BLM calculated the \"fair market value\" of (1) Crown's right-of-way (and the portion passed on to Sprint as a tower tenant), and (2) Sprint's own right-of-way authorizing its cabinets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 16-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 3-5 &amp; n.1 (describing how BLM calculated rent for each of the Site uses). Therefore, its argument is based solely on the fact that it was\n   charged two separate fees for them. In Sprint's view, BLM is \"collecting two rental payments totaling more than fair market value for the same use of the ... Site.\" Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 16 (emphasis removed). But in Defendants' view, Sprint is being charged for \"fundamentally different uses\" of the Site, both of which are authorized by BLM regulations. Defs.' MSJ Br. at 21-23 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202806.36\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2806.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (c) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On the record before it, the Court cannot conclude that BLM exceeded its statutory authority simply by requiring Sprint to pay two separate fees in connection with these two separate rights-of-way. Each fee is associated with a separate and distinct right to use federal land, for which the FLPMA requires BLM to charge fair market value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, pursuant to the Sublease, Sprint paid rent to Crown for its right to install four specifically-described antennas on Crown's tower, and for Crown to designate a \"lease area\" for Sprint. AR 962, 997. Crown kept a portion of this rent and passed another portion on to BLM. AR 963; Pl.'s MSJ Br. at 8 (citing AR 405, 403, 410, 446, 517, 527, 592, 597, 602, 605, 607). And second, by enacting the 2005 Regulation and interpreting it to cover cellular cabinets, BLM determined that Sprint was required to make a second set of payments for a right-of-way to install its cabinets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Sprint's argument is predicated on its contention that prior to being required to pay for its own right-of-way to install its cabinets, it was\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   paying fair market value for its\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   use of the Site pursuant to the Sublease (and Crown's right-of-way), such that requiring it to pay an additional fee violated the FLPMA. But on the present record, where Sprint has not challenged the various formulas used by BLM to calculate fair market value, the Court simply has no basis to agree. By promulgating the 2005 Regulation and interpreting it to include cellular cabinets, BLM effectively concluded that the fair market value of installing Sprint's cabinets on public land had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been adequately captured by the rent Sprint had been paying in connection with Crown's right-of-way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, it determined that\n   Sprint had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been paying fair market value for its\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   use of the Site. Whatever the merits of that determination, the record here simply provides no basis for the Court to second-guess it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Therefore, the Court cannot conclude that BLM exceeded its statutory authority under the FLPMA merely by requiring Sprint to pay two separate fees in connection with these two separate rights-of-way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
