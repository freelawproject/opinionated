Though school administrators suspended the Trimbur boy and his parents promised to supervise him, he continued harassing Julia Morath before her death by suicide. Julia Morath's parents now seek damages in Pennsylvania state court from the Trimbur boy and his parents alleging negligence caused their daughter's death by suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Trimbur boy and his mother asked their homeowner insurer to defend and indemnify them in state court. The insurer contractually agreed in the homeowner's insurance policy to provide a defense to a suit arising from an \"occurrence,\" defined as an \"accident\" under Pennsylvania Law. The insurer argues because the Trimbur boy sent the text message, there is no \"accident,\" at least as to him. The Trimbur boy counters Pennsylvania law requires we consider the foreseeability of the injury from his perspective, and while he cannot dispute sending the text message, Julia Morath's death by suicide constituted an extraordinary intervening event is far beyond anything contemplated in the text message and unforeseeable to him. The parties have not cited, and we cannot find, Pennsylvania law addressing whether the Trimbur boy's alleged negligence possibly leading to this ever more prevalent tragedy among our students is an occurrence mandating coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   But Pennsylvania courts have defined the underlying principles. And when we carefully examine the principles underlying coverage for \"accidents\" under Pennsylvania law, we hold the insurer must defend the Trimbur boy in the underlying state court case because the negligence claim against him falls within the scope of the \"occurrence\" language in the insurer's homeowners' policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

We find these events constitute an \"occurrence\" and State Farm must provide a defense to Zach Trimbur under the Policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    An insurer's duty to defend \"requires the insurer to cover the costs of defending the insured against a lawsuit.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    In Pennsylvania, like many states, \"[a]n insurer's duty to defend an insured in litigation is broader than the duty to indemnify, in that the former duty arises whenever an underlying complaint may potentially come within the insurance coverage.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    We determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend \"by defining the scope of coverage under the insurance policy on which the insured relies and comparing the scope of coverage to the allegations of the underlying complaint.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    Under Pennsylvania's \"four corners\" rule, we must limit our analysis solely to the underlying complaint itself and the terms of the insurance policy.\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    If, after conducting this analysis, we conclude even \"a single claim in [this] multiclaim lawsuit is potentially covered, the insurer must defend all claims until there is no possibility that the underlying plaintiff could recover on a covered claim.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    We may conclude State Farm has no duty to defend only if \"it is apparent on the face of the [underlying] complaint that none of the injuries fall within the purview of the insurance policy.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n    With these principles in mind, we turn now to the Policy's relevant language.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     A. A precondition to personal liability coverage under Policy is an \"occurrence,\" defined as an \"accident.\"\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Under the Policy, personal liability coverage is triggered only when the claim or suit for \"bodily injury or property damage to which this coverage applies [is] caused by an\n    <em>\n     occurrence.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <footnotemark>\n     29\n    </footnotemark>\n    \"Occurrence,\" State Farm argues, is the operative term.

They allege Zach Trimbur's conduct was \"unreasonable, negligent, grossly negligent, careless, and reckless and [he] intentionally breached his duty to exercise due care generally\" and in various particular respects, including, among other thing, his \"fail[ure] to use his cell phone in a reasonable manner,\" his failure to cease his conduct after his suspension from school, and acting \"with a reckless disregard to Julia Morath's health and safety.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     35\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Moraths also allege Zach Trimbur acted \"wanton[ly] and willful[ly].\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     36\n    </footnotemark>\n    They seek damages relating to the \"large and various expenses for the funeral, burial and estate administration expenses for which [they] are entitled,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     37\n    </footnotemark>\n    as well as a variety of other damages, including the loss of Julia Morath's future earning capacity.\n    <footnotemark>\n     38\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     C. State Farm must defend Zach Trimbur because the underlying negligence claim falls within the scope of the Policy.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    State Farm argues it has no duty to defend Zach Trimbur because a prerequisite to coverage under the Policy is an \"occurrence,\" defined in relevant part as an \"accident,\" and Pennsylvania courts hold similarly tortious acts do not contain the degree of fortuity inherent in the meaning of \"accident.\" State Farm emphasizes we must focus our analysis on the underlying act itself-not the chain of consequences flowing from it. Applying this focus on the insured's act alone, State Farm argues Zach Trimbur intentionally cyberbullied and harassed Julia Morath, and thus no \"accident\" occurred triggering coverage. Zach Trimbur counters State Farm focuses too narrowly on the intentionality of the act; intentional acts can, and often do, have unintended consequences, and Pennsylvania courts accordingly consider whether an insured could have reasonably foreseen the resulting injury. Applying this focus on the fortuity of the result, Zach Trimbur argues Julia Morath's death by suicide was an extraordinary intervening event unforeseeable to him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     1. State Farm misplaces its reliance on Pennsylvania decisions holding faulty workmanship claims do not arise from an \"accident.\"\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Directing our focus to the Trimbur boy's text message, State Farm argues the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Kvaerner Metals Division of Kvaerner, U.S., Inc. v.

We agree with State Farm to this extent. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's oft-cited decision in\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant, Inc. v. Nationwide Insurance Co.\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     58\n    </footnotemark>\n    is illustrative of the principle claims for assault do not arise from an accident.

The victim in the underlying case alleged State Farm's policyholder \"violently struck [her] on and about\n    various parts of her body with great force and violence, pulled [her] from her car, pushed and shoved [her] and knocked [her] to the ground.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     62\n    </footnotemark>\n    Judge Jones granted summary judgment to State Farm, finding the policyholder's alleged conduct did not constitute an \"accident\" triggering coverage under the policy.\n    <footnotemark>\n     63\n    </footnotemark>\n    \"There is no factual allegation that suggests Scalia's actions were unintentional or fortuitous,\" Judge Jones found.\n    <footnotemark>\n     64\n    </footnotemark>\n    The victim's complaint, he held, \"ultimately makes out a claim for the intentional tort of assault and battery, which inherently does not suggest an accident.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     65\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v.

Two of the counts in the underlying complaint described the son's conduct as \"negligent.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     72\n    </footnotemark>\n    Judge Ackerman nonetheless found the conduct similar enough to the assault in\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant, Inc.\n    </em>\n    to conclude the minor boy's \"conduct was not an 'accident' and, therefore, was not an 'occurrence' that would trigger coverage under the [insurance] policy.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     73\n    </footnotemark>\n    Judge Ackerman, citing\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , explained \"[w]here a policy\n    defines an 'occurrence' as an 'accident,' a willful and malicious assault is not an 'occurrence' requiring coverage.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     74\n    </footnotemark>\n    The boys' conduct, \"albeit not as severe as that ascribed to the adult in [\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ], is nonetheless still an assault, still willful, and still malicious, in that even a child in elementary school knows what actions will agitate and disturb his peers.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     75\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Zach Trimbur distinguishes\n    <em>\n     Ruff\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    He argues the case is of limited relevance because it lacks an intervening event analogous to Julia Morath's death by suicide. The distinction is apt, because in\n    <em>\n     Ruff\n    </em>\n    -as in\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Scalia\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    -the boys inflicted the physical harm directly upon the victim and there existed no evidence of third party action. Julia Morath's parents allege a different chain of causation. They allege Zach Trimbur harassed and bullied their daughter, which rendered her so emotionally distraught she inflicted bodily injury upon herself. The simple assault cases and\n    <em>\n     Ruff\n    </em>\n    are ill-suited to this more complex chain of alleged causation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Pennsylvania authority considering third-party conduct in the context of the duty to defend provides more persuasive guidance.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Outside the categories of faulty workmanship and simple assaults, courts applying Pennsylvania law consider the foreseeability of the resulting injury, even in cases in which the bodily injury is indisputably caused by an intentional act. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court embraced this principle decades ago in\n    <em>\n     Mohn v. American Casualty Co.\n    </em>\n    , holding the bodily injuries to the insured's son \"were sustained as a result of accidental bodily injury within the terms of the policy\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     76\n    </footnotemark>\n    even though police shot him while \"attempting to flee from the scene of a burglary he was in the process of committing.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     77\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held \"the fact that the event causing the injury may be traceable to an intentional act of a third party does not preclude the occurrence from being an 'accident,' \" and \"[t]hus, the test of whether injury is a result of an accident is to be determined from the viewpoint of the insured and not from the viewpoint of the one that committed the act causing the injury.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     78\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Our Court of Appeals applied this principle in\n    <em>\n     Nationwide v.

Nationwide, relying on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant\n    </em>\n    , argued on appeal \"the court must focus on the nature of the act which inflicted the injury or directly caused the death, and that act must be unintentional, even when an insured is sued for negligently failing to prevent or for contributing to the harmful intentional acts of the person who directly inflicted the injury or caused the death.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     85\n    </footnotemark>\n    Our Court of Appeals described Nationwide's argument as \"premised on a misreading of\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant\n    </em>\n    ,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     86\n    </footnotemark>\n    The complaint in\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant\n    </em>\n    \"alleged\n    <em>\n     solely\n    </em>\n    an intentional act and contained\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n    allegations of negligence on the part of its insured,\" and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the case therefore \"came to the unremarkable conclusion that an intentional tort was not an accident and thus not a covered occurrence under the policy.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     87\n    </footnotemark>\n    Our Court of Appeals described \"[t]he present suit against Pipher [as] clearly distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant\n    </em>\n    :\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     88\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    Here, the plaintiff's complaint raises numerous allegations of negligence on the part of Pipher, which allegedly contributed to Bernine McFadden's death.

Wood to paint the second floor apartment.\" Although Bernine McFadden's death was the direct result of a third party's intentional conduct, the complaint alleges that the insured's own negligence also played a significant part in her death. In the absence of any Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent directly on point, we believe that if confronted with this question, that court would find this distinction alone to be sufficient to hold that an insurance company has a duty to defend its insured against complaints alleging negligent conduct on the part of the insured as well as a third party's intentional conduct.\n    <footnotemark>\n     89\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court further endorsed this line of reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Donegal Mutual Insurance Company v.

In\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    , the insurer sought a declaratory judgment it had no duty to defend its insured in a bodily injury claim arising out of a pre-planned murder-suicide. The insured went to his ex-wife's home to kill her and then commit suicide, but the ex-wife's boyfriend-the plaintiff in the underlying personal injury action-\"arrived unexpectedly at the home, struggled with [the insured], and was seriously injured by shots fired from [the insured]'s gun.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     98\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Pennsylvania Superior Court concluded\n    \"an occurrence\" triggered the insurer's duty to defend its insured. \"These allegations ... set forth a claim that [the insured] accidentally shot [the boyfriend] while he waived around his gun during their struggle.

Contrary to State Farm's view, we see in these cases no bar to our consideration of the totality of the occurrence-to the contrary, these cases compel it. When properly focused on the entire occurrence, we find particularly material the fact Julia Morath, not Zach Trimbur, inflicted the only alleged bodily injury in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Scalia\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Ruff\n    </em>\n    , the insured inflicted the harm directly upon the victim; there is no intervening injurious event.

In each of those cases, the court held the insurer had to defend the insured because the underlying events were fortuitous from the perspective of the insured.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    We also find material, as our Court of Appeals did in\n    <em>\n     Pipher\n    </em>\n    , the Moraths allege a negligence theory against the Trimbur boy. Though the underlying complaint uses the words \"harassment,\" \"bullying,\" and \"intentional,\" the Moraths allege not a single intentional tort against the Trimbur boy. Our Court of Appeals explicitly distinguished\n    <em>\n     Gene's Restaurant\n    </em>\n    on this very ground in\n    <em>\n     Pipher\n    </em>\n    , holding the insurer had a duty to defend where the insured's negligence allegedly contributed to the victim's death at the hands of an individual who was not the insured.\n    <footnotemark>\n     101\n    </footnotemark>\n    We express no opinion on whether we would reach a different outcome if the Moraths alleged only a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Viewing these events from Zach Trimbur's perspective, we cannot conclusively find death by suicide is foreseeable from his cyberbullying, and Pennsylvania law appears to prohibit such a sweeping conclusion. Absent limited exceptions not applicable here, \"it is a general rule in Pennsylvania that suicide-or attempted suicide-is not a recognized basis for recovery in a tort claim.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     102\n    </footnotemark>\n    Pennsylvania follows such a rule \"because suicide constitutes an independent intervening act\n    <em>\n     so extraordinary as not to have been reasonably foreseeable by the original tortfeasor.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <footnotemark>\n     103\n    </footnotemark>\n    State Farm, without citing any authority for the proposition, nonetheless argues this line of authority should not apply here. We see no reason to disregard Pennsylvania courts' clear statement, and, moreover, we decline to prejudge a question resting at the heart of the underlying merits claims in Pennsylvania court. The Moraths's negligence claim falls within the scope of the policy.\n    <footnotemark>\n     104\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    We reach this conclusion mindful of a tragedy too common among our high school students arising from cyberbullying. In applying Pennsylvania law, we do not reward the Trimbur boy's text message. The issue is close particularly given the Trimbur boy's reference to self-harm and his apparent appreciation of some level of Julia Morath's struggles with mental illness. But the culpability of the Trimbur boy is not before us today. Such questions will be resolved in the Pennsylvania court. We are reviewing the four comers of the Policy and the Moraths's state court complaint. We hold State Farm must defend him in state court. Depending on the results of the state court case, we may face a different question on State Farm's duty to indemnify the Trimbur boy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    An insurer and its insured each ask whether the insurer's duty to defend extends to defending a negligence claim brought against an insured teenage boy cyberbullying a teenage girl allegedly leading to her death by suicide. The girl's parents sue the teenage boy for negligence in state court and the boy now asks the insurer to provide him a defense under his mom's home insurance policy. The teenage boy may have intended to insult a classmate and possibly cause her emotional distress. But, from the insured boy's perspective, his classmate's death by suicide is an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    State Farm must defend Zach Trimbur in the underlying litigation. In the accompanying Order, we grant Zach Trimbur's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the duty to defend and deny State Farm's motion for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment. We do not today address whether State Farm has any duty to indemnify Zach Trimbur.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"22\">\n    <p id=\"p-85\">\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Lebanon Sch.

State Farm argues insurers previously defined \"occurrence\" in a way to account for the foreseeability of the result of the conduct from the perspective of the insured.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ECF Doc. No. 20-2 at 6-8. State Farm argues industry practice has changed, and insurers now account for the concept of foreseeability in the intentional acts exclusion, a more modern policy development. While this may be true as a matter of industry practice, we do not view this distinction as material to the analysis Pennsylvania courts employ when interpreting the common meaning of the term \"accident,\" which is grounded in a focus on fortuity. State Farm also cautions us against relying on the line of authority considering whether an insured's intoxicated conduct constituted an \"occurrence.\" We do not rely on this line of authority here and express no opinion on the merits of this argument.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
