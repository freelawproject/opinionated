(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 2-24.) That case continues before this Court (the \"Underlying Suit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Three years later, Royal Park sued U.S. Bank again in this Court. On this occasion, Royal Park challenged U.S. Bank's practice of billing to the RMBS trusts the legal fees and expenses U.S. Bank incurred in defending the Underlying Suit. Royal Park alleges that U.S. Bank is not permitted to bill those fees to the trusts and seeks damages, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Fees Complaint,\" 17 Civ. 6778, Dkt. No. 1.) This separate suit, originally bearing case number 17 Civ. 6778, (the \"Fees Suit\") has been consolidated with the Underlying Suit and discovery is currently stayed regarding the Fees Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 342, 369.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court are two requests related to the Fees Complaint. First, National\n   Credit Union Administration Board (\"NCUA\") seeks to file a motion to intervene in this action as it relates to the Fees Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"NCUA Dec. 18 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 350.) Second, U.S. Bank seeks to file a motion either to dismiss the Fees Complaint or to stay these proceedings pending the resolution of the Underlying Suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"U.S. Bank Nov. 13 Letter,\" 17 Civ. 6778, Dkt. No. 12; \"U.S. Bank Nov. 22 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 343.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court construes both requests as motions and (1) DENIES NCUA's request to intervene in the suit; and (2) STAYS proceedings regarding the Fees Complaint pending the resolution of the Underlying Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 6, 2017, Royal Park sued U.S. Bank seeking damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief to stop U.S. Bank from billing litigation fees and costs to the trusts at issue in the Underlying Suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fees Complaint.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In light of the case's long history before this Court, the Court assumes familiarity with the extensive factual and procedural developments in the Underlying Suit and addresses the relevant background only briefly. As stated in further detail in this Court's order denying class certification, Royal Park asserts that trustee U.S. Bank breached its contractual obligations by failing to protect trust assets in twenty-one RMBS trusts under certain contractual agreements (the \"Governing Agreements\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Park Invs. SA/NV v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 415.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the Fees Complaint, Royal Park alleges that U.S. Bank has been charging \"its legal fees and costs incurred in its defense\" of the Underlying Suit to the trusts at issue in that action. (Fees Complaint \u00b6 2.) Royal Park alleges that, under the Governing Agreements, U.S. Bank is not permitted to reimburse itself for those fees and costs in this manner. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Royal Park brings this putative class action for breach of contract and related claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to recover those fees and costs and prevent U.S. Bank from continuing to bill those litigation fees and costs to the trusts. The Court consolidated the Underlying Suit and the Fees Complaint in November 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 342.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 13, 2017, U.S. Bank wrote to Royal Park pursuant to the Court's Individual Practices, outlining its arguments in support of a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion to stay the proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Bank Nov. 13 Letter.) Royal Park responded on November 20, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \"Royal Park Nov. 20 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 345), and U.S. Bank, by letter dated November 22, 2017, seeks a pre-motion conference for further guidance on\n   possible motion practice (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Bank Nov. 22 Letter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Separately, by a pre-motion letter dated December 19, 2017, NCUA requests leave to file a motion to intervene under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 (\" Rule 24\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NCUA Dec. 18 Letter) U.S. Bank opposes NCUA's request, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \"U.S. Bank Dec. 22 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 355), and Royal Park submitted a letter stating that it takes no position on NCUA's application (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 354).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In February 2018, Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger, to whom this action was referred for pretrial supervision, stayed discovery regarding the Fees Complaint pending resolution of the motion to dismiss after U.S. Bank sought guidance on its pre-motion letter request and how to proceed with discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"U.S. Bank Feb. 8 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 364; \"U.S. Bank Feb. 13 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 365; Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NCUA Dec. 18 Letter at 2.) NCUA also \"holds certificates or has beneficial interests in [twenty four] other trusts from the same securitization shelves at issue here\" but would limit its proposed complaint to allegations concerning the Overlapping Trusts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) NCUA asserts that it meets the requirements under Rule 24 to intervene as of right in the dispute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Alternatively, it seeks the Court's leave to intervene in the action permissively. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) After intervention, NCUA aims to \"develop the record on the fact that investor trust beneficiaries enter contracts with the trustee ... reinforcing the conclusion\" that case law requires dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court now construes NCUA's letter as a motion for intervention either as of right or with permission, pursuant to Rule 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Movants must meet a four-part test in order to intervene successfully:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [T]o intervene either as of right or with permission, an applicant must (1) timely file an application; (2) show an interest in the action; (3) demonstrate that the interest may be impaired by the disposition of the action; and (4) show that the interest is not protected adequately by the parties to the action.... Failure to satisfy any one of these four requirements is a sufficient ground to deny the application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Floyd v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266848\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1051/#p1057\">\n    770 F.3d 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1057 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court finds that NCUA satisfies the first, second, and third elements of this test, but cannot fulfill the fourth. Consequently, the Court does not grant intervention by right and denies NCUA's request for permissive intervention on largely the same grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This ruling is consistent with that of another court in this district dealing with similar facts. NCUA has filed motions to intervene under Rule 24 in similar cases brought by Royal Park against others RMBS trustees. The only other court to address such a motion denied NCUA's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Park Invs. SA/NV v.

Aug. 2, 2018) (hereafter,\n   <em>\n    Royal Park v. HSBC\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Timeliness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Federal Rules do not set a time in which to file a motion to intervene. Instead, the decision is \"entrusted to the [district court's] sound discretion\" based on \"(a) the length of time the applicant knew or should have known of its interest before making the motion; (b) prejudice to existing parties resulting from the applicant's delay; (c) prejudice to the applicant if the motion is denied; and (d) the presence of unusual circumstances militating for or against a finding of timeliness.\"\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266848\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1051/#p1057\">\n    770 F.3d at 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, NCUA filed its pre-motion letter seeking to intervene about three months after Royal Park filed the Fees Complaint and one month after U.S. Bank wrote its pre-motion letter to dismiss or stay the Fees Complaint. NCUA argues that because (1) its proposed complaint would add no new trusts to the litigation and (2) it requests no additional discovery that could delay proceedings, allowing NCUA to intervene would be more economical than requiring NCUA to proceed separately. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NCUA Dec. 18 Letter at 2.) NCUA also points to numerous cases permitting intervention after lengthier delays. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266848\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1051/#p1057\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   U.S. Bank counters that, because the Fees Suit has been consolidated with the Underlying Suit, the applicable complaint from which to measure timeliness is the original one that Royal Park filed more than four years ago, and thus intervention is not timely. (U.S. Bank Dec. 22 Letter at 1 (citing\n   <em>\n    John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Book Dog Books, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347859\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/169/#p173\">\n    315 F.R.D. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) ).) U.S. Bank also argues that \"NCUA has been active in RMBS litigation ... for years\" and has litigated indemnification clauses before, but provides no reasons for \"why intervention is now necessary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Finally, U.S. Bank argues that NCUA voluntarily dismissed claims regarding the Overlapping Trusts with prejudice in separate litigation against U.S. Bank and is thus barred by res judicata from intervening in this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347859\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/169/#p173\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) On this point, NCUA filed a one-page letter-brief in reply to clarify that the voluntary dismissal involved other trusts and not the Overlapping Trusts it seeks to address here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 365 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this proceeding, NCUA wrote its letter regarding a possible intervention motion only a month after U.S. Bank requested leave to file a motion to dismiss. U.S. Bank suffered no prejudice resulting from this short delay. To the extent U.S. Bank is concerned about possible delays, NUCA's filing of a separate suit would delay a resolution more than an intervention where NCUA would not add any additional trusts, seek new discovery, or bring meaningfully new claims. NCUA's limited delay does not engender the kinds of risks and prejudices the timeliness requirement guards against.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   What is more, the court in\n   <em>\n    Royal Park v. HSBC\n   </em>\n   found NCUA's motion timely in similar circumstances. There, NCUA moved to intervene the day after HSBC Bank USA, National Association (\"HSBC\") moved to dismiss the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203655781\">\n    2018 WL 3655781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. As here, HSBC had argued that NCUA knew about its interests \"well before it sought to intervene and intended to delay the case\" by waiting to file the motion until after HSBC filed a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203655781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   analysis, the court recognized the resulting prejudice from granting NCUA's motion because the court \"would likely strike the current briefing on [d]efendant's motion to dismiss, and order the plaintiffs to file a single consolidated amended complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203655781\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the court found the resulting delay would be too short to make the motion untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   U.S. Bank's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. To start, U.S. Bank's argument that the court must measure timeliness from the filing of Royal Park's original 2014 complaint misconstrues the role of the Fees Complaint. In support of this argument, U.S. Bank cites\n   <em>\n    John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , which was a case where a party sought to intervene two years after the initial complaint's filing and four months after the amended complaint's filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347859\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/169/#p173\">\n    315 F.R.D. at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But \"[t]here was no material change in the nature of the claims made in the\" amended complaint and it \"added no new claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347859\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/169/#p173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, the Fees Complaint, while related to the Underlying Suit, is clearly different in nature and brings new and separate claims. Thus, timeliness should be measured from the filing of the Fees Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   U.S. Bank's res judicata argument is similarly unpersuasive. As NCUA demonstrated in response, the voluntarily dismissed claims did not involve the Overlapping Trusts at issue here. Further, one of the elements of res judicata is that the claim \"could have been\" brought in the prior action.\n   <em>\n    Soules v. Conn., Dep't of Emergency Servs. &amp; Pub. Prot.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515970\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/52/#p55\">\n    882 F.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (2d Cir. 2018). There is no circumstance under which claims arising from U.S. Bank's billing of legal fees and costs incurred in the Underlying Suit to the trusts \"could have been\" brought in NCUA's separate suit that largely predated the ongoing Underlying Suit. Finally, while NCUA may have been litigating RMBS cases for years, it was put on notice of U.S. Bank's billing practices regarding the Underlying Suit only in September 2017. NCUA filed its intervention motion within three months -- before any meaningful decisions had been rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that NCUA's motion is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    NCUA's Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, NCUA must demonstrate an \"interest\" in the action under Rule 24. \"[F]or an interest to be 'cognizable' under Rule 24, it must be direct, substantial, and legally protectable [such that an] interest that is remote from the subject matter of the proceeding, or that is contingent upon the occurrence of a sequence of events before it becomes colorable, will not satisfy the rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266848\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1051/#p1057\">\n    770 F.3d at 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NCUA Dec. 18 Letter at 2.) As a result, NCUA argues in a conclusory manner that its interests in those two trusts are \"greater than is required by Rule 24(a)(2).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) NCUA also argues that its interests in twenty-four \"trusts from the same securitization shelves are interests 'relating to' the trusts\" in the Fees Complaint and are also sufficient under Rule 24. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund v.

Dec. 22, 2010) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In response, U.S. Bank counters that NCUA's interest must rise to a level that would qualify it as a \"necessary party\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 (\" Rule 19\"), but that NCUA cannot be a necessary party \"as this case has proceeded for nearly four years without it.\" (U.S. Bank Dec. 22 Letter at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    MasterCard Int'l Inc. v.

Next, U.S. Bank argues that NCUA's decision to limit its proposed complaint to the\n   Overlapping Trusts undermines NCUA's interest for two reasons. First, U.S. Bank asserts that this decision means NCUA's presence \"will add nothing\" because Royal Park already adequately represents those interests.

First, it argues that it has a \"broader interest\" than Royal Park \"as a federal agency\" which is \"rooted in the public interest.\" (NCUA Dec. 18 Letter at 3.) Second, it argues that \"intervention is commonly granted to absent class members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chen-Oster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204619663\">\n    2015 WL 4619663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 ).) On this point, NCUA asserts that Royal Park could seek to maximize the gain to the class and possibly exclude NCUA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, NCUA argues that its interests at the \"shelf level\" for the other trusts are broader than those of Royal Park, which has \"no incentive to assert broader application of its arguments\" to the shelf level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In response, U.S. Bank argues that NCUA's status as a federal agency is immaterial because here it seeks to intervene \"as a private liquidating agent using private counsel.\" (U.S. Bank Dec. 22 Letter at 2.) U.S. Bank also dismisses the relevance of NCUA's interest in other trusts at the same shelf level, given that NCUA has proposed to limit its complaint to only the Overlapping Trusts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ultimately, NCUA requests the exact relief as Royal Park, asking for the same interpretation of the same contracts for the same trusts. This identity of interest subjects NCUA to the higher burden of demonstrating inadequate representation as described in\n   <em>\n    Washington Electric\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   . The Court finds that NCUA cannot meet this higher burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At the outset, the Court notes its familiarity with Royal Park's zealous advocacy throughout this litigation. Nothing it presents supports NCUA's claim that Royal Park will seek to exclude NCUA's identical interests in any disposition to benefit itself. The mere possibility of such an exclusion, barring other facts that differentiate NCUA from Royal Park, does not overcome the high hurdle required under Rule 24, or else intervention would always be granted to absent class members. Should class certification be granted, NCUA may opt out, and also retains the right to object at a fairness hearing of any class settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Devlin v.

NCUA can accomplish this goal through other means, such as working with Royal Park, objecting to a settlement, or filing a separate suit.

Stays are also appropriate \"while awaiting the outcome of proceedings which bear upon the case, even if such proceedings are not necessarily controlling of the action that is to be stayed.\"\n   <em>\n    Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715858\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/630/295/#p305\">\n    630 F.Supp.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The possibility of overlapping or duplicative litigation weighs heavily in this case. The claims at issue in the Fees Complaint may well turn on determinations made in the Underlying Suit. To summarize this overlap briefly, Royal Park alleges that U.S. Bank is improperly billing the trusts for legal fees incurred in the Underlying Suit. U.S. Bank counters that indemnification clauses in the Governing Agreements permit it to bill the trusts for such fees and costs. Royal Park argues that the indemnification clauses do not apply. Critically, the parties also debate an exception to the indemnification clauses for expenses incurred as a result of U.S. Bank's alleged willful malfeasance. This exception may separately preclude U.S. Bank from reimbursing its legal fees and costs if U.S. Bank is found to have acted grossly negligently as regards its contractual duties under the Governing Agreements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Of course, whether U.S. Bank acted grossly negligently is a central factual question in the Underlying Suit. A finding in the Underlying Suit that U.S. Bank acted grossly negligently may fatally undermine its defenses to the Fees Complaint. If so, U.S. Bank would be forced to reimburse the trusts for the legal expenses it charged them. Thus, staying these proceedings could avoid a possible waste of both the parties' and the Court's resources. A stay also avoids the risks and inefficiencies associated with determining indemnification issues during ongoing litigation as opposed to at its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   None of the other considerations listed above outweigh the potential waste of resources if the case were to proceed. First, even though the Court recognizes that parties like U.S. Bank typically seek indemnification after incurring expenses in defending themselves, U.S. Bank's departure from the ordinary course does not substantially prejudice Royal Park or other trust investors. Most importantly, U.S. Bank is part of one of the largest banks in the United States, and it maintains sufficient coffers to reimburse all legal expenses charged to the trusts if necessary. Second, the public interest in prompt adjudication is counterbalanced by its interest in conserving judicial resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Specrite Design, LLC v. Elli N.Y. Design Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Civ. 6154,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203105859\">\n    2017 WL 3105859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court's reasoning accords with at least one other recent case in which a RMBS trustee successfully sought a stay of claims similar to those alleged in the Fees Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Park Invs. SA/NV v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co.,\n   </em>\n   No. 17 Civ. 5916,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203849840\">\n    2018 WL 3849840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2018). There, the court held that Royal Park could not demonstrate prejudice resulting from the stay because the defendant trustee could refund the trusts later if required to do so. Id. at *2. Thus, the court determined that\n   the \"analysis ultimately turns on what is most efficient\" and a stay \"may be necessary to avoid unnecessary determinations\" regarding the trustee's negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. That potential for a \"duplicative determination ... outweigh[ed]\" any prejudice to Royal Park and justified the stay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court agrees with this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court is persuaded that proceedings regarding the Fees Complaint should be stayed until the claims in the Underlying Suit are resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the motion so deemed by the Court as filed by the National Credit Union Administration Board seeking intervention (Dkt.
