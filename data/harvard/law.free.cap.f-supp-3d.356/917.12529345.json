(Dkt. Nos. 23 &amp; 25.) The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment came before the Court for hearing on November 9, 2018. (Dkt. No. 31.) On November 13, 2018, the Court issued an order concluding that (1) ICE had failed to prove as a matter of law that its search was adequate in all respects; (2) the Court could not make a determination regarding ICE's invocation of Exemptions 5 and 7(E) without a review of certain documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) ICE properly invoked Exemption 6 and 7(C) to protect private information regarding third parties and ICE employees. (Dkt. No. 32.) The Court thus ordered ICE to submit a new declaration regarding its search and to submit certain documents\n   <em>\n    in camera.\n   </em>\n   ICE has done so. (Dkt. Nos. 33, 34.) Having considered the parties' prior briefing, the relevant legal authority, and the supplemental submissions, the Court concludes as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court concluded that ICE's search was generally reasonable, but that ICE had failed to adequately explain its use of search terms and failed to demonstrate that it conducted a reasonable search for documents responsive to Request 12. (Dkt. No. 32 at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) ICE has submitted a Second Supplemental Declaration from Ms. Pavlik-Keenan which explains the search terms used and scope of the search in response to Request 12. (Dkt. No. 34-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With respect to the search terms, there were two issues: (1) ICE's failure to identify all the search terms used, and (2) the adequacy of the identified search terms. The Second Supplemental Pavlik-Keenan Declaration resolves the first issue. (Dkt. No. 34-1.) ICE has now provided Plaintiff with a complete list of the search terms used. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People for the Am. Way Found. v.

As for the adequacy of the search terms, the Second Supplemental Pavlik-Keenan Declaration attests that the San Francisco Field Officers were directed to use the search terms that they reasonably believed would appear in the records they maintained. (Dkt. No. 34-1 at \u00b6 6.) Each of the officers searched by Plaintiff's A-number, and five of the six officers searched for variants on Plaintiff's name, and four of the six searched for variants on the operation name. The Court is persuaded that the discrepancies in the search terms are not material given that they were based on the officers' \"unique knowledge of the manner in which they keep their own files and the vocabulary they use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Immigration Law Ctr. v.

Cal. Dec. 11, 2015) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that individual ICE field office searches were inadequate\n   because the declarations \"explain[ed] in some detail\" why the individual offices used the search terms they did.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Likewise, the Court is persuaded that ICE conducted an adequate search for training-related documents-even though the individual officers did not search for training-related documents-given Ms. Pavlik-Keenan's representation that the Training Division would have all such records including records related to the individual officers at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberation Newspaper v.

(Dkt. No. 32 at 11-12.) In particular, ICE did not search for records or communications between ICE and the San Francisco Police Department related to ICE officers identifying themselves as police or police officers and limited its search for responsive documents to the six individuals in the San Francisco Field Office directly involved in Plaintiff's apprehension. The Court ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding additional search terms. According to the Second Supplemental Pavlik-Keenan Declaration, they did so on November 26, 2018 and agreed upon a search of the emails for the ICE Field Office Director, the Deputy Field Office Director, and the Assistant Field Officer Directors of the San Francisco Field Office from 2014 and 2015 using the search term \"@sfgov.org\" (the email extension for the San Francisco Police Department). (Dkt. No. 34-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) ICE has conducted part of this search and will complete the remainder by January 4, 2019. Thus far, ICE has identified three non-responsive documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In sum, the Court is persuaded that ICE has \"conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamdan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332104\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/759/#p770\">\n    797 F.3d at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No. 26-1 at \u00b6 25.) The Court concluded that without even the name of the technique or any context for why this technique out of all the techniques referenced in the handbook is not commonly known, the Court lacked sufficient information to consider whether ICE properly redacted this information under Exemption 7(E). Having completed its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the chapter, the Court concludes that ICE has failed to meet its burden of \"demonstrating logically how the release of the requested information might create a risk of circumvention of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415764,3556965\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/37/\">\n    646 F.3d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The chapter at issue consists of three paragraphs and only provides general information regarding this law enforcement tactic and ICE has failed to show how revealing this very generalized information would assist fugitives in identifying undercover initiatives and evading apprehension. \"[T]he Government may not withhold a document simply because the document describes a specific application of the generally known technique or procedure-the document must reveal something more.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec.Frontier Found. v.

Cal. Dec. 22, 2016) (collecting cases re: the same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. ERO Training Material and Policy Refresher on the Fourth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ICE invoked Exemption 7(E) over portions of the ERO Training Material and Policy Refresher on the Fourth Amendment because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   the training materials includes discussion of certain ERO-specific practices\n   and procedures related to gathering evidence, taking statements, utilizing law enforcement databases, and engaging in hot pursuit. The redacted material also includes step-by-step instructions for conducting particular removal operations and information on law enforcement databases. [ ] Disclosure of this information, which is not well known, could reasonably be expected to jeopardize ongoing ICE investigations and operations and assist those seeking to violate or circumvent the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Dkt. No. 26-1 at \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff raised the same objections with respect to each of the documents over which ICE asserted Exemption 7(E); namely, that ICE provided insufficient information to invoke the exemption and has failed to show that the redacted techniques and guidelines are not generally unknown. The Court considered-and rejected-these arguments in the context of the Fugitive Operations Handbook. (Dkt. No. 32 at 19.21.) Having reviewed the redacted portions of the ERO Training Material and Policy Refresher on the Fourth Amendment\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   the Court concludes that ICE has properly invoked Exemption 7(E) over this material. The redacted material provides a \"detailed, technical analysis of the techniques and procedures used to conduct law enforcement investigations,\" including \"details or means of deploying law enforcement techniques.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Civil Liberties Union of N. California v. United States Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264797\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/473/#p491\">\n    880 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491-492 (9th Cir. 2018). While the public may generally know that ICE uses particular techniques, there is no dispute on this record that the step-by-step means for applying these techniques is not publicly known.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamdan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332104\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/759/#p770\">\n    797 F.3d at 777-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court thus concludes that ICE has met its burden for invoking Exemption 7(E) over the ERO Training Material and Policy Refresher on the Fourth Amendment. Having concluded that ICE properly invoked Exemption 7(E) over these materials, it is unnecessary to also decide whether ICE properly withheld this material under Exemption 5 as ICE claimed both exemptions simultaneously.
