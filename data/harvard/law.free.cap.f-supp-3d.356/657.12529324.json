LEVY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Innovative Textiles, Inc. (\"ITI\") filed a third-party complaint against Gentry Mills, Inc. (\"GMI\") alleging that GMI is liable for claims arising from a contract dispute brought by Carhartt, Inc. (\"Carhartt\") against ITI. GMI successfully moved to dismiss Innovative Textiles' first third-party complaint based on pleading deficiencies. The Court granted leave for ITI to file an amended third-party complaint. GMI asks the Court to reconsider, arguing that ITI's amendments are futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   An outline of this case is explained in the Court's previous opinion and order granting third-party defendant, GMI's Motion to Dismiss. (Dkt. 33.) In short, Carhartt initially sued third-party plaintiff, ITI, for breach of contract based on ITI's failure to sell it sufficiently fire-resistant fabric as specified in an agreement. ITI then filed a third-party complaint against GMI alleging that GMI failed to properly treat the fabric ITI eventually sold to Carhartt. (Dkt. 8.) The original third-party complaint, which contained very few factual allegations, was dismissed pursuant Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Dkt. 33.) GMI's current motion for reconsideration challenges the order granting ITI's motion for leave to amend and file an amended third-party complaint. (Dkt. 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As set forth in the July 16, 2018 order granting leave to amend (Dkt. 36), the amended third-party complaint includes a much more developed set of factual allegations. ITI has set forth its relationship with GMI and detailed the specifications regarding the chemicals and treatment it purchased from GMI. The new factual allegations are explored in more detail, as relevant, in the discussion below. (Dkt. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The amended third-party complaint also includes additional causes of action. The eight counts are now: breach of contract for the sale of goods (Count I); breach of express warranties (Count II); breach of implied warranties (Count III); violation of North Carolina UCC \u00a7 25-2-314 requiring merchantable goods (Count IV); violation of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose (Count V); breach of contract (Count VI); negligence (Count VII); and indemnification implied-in-law (Count VIII). The Court's current review of the amended third-party complaint is limited the to the issue of futility, as set forth in an earlier order. (Dkt. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court stated that \"the complaint makes no mention of the chemical sales that ITI contends is the 'predominant factor' of the parties' agreement.\" (Dkt. 33 at 11.) In its amended third-party complaint, ITI still does not sufficiently allege a sales contract. Although ITI now makes references to \"chemical goods,\" the contract pleaded is\n   <em>\n    predominantly\n   </em>\n   for services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The amended third-party complaint states that \"ITI contracted with GMI for the selection, purchase and application of several chemical additives to be used on the flame-resistant fabric that was ultimately sold to Carhartt.\" (Dkt. 37 at 3.) The details set forth in the amended complaint reveal the \"thrust\" of the contract. GMI was a \"supplier of ... finishes,\" and was given \"pre-treated fabric\" to be \"finished.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) \"After the finish process was complete,\" GMI would then send some of the \"finished fabric\" to a testing lab and the remainder to Carhartt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Through these allegations, it is evident that, to the extent chemicals were purchased, they were incidental to the finishing process. Therefore, the contract's \"purpose, reasonably stated,\" under the well-pleaded facts, \"is the rendition of service, with goods incidentally involved.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9186998\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/158/261/#p265\">\n    158 N.C.

It points to the words \"item,\" \"quantity,\" and \"description\" to suggest that the predominant purpose was to purchase goods. (Dkt. 42 at 17.) This is not persuasive. The purchase orders also contain the words \"finish\" and \"Dye Color\" within the description, with specification for a \"finished weight\" and \"finished width.\" (Dkt. 37-3 at 2.) Other description sections indicate to GMI: \"DO NOT PUT DWR FINISH ON THIS ROLL\" and \"this roll is to be slit, dried on the santex and framed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Moreover, the fabric itself was not provided by GMI. Rather, \"GMI[ ]applied the chemical additives to\n   <em>\n    ITI's\n   </em>\n   fabric.\" (Dkt. 37 at 4 (emphasis added).) The selection of chemicals to be applied to the fabric is not a sale of goods. Nor does the addition of the word \"goods\" each time ITI pleads chemicals in the amended complaint convert the pleaded contract into one for goods as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This conclusion aligns with many cases, which hold that contracts for the processing of or application of chemicals to goods, where there is no actual exchange of or only incidental use of materials, are predominantly for the provision of services.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    IMI Norgen Inc. v.

Rather, the application of the correct chemical and proper curing processes is at issue in the amended third-party complaint. For instance, the third-party party complaint outlines machinery and equipment failures in \"heating zones\" that resulted in \"inconsistencies and variations in the chemical and application and curing process.\" (Dkt. 37 at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) In total, these allegations reveal that the contract was predominantly for the provision of fabric treatment and processing, which are services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii.

First, ITI provided offers through purchase orders. True, the mere existence of purchase orders without demonstration of affirmative assent from GMI is not sufficient to allege the existence of a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southern Spindle &amp; Flyer Co. v.

But ITI pleads that \"GMI accepted ITI's contractual offer via GMI's conduct,\" by selling and applying the finishes to the fabrics, and shipping the finished product to Carhartt, Inc. and to an outside party for testing. (Dkt. 37 at 22.) Finally, the details of \"[w]hether mutual assent is established and whether a contract was intended between the parties are questions for the trier of fact,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Creech v.

But taking the allegations in the amended complaint as true, there was mutual assent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iii. Manner of Breach\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The second prong of a breach of contract claim is the actual manner of \"breach of the terms of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4102911\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/223/428/#p432\">\n    223 N.C.

In its amended complaint, ITI also cures deficiencies regarding the contractual obligations and manner of the alleged breach. In broad terms, ITI alleges that the purchase orders specify the type of flame resistant material to be used and stats that GMI failed to include the necessary additive. GMI disagrees, arguing that there are no allegations in the amended third-party complaint or indications in the purchase orders that the treatment must include a flame-resistant additive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The allegations are sufficient to allege a breach of contract. ITI states that GMI failed \"to sell a durable water repellant finish that included a flame-resistant additive\" as indicated on the purchase orders. (Dkt. 37 at 13, 23) ITI specifically alleges that various specifications, such as \"F12\" or \"Protex C modacrylic fibers,\" are flame resistant fibers that correspond to the need for flame resistant additives in its chemical finishes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 21-22.) These allegations must be accepted as true at this stage of the case. Therefore, ITI sufficiently pleads the manner of breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Purchase order, payment, and delivery is enough to plausibly allege the elements of a contract. And although the exact nature and outlines of the contract are disputed, ITI plausibly alleges a breach of contract for chemical application services. The amended third-party complaint is not futile as to Count VI. For this reason, there was no defect in the Court's decision to allow ITI to amend its third-party complaint to include Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    b.
