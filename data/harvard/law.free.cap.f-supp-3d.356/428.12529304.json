Defendants the Milton Hershey School and the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the Milton Hershey School Trust (collectively, \"the School\"), oppose Dobson's motion. Although we reject Dobson's amendments as proposed, we will reinstate several of Dobson's tort claims, which were improvidently dismissed pursuant to the gist of the action doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dobson is a former student of the School, which is a private, nonprofit institution that offers cost-free education to low income children from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. (Doc. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13, 17, 20, 56). The School also provides residential accommodations for students, housing them in group homes with supervisory \"houseparents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-25). Dobson enrolled in the School in 2004 at the age of nine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). At that time, his legal guardian executed the School's \"Enrollment Agreement,\" a three-page document setting forth terms and conditions of enrollment including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , attendance, conduct and discipline, student dating, school-provided health care, release of personal information, visitation, textbooks, and religious services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 11-3 at 5-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dobson avers that for much of his eight years at the School he was a \"model student\" and thrived both academically and socially. (Doc. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). He also worked in the School's admission office without pay, averaging 13 to 16 hours per week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-70). Dobson's likeness was even utilized by the School for promotional purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dobson's emotional well-being began to deteriorate when he reached high school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74). In ninth grade, he began to realize \"his sexual orientation as a gay teenager\" and struggled with peer relationships. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74). When he was caught viewing homosexual pornography on a residence computer, Dobson's houseparents allegedly forced him to watch a religious-based video intended to \"cure\" him of being gay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75). During eleventh grade, Dobson became depressed and experienced suicidal ideation after he drifted apart from his only close male friend at the School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-76). When another friend learned of Dobson's suicidal expressions, she reported them to Dobson's houseparents, who in turn contacted the School's health services to intervene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-79). A School psychologist recommended inpatient care at a local mental and behavioral health care facility, and Dobson agreed to this proposed treatment plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80). A School official, Dobson's houseparents, and a speech therapist visited Dobson during his inpatient stay, and he was given assignments and homework to stay on track with his classes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dobson appeared to be doing better over the following six months, but then suffered another bout of severe depression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-86). In March 2013, he expressed suicidal thoughts and the School required him to spend the night at the campus Health Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84). Dobson's depression worsened, and in May 2013, he wrapped a belt around his neck but did not carry out the suicide attempt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-87). Dobson self-reported his actions to the School and asked for help. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88). After seeing the School's lead psychologist, Dobson again agreed to the psychologist's recommendation of inpatient treatment at the same outside mental health care facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-91). Dobson maintains that School medical staff assured him that a second course of inpatient treatment would not affect his enrollment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90). During this second stay, no one from the School visited him or brought him coursework, and a nurse informed Dobson that the\n   School generally enforced a two-hospitalization expulsion policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-92). Dobson alleges that the School in fact had an official or unofficial \"shadow policy\" mandating that students be expelled after two mental health hospitalizations, even if those hospitalizations were recommended by School medical staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dobson avers that-in accordance with the two-hospitalization policy-the School abruptly expelled him and evicted him from his campus home while he was still receiving his second course of inpatient treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98). Dobson learned of his expulsion from his mother, who informed him that he was being expelled because he was \"a liability\" to the School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After release from inpatient treatment and due to his expulsion, Dobson was forced to return to Scranton, Pennsylvania to live with his mother and siblings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104). His mother, who was dealing with her own mental health and substance abuse issues, was soon evicted from her apartment and Dobson ended up \"bouncing\" from one living situation to another, finally settling at a friend's house where he paid rent by working a retail job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-06, 113). Dobson eventually finished his junior year at a public high school in Scranton and graduated from the school in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dobson alleges that his abrupt removal from his School home, community, and classes caused alienation, loneliness, and feelings of hopelessness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112). He further contends that his wrongful expulsion prohibited him from receiving significant post-secondary financial aid that the School offers to students who graduate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109). He avers that as a result of the School's actions he suffered significant mental anguish, humiliation, physical manifestations of severe emotional distress, and loss of self-esteem. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 184, 233, 239).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dobson commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Eastern District promptly transferred the matter to this district at the joint request of the parties. Dobson filed an amended complaint in October 2016, wherein he alleges violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Count I), the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , (Count II), and the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , (Count III), as well as state law tort claims for negligent breach of the duty of care (Count V), negligent misrepresentation (Count VII), intentional misrepresentation (Count VIII), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count IX), negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count X), civil conspiracy to endanger children (Count XI), breach of fiduciary duties of care and good faith (Count XII), and negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   (Count XIII).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The School moved to dismiss Counts V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII of the amended complaint. In a memorandum opinion dated August 10, 2017, the court granted the School's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Dobson v.

Aug. 10, 2017). We held that the state law tort claims were barred by the gist of the action doctrine and that amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. Dobson moved to amend the August 10, 2017 order to permit interlocutory appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which the court denied. The School then moved for judgment\n   on the pleadings in relation to the remaining claims. As briefing was nearing completion for that motion, Dobson moved for leave to file a second amended complaint, seeking to add claims for breach of contract and violation of Pennsylvania's Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (\"UTPCPL\"), 73 PA.

LAW INST. 1965).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The question then is whether Dobson's negligence, emotional distress, misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, and fiduciary duty claims implicate contractually based obligations or \"broader social dut[ies]\" owed by the School to its students. We find the latter to be the case, and now hold that the gist of the action doctrine does not bar Dobson's tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In Count V, Dobson asserts a standard negligence claim against the School. He alleges the School exercised year-round custody, care, and control over him and functioned as primary caregiver-providing education, housing, food, clothing, and medical, dental, and psychological care. Dobson avers that the School, in this \"\n   <em>\n    in loco parentis\n   </em>\n   \" status,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   owed him a duty of care, independent of any contractual obligation, to protect him from harm. Dobson asserts that the School breached this duty by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , expelling him due to his inpatient mental health treatment; permitting him to be discharged from inpatient care to his mother rather than maintaining custody over him to provide further necessary psychological treatment; failing to develop a care plan for him before he was discharged to his mother; failing to provide adequate psychological care for him prior to his discharge from the inpatient facility; and causing further harm to him by implementing \"conversion therapy\" after learning of his homosexual orientation. Dobson contends that the School's breaches resulted in significant mental, emotional, physical, and financial injury. These allegations implicate social duties which are broader in scope than applicable contractual obligations. Notwithstanding the existence of the Enrollment Agreement (and any other written policies or guidelines), we conclude that the nature of the duty alleged in Dobson's negligence claim is based on custodial care and protection of minor children and exists independent of any contractual obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gist of the action doctrine does not apply to such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The same is true for Dobson's infliction of emotional distress claims in Counts IX and X. Dobson avers that the School negligently or intentionally caused him emotional distress and physical harm. The alleged conduct includes ignoring Dobson's serious mental health issues, consciously\n   disregarding prior settlement agreements involving discrimination against students with disabilities, excluding students with mental health disabilities from campus events like graduation ceremonies and celebrations, attempting a crude form of \"conversion therapy\" on Dobson, threatening to expel him on the basis of his mental impairments when he was most fragile, and expelling him due to his hospitalizations while he was still undergoing inpatient mental health treatment. We reject the School's argument that these claims sound in contract merely because they reference School policies or guidelines. Dobson's allegations may imply that the School violated some of its own anti-discrimination guidance contained in the School's Student/Sponsor Handbook (the \"Handbook\") or its Student, Applicant and General Public Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy (\"EOP\"). But even if this were true, it would not transform Dobson's emotional distress claims into contract claims. Dobson is alleging that the School inflicted severe emotional distress-either negligently or intentionally-through its purportedly egregious conduct toward him. The essence of his claims derives from tort law and the broader social policies implicated thereby, not contract law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dobson's misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, and breach of fiduciary duty claims are no different. The allegations underlying these claims involve purported wrongdoing by the School outside of any \"contractual\" obligations that may have existed under the Enrollment Agreement, the Handbook, the EOP, or any other written materials provided to Dobson. For example, Dobson avers that the School made the material misrepresentation that complying with its doctors' recommendations for inpatient mental health treatment would benefit Dobson when in fact it automatically induced Dobson's expulsion under the School's two-hospitalization policy. Dobson likewise contends that School officials and administrators knowingly conspired to endanger the welfare of its students by implementing the discriminatory two-hospitalization policy regardless of the foreseeable risks it posed to students with mental health disabilities. The gravamen of these claims implicates a more fulsome social duty to all individuals not falling within the ambit of any contractual duty that may exist between Dobson and the School. Consequently, the gist of the action doctrine does not bar Dobson's tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency Challenges Under Rule 12(b)(6)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In its initial Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the School also challenged the sufficiency of Dobson's misrepresentation and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.

Specifically, Dobson alleges that the School's psychologists represented to him that consenting to inpatient mental health treatment would be the best course of action for success at the School and would not cause him to be expelled, when in fact the School knew that Dobson's second inpatient stint would result in automatic expulsion. Dobson avers that he reasonably relied on the School's representations, agreed to inpatient treatment, and was swiftly expelled, causing emotional, physical, and financial injuries. Moreover, Dobson alleges that the School intended this result to avoid the potential \"liability\" of dealing with a student with depression and suicidal tendencies.

In his amended complaint, Dobson pleads that he suffered \"physical harm,\" \"physical manifestations of emotional distress,\" and \"conscious pain and suffering\" as a result of the School's conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 184, 198). These averments, without more, do not suffice under Pennsylvania law. In\n   <em>\n    Abadie v.

Dobson avers that the School threatened to expel him due to his mental impairments, and did in fact expel and evict him while he was still receiving inpatient treatment for severe depression. The School purportedly took these actions despite knowing that Dobson would be forced to live with his mother who had her own mental health and substance abuse issues. This conduct occurred on the heels of a settlement with the Department of Justice regarding the School's mistreatment of students with disabilities. Dobson also alleges that after his homosexual orientation became known to the School and his houseparents, he was forced to watch a religious-based \"conversion therapy\" movie intended to \"cure\" him from being gay. The School also purportedly chose to terminate Dobson's enrollment and force him out of his home of eight years, without regard for his mental health or well-being, to avoid the liability of keeping him as a student. Moreover, Dobson contends the School encouraged him to get inpatient mental health care while knowing that such treatment would result in automatic expulsion under the two-hospitalization policy. These allegations, taken together, are sufficiently extreme and outrageous as to be considered \"utterly intolerable in a civilized society.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11806154,765959\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/720/745/\">\n    720 A.2d at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buczek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"679814\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/366/551/\">\n    531 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1125 ).

We will grant the motion insofar as we will permit Dobson to file a second amended complaint consistent with the foregoing discussion. We will vacate our August 10, 2017 memorandum and order (Docs. 50, 51) and reinstate Dobson's state law tort claims with the exception of intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count IX), with leave to amend.
