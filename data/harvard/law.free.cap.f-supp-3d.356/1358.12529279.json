Relevant here, Section 1692g(a) requires the debt collector's initial communication to the consumer (often referred to as the \"validation notice\") inform the consumer that he or she has thirty days to dispute the validity of the debt and that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will verify the debt and provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1692g(a)(3)-(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, neither party disputes that Defendant's Letter contained all mandatory Section 1692g(a) disclosures.

Defendant's Letter requested Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    \"immediately\"\n   </em>\n   contact Defendant at its office telephone number to make full payment of the debt. (Doc. 1-1) (emphasis added). In addition, the Letter advised that Defendant had been \"authorized to use any means at [its] disposal\" to \"collect the full balance of the debt\" and threatened \"additional action\" if Defendant did not \"receive payment\n   <em>\n    promptly.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%2051402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Further, the Letter includes no \"safe harbor\" or \"transitional language\" explaining that, notwithstanding Defendant's demand, Plaintiff still retained the right to make a written request within thirty days for validation of the debt and for information about the original creditor, and that such a request would force Defendant to cease its collection efforts and provide Plaintiff with the requested information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%2051402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Defendant's Letter was sent on its law firm letterhead containing a hand signed attorney signature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"A debt collection letter on an attorney's letterhead conveys authority,\" and \"[a]n unsophisticated consumer, getting a letter from an attorney, knows the price of poker has just gone up.\"\n   <em>\n    Avila v.

Additionally, as stressed by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , if Plaintiff had attempted to exercise her statutory rights by calling Defendant at the bolded and underlined telephone number included in the Letter (as opposed to submitting a written request), she may very well have waived her statutory rights, as Defendant would be under no obligation to comply with Section 1692g(b)'s directives to verify the debt or disclose the original creditor and cease its collection efforts. Therefore, the Court finds that the Letter's demands and threats overshadowed and were inconsistent with the Letter's Section 1692g(a) disclosures. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(b). Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the pleadings on her Section 1692g(b) overshadowing claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   1.
