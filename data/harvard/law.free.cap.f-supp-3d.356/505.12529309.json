Russell, III, United States District Judge\n   THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants President Donald J. Trump, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, and Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard Paul Zukunft's Objections to the Magistrate Judge's Memorandum Opinion and Order (ECF No. 209) and Motion to Stay Compliance with the Magistrate Judge's Memorandum Order and Opinion (ECF No. 208). This case involves equal protection and substantive due process challenges to President Trump's policy banning transgender persons from serving in the military. The Objections and Motion to Stay are ripe for disposition, and no hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2016). For the reasons outlined below, the Court will overrule the Objections and grant the Motion to Stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2016, the Department of Defense (\"DOD\"), after completing a thorough analysis of military costs, readiness, and other factors, concluded that \"there was no basis for the military to exclude men and women who are transgender from openly serving their country, subject to the same fitness requirements as other service members.\" (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 5, ECF No. 148). Subsequently, the Secretary of Defense issued the Open Service Directive to permit transgender persons to serve openly starting July 1, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 26, 2017, however, President Trump published a series of Tweets\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating, \"[T]he United States Government will not accept or allow ... [t]ransgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). On August 25, 2017, President Trump issued a \"Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security\" (\"Transgender Service Member Ban\"), which formalized the ban on transgender service members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). In addition, President Trump directed the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for implementing the policy directives by February 21, 2018 (the \"Implementation Plan\"), with full implementation by March 23, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 14, 2017, the Secretary of Defense issued Terms of Reference for developing the Implementation Plan, which directed the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to lead the development\n   of the Implementation Plan and to convene a Panel of Experts from within DOD to conduct a study to inform the Implementation Plan. (Pls.' Cert. Conf. Counsel Ex. 20 at 2-3, ECF No. 177-24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March 2018, the Secretary of Defense publically released the Implementation Plan, which: (1) prohibited transgender individuals who \"require or have undergone gender transition\" from serving in the military; and (2) permitted all other transgender individuals to serve \"in their biological sex\" as long as they do not have a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria. (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 11; Defs.' Mot. Dissolve Prelim. Inj. Ex. 1 at 2-3, ECF No. 120-1). These three policy directives: (1) the presidential Tweets; (2) the Transgender Service Member Ban; and (3) the Implementation Plan and related Panel of Experts, are at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 28, 2017, fourteen transgender individuals\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, Inc. filed suit against Defendants. (ECF No. 1). Plaintiffs allege that President Trump's ban on transgender persons serving in the military violates: (1) the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution; (2) substantive due process; and (3)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201074\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), which entitles current and certain former members of the military to medical care. (Am.

(ECF No. 40). On October 12, 2017, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. (ECF No. 52). On November 21, 2017, this Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201074\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim. (Nov. 21, 2018 Mem. &amp; Order at 52-53, ECF No. 85).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 4, 2018, the Court referred this case to a United States Magistrate Judge (\"USMJ\") for all discovery. (ECF No. 152). On June 15, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Supplemental Interrogatory Answers and Production. (ECF No. 177-1). In their Motion to Compel, Plaintiffs sought deliberative materials regarding: (1) President Trump's July 2017 Tweets and the Transgender Service Member Ban; (2) the DOD's Panel of Experts; and (3) the Implementation Plan and President Trump's acceptance of the Plan. (Pls.' Mot. Compel at 1, ECF No. 177-1). At the same time, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Judicial Determination of Privilege Claims (ECF No. 178 (sealed document) ) on a PowerPoint presentation that the Army inadvertently produced and Defendants sought to clawback on the theory that it, too, is protected by deliberative process privilege. (Defs.' Objs. Magistrate Judge's Mem. Op. &amp; Order at 5, ECF No. 209). On June 18, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion for a Protective Order to preclude discovery directed at the President and other sources concerning presidential communications and deliberations. (ECF No. 179).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 14, 2018, the USMJ issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order on these three Motions. (Aug. 14, 2018 Mem. Op. [\"Mem. Op.\"], ECF No. 204; Aug. 14, 2018 Order, ECF No. 205). The USMJ granted Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel, dismissed Plaintiffs' Motion for a Judicial Determination of Privilege Claims as moot, and granted Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order as to the President, but denied the Protective Order as to others who communicate with the President. (Mem. Op. at 11; Aug. 14, 2018 Order \u00b6\u00b6 1-3). The USMJ granted Plaintiff's Motion to Compel because there were no justifiable reasons to stay discovery. (Mem. Op. at 4). In addition, applying\n   <em>\n    In re Subpoena Duces Tecum Served on Office of Comptroller of the Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713914,1356180,1344613\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/1422/\">\n    145 F.3d 1422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1424 (D.C. Cir. 1998), the USMJ concluded that deliberative process privilege does not apply given that government intent \"is at the very heart of this litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6). The USMJ dismissed Plaintiffs' Motion for Judicial Determination of Privilege Claims as moot because the USMJ determined that deliberative process privilege does not apply to Plaintiffs' discovery requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Finally, balancing deference to the Executive with Plaintiffs' need for discovery, the USMJ granted Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order as to the President but not as to individuals with whom the President communicates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants now object to the USMJ's Memorandum Opinion and Order, and move to stay the Order. (ECF Nos. 208, 209). Plaintiffs filed an Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Stay on August 31, 2018. (ECF No. 211). Plaintiffs also filed an Opposition to Defendants' Objections to the USMJ's Order on September 14, 2018. (ECF No. 216). On September 28, 2018, Defendants filed a Reply.

Factual Findings\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Defendants argue that the USMJ's Memorandum Opinion and Order are based on \"clearly erroneous\" findings of fact. (Defs.' Objs. Magistrate Judge's Mem. Op. &amp; Order at 24-28). Defendants contend that the USMJ erred in finding that: (1) DOD's Panel of Experts would not have existed but for President Trump's August 2017 Tweets; (2) the circumstances regarding military readiness and deployability could not have changed so dramatically between 2016 and 2018 to warrant the creation of a new policy; and (3) the new policy bans transgender persons from military service.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Here, the USMJ's factual findings are reasonable. First, the USMJ's conclusion that the DOD Panel of Experts would not exist but for President Trump's Tweets on transgender military service is supported by evidence in the record. President Trump issued his series of Tweets on July 26, 2017. When the Secretary of Defense issued Terms of Reference for developing the Implementation Plan over a month later on September 14, 2017, he directed the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to convene a Panel of Experts from within DOD to conduct a study to inform the Implementation Plan. (Pls.' Cert. Conf. Counsel Ex. 20 at 2-3). The timeline of these events would, therefore, make it reasonable to conclude that the Panel of Experts was born of President Trump's Tweets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Nevertheless, Defendants argue that DOD began a review of its transgender service member policy before President Trump's Tweets, and that this review was the true impetus for convening the Panel of Experts. Plaintiffs explain, however, that this review was designed to assess the military's readiness to implement the Open Service Directive, not whether to implement the Open Service Directive at all. Thus, it was reasonable for the USMJ to find that the Panel of Experts would not exist without President Trump's Tweets announcing a change to the policy on transgender military service.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Second, the USMJ's finding that the circumstances regarding military readiness and deployability could not have changed so dramatically between 2016 and 2018 to warrant the creation of a new policy is reasonable based on the limited evidence in the record. Defendants suggest that this finding is clearly erroneous because the review for the Open Service Directive was based on limited and heavily caveated data from an external source, whereas the Panel of Experts' review was based on DOD's own data and experience. Plaintiffs and the USMJ regard the first review as valid because that process incorporated both the military leadership and transgender representatives. In order to explain how conditions changed so dramatically between 2016 and 2018, Defendants would need to produce additional information about the Panel of Experts that they currently seek to protect under deliberative process privilege. Given the lack of evidence in the record suggesting substantial changes to military readiness and deployability, the USMJ's finding that any such changes are too minor to warrant a change in policy is reasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Finally, the USMJ's finding that the Transgender Service Member Ban bans transgender persons from military service is reasonable. Defendants argue that the Implementation Plan would not result in a ban of transgender persons from the military because the new policy is not based on transgender status, but rather on the medical condition of gender dysphoria. The Court is not persuaded. The Implementation Plan states: (1) \"transgender\n    persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service\"; and (2) \"transgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve ... in their biological sex.\" (Mot. Dissolve Prelim. Inj. at 3-4). Prohibiting transgender persons who have undergone transition clearly discriminates on the basis of transgender identity. Moreover, requiring transgender persons who have not undergone transition to serve in their biological sex forces them to \"suppress the very characteristic that defines them as transgender in the first place.\"\n    <em>\n     Karnoski v.
