On October 31, 2017, Maxum brought this diversity jurisdiction action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Kaur, and named several other Defendants that are all parties in the state court proceeding.

Maxum filed a reply on October 22, 2018. ECF No. 53.

The Court finds it appropriate to rule on the motion without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 230(g).

Joshi Sangam was the driver of the tractor-trailer at the time of the accident. UMF 5. Kaur is alleged to have trained Sangam in the operation of the tractor-trailer. UMF 5.

In particular, Maxum points out that this is the only action pending that involves the question of coverage under the insurance policy and that there is no parallel action in state court. Maxum is not a party (nor could it be) to the state court tort claim against its insured. Maxum further submits that judicial administration, fairness to the litigants, and convenience would not be served by Defendants' dilatory request for dismissal on these grounds. This action has been pending for over a year in federal court, the summary judgment motion has been fully briefed, and the parties have stipulated to undisputed facts with regard to the summary judgment motion such that dismissal would result in starting the entire process anew in state court. Maxum also submits that it has not engaged in forum shopping as Defendants do not identify what advantage Maxum gains by seeking a coverage determination in federal court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   since the substantive law of California would apply in both the state and federal forum. Additionally, this action would settle all aspects of the controversy and clarifies the legal issue of whether Maxum owes a duty to defend or indemnify Kaur in the Underlying Action. Lastly, Maxum submits that there is no entanglement of state and federal court systems because the factual issues on which coverage can be determined are undisputed and do not require admission of fault by the insured such that it implicates liability issues in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Besides the fact that insurance law involves state law issues, that the underlying tort action is pending in state court, and that California law provides for declaratory relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201060\">\n    Cal.

These submitted factors are not particularly convincing on their own and do not weigh heavily in favor of abstaining from jurisdiction. Defendants argument that there is a state court action pending ignores that Maxum is not a party to the action and that it does not involve the same legal issues that are presented here - where the state court action is a tort action and this action involves contract interpretation of Kaur's insurance policy with Maxum.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dizol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22427\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1220/#p1222\">\n    133 F.3d at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If there are parallel state proceedings involving the\n   <em>\n    same issues and parties\n   </em>\n   pending at the time the federal declaratory action is filed, there is a presumption that the entire suit should be heard in state court.\") (emphasis added). \"The pendency of a state court action does not, of itself, require a district court to refuse federal declaratory relief...
