Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Petition for Damages in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri. (ECF No. 7) Defendant Reliant Care Management, LLC (\"Reliant Care\") removed the action to federal court on June 8, 2018 based on federal question jurisdiction. (ECF No. 1) Plaintiff contends that he entered into an employment agreement (\"Agreement\") with Reliant Care on April 13, 2015 for a period of 10 years. (Pet. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 7) The terms of the Agreement provided a base salary, monthly bonuses, and benefits, as well as provisions governing the termination of employment \"with cause\" or \"without cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-7) According to Plaintiff, in May of 2017, Reliant Care's owner and COO instructed Plaintiff to ensure that one of Reliant Care's facilities was in compliance with state regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9) Plaintiff issued several directives to the facility, but on May 26, 2017, Reliant Care suspended Plaintiff's employment, claiming that Plaintiff's conduct at the facility was unprofessional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10) On June 15, 2017, Reliant Care terminated Plaintiff's employment for cause, effective immediately. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11) However, Plaintiff claims that Reliant Care did not have grounds to fire Plaintiff for cause and that the proffered reasons of unprofessional conduct and unauthorized company credit card purchases were contrived and without any factual or legal basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Count I of the Petition, Plaintiff alleges breach of contract (Count I) for terminating Plaintiff without cause and failing to pay money and benefits owed under the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-27) Plaintiff further claims wrongful discharge in violation of public policy (Count II) for terminating Plaintiff's employment after he informed Reliant Care of possible illegal behavior with respect to Medicare services and billing and paying company bills with facility residents' personal funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-46) Finally, in Count III, Plaintiff avers that Reliant Care retaliated against him in violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\") by terminating Plaintiff's employment after he reported a nurse's allegations of sexual harassment by a regional director of Reliant Care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-69)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its Notice of Removal, Defendant Reliant Care asserts that ERISA completely preempts Count I because the breach of contract claim relates to employee benefit plans. In addition, Reliant Care contends that removal for federal question jurisdiction is also appropriate in Count II because Plaintiff is alleging a claim under the False Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , with respect to his complaint about alleged Medicare fraud.

First, the provisions cited by Reliant Care in support of its proposition that the severance plan involves an ongoing administrative scheme fail to demonstrate that the benefits \"included such things as the continuation of medical and dental benefits which were to be paid out over time.\"\n   <em>\n    Petersen v. E.F.

Instead, if terminated without cause, Defendant would provide written notice at least 60 days prior to the termination date; Plaintiff would be entitled to compensation accrued through the effective date of the termination; Plaintiff would be entitled to an amount equal to the compensation Plaintiff received in his last full year of employment prior to the effective date of termination and to be paid for a period of 24 months; and Plaintiff would be entitled to any other benefits accrued and owing. (ECF No. 15-1 \u00b6 8(a)(iv) ) The Agreement further provided that severance benefits were only paid on the condition that Plaintiff deliver a resignation from all employee benefit plans and allowed no accrual of benefits during the severance period. (ECF No. 15-1 \u00b6 8(e)(1) &amp; (3) ). Additionally, in the event Plaintiff obtained other employment within 24 months of termination, Defendant would offset the severance benefit payments by Plaintiff's current employment compensation. (ECF No. 15-1 \u00b6 8(e)(2) ). The only reference to continued participation in medical, vision, dental, life insurance, and disability plans pertained to termination for cause, which Plaintiff disputes is applicable to his case. The aforementioned provisions demonstrate that the severance payments would be easily calculated by simple or mechanical determinations not an ongoing administrative scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kulinski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309658\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/21/254/#p257\">\n    21 F.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Simple or mechanical determinations do not necessarily require the establishment of such an administrative scheme.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, review of the contract at issue demonstrates that the contract was a single contract unique to Plaintiff as an executive vice president, not a standard contract for employees. (ECF No. 15-1 \u00b6\u00b6 1-6) Although Reliant Care presents a declaration regarding the similarities between another executive's contract and Plaintiff's contract, Reliant Care has failed to show that the individual contract providing for severance benefits with respect to Plaintiff is an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Further, Defendant has failed to demonstrate that Plaintiff's Petition alleges an ERISA interference claim under \u00a7 510. \"Section 510 of ERISA prohibits, among other things, an employer from discharging or discriminating against a participant in an ERISA plan \" 'for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan.' \"\n   <em>\n    Barnhardt v.

Instead, Plaintiff contends that Reliant Care claimed Plaintiff was unprofessional as a pretext for his termination to avoid paying monies and benefits owed under the Agreement. (Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27) Reliant Care provides no case law in support of its proposition that Plaintiff's allegations regarding pretext for his termination converts to a claim that Reliant Care possessed a specific intent to interfere with Plaintiff's entitlement to ERISA benefits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avenevoli v.

The\n   <em>\n    Roller\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that plaintiff's FLSA claims involved the action of private defendants and not a federal agency, thus requiring a fact-specific inquiry into the defendants' conduct and not a resolution of a federal question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.
