Having considered the motions, submissions, and applicable law, the Court determines the motions should be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a business dispute arising from a prior employment relationship between Plaintiff Six Dimensions, Inc., (\"Six Dimensions\") and Defendant Lynn M. Brading (\"Brading\"). On August 24, 2014, Six Dimensions hired Brading as a Corporate Partnership Manager under an employment agreement (the \"2014 Agreement\"). On June 18, 2015, Brading resigned her employment with Six Dimensions to begin working for Defendant Perficient, Inc., (\"Perficient\"). At Brading's resignation, Brading and Six Dimensions entered into a termination agreement (the \"2015 Agreement\"). Following Brading's resignation, Six Dimensions alleges Brading misappropriated confidential information and solicited employees of Six Dimensions on behalf of and in cooperation with Perficient in violation of the 2014 Agreement and the 2015 Agreement. Six Dimensions further alleges Perficient unlawfully copied or caused copying of protected work and misappropriated confidential information of Six Dimensions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on the foregoing, on September 5, 2017, Six Dimensions filed this lawsuit against Brading and Perficient (collectively, \"Defendants\"). Six Dimensions brings claims for tortious interference with contract, unfair competition, copyright infringement, tortious interference with prospective economic relations, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation of trade secrets. On October 30, 2018, Defendants moved for summary judgment. The same day, Six Dimensions moved for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    II.

Moreover, conclusory allegations unsupported by specific facts will not prevent an award of summary judgment; the plaintiff cannot rest on his allegations to get to a\n   jury without any significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Emps. v.

Further, it is not the function of the Court to search the record on the nonmovant's behalf for evidence which may raise a fact issue.\n   <em>\n    Topalian v.

Therefore, \"[a]lthough we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the nonmoving party may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings, but must respond by setting forth specific facts indicating a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodson v.
