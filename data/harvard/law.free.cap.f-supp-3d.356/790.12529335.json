Strand, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This case is before me on (1) a Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R) (Doc. No. 53) in which Chief United States Magistrate Judge Kelly K.E. Mahoney recommends that I grant defendant's motion (Doc. No. 41) to suppress evidence and (2) the Government's unresisted motion (Doc. No. 55) to dismiss the indictment without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Because the Government is seeking dismissal without prejudice, I find it prudent to address the R &amp; R concerning defendant's motion to suppress. Both parties have filed notices (Doc. Nos. 54, 56) of no objection to the R &amp; R. Because there are no objections, I review the R &amp; R for clear error.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grinder v.

Having reviewed the R &amp; R, I find no error - clear or otherwise - in Judge Mahoney's factual findings and legal conclusions. As such, I will accept the R &amp; R and grant the motion to suppress evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As for the Government's motion to dismiss, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a) permits the Government to dismiss an indictment with leave of court. The dismissal must be with the defendant's consent only if it occurs during trial. Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a). Here, while the defendant's consent is not required, the Government's\n   motion states that counsel for the defendant has indicated that the defendant has no objection to the requested relief. Doc. No. 55 at 1. As such, I will grant the motion and dismiss the indictment without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1.

Doc. 41. After one of his friends gave the hard drive to a police officer, the officer waited six months before obtaining a search warrant for the hard drive. Fife argues that this six-month delay rendered the hard drive unreasonably seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Government resists. Doc. 49. I recommend\n   <strong>\n    granting\n   </strong>\n   the motion to suppress (Doc. 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On Saturday, September 4, 2016, Fife was involved in a car accident that resulted in his hospitalization and caused his friends and family to be concerned about his possible drug use. Fife had been staying with his mother and sister, Sheryl McKevitt, on property his mother and sister co-owned in Milford, Iowa. The property contained a trailer and a shed, and Fife spent a lot of time in the shed, even sleeping there on occasion (he also slept in the trailer sometimes). While Fife was still in the hospital, Fife's mother and sister sent Fife's nephew and a close family friend, Chad Wellendorf, to search the shed for drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fife's mother and sister told Wellendorf and Fife's nephew where the key to the shed was located, and they were able to gain access to the locked shed. Inside, they found needles and baggies containing what appeared to be drug residue. Other friends and family members arrived, and they gathered the drug paraphernalia for disposal. Eventually, someone called Milford Police Officer Matt Myhre (Officer Myhre), who agreed to dispose of the drug paraphernalia in a safe manner. Officer Myhre was on the property for this purpose at some point during the day, but he never entered the shed, and he did not\n   learn about the search of Fife's computer that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Believing they might find more evidence of drug use,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fife's friends and family decided to search Fife's computer\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   located in the shed. After two people failed to guess Fife's password, McKevitt-a computer whiz-booted the computer in safe mode and deleted the file containing the password so that she could gain access to the computer. Once in the computer, she saw two folders named for Fife's former stepdaughters. When she opened the folders, she saw videos depicting Fife's former stepdaughters, both minors, getting in and out of the shower in the nude, as well as still images taken from the videos. In addition to McKevitt, at least three other people saw some of the nude images or videos that day: Wellendorf; Matt Hallow, a family friend; and Fife's brother Travis Fife (who I will refer to as Travis to avoid confusion with Defendant). After seeing the images, the group discussed what to do. They decided to destroy the hard drive to protect Fife. McKevitt and Wellendorf took the hard drive out of the computer and gave it to Hallow to destroy. After the hard drive was taken out, they destroyed what remained of the computer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Later that same day, Hallow began to feel guilty about destroying the hard drive. He called Wellendorf and described how he was feeling. Wellendorf then contacted Travis, who agreed that the hard drive should not be destroyed. Wellendorf called Hallow back and relayed what Travis had said, concluding that Hallow should do what he needed to do. Hallow asked Wellendorf to contact Officer Myhre, who they both knew by virtue of living in the same small town. Wellendorf called Officer Myhre and told him that Hallow would be dropping something off. He did not give any more information about the hard drive, where it came from, or what it contained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Still on September 4, Hallow gave the hard drive to Officer Myhre and described what it contained. On September 7 and 8, 2016, Officer Myhre interviewed Hallow, Wellendorf, McKevitt, and Travis. They all confirmed that the hard drive belonged to Fife and that they had seen videos and nude images of Fife's former stepdaughters that appeared to have been taken surreptitiously. Although Fife's mother was not interviewed, someone told Officer Myhre that she had also seen some of the images.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Officer Myhre did not investigate the matter further until he obtained a search warrant for the hard drive on March 6, 2017. Doc. 42-2. Officer Myhre gave no reason for the delay, other than that he was unaware of any deadline to obtain a warrant. The hard drive was given to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a forensic\n   evaluation, which was completed in August 2017. In November 2017, Officer Myhre and Special Agent Rob Larsen of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation interviewed Fife for the first time about the images on the hard drive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 52. Officers interviewed Fife again in June 2018, and on June 21, 2018, a federal grand jury issued an indictment (Doc. 1) charging Fife with one count of sexual exploitation of a child, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (e) ; and one count of possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At no point did Fife request that officers return the hard drive, but I find that the evidence does not establish that Fife had any idea police had the hard drive until he was first interviewed in November 2017 (and even then, he perhaps did not know the hard drive was in police possession). Wellendorf testified that word spread around their small town that Fife's computer contained nude videos and images of his former stepdaughters shortly after the images were discovered in September 2016. He further testified that he believed Fife's mother knew that the hard drive had not been destroyed because after Officer Myhre conducted the September 2016 interviews, Fife's mother was angry with Hallow and seemed to blame him. McKevitt testified that she was unaware that officers had the hard drive until Fife was indicted and arrested in June 2018. Similarly, Fife submitted an affidavit averring that \"a family member told [him] ... the hard drive had been destroyed\"; that \"although the officers suggested [in November 2017] that they had viewed images from a hidden camera, they never told [him] that police actually had possession of [his] hard drive\"; and that he \"did not know Hallow had given police the hard drive until the indictment was returned in June 2018.\" Doc. 50-1. The transcript\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Fife's November 2017 interview shows that Special Agent Larsen suggested that they had evidence of the videos but never mentioned the hard drive, saying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 \"Uhm, have, have, uhm, some, some videos that, uhm, have come into our hands, uhm, and, uhm, you know, it shows you adjusting the camera.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 \"Would it surprise if I had evidence to indicate otherwise [with regard to whether Fife ever set up cameras in the bathroom]?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 \"I can tell you what I have.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 \"Well, you, you're gonna have to do a helluva lot better job of, of that to convince me and, and Matt on, on that [that he meant only to record himself and his wife]....

We have a lot more than that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 \"[T]he damage has already been done .... [b]ased on the videos I've seen ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Doc. 52. It does not seem that Fife knew officers had access to the videos prior to that interview, as he repeatedly denied the existence of such videos or that any videos were anything other than accidental, and he expressed several times that he felt sick to his stomach when the officers described the recordings they had seen.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Special Agent Larsen asked what Fife had done with recordings from SD cards, he said he had \"put it on a computer and then in a file, but I don't even have a computer anymore.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also indicated that he\n   knew people went through his computer after his accident, but he did not know anything about videos of his former stepdaughters. When Special Agent Larsen indicated he had already seen the videos, Fife asked, \"if they turn in those videos, why not turn in all of 'em that are, if they got these SD cards or are on the computer?\" Viewing the transcript in whole, it does not appear to me that Fife knew officers had any evidence of the videos prior to the November 2017 interview. Moreover, it is not even clear if he knew they had the hard drive after the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Fife filed the pending motion to suppress on October 19, 2018. Doc. 41. The Government sought an extension of time to file a responsive pleading, which was granted. Docs. 44, 45. The Government's responsive pleading was filed on November 5, 2018. Doc. 49. Defendant's reply brief was filed on November 12, 2018. Doc. 50. I held a hearing on the motion on November 14, 2018, at which Officer Myhre, Special Agent Larsen, Wellendorf, and McKevitt testified. Doc. 51. At the hearing, I admitted the following exhibits into evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Defense Exhibit A (Doc. 42-1) - Officer Myhre's police report\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 Defense Exhibit B (Doc. 42-2) and Government Exhibit 1 (Doc. 49-1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   - search warrant application, affidavit, and attachments\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 Defense Exhibit C (Doc. 42-3) - search warrant return\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 Defense Exhibit D (Doc. 42-4) - Iowa court docket related to search warrant\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Defense Exhibit E (Doc. 50-1) - Fife's affidavit\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 Government Exhibit 2 (Doc. 52) - transcript of November 2017 interview with Fife prepared by Special Agent Larsen\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Whether the Delay in Obtaining a Search Warrant Rendered the Seizure Unreasonable\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects \"against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. It does not apply, however, to an unreasonable search or seizure by a private party \"that [is] neither instigated by nor performed on behalf of a governmental entity.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Goodale\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694648\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/917/#p921\">\n    738 F.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921 (8th Cir. 2013). Moreover, law enforcement may perform the same search as the private party without violating the Fourth Amendment, as long as the search does not \"exceed[ ] the scope of the private search.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Miller\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11710907\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/813/#p815\">\n    152 F.3d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 815 (8th Cir. 1998). The rationale for this rule-which at least one circuit court has called into question in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is that because a private search frustrates a person's \"legitimate expectation of privacy\" in his property, \"an ensuing police intrusion that stays within the\n   limits of the private search is not a search for Fourth Amendment purposes.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11710907\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/813/#p815\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Just as the private-search doctrine acts as an exception to the warrant requirement, so does consent. Law enforcement need not obtain a warrant when they have consent to search property from the defendant or from \"[a] third party with 'common authority' over a property, or a third party that a government agent reasonably believes has 'common authority' over a property.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Hinkle\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3349877\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/836/#p840\">\n    456 F.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840 (8th Cir. 2006). \"Common authority is a function of mutual use, joint access, and control ....\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v. James\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295910\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/353/606/#p613\">\n    353 F.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613 (8th Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, the parties do not dispute that the private-search doctrine applies; the search and seizure of Fife's computer by his friends and family did not implicate the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government does not argue that no governmental search or seizure occurred for purposes of the Fourth Amendment nor that officers did not need a search warrant to perform a full search of the hard drive. And the parties agree that the initial seizure of the hard drive by Officer Myhre on September 4, 2016, was lawful, as he had probable cause to believe it contained child pornography based on Hallow's statements (which was further bolstered by the witness interviews he conducted on September 7 and 8, 2016). At issue is whether Officer Myhre's six-month delay in obtaining a search warrant for the hard drive rendered the seizure unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In deciding whether the seizure became unreasonable, the parties primarily rely on a line of cases from the Eleventh Circuit beginning with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Mitchell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642555\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1347/\">\n    565 F.3d 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam). In\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , officers seized a hard drive from the defendant's residence when the defendant refused to give consent to search the computer during a consensual encounter in which he admitted the computer contained child pornography.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642555\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1347/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642555\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1347/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642555\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1347/\">\n    at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the Government proffered no reason for the delay in obtaining a warrant. After the interviews Officer Myhre conducted on September 7 and 8, 2016, he performed no additional work on the case for months, simply because he did not believe the matter was time sensitive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mitchell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3642555\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1347/\">\n    565 F.3d at 1353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting explanation that \"[n]o effort was made to obtain a warrant within a reasonable time because law enforcement officers simply believed that there was no rush\"). The affidavit in support of the search warrant appears to consist primarily of boilerplate language, with about a single-spaced page of original content describing the information about the private search that Officer Myhre obtained during the September 2016 interviews. Doc. 42-2 at 8-9. The length of the delay-six months-is longer by far than the delays at issue in the Eleventh Circuit cases, which were around one or two months (when neither the defendant nor another person with \"common authority\" over the seized item consented to its seizure). The length of delay, in combination with the lack of justification for it, weighs heavily against the seizure being reasonable. In both\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   and this case, private persons told law enforcement that the hard drive contained child pornography, but no officer saw the images for themselves (unlike in\n   <em>\n    Laist\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sparks\n   </em>\n   ). The governmental interest here is stronger than in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , however. Rather than stating generally that the hard drive contained child pornography (as in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ), here, the private persons described the videos and images they had seen to police and identified the victims, confirming that they were minors-so the officer could verify that the private persons were not mistaken as a matter of law or fact that what they had seen constituted child pornography (although they still could have been lying).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Fife's possessory interest in the hard drive was more like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   than the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Laist\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Sparks.\n   </em>\n   Fife did not consent to the search or seizure of the computer. As I found in the background section, the computer belonged\n   to him and no one else.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, he protected his interest in the computer through a password that was strong enough that two people who know him well were not able to crack it; it was only when his sister used computer skills far greater than the average person's that his friends and family were able to access his computer (in\n   <em>\n    Laist\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sparks\n   </em>\n   , the seized items-a computer and phone, respectively-were not password protected). During the pendency of the seizure and prior to the issuance of the search warrant, Fife was not in custody nor charged with a crime, and although his computer was destroyed, he still had an interest in accessing any non-contraband files contained on the hard drive (which he did not have the opportunity to retrieve from the hard drive prior to its seizure, as in\n   <em>\n    Laist\n   </em>\n   ). And although Fife failed to request the hard drive's return, I do not find that he knew police had the hard drive-prior to the issuance of the search warrant, it appears that Fife believed the hard drive had been destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the hearing on the motion, the Government rested almost entirely on its theory that Fife abandoned the hard drive, in reliance on\n   <em>\n    Sparks.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sparks\n   </em>\n   is readily distinguishable, however: in that case, the third party found a lost phone; the defendants knew who had the phone but made no effort to recover it after the first day it was lost; and the defendants obtained a replacement phone. Here, on the other hand, third parties took Fife's computer from the locked shed where he resided, and it appears he was not able to replace the files contained on the hard drive. Most importantly, as I noted above, Fife did not know to contact the police to recover his hard drive, because he did not know that they had the hard drive-he believed it had been destroyed. The court in\n   <em>\n    Sparks\n   </em>\n   repeatedly emphasized that its holding depended on the fact that the defendants could have recovered the phone with \"reasonable effort,\" since they knew who had the phone and where to find her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356826\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1323/\">\n    806 F.3d at 1342-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I find that the\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   unreasonable-delay test applies in such circumstances.

As the Government's briefing notes, the good-faith exception applies when an officer acts in good faith on a warrant that is \"later determined to be invalid\" or to lack probable cause.

Here, no defect was found with the warrant itself; instead, the problem is with the delay in obtaining a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The purpose of the good-faith exception is to ensure that the suppression of evidence acts to deter violations of the Fourth Amendment-the idea being that suppression serves no purpose if law enforcement searched or seized evidence in accordance with a warrant approved by a \"detached and neutral\" judge acting as a \"reliable safeguard against improper searches,\" such that officers act with \"the objectively reasonable belief that their conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Here,\n   however, that a judge found probable cause to issue a search warrant does not reflect a \"detached and neutral\" determination on the reasonableness of the six-month delay, especially because it is unclear from the affidavit in support of the search warrant how long the hard drive had been in police custody (and no additional testimony supported issuance of the search warrant). Doc. 42-2 at 8-9, 13. The affidavit reflects that the private search and seizure of the hard drive occurred on September 4, 2016, but it does not explicitly state when the interviews occurred or when Officer Myhre obtained the hard drive (although the affidavit does suggest that the hard drive was taken out of the computer in September 2016 and given to Hallow to destroy and notes that Hallow brought the hard drive to Officer Myhre and that it \"has been secured at the Milford Police Department since receiving it\").

If this were all that was needed, evidence would never be suppressed following these types of violations because, by definition, the police would always have a warrant before they searched. In the line of Supreme Court decisions on which we have relied, the question is not whether police ultimately obtained a warrant; it is whether they failed to do so within a reasonable time.... Furthermore, removing this sort of police misconduct from the ambit of the exclusionary rule would have significant implications: it would eliminate the rule's deterrent effect on unreasonably long seizures. Police could seize any item-a phone, a computer, a briefcase, or even a house-for an unreasonably long time without concern for the consequences, evidentiary and otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752255\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/1029/#p1031\">\n    675 F.3d at 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
