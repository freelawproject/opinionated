BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n   In a September 6, 2018, Opinion, this Court granted Defendant Internal Revenue Service's Motion for Summary Judgment as to certain Freedom of Information Act requests made by Plaintiffs Thomas and Beth Montgomery. In now seeking reconsideration, Plaintiffs argue that the Court misstated certain facts, improperly relied on\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declarations, and misconstrued the scope of a FOIA exemption. As none of their objections calls the prior Opinion into question, the Court denies the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

After several years of subsequent litigation, the parties reached a global settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 (First MSJ), Exh. B (Global Settlement) at 2, 4-5. This did not end the war, however, as the Montgomerys then filed a number of FOIA requests aimed at gathering information about how they might have originally come to the IRS's attention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Compl.), Exh. A (FOIA Request) at 1-2. At issue here are five of those requests, which seek forms the IRS may have in its possession in connection with whistleblower activity related to the Montgomerys.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701994,12584652\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/557/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant eventually issued a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response as to those requests, refusing to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records. It based that response on a number of FOIA exemptions including Exemption 7(D), which protects information that \"could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(D). Dissatisfied with that response, the Montgomerys filed this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After an initial round of briefing on several procedural issues, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Court rendered a mixed verdict, siding with Defendant as to the five requests at issue here and with Plaintiffs as to the others. While the Court required the IRS to conduct a further search on the latter group of requests - a process now underway - it agreed with the Service that disclosure of the existence of records responsive to the first five requests under these circumstances could, as a general matter, be reasonably expected to reveal the identity of a confidential source. The\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response based on Exemption 7(D) was thus appropriate. The Court rejected Plaintiffs' arguments that the Service's past litigating positions or public statements were inconsistent with its current position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court understands Plaintiffs to offer three general bases to reconsider its prior Opinion: (A) the Opinion misstates facts; (B) it improperly relies on\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declarations; and (C) it improperly upheld Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response based on FOIA Exemption 7(D). Each concern is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Montgomerys first take issue with the Court's description of the factual background of the case. In particular, they say the Opinion wrongly stated that they owed penalties to the IRS as a result of their role in several businesses subject to IRS enforcement proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 51 (Mot.) at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n    330 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   166 ). To the extent the Court may have improperly characterized the Montgomerys' personal income-tax history from the morass of factual disputes that marked the parties' prior litigation, this had no effect on its decision upholding the IRS's response to several of their FOIA requests. Reconsideration on this ground is thus unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123794\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/170/#p173\">\n    189 F.Supp.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (D.D.C. 2016) (reconsideration based on alleged factual error necessary only if court failed to consider \"data that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the Court\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs themselves point to no nexus between these statements and the Court's analysis of the FOIA issues in this case. They instead appear to rely on more general allegations that the Court is somehow prejudiced against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 2. Such assertions are not well founded. Recall that in the most recent round of briefing, the Court sided with the Montgomerys as to more than half of their requests; in the previous procedural round, it sided with them in whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523575\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/391/#p393\">\n    292 F.Supp.3d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Today, furthermore, it has issued an Order granting Plaintiffs' most recent motion challenging the sufficiency of the Government's search for responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 62. How those decisions, which are equally related - or, more accurately, equally\n   <em>\n    unrelated\n   </em>\n   - to the statements Plaintiffs mention, fit with their allegation of prejudice here is unclear. In any event, this complaint does not warrant reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     In Camera\n    </em>\n    Declarations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Next up is Plaintiffs' argument that the Opinion improperly relied on\n   <em>\n    in cam\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    era\n   </em>\n   declarations. The IRS did submit declarations or portions of declarations for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review in support of its withholdings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31 (Def. Second MSJ), Attach. 4 (Declaration of Patricia Williams). The Court then referenced those materials when explaining that the agency had met its burden of justifying its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response based on Exemption 7(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n    330 F.Supp.3d at 170-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Montgomerys offer three objections to these declarations, none of which justifies reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first is that such declarations are not appropriate in a FOIA case involving Exemption 7(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 6-7. But courts have expressly sanctioned the use of such declarations where \"no additional information ... may be publicly disclosed without revealing precisely the information that the agency seeks to withhold.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnard v. DHS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3344778\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/598/1/#p16\">\n    598 F.Supp.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (D.D.C. 2009) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Life Extension Found., Inc. v. IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4300476\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/915/174/#p185\">\n    915 F.Supp.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185-86 (D.D.C. 2013) (relying on\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declarations to uphold withholding under Exemption 7(D) ). As the Court explained, an agency's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response based on Exemption 7(D) can be just such a situation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The difficulty here is that if the Government describes its interactions with a specific source, it would thereby undercut the protection that\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   provides. In other words, because a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is meant to obscure the very existence of the source (or attempted source), the Government cannot offer any public statement concerning the confidentiality assurances given to that source (or a statement that no source exists). As the Service persuasively argues, even though the identity of an informant may not be at risk in every case, to protect whistleblowers in cases where disclosure of the existence of records could lead to their identification, it must assert\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   whenever an informant is involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n    330 F.Supp.3d at 170-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In such circumstances, the agency must still explain in a public declaration why, as a general matter, the information requested would reveal the identity of a confidential source if one existed. For example, if the purported source were part of an agency's whistleblower program, as in this case, it is required to explain publicly that such sources are given assurances of confidentiality. But that's not all. The agency must also explain whether such records in fact exist, and, if they do, why disclosure of their existence would reveal the identity of a specific confidential source in this case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n    at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Where that very explanation may reveal information protected by a FOIA exemption, like here, it can be provided to the Court via\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declarations and paired with a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    In camera\n   </em>\n   declarations, properly understood, thus\n   <em>\n    safeguard\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' rights to government records, at least in this context. Were the Court, as Plaintiffs wish, to refuse to grant Defendant leave to file declarations\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and responsive documents were to exist, the Court could not confirm that the records' disclosure would in fact implicate a FOIA exemption -\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , that disclosure would compromise the identity of a specific source for whom the agency \"either has given an express grant of confidentiality or satisfied the\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   factors to show an implicit grant\" of confidentiality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It would simply have to take the Government at its word that this is the case. By reviewing such\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   materials, conversely, the Court can closely evaluate the Government's reasoning and then order as much of the materials released as is consistent with the exemption the agency has invoked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roth v.

Cir. 2011). Such a procedure is\n   assuredly second best to a full-throated debate about the specific records in question. But that is why such declarations may be relied on only in the rare circumstance, like here, where such debate would \"reveal[ ] precisely the information that the agency seeks to withhold.\"\n   <em>\n    Life Extension\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4300476\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/915/174/#p185\">\n    915 F.Supp.2d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second objection to the Court's consideration of\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   declarations is that they should not be believed given that \"Defendant's track record with Plaintiffs is marked by fundamental dishonesty and contradictions.\" Mot. at 7. Of course, this complaint applies as much to public declarations as\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   ones. To the extent Plaintiffs think\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   declaration must be\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   public because of the agency's alleged misconduct, the Court disagrees. It has not observed here the sort of bad-faith conduct Plaintiffs allege the IRS committed several years ago and has seen nothing to make it question the veracity of the declarations in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Montgomerys last assert that consideration of these declarations is \"contrary to the Court's Minute Order of April 26, 2018[,] in which the Court stated that, '[t]o the extent the Court considers any\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   materials, it will ensure that Plaintiffs are given an opportunity to be heard such that they are not thereby prejudiced.\" Mot. at 1. Not so. Plaintiffs have now filed three sets of briefs addressing this matter - their opposition to the Government's request to file these declarations, their cross-motion for summary judgment and opposition to the Government's motion, and this Motion for Reconsideration. They have voiced their concerns about the declarations and the Court has heard - and rejected - them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Having considered this briefing, the Court has done much of what Plaintiffs themselves requested and all of what this Circuit requires. \"[A]fter reviewing the declarations submitted by Defendant,\" the Court has \"ma[d]e available\" to Plaintiffs \"as much as possible of [any such]\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   submission[s].\" ECF No. 33 (Mot. for Leave to File Opposition) at 10 (citation omitted). That is to say, none of the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   submissions could be released without compromising information protected by Exemption 7(D).

Under that doctrine, an agency may be barred from asserting\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    or a FOIA exemption if doing so would be irreconcilable with its previous official statements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wolf v.

Take the\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    -waiver argument first.

The plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that \"the\n    <em>\n     specific\n    </em>\n    information\" is already \"in the public domain by official disclosure.\"\n    <em>\n     Wolf\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n     473 F.3d at 378\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Plaintiffs maintain that the IRS has officially acknowledged that there was no confidential informant in this case, so it cannot assert an exemption whose sole purpose is to protect against the disclosure of the identity of a confidential source. Once again, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not borne their burden. As to the first and second prongs, the Court has explained why the information requested sweeps more broadly than, and does not match, the information previously disclosed. To wit, the whistleblower forms requested may contain substantial information about any persons who have provided information to the IRS or any details those persons may have provided. Of course, the general statements by the IRS in prior litigation that that there was no informant do not match such information and thus are not official acknowledgements of that information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Plaintiffs rejoin that such information, if it exists, could not implicate Exemption 7(D).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 9-10. (To the extent the Court did not directly address this argument in its prior Opinion,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n     ,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    it does so\n    now.) But they are wrong. The scattered statements in the previous litigation do not rule out the presence of Exemption 7(D)-protected information in the requested records. A brief refresher: Several IRS officials in previous litigation involving partnerships managed by Plaintiff Thomas Montgomery stated that \"there had been no whistleblower\" and that \"there was not ... an informant who put the Internal Revenue Service on notice\" of certain tax conduct.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 38, Attach. 2 (Plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts), \u00b6\u00b6 34-38. The context of those statements is critical. A number were specific to particular partnerships; several did not address whether there might have been an informant as to Plaintiff Beth Montgomery.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 13, Attach. 9 (Plaintiffs' Motion for Disclosure in\n    <em>\n     Southgate\n    </em>\n    Litigation) at ECF pp. 25-26; ECF No. 13, Attach. 11 (Gee Deposition and Thurber Testimony) at ECF pp. 5, 26-28. Some were also limited in time -\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , \"And we did not have any informants involved in any of the returns we classified during that week of December, 2005.\" Thurber Testimony at ECF p. 28.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Plaintiffs have not shown that these statements mean there could be no confidential source whose identity would be compromised if responsive documents were revealed. There may have been such a source during a different time period from that addressed in the statements, yet still within the eight-year period subject to Plaintiffs' requests.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl., \u00b6 16. Or there may have been a source reporting on conduct or persons outside the scope of that litigation. Or it is possible that someone might be a confidential source within the meaning of Exemption 7(D) but not have been considered an informant or whistleblower in the investigations that were subject of prior litigation - perhaps because the IRS did not rely upon their information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Montgomery\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n     330 F.Supp.3d at 170-71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Indeed, Thomas Montgomery himself argued that the Government's prior statements left open the question of whether there was a confidential informant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Southgate\n    </em>\n    Motion for Disclosure at ECF pp. 25-30;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 19 (Opp. to First MSJ), Attach. 1 (Plaintiffs' Statement of Disputed Material facts) at ECF p. 6 (describing IRS statements on informant issue as \"immaterial, incomplete, inaccurate, and misleading\"). All those possibilities, which Plaintiffs have done little to dispel, demonstrate the Montgomerys have not met their burden of showing that \"the specific information\" subject to their requests and protected by Exemption 7(D) is \"in the public domain by official disclosure.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wolf\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n     473 F.3d at 378\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <em>\n     2. Estoppel\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Plaintiffs' next argument was that a prior judicial decision collaterally estopped the IRS from now asserting that there might have been a confidential source. Recall that the district court in\n    <em>\n     Bemont Investments, LLC v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203057437\">\n     2010 WL 3057437\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (E.D. Tex. Aug. 2, 2010),\n    <em>\n     aff'd in part and rev'd in part\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877691\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/339/#p341\">\n     679 F.3d 339\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (5th Cir. 2012), stated that \"[t]here was no informant [t]here.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *13. This one fails for the same reason the official-acknowledgement argument did: The issue the\n    <em>\n     Bemont\n    </em>\n    court decided does not resolve the question of whether there are responsive records protected by Exemption 7(D). In particular, that court's remark was focused on that litigation during that time period. So even if the court's understanding of the terms \"informant\" or \"whistleblower\" mapped onto Exemption 7(D)'s term \"confidential source,\" which is far from clear, its determination did not address the field of possibilities of such sources as applied to Thomas and Beth Montgomery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     3. Exemption 7(D)\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Montgomerys last contend that the Court's decision is contrary to the terms of FOIA Exemption 7(D), which applies only to \"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\" that \"could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(7)(D). They maintain that the decision expands that exemption to persons who provided information without assurances of confidentiality, who may not even be \"sources,\" and whose identities are not at risk of disclosure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 11-15. But the Opinion did nothing of the sort.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Take the issue of confidentiality first. For Exemption 7(D) to apply, the source must have \"provided information based upon an express grant of confidentiality or 'in circumstances from which such an assurance could reasonably be inferred.' \"\n    <em>\n     Montgomery\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n     330 F.Supp.3d at 170\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     U.S. Dep't of Justice v.

As the Court explained, in the particular circumstances of the\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response here, the IRS met this standard. It explained publicly why the records, if they exist, would reveal the identity of a source given either an express or implied grant of confidentiality.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Second MSJ, Attach. 6 (Declaration of Amy Mielke), \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Then it submitted information\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    for the Court to confirm that, if responsive documents existed, they in fact implicated such a confidential source. Further explanation of the assurances given to a source, if any, would realize the harm the agency seeks to avoid because it would reveal whether any such source existed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Montgomery\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n     330 F.Supp.3d at 170\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, the IRS thus fully complied with\n    <em>\n     Roth\n    </em>\n    's requirement that \"an agency 'publicly explain[ ] to the extent it can why it has concluded that certain sources provided information under an express or implied assurance of confidentiality.' \" Mot. at 14 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Roth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383192,3555731\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/1161/\">\n     642 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1185 ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    What about Plaintiffs' argument that Exemption 7(D) does not cover \"attempted\" sources?\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 11. The Court's Opinion, for starters, did not depend on the exemption reaching persons who, in Plaintiffs' parlance, merely attempt to become confidential sources. As explained above, notwithstanding the Government's prior statements about informants, any responsive records may well contain information about what Plaintiffs refer to as\n    <em>\n     actual\n    </em>\n    confidential sources.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    Section III.C.1. The Court notes, however, that the terms of Exemption 7(D) comfortably include persons who provided information to the Government under an assurance of confidentiality where such information was never actually relied upon in a particular investigation or prosecution. To wit, the exemption protects the identity of a \"source,\" a term ordinarily understood to include persons who merely provide information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     American Heritage Dictionary\n    </em>\n    1674 (5th ed. 2011) (defining source as \"one ... that supplies information\"). The upshot is that, either way you understand the exemption, the whistleblower forms Plaintiffs request, if they exist, are likely to contain information from and about protected sources.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The Montgomerys last insist that Exemption 7(D) only protects the\n    <em>\n     identities\n    </em>\n    of confidential sources and thus cannot be invoked to shield from disclosure the\n    <em>\n     existence\n    </em>\n    of a confidential source.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 12-14. The Court agrees with the former but disagrees with the latter. As explained, there are some circumstances in which the divulging of the existence of a confidential source will also reveal that source's identity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Montgomery\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527091\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/161/#p168\">\n     330 F.Supp.3d at 170-71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Those circumstances, as the IRS explains, obtain here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mielke Decl., \u00b6 13. The Court's decision thus does not broaden the scope of Exemption 7(D) - it respects it and the harms it is intended to prevent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     FBI v.
