In this lawsuit, Zeus's insurer, Plaintiff Great American E &amp; S Insurance Company, seeks a declaration that it has no duty to provide a defense to Zeus in a suit filed against Zeus by one of its customers, Spring Windows Fashions LLC.

Zeus is an Illinois limited liability company whose members are Illinois citizens and whose principal place of business is in Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)

When Zeus sued SWF, seeking recovery for the alleged misrepresentations under various theories, SWF counterclaimed, alleging breaches of warranty and negligence and demanding indemnification for the cost of replacing the batteries in the window products. (GA 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 5; Answer and Counterclaim of Spring Window in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Cow.%204382\">\n    17 C 4382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Exhibit B to Complaint [1-2].) In the\n   lawsuit before this court, Zeus seeks a declaration that its insurer, Defendant Great American, is liable to provide coverage for losses SWF is seeking to recover from Zeus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. SWF Reports of Battery Performance Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2016, March 2016, July 2016, and August 2016, Zeus and SWF entered into a series of purchase orders in which Zeus, a private labeler of batteries, supplied SWF with AA lithium ion batteries for use in SWF's motorized window shade products. (GA 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7.) On June 7, 2016, a customer of one of the retail stores that distribute SWF's products complained about a problem involving the batteries for one of those products; the customer reported that one of the battery tubes was so hot that it almost burned his hands, and the batteries inside were charred and melted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8; Incident Report, Exhibit H to GA 56.1 Resp.) SFW prepared an incident report about the June 7 complaint, but did not immediately notify Zeus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; Incident Report, 6/7/2016, Exhibit H to GA 6.1 Resp.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Four more complaints followed. For the first two of these, in September 2016, SWF again prepared incident reports, but did not notify Zeus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Zeus did receive reports concerning two more incidents, the first in November 2016 and another in February 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Zeus contends that the report it received on November 11, 2016 did not identify the \"subject battery\" as the cause of the incident (Zeus Local Rule 56.1 Statement (\"Zeus 56.1 Stmt.\") [18] \u00b6 12), but in the e-mail message Zeus cites, SWF described \"a very serious incident with Zeus batteries\" resulting in \"damages depicted in the attached photos.\" (Nov. 11, 2016 e-mail message from Keith Carlson, Exhibit 1 to Decl. of Mills Rendell [19], at 6.) The message stated, further, that SWF was \"very concerned\" about \"safety and liability\" issues, as well as SWF's own reputation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The message noted that this was the \"fourth major concern [SWF had] had with Zeus batteries in about a month,\" the other three involving \"leaking batteries,\" and that \"all indications\" concerning testing of the SWF product suggested \"a catastrophic battery failure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The court concludes that Zeus was in fact on notice as of November 2016 that its batteries were involved in a product failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Great American insists that Zeus knew this as early as June 2016 (GA 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 12), but the materials Great American cites do not support this assertion. The June 1, 2016 e-mail message Great American cites is an internal exchange at SFW describing a complaint from a customer of a leaking battery; there is no indication that Zeus batteries were identified in any such complaint. Keith Carlson of SWF forwarded the exchange to Gina Galante at Zeus, requesting that Zeus, like a competitor battery source, provide SFW with a \"no leak guarantee.\" (June 1, 2016 Carlson e-mail, Exhibit C to GA 56.1 Resp.; Galante Dep., Exhibit A to GA 56.1 Resp. at 50:8-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 13, 2016, Herb Holmstedt and Bert Olsen of Zeus met with six representatives of SWF. (Holmstedt Memo, June 13, 2016, Exhibit B to GA 56.1 Add'l.) According to a memo prepared by Holmstedt after the meeting, the parties met \"to review patent concerns, discuss the recent battery quality issues, the battery leak warranty and new programs,\" with patent concerns being the \"top priority.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The three quality issues identified in Holmstedt's memo were one \"battery that a customer claimed leaked\" a set of batteries that were \"dead on arrival\"-that is, they did not function; and a recent complaint about a \"melting case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The memo\n   notes that it was not clear that Zeus was the source of the battery that had leaked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the conclusion of the meeting, Zeus agreed to provide SWF with \"a copy of the battery leak test that the products underwent\" at the direction of the battery manufacturer's sales agent, as well as its standard warranty and a \"no leak\" guarantee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:23-32:5; 33:17-34:3.) SWF also planned to conduct its own leak test. (Holmstedt Memo at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a June 15, 2016 e-mail, Zeus engineer Kevin Oh notified Zeus's Director of Sales that Oh wanted to \"receive the battery(s) with quality issue for us to evaluate and provide some feedback, given that batteries were from ZEUS.\" (Kevin Oh e-mail, June 15, 2016, Exhibit I to GA 56.1 Resp.) Zeus asserts, however, that after the June 13, 2016 meeting, SWF \"never provided Zeus with any further information concerning the leaking battery, the batteries with short life [or] the melting case.\" (Galante Declaration, Exhibit A to Zeus Response to GA 56.1 Add'l.) In particular, SWF never advised that Zeus was the source of any of the returned batteries, or that any Zeus battery was the cause of any failure. (Galante Dep. 31:23-35:24.) As a result, Zeus asserts, Zeus did not engage in any \"follow up\" with SWF on these issues. (Zeus Resp. to GA 56.1 Add'l. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In an August 8, 2016 e-mail, Joe Weibler of SWF forwarded photos of damaged batteries. (Weibler e-mail, Aug. 8, 2016, Exhibit J to GA 56.1 Resp.) Ms. Galante acknowledged in her deposition that photos attached to the message are of \"Zeus batteries,\" and show \"leaking batteries.\" (Galante Dep. 73:1-4.) The message states that SWF had \"some serious concerns about product reliability/durability and its potential impact on [SWF's] final product.\" (Id. 72:9-73:12.) The e-mail also advised that Ms. Galante could expect to receive \"additional input and questions.\" (Weibler E-mail, Aug. 6, 2016, Exhibit J to GA 56.1 Resp.) Ms. Galante testified that to her knowledge, there was no further word from SWF; and although \"a leaking battery [has] the potential to cause damage,\" batteries are not always the cause of problems with products in which they are installed, so she was not concerned by the photos in the absence of a formal incident report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   75:14-76:18; 79:12-80:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As noted, in November 2016, SWF told Zeus about an incident with the Zeus batteries in a Menard's store display and claimed a \"catastrophic battery failure.\" Zeus received formal incident reports on that date as well. (Galante Dep., 86:16-19.) On receipt of the November 11, 2016 e-mail, Zeus arranged for its Chief Technology Officer, Peter Foret, and a sales representative, Bert Olson, to meet with SWF personnel. (November 11, 2016 e-mail from Gina Galante, Exhibit 2 to Rendell Decl. [19], at 9.) Until that date, SWF had never refused to accept any shipment of Zeus batteries, had never refused to pay an invoice from Zeus, and had never requested a refund from Zeus. (GA Resp. \u00b6 15.) In an internal e-mail, Brad Rendell of Zeus asked his colleagues, \"What is the story? Is this misuse by the customer or bad batteries? Is this the first time we have heard about these issues? What about the June 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   issue?\" (Brad Rendell e-mail, November 13, 2016, Exhibit K to GA 56.1 Resp.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following day (November 14, 2016), SWF advised Zeus by e-mail that SWF had \"quarantined some set level of inventory,\" claiming it was \"defective.\" (Galante Dep., 199:2-3, 200:2-3.) Zeus was of the view that the damage resulted from customer misuse-specifically, placement of batteries in the wrong position, referred to as \"reverse polarity\"-that was remediable by way of a \"battery pack configuration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91:3-19.) Zeus suggested such a\n   \"temporary fix\" in a conference call on November 16. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95:2-5; 96:8-17; 97:9-20.) Specifically, Zeus proposed a configuration in which eight batteries would be placed in custom battery pack assemblies, so that there could be no \"reverse polarity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96:5-97:24.) Zeus also pressed the proposal in e-mails to SWF, noting Zeus's belief that \"the batteries are not at fault if installed properly.\" (Rendell e-mail Dec. 1, 2016, Exhibit D to AG 56.1 Resp. [19] at 15.) SWF never accepted this proposal, which Zeus believed would have remedied a problem that, in Zeus's view, is a defect in the SWF product design. (Galante Dep. 124:3-16; Bert Olson e-mail, Nov. 16, 2016, Exhibit D to AG 56.1 Resp.) Zeus also suggested a follow-up meeting, but SWF declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   101:20-102:4; 106:10-16.) Galante believes that SWF sought to target Zeus batteries as the cause of defect in an effort to minimize SWF's own liability and reduce the scope of any resulting recall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   125:1-17.) In eliminating Zeus as a supplier and instead purchasing batteries from Zeus's competitor, Galante believed, SWF was \"throwing Zeus 'under the bus' \" but not correcting the problem in SWF's own faulty product design. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   159:6-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Alarmed by SWF's communications, Zeus turned to its battery manufacturer and engineers. In a November 17, 2016 e-mail, Peter Foret of Zeus warned the supplier, \"We are afraid that our customer [SWF] will take us and you to court and sue for possible damages.\" (Peter Foret e-mail, Nov. 17, 2016, Ex. D to GA 56.1 Resp.). Zeus personnel acknowledged that both Zeus and SWF were concerned that \"this [a battery failure] could happen again.\" (Bert Olson e-mail Nov. 17, 2016, Exhibit D to GA 56.1 Resp.) Also on November 17, Zeus asked its battery supplier to \"perform a Failure Analysis on the rejected units\" to determine the cause of the failure and potential corrective action. (Peter Foret e-mail Nov. 17, 2017, Exhibit L to GA 56.1 Resp.) On November 19, 2016, as Zeus was poised to make additional shipments, SWF cancelled its order \"for the time being.\" (Taylor Dalzin e-mail, Exhibit F to Zeus Resp. to GA 56.1 Add'l.) In a set of internal e-mails dated November 20, 2016, Zeus noted the possibility that \"this is going to cost us the account as well as possible law suits.\" (Mills Rendell e-mail, Nov. 20, 2016, Ex. L to GA 56.1 Resp.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 29, 2016, SWF cancelled its existing order for more inventory. (Id. 106:17-107:14.) Zeus responded the following day: On November 30, 2016, Mills Rendell sent a letter to SWF in which he pointed out that the Zeus batteries had been tested extensively and complied with all relevant safety standards. (Mills Rendell letter, Nov. 30, 2016, Exhibit G to Zeus Resp. to AG 56.1 Add'l.) Rendell noted that Zeus and the battery manufacturer had \"analyzed the incident\" (presumably a reference to the \"catastrophic battery failure\" in a display at a Menard's store) and had identified one potential cause: \"reverse polarity insertion of a single battery cell.\" (Id.) He noted that the SWF design allowed for operation of the product even when the battery was installed improperly, which Zeus contends is inconsistent with industry safety standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 8, 2016, Zeus heard from Cuyler Cunningham for the first time; he is SWF's Executive Director for Global Procurement, and had not been Zeus's contact person before then. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   110:9-111:13.) In a December 8, 2016 e-mail message, Cunningham notified Zeus that SWF would be replacing all of the Zeus batteries in any of its customer displays and expected Zeus to reimburse SWF for the cost of doing so ($119,165). (Cunningham e-mail Dec. 8, 2016, Exhibit 3 to Rendell Decl. [19], page 19 of 48.) Cunningham\n   advised, further, that SWF would be returning $132,978 of inventory to Zeus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cunningham added that SWF still wanted to \"give Zeus the opportunity to demonstrate\" the quality of the batteries and that SWF was \"willing to work with [Zeus] to requalify your product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After consulting with counsel (Mills Rendell e-mail, Dec. 9, 2016, Exhibit M to GA 56.1 Resp.), Zeus's President Mills Rendell responded by \"unequivocally reject[ing]\" SWF's contention that the batteries were defective. In an e-mail response to Cunningham, Rendell noted that SWF's design allowed the SWF product to operate regardless of whether or not the batteries are installed correctly and asserted that it was this misuse of the Zeus product and the SWF defective design, not the Zeus batteries, that caused the failure. (Rendell E-mail Dec. 9, 2016, Exhibit 3 to Rendell Decl. [19] at 18 of 48.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rendell notified SWF that Zeus is \"not liable for any proper [sic] damage and/or personal injury caused by your misuse of our product,\" would not accept return of its inventory, and expected SWF to pay for the battery orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Zeus explained its position in more detail in a message from its Director of Sales, Herb Holmstedt, to Cuyler Cunningham: \"The issue is not with the cells, the ZEUS cells are good. The issue is with the cells being installed backwards in the SWF application.\" (Herb Holmstedt e-mail, Dec. 20, 2016, Exhibit N to GA 56.1 Resp.) That backward installation is possible at all is, in Zeus's view, a design error, recognized as such \"throughout the industry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The next day, Holmstedt suggested to Mills Rendell that Zeus's attorney \"send [SWF] a letter so they know ... we're serious about fighting this.\" (Holmstedt e-mail Dec. 21, 2016, Exhibit O to GA 56.1 Resp.) There was no meaningful response from SWF. On January 26, 2017, Holmstedt sent an e-mail to Zeus personnel in which he said that Zeus is a \"small company\" and had \"done nothing wrong,\" had provided batteries \"of top quality,\" and believed SWF should pay the outstanding invoices and accept shipment of the rest of its order. (Holmstedt e-mail, Exhibit C to Zeus Resp. to GA 56.1 Add'l.) On that same day, Mills Rendell advised Holmstedt in an e-mail that Zeus \"need[ed] to prepare for litigation.\" (Mills Rendell e-mail Jan. 26, 2017, Exhibit P to GA 56.1 Resp.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Zeus received a more substantive response from Cunningham on January 31, 2017. Cunningham rejected Zeus's theory that the SWF design was at fault for battery failures; he noted that SWF had used batteries from other suppliers for ten years in SWF products of the same design but had not experienced such catastrophic failures, despite the likelihood that some of those competitors' products had also been installed backward. (Cuyler Cunningham e-mail, Jan. 31, 2017, Exhibit Q to GA 56.1 Resp.) Cunningham concluded that SWF would \"treat Zeus's products as non-conforming\" and would \"not make further payment to Zeus,\" instead returning inventory in its possession. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Notice to Great American\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Zeus first discussed the issue of insurance coverage with counsel on February\n   22, 2017. (Galante Dep., at 187:9-24.) Specifically, Zeus contacted its attorney, Robert Rosenfeld, whose web site identifies his focus as real estate law, but who also practices in the areas of commercial litigation, technology law, and business law. (Rosenfeld Web Site, Exhibit D to GA Resp. to Zeus Add'l.) Zeus consulted with an insurance agent, Mike Bulow, that same day. (Galante Dep. at 188:4-18.) Galante explained that until that time, Zeus had \"very, very little to zero information\" and that \"there wasn't an issue to discuss with the insurance broker.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   189:3-17.) Galante continues to believe that SWF's design was the reason for the failures (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   190:7-21), and that it is not necessary to \"alert the insurance company every time a customer calls in with a complaint that their battery is not working.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   192:9-13.) Galante pointed out that as of November and December, SWF had not requested that Zeus reimburse it for damage (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   194:7-17), and that Zeus was awaiting feedback and test data from SWF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   194:18-195:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   SWF's Senior Vice President, John Comerford, followed up on February 24, 2017, announcing in a certified mail letter that SWF had initiated a recall of its products, and making a formal demand that Zeus indemnify it for all costs relating to the recall and \"any other incidents involving the Zeus Batteries.\" (Comerford letter, Feb. 24, 2017, Exhibit 4 to Rendell Decl. [19], page 21 of 48.) Comerford's letter stated that SWF had \"seen no evidence that the incidents described\" in earlier correspondence \"were caused by anything other than an unidentified latent defect in the Zeus Batteries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Four days later, on February 28, 2017, Zeus sent its insurer, Plaintiff Great American, a copy of SWF's initial report to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, dated February 21, 2017, as well as the February 24, 2017 letter notifying Zeus of the product recall and demanding indemnification. (GA 56.1 Resp. [47] \u00b6 19.) Great American acknowledged receipt of the claim but declined to provide a defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Litigation with SWF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On May 8, 2017, Zeus sued SWF in the Circuit Court of Cook County, alleging violations of Illinois law and seeking a declaration that the batteries it provided to SWF were in fact safe products and were not the cause of the incidents leading to a recall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Zeus had never before filed a lawsuit against any other company. (AG Resp. to Zeus Add'l. \u00b6 10.) Zeus furnished a copy of the complaint to Great American on June 12, 2017. (GA 56.1 Resp. [47] \u00b6 20.) SWF removed the case to this court and filed a counterclaim in which it alleges that there were defects in the Zeus batteries resulting in \"at least five occasions\" in which the batteries \"exploded, leaked, caught fire, suffered a catastrophic deconstruction or otherwise malfunctioned while installed in a motorized window shade manufactured by SWF.\" (Answer and Counterclaim [14] in Docket No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Cow.%204382\">\n    17 C 4382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15.)

SWF's counterclaim against Zeus in the underlying litigation seeks damages in the amount of $130,000 for the cost of the Zeus batteries; $115, 000 to replace the defective batteries; and at least $1,000,000 in costs relating to the recall. (GA 56.1 Resp. [47] \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   SWF filed the Counterclaim on July 5, 2017; Zeus tendered it to Great American for defense on July 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) On September 15, 2017, Great American denied coverage and instituted this declaratory judgment suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) It is undisputed that Great American has a duty to defend Zeus against any lawsuit seeking damages for \"property damage\" caused by \"an occurrence,\" and that \"property damage\" is defined to include \"physical injury to tangible property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33; see also the Policy, Exhibit C to the Complaint [1] at \u00a7 I, Coverage A, Paragraph 1.a.) What is disputed is whether these allegations in the underlying complaint constitute claims of \"property damage\" within the meaning of the GA insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Coverage Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In January 2018, Zeus's insurance agent received a \"Policy Loss Report\" from Great American and provided it to Zeus. The Policy Loss Report shows that Great American had assigned a claim number (A00121428) to the Counterclaim filed by SWF against Zeus. (GA Resp. to Zeus Add'l. \u00b6 1.) The Policy Loss Report includes the following entries in the column for \"Loss Description\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   PROPERTY DAMAGE:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   LAWSUIT ALLEGES INSURED[']S\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   BATTERIES ARE DEFECTIVE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   PROPERTY DAMAGE:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ALLEGES THAT BATTERY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   OPERATED SHADES CAUGHT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   FIRE AND DAMAGED\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2, 3; Policy Loss Report, Exhibit 2 to Galante Decl.) As \"Total Incurred,\" the report lists $104,800.00 for the first of these entries, and $40,645.36 for the second, resulting in a \"Total for Policy\" of $145,445.36. (GA Resp. to Zeus Add'l. \u00b6 4; Policy Loss Report.) On January 23, 2018, Great American advised Zeus by letter that it had paid $12,933.24 for losses and $27,535.72 for expenses on the Ritchie Claim, No. A000094042, leaving Zeus obligated to pay the deductible of $2,500.00. (GA Resp. to Zeus Add'l. \u00b6 5; Michelle Daughtery Letter, Jan. 23, 2018, Exhibit 1 to Galante Decl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Zeus, a family-owned company, does not have an in-house counsel position, though its vice-president has a law degree and was admitted to the bar thirty years ago. (GA Resp. to Zeus Add'l. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7.) As described earlier, Zeus first consulted a lawyer concerning its dispute with SWF on December 8 or 9, 2016. Gina Galante explained in her deposition that Zeus wanted the advice of its attorney, Rob Rosenfeld, concerning a \"precise response back to [SWF] showing that our product is not at fault and that they have a financial obligation.\" (Galante Dep. at 131:11-22.) Zeus did not notify its insurer in November 2016, Galante explained, because Zeus was \"further investigating\" the matter of the Menards battery failure. (Id. at 191:4-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   She noted that at that time, \"it [was] merely a claim on a leaking battery,\" and SWF had not asked Zeus to \"pay for the cost to replace whatever it was in the Menard store.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194:7-13.) Nor did Zeus contact its insurer in December 2016; Galante noted that Zeus had \"gained no additional test data from the customer\" by then, and still had no reason to believe the Zeus battery, rather than reverse polarity, was the cause of the incident. (Id. 194:18-195:8.) When Zeus did notify Great American of the SWF claim, it was, to Gina Galante's knowledge, the first time that Zeus had ever reported a claim or potential claim to an insurer. (Galante Dep. at 17:8-16.) In a letter dated March 23, 2017, Great American acknowledged receipt of Zeus's claim, but noted that SWF had not filed a claim or lawsuit for damages; the fact that SWF had proposed a recall of the product \"does not trigger coverage or defense under [Zeus's] policy.\" (Andrew Herbert letter, March 23, 2017, Exhibit G to GA Resp. to 56.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In this litigation, Great American seeks a declaration that it has no duty to defend Zeus against any claims brought in Zeus's litigation with SWF for two reasons: First, Great American argues that the Counterclaim filed against Zeus does not seek compensation for losses \"because of\" \"property damage\" caused by \"an occurrence\" within the meaning of the policy. Second, Great American urges, Zeus failed to provide Great American with timely notice of the potential claim. Both parties have moved for summary judgment, appropriate only where the moving party shows that there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

The Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   With these principles in mind, the court turns to the Counterclaim. SWF alleges, inter alia, that \"defects in the Zeus batteries\" caused at least five \"incidents\" in which \"Zeus' Batteries exploded, leaked, caught fire, suffered a catastrophic deconstruction or otherwise malfunctioned while installed in a motorized window shade manufactured by SWF.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Complaint [1] Ex. B, at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first incident, a non-party customer found a battery tube to be \"so hot that it almost burned his hands\" and \"the batteries inside were charred and melted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, \u00b6 26.) In the second incident, another non-party customer \"allegedly reported that a battery case exploded and that the window shade would no longer operate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, \u00b6 28.) In the third incident, yet another non-party \"allegedly reported that the batteries in one shade leaked and damaged the case and window casing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, \u00b6 30.) In the fourth incident, a distributor \"allegedly reported that one or more batteries had a catastrophic deconstruction as a result of venting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, \u00b6 32.) And in the fifth incident, a customer alleged that one of SWF's blinds \"caught on fire and caused property damage and that two of the batteries had exploded after falling from the melted window shade.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   All five of these incidents were caused by an \"occurrence\" in that they were precipitated by malfunctions unforeseen by Zeus. Great American appears to be correct that the first, second, and fourth incidents do not qualify as \"property damage,\" because they allege only damage\n   to batteries produced by Zeus. The third and fifth incidents, however, properly construed in favor of Zeus, do describe \"property damage\"; both involve damage to property other than the batteries themselves: the third alleging damage to a window casing, and the fifth alleging that a window shade melted and that additional unspecified property damage occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The remaining issue is whether the SWF counterclaim seeks damages \"because of\" either of these two incidents. SWF does not specifically allege that it seeks damages to repair or replace damaged SWF products. Instead, SWF asks for an award of \"at least $1,000,000\" for costs it incurred in \"coordinating with the Consumer Product Safety council to recall its motorized window shades equipped with Zeus's batteries,\" as well as unspecified damages sustained to its reputation as a result of \"Zeus's provision of non-complying Batteries.\" (Complaint [1] Ex. A, at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Construed liberally in Zeus's favor, both allegations describe harms that were precipitated by the property damage described above. At least some of the recalled SWF products were plausibly those already damaged by batteries, and proof of the reputational harms will likely involve evidence that the batteries caused damage to a customer's property. This interpretation is bolstered by the allegation elsewhere in the complaint that \"SWF incurred expenses associated with ... replacing SWF's products and issuing a product recall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. Under\n   <em>\n    Berry Plastics\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wausau Underwriters\n   </em>\n   , this suffices to fit the allegations at least \"potentially within\" the Policy's language, triggering Great American's duty to defend. Given the deference in favor of the insured, the court concludes Zeus is entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   What remains is Great American's argument that Zeus failed to provide timely notice of SWF's claim. (Great American M.S.J. [44] at 12.) In Illinois, insured parties must comply with notice provisions as a prerequisite to insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    Livorsi Marine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3602406\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/222/303/#p311\">\n    222 Ill.2d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Ill.%20Dec.%20533\">\n    305 Ill.Dec. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=856%20N.E.2d%20338\">\n    856 N.E.2d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The notice provision in Great American's policy provides that an insured party \"must see to it that we are notified as soon as practicable of an occurrence which may result in a claim or suit which may involve this policy\" including, \"to the extent possible\": \"how, when and where the occurrence took place,\" \"the names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses,\" and \"the nature and location of any injury or damage arising out of the occurrence.\" (Policy at \u00b6 VI.H.1.) In this context, the Illinois Supreme Court has held that \"[a]s soon as practicable\" means \"within a reasonable time,\" and noted, \"[w]hether notice has been giving within a reasonable time depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\"\n   <em>\n    Livorsi Marine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3602406\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/222/303/#p311\">\n    222 Ill.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   305 Ill.Dec. 533,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=856%20N.E.2d%20338\">\n    856 N.E.2d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Barrington Consol.

Here, the court concludes that each of the five factors are either neutral or tilt in Zeus's favor, and Zeus is therefore entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The subject of the first factor-the policy language-\"does not aid in our reasonableness analysis because it does not identify a specific time frame for giving notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Yorkville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630723\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/238/177/#p185\">\n    238 Ill.2d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=345%20Ill.%20Dec.%20445\">\n    345 Ill.Dec. 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=939%20N.E.2d%20288\">\n    939 N.E.2d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the Policy requires that the insured party notify the insurer of an \"occurrence\" \"as soon as practicable.\" (Policy at \u00a7 IV.2.a.) This terminology does not favor either party; whether Zeus gave notice \"as soon as practicable\" is informed by the court's assessment of the remaining factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The second factor-the insured party's sophistication-favors Zeus. Zeus, a battery distributor, has never filed a lawsuit against any other company. It therefore bears little resemblance to the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Yorkville\n   </em>\n   , which was \"presumed to be sophisticated in the areas of commerce and insurance\" because it is a bank.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630723\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/238/177/#p185\">\n    238 Ill.2d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=345%20Ill.%20Dec.%20445\">\n    345 Ill.Dec. 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=939%20N.E.2d%20288\">\n    939 N.E.2d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    MHM Services Inc. v. Assurance Co. of America\n   </em>\n   , the Illinois appellate court found an insured party to be sophisticated because it (1) retained a part-time and later a full-time general counsel, (2) retained coverage counsel, (3) had the benefit of local litigation counsel, and (4) had cash on hand to pay litigation expenses.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20112171\">\n    2012 IL App (1st) 112171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 64,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=363%20Ill.%20Dec.%20830\">\n    363 Ill.Dec. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=975%20N.E.2d%201139\">\n    975 N.E.2d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1159. In contrast, Zeus has no in-house counsel, and the first attorney it consulted regarding the issue of insurance coverage, Robert Rosenfield, does not identify as focusing either in insurance law or litigation generally. There is no evidence that Zeus has cash on hand for litigation expenses; the fact that it has never before initiated commercial litigation suggests otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The third factor is the insured's awareness of an event that may trigger insurance\n   coverage. Although the court has concluded that Zeus was aware of a relevant occurrence in November 2016, no evidence in the record suggests that Zeus understood that this would trigger insurance coverage prior to February 22, 2017. Galante affirmed when deposed that, prior to that point, Zeus had \"very, very little to zero information\" and was under the impression that it was not necessary to \"alert the insurance company every time a customer calls in with a complaint that their battery is not working.\" As late as December, SWF's Executive Director for Global Procurement informed Zeus that SWF was \"willing to work with [Zeus] to requalify your product,\" suggesting no litigation was pending. And prior to February 2017, SWF had specifically described only one battery-related incident to Zeus, with the three others only alluded to over e-mail. Absent evidence that Zeus was informed prior to February that the battery incident was likely to result in litigation, this factor tilts in Zeus's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The fourth factor is the insured's diligence is ascertaining whether coverage is available. This factor takes into account the insured party's justification for any delay; under some circumstances, even multi-year delays may be found reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yorkville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630723\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/238/177/#p185\">\n    238 Ill.2d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=345%20Ill.%20Dec.%20445\">\n    345 Ill.Dec. 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=939%20N.E.2d%20288\">\n    939 N.E.2d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). The delay in this case did not exceed four months, and the weight of evidence suggests that Zeus was not aware of the pendency of litigation prior to February 22, 2017, when it first discussed insurance coverage with Rosenfeld. Four days later, it provided notice to Great American. The fourth factor tilts in Zeus's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The fifth and final factor considers whether the insurer suffered prejudice as a result of a delay in notice. There is no evidence of prejudice to Great American in this case. Great America received notice four months before SWF filed its Counterclaim. Great American speculates that \"perhaps\" it \"would have been able to evaluate whether Zeus should recall its product or otherwise try to prevent additional incidents and/or explore an early settlement to avoid a lawsuit.\" Speculation does not substitute for evidence of prejudice. The court concludes that Zeus prevails on this issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although \"length of delay\" is not a delineated\n   <em>\n    Yorkville\n   </em>\n   factor, it bears note that the only case Great American cites where a court found a delay as short or shorter than four months to be unreasonable is a case decided more than sixty years ago, involving a car accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawkeye-Sec.

In view of the presumption that the court should construe the insurance policy strictly against the insurer, Zeus is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

These circumstances are somewhat unusual, but the court is guided by\n   <em>\n    Great West\n   </em>\n   's holding that \"claims which, if successful, have the effect of reducing or eliminating the insured's liability\" are \" 'defensive' claims ... encompassed in an insurer's duty to defend.\"\n   <em>\n    Great West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241140\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/315/879/#p882\">\n    315 F.Supp.2d at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, to the extent that there is any ambiguity as to whether the Policy covers affirmative suits, Illinois courts have held that \"[a]ny ambiguity arising from the definition of 'suit' is strictly construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer that drafted the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Selective Ins.
