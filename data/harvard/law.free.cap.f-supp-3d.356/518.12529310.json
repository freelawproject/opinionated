Count I seeks to collect \"Mr. Pate's unpaid federal income taxes, penalties, and interest assessed against Mr. Pate for the 2004 tax periods and ... the 2007-2009 tax periods\" through a judgment against O'Brien or, alternatively, against Marshall.

In that capacity, O'Brien filed a Petition for Authorization to Pay Income Tax Liabilities on March 31, 2016, and on May 16, 2016, the Orphans' Court \"authorized and directed\" him to pay federal taxes of $7,243.69 and state taxes of $4,666.41.

The United States alleges that, as of August 7, 2017, the total amount still due for Pate's federal income taxes, including penalties and statutory interest, for 2004, 2007, 2008 and 2009 is $229,974.

Similarly, while the United States asserts that \"Defendant Marshall's Answer appears to contain allegations of fraud against Mr. O'Brien in the preparation and payment of taxes,\" Pl.'s Opp'n 9, its Amended Complaint does not allege fraud (which, if alleged, must be with particularity, Fed.

Indeed, the United States simply alleges that O'Brien was appointed as Special Administrator; taxes were assessed against Pate for 2004 and \"against Mr. O'Brien, in his capacity as the Special Administrator for the Pate Estate,\" for the 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax periods; and Pate, O'Brien and Marshall \"failed to fully pay the assessed amounts,\" such that \"Mr. O'Brien, in his capacity as Special Administrator of the Pate Estate, or, in the alternative, Ms. Marshall, in her capacity as a representative of the Pate Estate, ... is indebted to the United States for the unpaid balance of the federal income tax liabilities.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12, 16. There is not the slightest suggestion in its Amended Complaint of fraud or any other wrongdoing on the part of Mr. O'Brien beyond the failure to pay the Estate's taxes in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202227928\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, it is assumed that, if the United States intended to adopt the conclusory allegations of fraud made by Ms. Marshall, a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant, it would have refrained from doing so until satisfied that it had a good faith basis to do so, as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. Perhaps that explains why there are no such allegations in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, the United States has not identified any case law that demonstrates that the Court's authority to issue orders \"as may be necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws\" would permit it, in this instance, to grant O'Brien authority to defend this litigation. Certainly, the United States argues that \"the probate court no longer has jurisdiction over this matter\" because more than eighteen months have passed since Pate's death. Pl.'s Opp'n 8. But, the United States has not alleged or even argued that it could not have attempted to collect these taxes while the Estate was in probate. Therefore, it does not appear necessary or appropriate for the Court to direct O'Brien to act on the Estate's behalf, that is, for the Court to perform a function typically performed by a state court, when the state court may no longer have that authority.
