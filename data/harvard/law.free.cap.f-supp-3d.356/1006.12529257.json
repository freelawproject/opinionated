(Doc. Nos. 32, 33.) Plaintiffs the City of Imperial Beach, San Diego Unified Port District, and the City of Chula Vista (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") oppose the motions. (Doc. No. 37.)

On September 27, 2017, Plaintiffs sent Defendants a Notice of Intent (\"NOI\") indicating Plaintiffs' intent to sue Defendants for violations of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206972\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). (Doc. No. 31.) The NOI informed Defendants that their discharge of pollutants into the Tijuana River Valley violated both the CWA and RCRA. On March 2, 2018, Plaintiffs initiated this action against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Doc. No. 1.) On June 12, 2018, USIBWC and Veolia moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), arguing in part that Plaintiffs failed to state a RCRA claim. On August 29, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motions to dismiss, dismissing Plaintiffs' RCRA claim with leave to amend. (Doc. No. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 12, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). (Doc. No. 31.) The SAC alleges three causes of action: (1) against USIBWC, for discharges of pollutants from the flood control conveyance without a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\") permit in violation of the CWA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1342 ; (2) against both Defendants, for discharges of pollutants from the canyon collectors in violation of the CWA and the NPDES Permit; and (3) against both Defendants, for contribution to an imminent and substantial endangerment in violation of RCRA. Defendants' motions to dismiss followed on September 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The City of Imperial Beach is a California General Law City and municipal corporation, organized and existing by virtue of the laws of the State of California. The San Diego Unified Port District is a public entity created by the San Diego Unified Port District Act, California Harbors &amp; Navigation Code, Appendix 1, \u00a7 1\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The City of Chula Vista is a California Charter City and municipal corporation, organized and existing by virtue of the laws of the State of California and the Charter of the City of Chula Vista.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The USIBWC is an agency and instrumentality of the United States government charged with addressing transboundary issues arising out of agreements between the United States and Mexico, including the Treaty of February 3, 1944, for the Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande (\"1944 Treaty\"). Veolia is a limited liability company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Massachusetts. Veolia contracts with USIBWC to operate and maintain the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (\"South Bay Plant\") and its associated facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The International Boundary and Water Commission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The International Boundary and Water Commission (\"Commission\") is a bi-national body comprised of the USIBWC and the Comisi\u00f3n Internacional de L\u00edmites y Aguas (\"CILA\") in Mexico. Both sections of the Commission exercise the rights and obligations of their governments under the 1944 Treaty. Under the 1944 Treaty,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Neither Section [the USIBWC or CILA] shall assume jurisdiction or control over works located within the limits of the country of the other without the express consent of the Government of the latter. The works constructed, acquired or used in fulfillment of the provisions of this Treaty and located wholly within the territorial limits of either country, although these works may be international in character, shall remain, except as herein otherwise specifically provided, under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Section of the Commission in whose country the works may be situated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Doc. No. 33-2 (\"1944 Treaty\") Art. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. South Bay Plant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Decisions of the Commission are recorded in Minutes. In 1990, the Commission entered into an agreement known as Minute 283 to address the border sanitation\n   problem in San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Baja California. (Doc. No. 16-2 (\"Minute 283\").) Among other things, Minute 283 led to the construction of the South Bay Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The South Bay Plant is located in the Tijuana River Valley in the City of San Diego, San Diego County, California. The South Bay Plant was designed to handle 25 million gallons per day, based on a 30-day average, \"to treat sewage generated in excess of the capacity\" of facilities in Mexico. (Minute 283 at 4.) USIBWC owns the South Bay Plant, and Veolia operates it. The South Bay Plant and its associated facilities are subject to the terms of NPDES permit No. CA0108929 (the \"NPDES Permit\"). The NPDES Permit authorizes discharges of pollutants at the South Bay Ocean Outfall only, and only after such pollutants have gone through secondary treatment at the South Bay Plant. All other discharges are prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (SAC at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The primary influent to the South Bay Plant is sewage from Mexico. (SAC \u00b6 58.) While a CILA Diversion exists in Mexico to divert flows in the Mexican Tijuana River into the transboundary sewage system, it \"frequently malfunctions, allowing sewage to flow past the Diversion and across the U.S./Mexico Border.\" (SAC \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Canyon Collectors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Water that crosses the border into the United States from Mexico west of the flood control conveyance does so at six discernible locations: Yogurt Canyon, Goat Canyon, Smuggler's Gulch, Canyon Del Sol, Silva Drain, and Stewart's Drain. USIBWC owns and Veolia operates and maintains canyon collectors at five of these locations, excluding Yogurt Canyon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (SAC at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The canyon collectors are among the facilities that operate under and are subject to the South Bay Plant NPDES Permit. They are \"designed to capture and detain polluted wastewater the moment it crosses the U.S./Mexico Border into the United States.\" (SAC \u00b6 66.) Each concrete collector abuts the border and spans the opening of one of the drainage points. The canyon collectors collect and direct wastewater into a shallow detention basin. Wastewater in the detention basin is then directed to a screened drain inlet (\"collector inlet\") regulated by a valve. When open, the water in the detention basin is accepted into a pipe system and conveyed to the South Bay Plant for treatment and eventual discharge at the South Bay Ocean Outfall. When closed, the water cannot drain into the treatment system, and instead overflows the detention basin and travels into the downstream drainages. Waste that does not flow through the treatment system collects in the canyon collector basins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Flood Control Conveyance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In 1978, USIBWC constructed a flood control conveyance designed to capture as much as 135,000 cubic feet of water per second from the Tijuana River as it crosses the border from Mexico into the United States. (SAC \u00b6 43.) The flood control conveyance is a discrete, concrete-lined conveyance with banked sides that begins at the United States border with Mexico. It directs water, sewage, and other waste into an area of the Tijuana River Valley west of the historical course of the Tijuana River, in which the Tijuana River had not previously flowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The flood control conveyance is not subject to the NPDES Permit, and Veolia is not involved in its operation. Plaintiffs allege that USIBWC routinely discharges pollutants and solid and/or hazardous waste, captured from the Mexican portion of the Tijuana River, out of the flood control conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At times, the flow of wastewater in the flood control conveyance is slowed or completely halted. USIBWC recently constructed temporary earthen berms at the border between the United States and\n   Mexico to reduce the volume of flow into the flood control conveyance from the Tijuana River in Mexico, redirecting those flows south into the CILA Diversion. However, Plaintiffs note that the berm is not designed to protect against high volume flows and may wash out with even the slightest amount of precipitation. The berm also temporarily detains wastewater, causing water to pool in the flood control conveyance. In addition, Plaintiffs allege that the structure of the flood control conveyance was intentionally designed to slow the flow of water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (SAC at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Rule 12(b)(1) - Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. \"Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause. Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v.

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 103-14.) USIBWC argues that this claim is barred by sovereign immunity. Application of the CWA to the flood control conveyance, USIBWC argues, will affect or impair the 1944 Treaty.

If required to operate the flood control conveyance under an NPDES permit, USIBWC argues, it will be \"legally responsible for ensuring the water quality of any transboundary flows that pass through the flood control conveyance.\" (Doc. No. 40 at 4.) This \"new, open-ended obligation,\" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .), will \"compel USIBWC to develop a unilateral, domestic solution to the international problem of pollution in the Tijuana River.\" (Doc. No. 33-1 at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   USIBWC concedes that operating the canyon collectors in compliance with its current NPDES permit does not affect or impair the 1944 Treaty. This is because, USIBWC argues, the United States and Mexico already negotiated an agreement to address the problem of transboundary flows through the Tijuana tributary canyons-Minute 283.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   USIBWC argues that Minute 283 assumes that works within the United States are subject to CWA regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute 283 at 4 (\"Because water quality standards are more strict in the United States, the construction, operation and maintenance of the land and deep ocean outfalls would be financed by the United States in recognition of the potential benefits to the Tijuana River Estuary and United States Beaches in San Diego County, California.\"). Unlike the canyon collectors, USIBWC argues, the Commission has not agreed on a Minute to address the border sanitation problem presented by discharges from the flood control conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that application of the CWA to the flood control conveyance will not affect or impair the 1944 Treaty. They argue that the Treaty already requires the United States to comply with domestic water quality standards, including the CWA. The 1944 Treaty provides that works within the United States remain under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of USIBWC, 1944 Treaty, Art. 2, and that the United States \"shall assume responsibility for and adjust exclusively in accordance with its own laws all claims arising within its territory in connection with the construction, operation, or maintenance\" of the works agreed upon under the Treaty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189060\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/284/#p290\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189060\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/284/#p290\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at Art. 20.

It is possible that requiring USIBWC to comply with the CWA for discharges from the flood control conveyance will affect or impair the 1944 Treaty and relevant Minutes. But the SAC does not indicate whether compliance with the CWA will affect or impair the 1944 Treaty. Nor do the Treaty or Minutes. USIBWC mounts a \"factual attack\" against Plaintiffs' claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safe Air for Everyone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236006\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/1035/#p1039\">\n    373 F.3d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court would need to make factual findings outside of the pleadings to reach a conclusion on this question. And USIBWC fails to present sufficient evidence to support any such finding. First, USIBWC fails to identify what compliance with the CWA would require. USIBWC itself refers to the \"new, open-ended obligation\" that application of the CWA would create, without defining this obligation. Even if Plaintiffs succeed on their first claim and USIBWC is required to obtain an NPDES permit, the terms of the permit are unknown. Second, the SAC and 1944 Treaty do not indicate how USIBWC's new (undefined) obligation will affect or impair the Treaty. USIBWC presents no evidence on this issue. USIBWC concedes that operating the canyon collectors under the constraints of an NPDES permit does not affect or impair the 1944 Treaty, but argues that requiring a permit at the flood control conveyance will affect the Treaty. At oral argument, USIBWC argued that the terms of an NPDES permit regulating discharges from the flood control conveyance would impose a much broader obligation than that imposed by the NPDES permit regulating the canyon collectors. USIBWC supports its argument with hypotheticals, but no evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   USIBWC fails to present sufficient evidence for the court to find that compliance with the CWA would affect or impair the 1944 Treaty.

The berms, coupled with the design of the flood control conveyance and canyon collectors,\n   temporarily slow and detain the flow of wastewater. This causes the water to pool and creates an environment that allows pathogens to multiply. This \"highly concentrated\" waste is flushed from the canyon collectors and flood control conveyance during high flow events. The waste ultimately reaches the Tijuana River, Estuary, and Pacific Ocean where human exposure is likely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants argue that the NOI does not reference the sediment berms in the flood control structure and canyon collectors, highly concentrated flows allegedly created by the berms and canyon collector basins, or any obstruction of wastewater flow. Instead, Defendants argue, the NOI focuses on \"the mere passage of wastewater through USIBWC's facilities.\" (Doc. No. 40 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the NOI provided Defendants with sufficient information to take ameliorative steps and that Plaintiffs could not have mentioned the sediment berms in the NOI because the berms did not exist when the letter was sent. In fact, Plaintiffs argue, Defendants' construction of the berms was a misguided attempt to mitigate the violations described in the NOI. (Doc. No. 37 at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The NOI provided Defendants with sufficient notice of these alleged violations. The berms and design of the facilities are part and parcel of the overarching issue detailed in the NOI-discharge of waste from the canyon collectors and flood control conveyance. Defendants constructed the berm in the flood control conveyance in an attempt to solve this issue and direct more wastewater into the CILA and South Bay Plant. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 63, 84.) But during high flow events, the berm washes out and is insufficient to capture and redirect the flow of wastewater. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 63, 84, 128.) In lower flow and dry events, the berm makes the problem worse by impeding water flow and fostering pathogen growth. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Similarly, the design of the canyon collectors and flood control conveyance temporarily detain wastewater, fostering pathogen growth during times of lower water flow. The ultimate harm alleged as a result of these actions is the discharge of waste and pathogens from the canyon collectors and flood control conveyance during high flow events. The NOI discusses this discharge of waste in detail and, like the SAC, states that the waste eventually reaches the Tijuana River, Estuary, and Pacific Ocean where human exposure is likely. The NOI notified Defendants of the source of the violation (overflow from the canyon collectors and discharges from the flood control conveyance terminus), when the violation occurred (continuously for the canyon collectors and during every wet weather event for the flood control conveyance), and the harm caused by the violation (human and environmental exposure caused by flow events that wash pathogens and other waste into the Tijuana River, Estuary, and Pacific Ocean).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   USIBWC cites\n   <em>\n    San Francisco Baykeeper v.

The dried and waste-laden sediment is then \"mobilized by wind and vehicular traffic, creating inhalation exposure and re-deposition of dust on vegetation that may subsequently be consumed by wildlife.\" (SAC \u00b6 102.) Waste is also dispersed by wind when water evaporates from the canyon collectors and flood control conveyance, leaving behind dried waste. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The waste is then picked up and dispersed by wind. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The NOI makes no mention of the movement of waste by bulldozer, shovel, or other equipment. Nor does it mention the mobilization of waste by wind. Unlike Plaintiffs' allegations relating to the discharge of wastewater from the flood control conveyance and canyon collectors, Defendants did not have sufficient notice that their activities resulted in the dispersal of waste by wind.

At best, the court held, these allegations involved the mere passive transport of wastewater from the border to the Tijuana River Valley. (Doc. No. 26 at 20.) The FAC alleged that the structure of the flood control conveyance \"merely permit[s] the waste from Mexico to flow through the system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Thus, Plaintiffs failed to allege that USIBWC played an active role with a sufficiently\n   direct connection to the waste. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Similarly, the FAC's allegations relating to the flow of water through the canyon collectors that is not diverted into one of the drains for treatment at the South Bay Plant failed to allege that Defendants played an active role with a direct connection to the waste. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 20-21.) \"Wastewater that is not detained by the canyon collectors, like the wastewater that is never detained in the flood control conveyance, would flow into the Tijuana River Valley and make its way to the Pacific Ocean regardless of Defendants' actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 21.) This theory of liability-wastewater passively flowing from the border through Defendants' facilities and into the Tijuana River Valley unchanged-remains insufficient for RCRA liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In addition to these allegations, however, the SAC alleges a new theory of liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that the design of the canyon collector detention basins and flood control conveyance, and the construction of a berm in the flood control conveyance, change the quality and character of the waste flowing across the border from Mexico. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are aware that the flood control conveyance and canyon collectors almost always contain pollutants and waste. (SAC \u00b6 70.) The flood control conveyance \"collects and concentrates pollutants in runoff that might otherwise not be traceable to an identifiable source of discharge.\" (SAC \u00b6 72.) A portion of the flood control conveyance was intentionally designed to slow the flow of water before it exits the conveyance into the New Tijuana River. (SAC \u00b6 60.) USIBWC also constructed a temporary berm in the flood control conveyance using waste-laden sediment and other materials deposited in the conveyance. (SAC \u00b6 63.) The berm is intended to reduce the volume of water flowing across the border from Mexico by redirecting the water south into the CILA diversion in Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) But it also temporarily detains wastewater in the flood control conveyance. (SAC \u00b6 102.) Plaintiffs allege that the design of the canyon collector detention basins temporarily detain wastewater. Defendants bulldoze, shovel, and otherwise move the waste-laden sediment in the canyon collector basins to create temporary berms inside the detention basins and along the canyon collector rims. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 83, 84.) The berms are intended to direct and contain flows entering and moving through the canyon collectors. (SAC \u00b6 84.) Wastewater pools in the canyon collector detention basins when the drain inlets leading to the South Bay Plant system are not open or are blocked. (SAC \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The SAC describes the detained wastewater in the flood control conveyance and canyon collectors as \"open toxic waste pits.\" (SAC \u00b6 102.) Slowed and temporarily detained water in the flood control conveyance and canyon collector detention basins create an \"enhanced physiochemical environment that allows much greater pathogen survival and growth,\" increasing pathogen concentrations. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) It also \"creates more favorable environments for pathogen vectors, particularly mosquitos and flies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) When water flow increases, waste with higher concentrations of pathogens and contaminants is flushed into the Tijuana River Valley. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) High flows of water into the flood control conveyance cause the concentrated \"slug flows\" to discharge into the New Tijuana River. (SAC \u00b6 63, 102.) An influent of water into the\n   canyon collector basins causes the waste to overflow from the basins and travel toward the Tijuana River Valley. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 67, 102.) These flows contain higher concentrations of contaminants and pathogens. (SAC \u00b6 102.) Sediment from the flood control conveyance and canyon collectors is more likely to contain contaminants such as carcinogenic compounds, DDT, dioxins, furans, heavy metals, and Poly Nuclear Aromatics. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) As a result, flows of waste exiting the flood control conveyance and canyon collectors after detention are more likely to harm humans and the environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Unlike the allegations the court previously dismissed, the SAC alleges that Defendants' actions change the quality and character of waste. As a result of Defendants' construction of sediment berms and the design of the canyon collectors and flood control conveyance, the highly concentrated waste that exits Defendants' facilities is different than the waste that flowed across the border. This waste presents an increased risk of endangerment to human health and the environment. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' allegations are implausible, disingenuous, and the remedy to the alleged harm caused by the berms would be to remove them, resulting in more waste flowing freely into the Tijuana River Valley instead of the CILA diversion. (Doc. No. 33-1 at 22.)

Plaintiffs' allegations are not implausible. The accumulation and stagnation of contaminants may result in the growth of pathogens and higher concentrations of contaminants.
