No. 46). Having thoroughly considered the parties' briefing and the relevant record, the Court finds oral argument unnecessary and hereby DENIES the motion for the reasons explained herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed for the purpose of this motion. In the early morning of May 14, 2017, Plaintiffs Marvin Dykes and Mark Harris (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") were working as the conductor and locomotive engineer aboard a\n   BNSF train when it derailed near Surrey, British Columbia. (Dkt. No. 47-1 at 3, 14.) Plaintiffs had boarded the train the night before in Everett, Washington and were headed for the Thornton Railyard in British Columbia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 11.) Thornton Yard is owned by Third-Party Defendant Canadian National Railway Company (\"CNR\"). (Dkt. No. 47-3 at 8.) BNSF trains go to Thornton Yard to interchange loaded and empty freight cars with CNR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To access Thornton Yard, BNSF trains must exit their main line and use a side track known as the Brownsville lead. (Dkt. No. 47-2 at 35.) The Brownsville lead is a 2.5-mile stretch of track that is owned by CNR, and used by BNSF pursuant to an Interchange Agreement with Running Rights (\"Interchange Agreement\"). (Dkt. Nos. 47-2 at 35, 47-3.) The Interchange Agreement allows BNSF to use both the Brownsville lead and Thornton Yard so that it can conduct its interchange operations, while making CNR responsible for managing, maintaining, and repairing the tracks. (Dkt. No. 47-3 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly after switching onto the Brownsville lead, but before reaching Thornton Yard, Plaintiffs' train derailed. (Dkt. No. 47-2 at 34-35.) The train derailed because of a broken rail on the Brownsville lead. (Dkt. Nos. 47-1 at 25, 52-2 at 5.) Both BNSF and CNR state that they were unaware of the broken rail prior to the accident. (Dkt. Nos. 47-1 at 24, 47-2 at 36.) Plaintiffs allege that they suffered severe injuries as a result of the derailment. (Dkt. No. 47-3 at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against BNSF for negligence under the Federal Employer's Liability Act (\"FELA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt.

BNSF's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   BNSF asks the Court to grant summary judgment for two reasons. First, BNSF asserts that it cannot be held liable under FELA because Plaintiffs have not produced evidence that BNSF was directly negligent in causing the train derailment that resulted in their injuries. (Dkt. No. 46 at 5.) Second, BNSF asserts that it cannot be held liable for CNR's negligence, if any, because CNR was not acting as BNSF's agent within the meaning of FELA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Plaintiffs argue that BNSF can be held liable under FELA for the failure to properly inspect, maintain, and repair the broken rail that caused the derailment.

BNSF's own investigative report into the derailment showed that the broken rail had a \"detail fracture\" that originated at or near the surface of the rail head, that had progressed through \"approximately 70% of the head width,\" and that was visible in pictures taken after the derailment.

But BNSF cannot, as a matter of law, insulate itself from FELA liability by delegating its duty to ensure a safe workplace to CNR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nivens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681988\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/425/114/#p120\">\n    425 F.2d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a third-party's failure to maintain tracks in accordance with its lease with a railroad would not defeat plaintiff's FELA claim against railroad resulting from unsafe tracks).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   BNSF's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, BNSF argues that Plaintiffs have not put forth any evidence showing that it was negligent because none of the parties can \"say with certainty when, why, or how the rail broke.\" (Dkt. No. 46 at 6.) How the rail broke raises a separate question about whether an inspection conducted prior to the derailment would have led to discovery and repair of the broken rail. As described above, Plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find that neither BNSF nor CNR exercised reasonable care in inspecting the Brownsville lead prior to the derailment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   BNSF also asserts that there is no evidence that it should have known about a defect or break in the rail prior to the derailment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) However, since a jury could conclude from the evidence that CNR should have been on notice of the broken rail, then BNSF could similarly be found to have constructive notice of the defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Security Ins. Co. v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1951707\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/276/182/\">\n    276 F.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1960) (holding that constructive notice is sufficient to prove negligence in FELA case). Moreover, BNSF cannot absolve itself from FELA liability by arguing that it could not have discovered the broken rail because CNR was exclusively responsible for maintaining the Brownsville lead. The Supreme Court rejected that exact argument in a case where it held that a railroad was liable for its employee's injuries caused by a third-party's defective railcar despite the fact that it would have been essentially impossible for the railroad to discover the relevant defect.\n   <em>\n    Shenker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8279\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/374/1/#p7\">\n    374 U.S. at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8279\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/374/1/#p7\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that the railroad's lack of control or supervision over the defective railcar did not provide \"an exception to the employer's duty to provide a safe place to work,\" and that the railroad could have protected itself \"by refusing to permit its employees to service the car.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8279\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/374/1/#p7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court again emphasizes that the degree of proof necessary to take a FELA claim to a jury is significantly less than a\n   normal negligence claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736204\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/1366/#p1370\">\n    823 F.2d at 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A jury's right to pass upon the questions of fault and causation in FELA actions must be viewed liberally; the jury's power to engage in inferences is significantly broader than in common law negligence actions.\"). Whether BNSF exercised reasonable care in ensuring that the Brownsville lead was safe, such that it met its non-delegable duty to provide Plaintiffs with a safe workplace, is a question for the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    b. Agency Theory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs can separately argue at trial that CNR's negligence in failing to adequately inspect and repair the Brownsville lead can be imputed to BNSF because CNR was acting as its agent. BNSF and CNR entered into the Interchange Agreement because \"it was desirable and beneficial for each of the parties [ ] to deliver and receive interchange traffic\" in the Thornton Yard. (Dkt. No. 47-3 at 8.) As part of the Interchange Agreement, CNR allowed BNSF to operate its trains along the Brownsville lead in order to access Thornton Yard, \"for the sole purpose of delivery and receipt of interchange traffic.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) The Interchange Agreement also placed \"[t]he construction, maintenance, repair and renewal of the [Brownsville lead]\" under the exclusive direction and control of CNR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court concludes that by allowing BNSF to use the Brownsville lead pursuant to the Interchange Agreement, CNR was performing operational activities for BNSF such that it was the railroad's agent under FELA. CNR not only allowed BNSF to use the Brownsville lead, but also performed inspections and maintenance of the tracks where the derailment occurred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 47-3 at 10.) Such operational tasks go to the very core of BNSF's business-indeed, BNSF would not have been able to conduct its interchange operations in British Columbia without the use of the Brownsville lead. (Dkt. No. 46 at 4, 47-3 at 1.) By entering into the Interchange Agreement, BNSF effectively outsourced these essential operational tasks to CNR, which it would otherwise have had to perform itself. Therefore, if CNR acted negligently in inspecting or maintaining the tracks where the derailment occurred, its negligence can be imputed to BNSF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This strikes the Court as the exact type of scenario where courts have found an agency relationship under FELA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinkler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163006\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/326/#p331\">\n    356 U.S. at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163006\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/326/#p331\">\n    78 S.Ct. 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that third-party switching operator was an agent because it played a part in railroad's \"total enterprise\");\n   <em>\n    Nivens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681988\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/425/114/#p120\">\n    425 F.2d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding trial court's agency instruction, which stated that railroad would be liable for third-party's negligent design of railway because the tracks were used \"for [the railroad's] benefit and in furtherance of its operational activities\") (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2206400\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/438/208/#p211\">\n    438 F.2d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an agency relationship existed when a third party provided railroad employees with a parking lot to use before and after work).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   BNSF argues that CNR could not have been its agent based on the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

Plaintiffs were working for BNSF, not CNR, when the derailment occurred on the Brownsville lead. BNSF entered into the Interchange Agreement with CNR so that it could use the Brownsville lead and Thornton Yard to conduct its operations in British Columbia. The Interchange Agreement also relieved BNSF from having to inspect, maintain, and repair the tracks that it used to conduct its operations. The operative facts in\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   were that the defendant railroad neither ordered its employee to maintain the turpentine company's siding track nor stood to benefit from the track's repair. This case presents the opposite situation-Plaintiffs were operating their train on the Brownsville lead at the direction of BNSF and for the railroad's clear benefit. BNSF's narrow reading of\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   is at odds with Congress's intent that FELA be liberally applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinkler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163006\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/326/#p331\">\n    356 U.S. at 330-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163006\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/326/#p331\">\n    78 S.Ct. 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plainly an accommodating scope must be given to the word 'agents' to give vitality to the standard governing the liability of carriers to their workers injured on the job.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant BNSF's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 46) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Plaintiffs originally filed separate lawsuits that the Court consolidated into this action. (Dkt. No. 9) (ordering\n    <em>\n     Harris v. BNSF\n    </em>\n    , C18-0052-JCC, consolidated into this matter). For administrative purposes, the Court ORDERS Plaintiffs to file a copy of the complaint filed in Mr. Harris' lawsuit within seven (7) days of this order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    CNR has filed a motion to dismiss the third-party complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 43.) The Court will resolve that motion in a separate order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Although CNR indicated in a closeout report of the derailment that it would \"[r]eview RFD tapes to determine if defect was missed on last test,\" and that \"[r]ail section will be sent to lab for further analysis,\" CNR neither sent the rail for further analysis, nor preserved the broken rail as evidence. (Dkt. Nos. 47-2 at 57, 52-4 at 16.) BNSF asserts that it does not know where the broken rail is, and Plaintiffs indicate that they will seek an adverse inference instruction at trial. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. Nos. 51 at 3, 52-2 at 5.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The Court's ruling on summary judgment does not preclude BNSF from raising this issue again during trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    As the Court has detailed above, Plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing at summary judgment of CNR's negligence.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    Part II.B.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Nor is the Court persuaded by BNSF's policy argument that if it could be held liable for CNR's negligence, then it could potentially be held liable whenever and wherever one of its employees is injured as a result of a third party's negligence. (Dkt. No. 54 at 4-5.) First, FELA imposes broad liability on railroads that is \"an avowed departure from the rules of the common law,\" and which obligates railroads \"to bear the burden of all injuries befalling those engaged in the enterprise arising out of the fault of any other member engaged in the common endeavor.\"\n    <em>\n     Sinkler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163006\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/326/#p331\">\n     356 U.S. at 330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163006\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/326/#p331\">\n     78 S.Ct. 758\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This case does not involve some attenuated instance of third-party negligence-it involves a\n    <em>\n     train derailment\n    </em>\n    allegedly caused by insufficient inspection and maintenance of\n    <em>\n     railways.\n    </em>\n    Second, the Court cannot help but observe that the Interchange Agreement's indemnification provisions appear to be an attempt to protect BNSF from the exact type of broad liability which it argues FELA does not impose. (Dkt. No. 47-3 at 14.) Indeed, BNSF has filed a third-party complaint against CNR for that very reason. (Dkt. No. 39.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
