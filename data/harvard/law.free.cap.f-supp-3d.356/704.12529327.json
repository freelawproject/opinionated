Having carefully reviewed the administrative record and the parties' briefs, and also having carefully considered the ALJ's analysis leading to the non-disability finding here at issue, the Court finds the ALJ carefully and reasonably reviewed the record, appropriately reviewed the Listings, properly weighed the medical opinion and medical evidence at issue (and applied the 'good reasons' rule with respect to the medical evidence by Plaintiff's treaters), and accurately determined Plaintiff's RFC and disability status. Thus, as more fully explained herein, the Court finds the ALJ's decision supported by substantial evidence and concludes that the ALJ's non-disability finding should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
