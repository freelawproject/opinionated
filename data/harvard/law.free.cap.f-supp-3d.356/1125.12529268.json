The Court has jurisdiction over this lawsuit pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1367.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Dalkita, Inc. (\"Dalkita\") filed this action on June 6, 2018 asserting the following claims for relief: (1) trademark infringement and false designation of origin under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15, U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) ; (2) cybersquatting under \u00a7 43(d) of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; (3) deceptive trade practices under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%206-1-101\">\n    Colo.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 7-74-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Docket No. 1. On July 30, 2018, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction on its federal trademark infringement and cybersquatting claims. Docket No. 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 24, 2018, defendants filed a cross-motion for a preliminary injunction based on their counterclaims for trademark infringement under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act and unfair competition under Colorado law. Docket No. 19. The Court held an evidentiary hearing on both preliminary injunction motions on October 9, 2018. Docket No. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court makes the following findings of fact based on the parties' filings and the\n   evidence presented at the October 9, 2018 evidentiary hearing:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Dalkita is a full service architecture and construction firm based in Littleton, Colorado. Dalkita's primary focus is designing distilled spirits plants. Docket No. 1 at 2, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Colleen and Scott Moore are the co-owners of Dalkita.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. In October 2016, Dalkita hired defendant Devin Mills as a part-time distillery engineer. When hired, Mr. Mills owned his own company, Devin Mills Consulting, which he had started in 2012. Mr. Mills' job duties at Dalkita included helping to design and build distilleries. He also engaged in limited marketing activities, such as talking with prospective clients and attending the American Distillery Institute (\"ADI\") conference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 9 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. On April 18, 2017, Mr. Mills signed Dalkita's employment manual, which provides that \"[i]ncidental and occasional personal use of company computers, phones, or electronic mail and voice mail systems is permitted, but information and messages stored in these systems will be treated no differently from other business-related information and messages.\" Exhibit 1 at 14. The first page of the manual states that \"[t]he content of a manual does not constitute nor should it be construed as a promise of employment or as a contract between Dalkita Construction, Inc. dba Dalkita Architecture &amp; Construction, and any of its employees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   4. In January 2017, Mr. Mills began developing the idea for a podcast aimed at helping distillers \"get better at their jobs.\" No one at Dalkita instructed Mr. Mills to create a podcast or authorized him to develop the podcast during work hours. Between January 2017 and March 2017, Mr. Mills independently registered the domain name distillingcraft.com, created a landing page for the website, hired an artist to design a \"Distilling Craft\" logo, and developed a basic structure for the podcast.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibits A, B, C. The landing page of the distillingcraft.com website stated \"Podcast Coming Soon - May 2017.\" The website was publicly accessible, but only six people signed up to be notified of the podcast via the website before July 18, 2017. Those individuals consisted of Mr. Mills, his wife, two of his wife's co-workers, Mr. Mills' friend Michelle, and one \"random guy.\" Mr. Mills does not know how many people saw the landing page of the distillingcraft.com website between the date of its initial publication and July 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   5. On April 1, 2017, Mr. Mills and the Moores flew to Baltimore, Maryland for the ADI conference. Dalkita paid for Mr. Mills' trip to Baltimore. Mr. Mills told the Moores about the podcast and distillingcraft.com during the flight to Baltimore. Mr. Mills testified that he informed the Moores of the podcast at that time because he felt that it would be unethical to solicit sponsors for the podcast at the conference without talking to Dalkita first. This testimony is corroborated by Ms. Moore's statement that Mr. Mills told her about the podcast in the \"first quarter of 2017\" and that the Moores informed Mr. Mills in April 2017 that they would reimburse him for any expenses associated with the podcast. Additionally, the first podcast-related entry in Mr. Mills' time records at Dalkita was on April 11, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 9 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   6. Mr. Mills testified that he told \"probably a couple hundred people\" at the ADI conference to visit the distillingcraft.com website and \"check out what we were doing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   7. Mr. Mills testified that, after explaining his podcast idea to the Moores on the flight to Baltimore, he and the Moores entered into a sponsorship contract whereby Dalkita agreed to pay Mr. Mills his regular hourly rate for time spent on the\n   podcast in exchange for Dalkita being the sole sponsor of the podcast. Mr. Mills testified that he initially asked Dalkita for $ 450-$ 500 per episode in exchange for sponsorship, but Mr. Moore suggested that Dalkita pay Mr. Mills on an hourly basis in order to avoid Dalkita having to fill out additional paperwork. Mr. Mills testified that producing one episode would require approximately ten hours of work. At the evidentiary hearing, the Moores denied the existence of any sponsorship agreement. Ms. Moore testified that Dalkita offered to pay for the costs of the podcast because the podcast belonged to Dalkita, not because of any sponsorship agreement. Likewise, Mr. Moore testified that there were no written or oral agreements concerning sponsorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   8. The morning after the April 1, 2017 flight to Baltimore, Ms. Moore changed the colors of the Distilling Craft logo from red to orange to reflect Dalkita's branding. Mr. Mills testified that he agreed to the change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   9. Mr. Mills' time records reflect that, beginning on April 11, 2017, Mr. Mills logged an average of ten hours of work for each podcast episode.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 9. However, Mr. Mills' podcast-related time entries do not always reference the podcast specifically,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit 9 at 5 (April 21, 2017 time entry: \"Emailed initial 4 desired interviewees then talked to James young and Sean smiley about when the scheduling would work best.\"), or give any indication that the time Mr. Mills spent on the podcast was governed by a separate sponsorship agreement.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   10. Ms. Moore was heavily involved in various aspects of the podcast's production, including the recruitment of guests, the development of questions for the interview segments, and marketing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibits 10, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   11. In July 2017, Dalkita hired a third-party audio editing firm to produce the finished audio files for the podcast.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   12. Updates on the podcast were incorporated into Dalkita's internal team meetings as early as May 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   13. In certain emails with prospective podcast guests, some of which were copied to Mr. Mills, the Moores referred to the podcasts as Dalkita's podcasts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit 10 at 1 (January 9, 2018 email from Colleen Moore asking if distiller would \"like to be on our podcast\"), 6 (August 15, 2017 email from Colleen Moore asking if distillers would like to be guests on \"our new podcast\"), 12 (August 23, 2017 email from Colleen Moore to distiller Scott Hanson characterizing podcast as Dalkita's \"little side project\"). In other emails, Ms. Moore referred to Dalkita as a sponsor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit 10 at 3 (July 18, 2017 email from Colleen Moore stating that Dalkita was \"sponsoring/producing\" the Distilling Craft podcast), 9 (August 23, 2017 email from Colleen Moore stating that Dalkita was \"sponsoring a podcast hosted by Devin Mills\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   14. There is no evidence that Mr. Mills attempted to correct the Moores when they told third parties that the podcast was \"our podcast.\" Mr. Mills admits that he did not attempt to correct that impression or talk to Ms. Moore privately about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   15. The first episode of the podcast was published on July 18, 2017. The podcast consists of three segments: (1) an engineering talk; (2) an interview; and (3) commercials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   16. Mr. Mills was the host of the podcast. He was responsible for conducting interviews, recording the \"technical talk\" portion of the show, and posting the updated metadata for the podcast to Blubrry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Blubrry is a podcast hosting platform. The final audio files from the podcast were uploaded onto the Blubrry platform where they were served out to other websites, such as iTunes, Google, and dalkita.com. Dalkita paid for the Blubrry account from the inception of the account until approximately one month after Mr. Mills' termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   17. Dalkita paid for all expenses related to the podcast, except for the registration of the distillingcraft.com domain name. When Ms. Moore asked Mr. Mills to put the annual registration fee for the distillingcraft.com domain name on Dalkita's company credit card, Mr. Mills responded that he had already paid for the first year of the domain name on his own card, but would use the Dalkita card the following year. Exhibit 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   18. The distillingcraft.com domain name remained under Mr. Mills' name. At some point, however, distillingcraft.com was redirected to Dalkita's website, where Dalkita posted all of the information related to the podcast.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   19. Ms. Moore posted advertisements for the podcast on Facebook. Distilling Craft's Facebook page directed visitors to Dalkita's company website, dalkita.com.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   20. Between July 2017 and March 2018, Dalkita and Mr. Mills produced a total of twenty episodes of the Distilling Craft podcast.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 9; Exhibit 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   21. Mr. Mills' employment with Dalkita was terminated on March 12, 2018. Exhibit 9 at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   22. Before or immediately after Mr. Mills' termination, Mr. Mills changed the passwords to all the podcast-related accounts, including the Blubrry account. Approximately one month after his termination, Mr. Mills obtained formal ownership of the Blubrry account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   23. On March 15, 2018, Ms. Moore filed a Colorado trademark registration for the Distilling Craft mark. Exhibit H. The registration form lists a first use in commerce date of March 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-102\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dalkita also has a pending trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   24. Since Mr. Mills' termination, Dalkita has released \"recut\" episodes of the podcast that eliminate Mr. Mills' engineering segment. Mr. Mills has also released full episodes of the podcast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   25. Blubrry program statistics on the podcast show that total podcast downloads decreased from 4,283 in February 2018 to 919 in June 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   26. Sometime after Mr. Mills' termination, one of Dalkita's clients sent Dalkita an email response to an invoice from Mr. Mills for work performed by his consulting business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   27. Mr. Mills currently operates a consulting business called Devin Mills Consulting d/b/a Distilling Craft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   28. Mr. Mills is scheduled to begin filming additional episodes of a television show related to distilling. Mr. Mills hopes to promote the Distilling Craft brand via the show.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To succeed on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the moving party must show (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood that the movant will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in the movant's favor; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    RoDa Drilling Co. v.

Although Mr. Mills testified that he spoke to a \"couple hundred people\" at the ADI conference regarding distillingcraft.com, the Court, as noted above, gives this testimony little weight. Thus, the Court is left with a handful of people that Mr. Mills said visited the site before July 2017. Defendants have not shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Mr. Mills engaged in promotional efforts \"sufficiently public to identify or distinguish the marked goods in an appropriate segment of the public mind.\"\n   <em>\n    Brookfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626525\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1036/#p1052\">\n    174 F.3d at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and bracket omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants argue that, even if Mr. Mills' activities between January and July 2018 did not create rights in the Distilling Craft mark, Mr. Mills established ownership of the mark by \"continuously us[ing], advertis[ing], and provid[ing] services under the Distilling Craft name with Plaintiff as the sponsor for approximately a year thereafter.\" Docket No. 30 at 5. Defendants predicate their argument on the existence of a sponsorship agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the\n   parties' course of conduct is inconsistent with the existence of such an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court gives no weight to Dalkita's employment manual, which states that \"[t]he content of a manual should [not] be construed ... as a contract between Dalkita Construction, Inc. dba Dalkita Architecture &amp; Construction, and any of its employees.\" Exhibit 1 at 1. The following evidence, however, is inconsistent with the existence of a sponsorship agreement. First, Ms. Moore was heavily involved in all aspects of the production process, including the recruitment of guests, the development of questions for the interview segments, and the marketing of the podcast.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibits 10, 11. That activity is inconsistent with Dalkita being merely a sponsor, but is consistent with Dalkita owning the podcast. Second, Ms. Moore changed the colors of the Distilling Craft logo to match Dalkita's branding, and all information related to the podcast was posted on Dalkita's website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 8. Although Mr. Mills agreed to Ms. Moore's idea of changing the colors, this is inconsistent with Dalkita simply being a sponsor. Third, in emails with prospective podcast guests, Ms. Moore frequently characterized the podcast as belonging to Dalkita.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exhibit 10 at 1 (January 9, 2018 email from Colleen Moore asking if distiller would \"like to be on our podcast\"), 6 (August 15, 2017 email from Colleen Moore asking if distillers would like to be guests on \"our new podcast\"), 12 (August 23, 2017 email from Colleen Moore to distiller Scott Hanson characterizing podcast as Dalkita's \"little side project\"). While there are other emails in which Ms. Moore stated that Dalkita was \"sponsoring\" the podcast, those emails are ambiguous at best, referring also to \"our show\" and describing Mr. Mills as the \"host\" of the podcast rather than its creator/owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 10 at 3, 9. Moreover, Mr. Mills' failure to correct the Moores' assertion of Dalkita's ownership role is, by itself, evidence that no sponsorship agreement existed. Mr. Mills testified that he did not think it was necessary and it would have been \"over the top\" to do so, but his silence, combined with defendants' lack of any written evidence supporting the existence of a sponsorship agreement, weighs against any finding in favor of defendants on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Two additional facts are inconsistent with Mr. Mills' position. First, there is no indication in Mr. Mills' time records that the hours he spent on the podcast were governed by a separate sponsorship agreement. Second, the terms of the alleged sponsorship agreement are nebulous. While Mr. Mills testified that Dalkita agreed to pay Mr. Mills his regular hourly rate for work performed on the podcast in exchange for sole sponsorship, defendants did not present any evidence regarding the parties' agreement on - or discussion of - other important issues suggesting a meeting of the minds, such as the length of the sponsorship agreement, what expenses Dalkita would pay, how Mr. Mills would account for podcast-related work in his time sheets, and the extent to which Ms. Moore would be involved in the production process. In the absence of further evidence suggesting the existence of a sponsorship agreement, defendants fail to show that they are likely to succeed in demonstrating ownership of the Distilling Craft mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Because defendants have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their trademark infringement claim, they have failed to demonstrate a \"clear and unequivocal\" right to relief.\n   <em>\n    Beltronics USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5894496\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/1067/#p1070\">\n    562 F.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, because defendants limited their arguments to the trademark infringement claim at the evidentiary hearing, the Court will likewise limit its analysis to that claim. Even if the Court were to consider both claims, however, defendants' unfair competition claim would fail for the same reason as their trademark infringement claim. A claim for unfair competition under Colorado law requires defendants to show that (1) the Distilling Craft trade name has acquired a secondary meaning; and (2) plaintiff has unfairly used the name, or a simulation of it, against defendants.\n    <em>\n     Gregg Homes, Inc. v.
