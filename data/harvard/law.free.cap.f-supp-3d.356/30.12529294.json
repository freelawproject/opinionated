This evidence plainly establishes that the plaintiffs meet the first element for the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction because, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), because the lawsuit was filed after North Korea was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, in part, \"as a result of\" its barbaric treatment of Otto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Three separate experts on North Korea confirm that Otto was tortured during different stages of his detention in North Korea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, Otto was likely tortured while interrogated to obtain a false confession. David Hawk, an expert on human rights in North Korea who has interviewed many North Korean refugees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hawk Expert Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-4, and whose testimony the D.C.

North Korea ultimately obtained a false confession from Otto, and \"the initial or pretrial interrogation stage, when interrogators\n   are attempting to extract a confession, is when torture most commonly occurs in North Korea; indeed, it would be unusual if torture did not occur in this phase.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340131,4285324\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Similarly, Bob Collins, an expert having extensive familiarity with North Korean interrogation methods,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Collins Expert Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-7, noted that Otto's purported \"confession,\" which was full of patently false statements and unnatural language,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27, indicates the confession was \"most likely dictated to [Otto] in advance and the product of torture,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Professor Sung-Yoon Lee, who specializes in Korean Studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Lee Expert Decl. \u00b6 1, similarly concluded that \"Otto was likely tortured by North Korean agents while detained in order to obtain a confession from him,\" because it is a \"routinized way through which North Korea obtains confessions from individuals in its custody,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, Otto was likely tortured based on the nature of the North Korean crime to which he was forced to confess and for which he was convicted: removing a poster that said, \"Let's arm ourselves strongly with Kim Jong-il patriotism!\" Collins Expert Decl. \u00b6 21. According to Mr. Hawk, \"North Korea almost certainly tortured Otto\" because this crime would carry a penalty of \"particularly brutal treatment\" in North Korea, Hawk Expert Decl. \u00b6 38, or even the penalty of \"execution,\" H'rg Tr. (Rough) at 97 (Expert David Hawk). Mr. Collins confirms that, \"[a] crime of the nature of which Otto was accused is in fact the ultimate crime in North Korea;\" and North Koreans suspected of similar political offenses \"are seized and deported without judicial process to political prison camps ... where they are routinely tortured and mistreated.\" Collins Expert Decl. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Third, North Korea \"most likely further tortured\" Otto after his trial and sentencing \"for their own intelligence and foreign relations purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Indeed, North Korea probably \"both seized and maintained custody of Otto\" and then \"systematically tortured\" him to \"further certain policy goals: namely, in order to deter the United States from responding either with military action or sanctions in the face of North Korea's increased nuclear and conventional weapons testing.\" Lee Expert Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Fourth, the general fact of Otto's detention in North Korea suggests he was tortured. For example, Mr. Hawk opined that in all North Korean detention facilities, prisoners \"are uniformly treated with brutality and disregard for human rights.\" Hawk Expert Decl. \u00b6 13. The \"practice of torture permeates the North Korean prison and detention system,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, and \"is particularly common ... during interrogations,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Likewise, Mr. Collins explained that he is \"aware of hundreds of North Koreans ... who have been subject to\" torture, Collins Expert Decl. \u00b6 27, and concluded Otto was likely tortured based on that \"routine\" practice,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 28. According to Professor Lee, given the expected and routinized nature of torture in North Korean facilities, North Korean interrogators \"would have found it unpatriotic not to use torture to get what they want.\" H'rg Tr. (Rough) at 126 (Expert Prof. Sung-Yoon Lee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Fifth, notably, several torture methods regularly employed by North Korea are \"consistent with Otto's condition when he returned.\" Collins Expert Decl. \u00b6 31. Dr. Daniel Kanter, the neurologist who cared for Otto when he returned to the United States, concluded Otto's brain damage resulted from the cessation or significant reduction of blood flow to the brain for five to twenty minutes, which can be caused by\n   \"cessation of breathing.\" Kanter Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14, 15. \"[N]ormal North Korean torture methods,\" which include \"[w]ater-boarding,\" \"manipulating teeth with pliers,\" and \"application of electric shock,\" \"can lead to a cessation of breathing,\" and if Otto began \"to resist,\" \"interrogators would have become infuriated ... and suffocated him or otherwise caused him to stop breathing, only to be forced to revive him.\" Collins Expert Decl. \u00b6 31. Even more, Otto \"had a large scar on his foot and ... certain of his bottom teeth appeared repositioned,\" further evidence supporting that his physical condition resulted from \"[t]he application of electric shocks\" to Otto's foot and the use of pliers to rearrange Otto's teeth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although \"there were not any apparent visible wounds on Otto [in the video footage available of him while in North Korean detention],\" \"bruises, wounds or other injury on the body anywhere other than his hands, head and neck would not have been visible\" from the \"methods of torture commonly applied to North Korean detainees in order to extract [a] confession.\" Collins Expert Decl. \u00b6 28. For instance, \"water-boarding, being forced to squat for several hours, and being placed in a box too small to either stand or lie down in for long periods of time,\" all \"cause severe pain and suffering without leaving obvious physical evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   H'rg Tr.

Moreover, United States officials have publicly confirmed that North Korea tortured Otto.

(Rough) at 121 (Expert Prof. Sung-Yoon Lee) (explaining that North Korea publicly portrays itself as a \"high-functioning\" nation \"based on the ... rule of law\" to maintain \"the semblance of normalcy\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 104 (Expert David Hawk) (stating that North Korea \"care[s] about its international reputation with respect to human rights\"). As Otto's case illustrates, fear that public criticism of North Korea will result in reprisal against the hostage worked as North Korea intended to keep the Warmbiers and their family and friends silent about Otto's detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   U.S. government officials repeatedly cautioned the Warmbiers that North Korea threatened to injure Otto if they spoke out publicly about Otto's confinement and questioned or criticized publicly the North Korean story about the circumstances of\n   Otto's detention. Otto's mother stated that, \"we were told by all the government officials we met with that we should stay quiet and not speak out against North Korea because doing so would probably mean that Otto would be punished for what we said.\" C. W. Decl. \u00b6 19. In June 2017, Joseph Yun, the former U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Policy at the State Department, told Fred Warmbier that North Korean representatives \"won't release Otto\" if the Warmbiers spoke to the media about Otto's detention. F. W. Decl. \u00b6 18. In sum, North Korea used Otto's detention to \"control\" the \"dialogue the whole time,\" H'rg Tr. (Rough) at 82-83 (C. W.), and Otto's parents were \"[t]errified,\" \"afraid to ... speak out or discuss\" Otto \"with anyone,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 23 (F. W.). This same fear was shared by Otto's siblings,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45 (G. W.); F. W.

Extrajudicial Killing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Next, North Korea's treatment of Otto amounted to an extrajudicial killing. Under Section 1605A(h)(7), \"extrajudicial killing\" has the meaning given to it in the TVPA, which defines an extrajudicial killing as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.

Circuit has explained, \"jurisdictional causation\" is evaluated under a \"proximate cause\" standard, which requires \"some reasonable connection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damage which the plaintiff has suffered,\" such that the act was a \"substantial factor,\" and the victim's injury was \"reasonably foreseeable or anticipated as a natural consequence\" of the defendant's act.\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n    864 F.3d at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Here, North Korea released Otto from his detention with such irrevocable, extensive brain damage that this resulted in Otto's death. Kanter Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 16, 21. Dr. Kanter opined, \"based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\" that Otto \"died because of his brain injury,\" which \"was caused by the sustained cessation of blood flow to the brain, an injury occurring in North Korea after the last video that was released of him from his trial and sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.

Dr. Kanter \"diagnosed [Otto's] brain injury as severe and unrecoverable,\" concluding Otto \"could have continued indefinitely with artificial\" life support, \"but he could not have lived without that assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. As to North Korea's alternative public claim that Otto died from botulism, F. W. Decl. \u00b6 24, Dr. Kanter's team conducted on Otto an \"electromyography study,\" which tests for \"neuromuscular junction dysfunction,\" \"an important feature of botulism,\" Kanter Decl. \u00b6 13. The test \"was normal, indicating\n   that [Otto] had not contracted botulism while in North Korea that would have caused respiratory failure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. That Otto would die from this brain injury was also reasonably foreseeable. According to Mr. Hawk, North Korea released Otto \"just before he would have died in detention,\" H'rg Tr. (Rough) at 98 (Expert David Hawk), deciding it \"needed to get him out of the country before he [died] in detention, which would be harder for [North Korea] to explain,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   With respect to the second element, North Korea deliberately caused Otto's brain damage, which resulted in his death. North Korea's torture methods \"pose a substantial danger to human life,\" and North Korea \"routinely withholds medical care from those in its custody, with such frequency that it amounts to an intentional act.\" Hawk Expert Decl. \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25 (explaining denial of food rations and imposition of hard labor are also \"common\" intentional acts resulting in death); Kanter Decl. \u00b6 15 (\"Because the [brain] injury was so extensive, it was unlikely that [Otto] was with medical personnel who were willing and able to intervene to resuscitate him when the injury occurred.\").

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, the plaintiffs' motion for default judgment is granted. North Korea is liable for the torture, hostage taking, and extrajudicial killing of Otto Warmbier, and the injuries to his mother and father, Fred and Cindy Warmbier. The plaintiffs are awarded monetary damages in the following amounts: Otto Warmbier's estate is entitled to $ 6,038,308 in economic losses, $ 96,375.80 in medical expenses, $ 15,000,000 in pain and suffering, and $ 150,000,000 in punitive damages. Fred and Cindy Warmbier are each entitled to $ 15,000,000 in solatium damages and a total of $ 300,000,000 in punitive damages. Thus, the total damage award is $ 501,134,683.80.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Rough Transcript of Hearing (Dec. 19, 2018) (\"H'rg Tr.
