That lawsuit, which involved grave injuries to a construction worker, has been resolved, but the allocation of defense costs remains. In particular, Plaintiff seeks reimbursement from Defendant of $ 145,263.30 it paid in defense costs, plus interest at 9% per annum from December 13, 2013; Defendant disclaims the obligation to pay, and argues in the alternative that any obligation should be set off\n   by other, arguably related defense costs incurred by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons stated in the remainder of this Opinion, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, and Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Relevant Contracts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The accident in question took place at a construction site in the Bronx that was owned by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (\"DASNY\"). (Com. Ex. 5). DASNY hired Preferred Builders, Inc. (\"Preferred\") to perform foundation work on the project, which included placing and setting concrete wall panels and wall forms. (Com. Ex. 3; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 2). DASNY also retained Gilbane Building Company (\"Gilbane\") to serve as Construction Manager. (Ham. Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DASNY's contract with Preferred required that Preferred obtain insurance coverage naming both DASNY and DASNY's construction manager,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Gilbane, as additional insureds, and specifying that the coverage afforded each additional insured was primary (as distinguished from excess). (Com. Ex. 3, 12). Accordingly, Preferred obtained an insurance policy from Valiant Insurance Company, which later became Hamilton. (Com. Ex. 1). Under that policy (the \"Hamilton Policy\"), both DASNY and Gilbane were listed as additional insureds. (Com. Ex. 1-3). The Hamilton Policy further recited that \"[t]o the extent that this insurance is afforded to any additional insured under this policy, such insurance shall apply as primary and not contributing with any insurance carried by such additional insured, as required by written contract.\" (Com. Ex. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DASNY's contract with Gilbane similarly required that Gilbane obtain insurance coverage naming DASNY as an additional insured, for which the policy would provide primary coverage. (Ham. Ex. A). Accordingly, Gilbane obtained an insurance policy from Liberty Mutual (the \"Liberty Mutual Policy\"). (Com. Ex. 4). As to any additional insured, the Liberty Mutual Policy specified that \"[c]overage would be excess of any other valid and collectable insurance\n   <em>\n    unless the agreement between the insured and additional insured requires this insurance to be primary.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As potentially relevant to the instant motions, the Liberty Mutual Policy contained an endorsement providing for a deductible in the amount of $ 250,000. (Com. Ex. 4). Among other things, the endorsement\n   stated: \"We [Liberty Mutual] have the right but not the duty to advance any part or all of these amounts. Exercise of our right to advance such amounts shall not create any obligations or be construed as a waiver or estoppel of our rights under this policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). It further explained that both \"damages and supplementary payments erode[d the] deductible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And it defined \"supplementary payments\" to include \"[a]ll expenses we incur\" in \"any 'suit' against an insured we defend.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Underlying Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Angel Siguencia, an employee of Preferred, was injured by a falling concrete wall while working on the site on July 7, 2010. (Com. Ex. 5 at \u00b6 23). Preferred was the only contractor working in the area at the time of the accident, and it was Preferred's responsibility to supervise the \"means and methods\" of its employees' work. (Def. Br. 5; Ham. Ex. D at 17-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 21, 2011, Siguencia filed the Underlying Action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Bronx County, against DASNY and Gilbane, among others, but did not name Preferred as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siguencia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gilbane\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    , et al.\n   </em>\n   , Index No. 305543/2011. (Com. Ex. 5). DASNY cross-claimed against Gilbane and also commenced a third-party action against Preferred. (Com. Ex. 6, 8). Gilbane, which was defended by the law firm Marshall Dennehey Warner Coleman &amp; Goggin (\"Marshall Dennehey\"), both cross-claimed against Preferred and brought an additional third-party action against Preferred. (Com. Ex. 7, 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. 12 n.7 (explaining reasons for the third-party action) ). Defendant Hamilton, the insurer for Preferred, stepped in to defend and appoint counsel for Preferred. (Follet Dep. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Insurance Coverage Disputes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Gilbane's Tenders of Defense and Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 3, 2011, on July 25, 2011, and on September 12, 2013, Gilbane's counsel, Marshall Dennehey, thrice tendered Gilbane's defense, indemnification, and additional insured status in the Underlying Action to Hamilton, via Hamilton's claims management agent, Riverstone. (Com. Ex. 12, 17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The January 3, 2011 letter stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [W]e are tendering the defense and indemnification of the claims against Gilbane to your\n   company as the General Liability Carrier for Preferred. Gilbane does hereby tender its defense ... and requests that it be indemnified and that the costs of its defense be immediately assumed[.] Absent resolution of this tender within thirty (30) days, Gilbane may seek to enforce its rights and move to compel the assumption of its defense pursuant to the contractual obligation of Preferred to Gilbane.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Com. Ex. 11). Notably, the January 3, 2011 letter was sent before Siguencia brought the Underlying Action on June 21, 2011, and the letter accordingly refers to the Underlying Action as \"pre-suit.\" (Com. Ex. 5, 11). According to a subsequent description by Liberty Mutual's agent, Hamilton \"responded by saying that [it] opened a file to investigate the tender.\" (Com. Ex. 12). Marshall Dennehey's July 25, 2011 letter stated similarly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [W]e are tendering the defense and indemnification and additional insured status of the claims against Gilbane to your company as the General Liability Carrier for Preferred. Gilbane does hereby tender its defense to [Hamilton] ... and requests that it be indemnified and that the costs of its defense be immediately assumed.... We ask that you respond to this demand immediately[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 21, 2011, Hamilton denied coverage for Gilbane on the basis that there was no direct contractual privity between Gilbane and Hamilton's policyholder, Preferred. (Follett Dep. 54-55, 58). Approximately two years later, on October 11, 2013, Hamilton reversed course and \"agreed to assume Gilbane's defense under a full reservation of rights,\" by which Hamilton meant that it: (i) \"reserve[d] the right to appoint new defense counsel\" for Gilbane; (ii) the \"insured status applies only to the extent the liability of the additional insured arises out of Preferred Builders' work\"; and (iii) Hamilton \"reserve[d] the right to disclaim coverage for any liability assessed against Gilbane that falls outside this [coverage limitation].\" (Com. Ex. 17). On January 14, 2014, Hamilton reasserted both its \"agreement to defend Gilbane,\" and its reservation of rights, noting that \"Gilbane's additional insured coverage is limited to its liability arising from the work of [Hamilton's] named insured, Preferred Builders[.]\" (Com. Ex. 18). Neither of these letters mentioned a duty to indemnify, only to defend. (Com. Ex. 17, 18; Kayata Decl. \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In discussions that took place following the October 11, 2013 letter, Hamilton's agent indicated an intent to replace Gilbane's counsel, Marshall Dennehey, with counsel of Hamilton's choosing. (Kayata Decl. \u00b6 20). Liberty Mutual resisted on the basis that Hamilton was subject to a potential conflict of interest, which conflict flowed from the combination of Hamilton's existing representation of Preferred and its recently-expressed position limiting Gilbane's coverage to harm caused by Preferred's negligence. The simultaneous representations, it was argued, might lead Hamilton to characterize the accident as caused solely by Gilbane's negligence. (Kayata Decl. \u00b6 21; Com. Ex. 19). Arguably substantiating these concerns, on January 14, 2014, Hamilton requested, unsuccessfully, that Gilbane \"dismiss the third party complaint that [Gilbane] recently served upon Preferred in order to avoid additional, unnecessary costs for all.\" (Com. Ex. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In mid-2014, Hamilton hinted at a retreat from its reservation of rights. On June 11, 2014, an attorney for Hamilton, Michael Buckley, emailed Liberty Mutual's Senior Technical Claims Specialist, Paul Kayata, stating: \"this email will confirm that my client, [Hamilton], will accept the defense of Gilbane at this point in time, going forward through trial and appeal if necessary, without any limitation. This should also moot the third party claim against Preferred Builders.\" (Com. Ex. 21). That same day, June 11, 2014, Mr. Kayata requested a \"formal coverage opinion letter\" from Mr. Buckley amending the prior coverage position statements of October 11, 2013, and January 14, 2014, to clarify the sequencing of Preferred's excess coverage provisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). No such letter arrived. (Kayata Decl. \u00b6 24). Hamilton's representative witness later testified that Mr. Buckley was not \"authorized to make final claims decisions on behalf of Hamilton for the Siguencia matter ... [or] to issue coverage position letters,\" and that, while Hamilton had agreed to defend Gilbane, it had never agreed to indemnify Gilbane. (Follett Dep. 99, 126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Duty to Defend DASNY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Before the Underlying Action was filed, DASNY had made a pre-action request to\n   Liberty Mutual for additional insured status, which Liberty Mutual \"denied as premature.\" (Ham. Ex. E, J). By letter dated January 28, 2011, Liberty Mutual explained that, \"[u]nless and until the claimant commences a 'suit,' we are not obligated to provide a defense.\" (Ham. Ex. J). Liberty Mutual acknowledged that DASNY \"potentially qualifie[d] as an additional insured under the [Liberty Mutual P]olicy,\" but maintained that the Liberty Mutual coverage was \"limited to liability for 'bodily injury' ... caused in whole or in part by the named insured's acts or omissions,\" and that the Liberty Mutual \"coverage is excess over any other additional insured coverage afforded to [DASNY].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on information it had received about the accident, Liberty Mutual expressed the view that Siguencia's injury was not \"caused in whole or in part by the acts or omissions of Gilbane Building Company or those acting on its behalf\"; that \"it does not appear that Gilbane Building Company had anything to do with the loss\"; and thus that DASNY would not be covered against a claim arising from that incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On October 15, 2013, Hamilton demanded that Liberty Mutual cover DASNY's defense costs on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis. (Ham. Ex. L). Hamilton asserted that, per DASNY's contract with Gilbane, the Liberty Mutual Policy provided primary insurance coverage for DASNY and, further, that as Siguencia's complaint alleged that Gilbane's negligence contributed to the injury, Liberty Mutual had a duty to defend DASNY. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). DASNY formally tendered its defense to Liberty Mutual on June 27, 2014, on the basis that \"Plaintiff's summons and complaint alleges direct claims against Gilbane for negligence[.].\" (Ham. Ex. E). The parties do not dispute that Liberty Mutual \"refused to defend DASNY.\" (Def. 56.1. \u00b6 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On November 13, 2014, Siguencia settled the Underlying Action for $ 2.5 million. (Com. Ex. 10). Hamilton, on behalf of its insured Preferred, paid the $ 1 million limit of its policy, and Preferred's excess insurer paid the remaining $ 1.5 million. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 57-58). Liberty Mutual did not contribute to the settlement, but did pay $ 145,263.30 for Gilbane's legal defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Liberty Mutual brought this action against Hamilton on March 31, 2017, to recover the costs that Liberty Mutual incurred to defend Gilbane in the Underlying Action, plus interest. (Dkt. # 1). In March 2018, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. (Dkt. # 42, 89, 93). Both parties' opposition briefs were filed in April 2018. (Dkt. # 103, 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Pl. Opp. 6). For this proposition, Liberty Mutual relies on\n   <em>\n    Ghaly\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    First Am. Title Ins.

Br. 8). That is, Liberty Mutual must have been aware of its right to demand payment at least by the time Gilbane first tendered its defense to Hamilton on January 3, 2011, substantially outside the limitations window. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Unfortunately for Hamilton, it relies on a New York Court of Appeals decision that clearly cabins its reasoning to the terms of the particular insurance contracts at issue in that dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hahn Automotive Warehouse, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    American Zurich Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5717216\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/765/#p767\">\n    18 N.Y.3d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5717216\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/765/#p767\">\n    944 N.Y.S.2d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5717216\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/765/#p767\">\n    967 N.E.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\"\n   <em>\n    Under the terms of the insurance contracts in this case\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the counterclaims accrued when the insurers had the right to demand payment.\" (emphasis added) ).\n   <em>\n    Ghaly\n   </em>\n   makes clear that, under New York law, a claim for failure to defend accrues when the underlying action terminates. Liberty Mutual's action is therefore timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Hamilton Owed Gilbane a Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As noted, to determine whether the insurer has a duty to defend, courts assess whether the complaint in the underlying action could conceivably state a claim that would be covered under the insurer's policy. \"Whether an insurer has a contractual obligation to defend an action against its insured is a determination of law to be made by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the provisions of the insurance policy[.]\" 70A N.Y. JUR. 2D INSURANCE \u00a7 2122. \"[T]he insurer must defend whenever allegations within the four corners of the complaint suggest ... a reasonable possibility of coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5717216\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/765/#p767\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, the complaint in the Underlying Action alleged that Gilbane was the \"general contractor\" for DASNY's construction project, and that Siguencia was injured by a falling concrete wall panel at the construction site. (Com. Ex. 5). Specifically, the Complaint alleged that \"the device being used to ... move the concrete form ... and other devices, were not constructed, placed, equipped, used and provided, and same were not operated or conducted so as to provide reasonable and adequate\n   protection and safety to the Plaintiff, who was an employee at the site.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). There is no dispute that Siguencia was an employee of Preferred; that Preferred was hired to place and set the concrete wall forms; that the injury occurred at a time when Preferred was the only contractor working in the area; and that Preferred bore the responsibility to supervise the means and methods of its employees' work. (Com. Ex. 3, 5; Ham. Ex. D 17-21, 122).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Hamilton Policy issued to Preferred included an endorsement naming, as an additional insured, \"[a]ny Person or organization [Preferred] agreed to add as additional insured by written contract, prior to an 'occurrence' or offense.\" (Com. Ex. 1). For that additional insured, the Hamilton Policy provided primary coverage \"only with respect to liability arising out of '[Preferred's] work' for that insured by or for [Preferred].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Neither party disputes the classification of Siguencia's injury as arising out of Preferred's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Rather, as Hamilton's representative witness testified, Hamilton initially denied Gilbane's tender because Hamilton determined that the Policy's \"additional insured endorsement required a separate contract\" between Preferred and Gilbane. (Follett Dep. 54-55). Hamilton did not dispute that Preferred's contract with DASNY \"agreed to include the construction manager, which was Gilbane, as an additional insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58). On subsequent review, Hamilton determined that the language of the endorsement in this case did not require a separate \"contract between a named insured and an additional insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55). In other words, Preferred's contract with DASNY was sufficient to trigger the additional insured endorsement coverage for Gilbane under the Hamilton Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Given the lenient standard that any reasonable possibility of coverage activates a duty to defend, the Court has little difficulty concluding that Hamilton owed Gilbane such a duty. The Court recognizes that Hamilton agreed to assume Gilbane's defense with a full reservation of rights, and thereby retained the ability to contest any duty to indemnify Gilbane. However, the Court need not decide whether Hamilton was obliged to indemnify Gilbane against Siguencia's claims; this action concerns only Hamilton's duty to defend Gilbane in the Underlying Action. Hamilton was \"required to provide a defense unless it [could] demonstrate that the allegations of [Siguencia's] complaint cast that pleading solely and entirely within the policy exclusions, and, further, that the allegations,\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   , are subject to no other interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Automobile Ins.

The issue is whether this refusal was justified. Ultimately, the Court finds that it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"[A]n insurer's wrongful refusal to defend causes the insurer to forfeit its right to control the underlying litigation[.]\" 31 N.Y.

This forfeiture of the insurer's right to control the insured's defense is all the more clear when a conflict of interest exists between the insurer and the insured. As but one example, in\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York Central Mutual Fire Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1193905\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/210/829/\">\n    210 A.D.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1193905\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/210/829/\">\n    620 N.Y.S.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Dep't 1994), following a declaratory judgment that the insurer had breached its duty to defend, the insurer sought to replace the insureds' existing counsel with new counsel of the insurer's choosing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 592-93. The Third Department explained that the insurer had \"lost the right to control the action\" through its breach of the duty to defend; that there was a conflict of interest between the insurer and the insureds; and that the insureds were \"entitled to a defense by an attorney of their own choosing, particularly in light of [the insurer's] unjustified refusal to defend them in the underlying action from the outset.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 593 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   , Hamilton initially breached its duty to defend Gilbane, and then sought to replace Gilbane's counsel. Hamilton now argues that when on October 11, 2013, it finally agreed that it had a duty to assume Gilbane's defense, and did so with a full reservation of rights, it had the right to choose Gilbane's counsel. (Com. Ex. 17; Def. Br. 11). Because Liberty Mutual resisted Hamilton's offer due to concerns over Hamilton replacing Gilbane's counsel, Hamilton requests that its liability for Gilbane's defense fees and cost \"be cut[ ]off as of October 11, 2013.\" (Def. Br. 13). Liberty Mutual argues, in response, that the 2013 offer was unacceptable, as Hamilton had no right to choose Gilbane's counsel for at least three reasons: (i) the reservation of rights; (ii) an arguable conflict of interest between Hamilton and Gilbane; and (iii) the specter of prejudice had Gilbane been forced to change counsel more than two years into the Underlying Action. (Pl. Br. 15-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Before examining these three issues, the Court pauses to address the rather curious assertion by Hamilton that it \"did not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   Gilbane to change counsel at all.\" (Def. Br. 16 (emphasis added) ). Hamilton states that, in fact, on October 11, 2013, it offered \"to defend Gilbane with the\n   <em>\n    same counsel\n   </em>\n   (Marshall Dennehey)\". (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Com. Ex. 17) ). Were this assertion factually correct, it would seem to negate arguments advanced by both parties. As it happens, it is entirely contradicted by the record. Hamilton's October 11, 2011 letter states unequivocally, \"[Hamilton] reserves the right to appoint new defense counsel[.]\" (Com. Ex. 17). No reasonable fact finder could interpret that statement to mean that Hamilton was offering to defend Gilbane using Gilbane's existing counsel. The Court is disappointed that Hamilton would argue otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Reservation of Rights\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Regarding the issue of reservation of rights, Hamilton argues, correctly, that an insurer does not waive the right to control the insured's defense merely by undertaking the duty to defend with a full reservation of rights. (Def. Br. 10-11).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Law Offices of Zachary R. Greenhill P.C.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Ins.

Liberty Mutual argues to the contrary that a full reservation of rights regarding a duty to indemnify generally does require waiver of the insurer's right to control the defense and choose counsel. (Pl. Br. 16). However, in making this assertion, Liberty Mutual engages in selective quotation from a sister court in this District; the full quote undermines Liberty Mutual's argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   An insurer's reservation of rights does not automatically entitle its insured to representation of its choice at the insurer's expense.

Liberty Mutual argues from this decision that Hamilton had no right to choose Gilbane's counsel because of a conflict of interest whereby Hamilton \"would be liable only on some of the grounds for which recovery was sought in the Underlying Action,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"only to the extent the liability ... arises out of Preferred Builders' work.\" (Pl. Br. 16; Com. Ex. 17). It posits that this limitation on Hamilton's liability created a conflict: Hamilton \"would not only be less interested in defending liability arising from Gilbane's work; it would want to show that liability arose solely from Gilbane's work - increasing Gilbane's exposure and eliminating Hamilton's exposure both as insurer of Gilbane and as insurer of Preferred.\" (Pl. Br. 16-17). In addition, Liberty Mutual notes that \"Gilbane had cross-claims against and from DASNY, Hamilton's additional insured, and a third-party action for indemnification against Preferred, Hamilton's Named Insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Hamilton contends that the issue of conflict \"is irrelevant\" because, by the time it finally undertook Gilbane's defense, there was no more conflict. (Def. Br. 11-12, 16). Specifically, by October 11, 2013, there was no longer any dispute \"that Preferred Builders was ...\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   responsible for Siguencia's injury\"; that Preferred had no plausible claim against Gilbane; and that Gilbane's sole liability flowed from the\n   negligence of its sub-contractor, Preferred. (Def. Br. 11-12). Hamilton also asserts that Liberty Mutual was aware of the absence of conflict no later than January 28, 2011, and thus had no basis to refuse Hamilton's October 11, 2013 acceptance of the tender of defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). In any event, Hamilton claims, even before the determination of Preferred's sole liability, Hamilton could have obviated the issue by appointing different counsel for Gilbane, which counsel would have been ethically bound to defend Gilbane against all claims independent of Hamilton's coverage position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court agrees with Liberty Mutual. Even if the Court could plausibly determine that the conflict posed by the limitations on Hamilton's liability had evaporated by 2013, Gilbane's cross-claim and third-party action persisted. \"A further justification for representation by attorneys selected by the insureds exists in the instant case by reason of the claims and cross claims of the respondents.... The cross claims indicate true adversity and conflict of interest[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Rimar v. Cont'l Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2978718\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/50/169/\">\n    50 A.D.2d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20N.Y.S.2d%20309\">\n    376 N.Y.S.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313 (4th Dep't 1975). Here, the specter of conflict from the cross-claims and third-party action loomed larger due to Hamilton's repeated, and unsuccessful, attempts to persuade Gilbane to drop those claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Com. Ex. 21). Under these circumstances, the apparent conflict of interest between Hamilton and Gilbane entitled Gilbane to counsel of its own choosing. Thus, Gilbane's refusal to accept Hamilton's offer of defense under the condition of a change of counsel did not absolve Hamilton of its duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Breach and Delay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court concludes that Hamilton remained obligated to defend Gilbane for a separate reason: Hamilton's initial breach of its duty to defend, and its years'-long delay in rectifying that breach before stepping in to assist, waived its right to appoint Gilbane's counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1193905\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/210/829/\">\n    620 N.Y.S.2d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hamilton attempts to evade this conclusion by arguing that Gilbane would not have been prejudiced by having to switch counsel more than two years into the lawsuit because it could have elected to use DASNY's counsel, which had been involved in the matter from the commencement of the Underlying Action, and because the issues in the Underlying Action were so basic that new counsel could have gotten up to speed rapidly. (Def. Br. 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The notion that Gilbane could have selected DASNY's counsel is, once again, belied by the record. As stated above, Hamilton's October 11, 2011 letter is unequivocal that, \"[Hamilton] reserves the right to appoint new defense counsel[.]\" (Com. Ex. 17). Nothing in that letter indicates that Gilbane could choose DASNY's counsel, which counsel would in any event have been conflicted due to DASNY's cross-claim against Gilbane. And Hamilton's suggestion that Gilbane would not have been prejudiced by the switch to entirely new counsel is wholly unpersuasive: Marshall Dennehey had represented Gilbane through years of litigation; Gilbane undoubtedly would have been prejudiced if it had to retain new counsel at so late a stage in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court concludes that Hamilton was liable for Gilbane's defense fees and costs throughout the entirety of the Underlying Action, and that Gilbane's 2013 refusal of Hamilton's belated (and conditional) offer to defend does not terminate that liability. Absent a basis for reduction, Liberty Mutual is entitled to recover from Hamilton the full amount of costs that it incurred in defending Gilbane, plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Hamilton Is Not Entitled to a Set-Off for the Costs It Expended in Defending DASNY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Hamilton argues that a basis for reduction exists - namely, a set-off for the defense costs that Hamilton expended on DASNY. To review, DASNY's contract with Preferred required that Preferred obtain insurance coverage naming both DASNY and Gilbane as additional insureds (which was accomplished in the Hamilton Policy), while DASNY's contract with Gilbane required that Gilbane obtain insurance coverage naming DASNY as an additional insured (which was accomplished in the Liberty Mutual Policy). (Com. Ex. 1-4, 12; Ham. Ex. A). Separate and apart from the dispute over Hamilton's duty to defend Gilbane, this case also presents an issue as to Liberty Mutual's duty to defend DASNY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   It is both undisputed and correct that DASNY qualified as an additional insured under Preferred's Hamilton Policy, which stated that \"[t]o the extent that this insurance is afforded to any additional insured under this policy, such insurance shall apply as primary[.]\" (Com. Ex. 1, 2). Gilbane's Liberty Mutual Policy also contained a provision for additional insureds. (Com. Ex. 4). However, the parties disagree as to whether DASNY qualified as an additional insured under the Liberty Mutual Policy and, if so, whether Liberty Mutual's coverage for DASNY was co-primary or in excess of Hamilton's coverage for DASNY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Co-Primary Versus Excess Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Hamilton argues that both it and Liberty Mutual owed DASNY a duty to defend, that Liberty Mutual refused DASNY's tender, and that Hamilton is thus entitled to a set-off for its costs incurred in defending DASNY. (Def. Br. 17). Liberty Mutual maintains in the first instance that any duty to defend that it owed to DASNY - of which it admits none - would merely have obliged it to provide excess coverage. It points to the \"Other Insurance\" provision of its policy, which states: \"Coverage would be excess ... unless the agreement between the insured and additional insured requires this insurance to be primary.\" (Com. Ex. 4). Liberty Mutual claims that the coverage is excess because no contract exists in which Gilbane agreed to \"provide DASNY with insurance primary as compared to the insurance coverage provided to DASNY as an additional insured by Preferred.\" (Pl. Br. 24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Liberty Mutual's position is belied by the record. As Hamilton points out, the terms of Gilbane's Liberty Mutual policy guaranteed co-primary coverage to DASNY as an additional insured. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. 19). DASNY and Gilbane entered into a contract that required Gilbane to obtain coverage naming DASNY as an additional insured, and required as well that the policy \"be endorsed to be primary as respects the coverage afforded the Additional Insureds[.]\" (Ham. Ex. A2). There is nothing ambiguous about this provision, or about the language in the Liberty Mutual Policy stating that coverage for additional insured is excess \"unless\" the contract between DASNY and Gilbane \"requires this insurance to be primary,\" which it does.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DD 11th Ave., LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harleysville Ins. Co. of N.Y.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272848,4271131\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/129/599/\">\n    129 A.D.3d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20N.Y.S.3d%2048\">\n    12 N.Y.S.3d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (1st Dep't 2015) (holding that an insurer owed primary coverage where the policy's \"additional insured endorsement specifically provides that 'any coverage ... to an additional insured shall be excess ... unless the 'written contract' specifically requires that this insurance be primary ...' and [the named insured] expressly contracted to provide ... primary coverage\"). Accordingly, the Court finds that Liberty Mutual owed a co-primary\n   duty to defend DASNY in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Purported Agreement to Contribute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As a separate justification for a set-off, Hamilton argues that \"the Liberty Mutual adjuster agreed to contribute on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   , co-primary basis.\" (Def. Br. 19). For support, Hamilton points to a March 31, 2015 email from Liberty Mutual's claims adjuster, Paul Kayata, to Hamilton, stating that Liberty Mutual was seeking reimbursement of its costs incurred to defend Gilbane, \"less 50% of ... [Hamilton's] costs to defend DASNY.\" (Ham. Ex. M).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Even were it appropriate for the Court to consider this email - and it is not,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 408 - the Court is not persuaded by Hamilton's reasoning. The email on which Hamilton relies does not establish that Liberty Mutual conceded an obligation to pay 50% of the DASNY defense costs, as opposed to an offer to do so to facilitate collection of its claim against Hamilton for the costs of Gilbane's defense. In an earlier email exchange dated March 18, 2015, Kayata asserted that Liberty Mutual's official position was that Hamilton was required \"to pay the full costs to defend this case.\" (Ham. Ex. M). There is no indication of a change of position as to coverage; Liberty Mutual appears merely to offer to share the costs of DASNY's defense to facilitate settlement of its claim for the costs of Gilbane's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The $ 250,000 Deductible\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The terms of the Liberty Mutual Policy, combined with the terms of DASNY's contract with Gilbane, obliged Liberty Mutual to provide co-primary coverage for DASNY's defense. In theory, therefore, Liberty Mutual should share the defense costs advanced by Hamilton to DASNY. Liberty Mutual seeks to escape this conclusion with two arguments, one of which proves to be successful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Liberty Mutual maintains that it has no obligation to pay for DASNY's defense costs because those costs fall within the Liberty Mutual Policy's $ 250,000 deductible for \"supplementary payments,\" which are the responsibility of the insured. (Pl. Br. 19-20). In Liberty Mutual's view, its obligation to defend DASNY would not apply until the costs of the defense exceeded the deductible amount, which has not occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hamilton rejoins that the $ 250,000 deductible \"is irrelevant\" because Liberty Mutual was obliged to provide \"primary\" coverage for DASNY, an obligation that Hamilton contends would be breached were Hamilton to bear the sole responsibility for the first $ 250,000 of DASNY's defense. (Def. Br. 22). Put differently, Hamilton's position is that the existence of the deductible breaches Liberty Mutual's obligation to provide primary coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Liberty Mutual has the better of the argument. \"[I]n establishing a pecking order among multiple insurers covering the same risk ... [New York case law has] recognized the right of each insurer to rely upon the terms of its own contract with its insured.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LiMauro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20N.Y.2d%20369\">\n    65 N.Y.2d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372-73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=492%20N.Y.S.2d%20534\">\n    492 N.Y.S.2d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20N.E.2d%2013\">\n    482 N.E.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). Accordingly,\n   Liberty Mutual is entitled to rely on the terms of its contract with DASNY, which exclude coverage for the first $ 250,000 in costs. To force Liberty Mutual to pay costs of DASNY's defense prior to the exhaustion of that $ 250,000 deductible would contravene the plain meaning of its contract with DASNY. To be sure, an insurer\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   is obligated to reimburse [another insurer] for half of its costs in defending ... the parties' mutual insured ... pursuant to identical \"other insurance\" provisions contained in the parties' general liability insurance policies,\n   <em>\n    which are identical\n   </em>\n   and insure against the same risk, thereby requiring each insurer to contribute in proportion to its limit amount of insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Indem.

(Pl. Br. 22). For support, Liberty Mutual points to\n   <em>\n    Wassau Underwriters Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gamma\n   </em>\n   , USA, Inc., No. 708796/2015 (Sup. Ct. Queens Cty., May 6, 2016), an unpublished trial court decision currently on appeal to the Second Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 n.11). In point of fact,\n   <em>\n    Wassau\n   </em>\n   does not clarify the issue because in that case, the court held that the anti-subrogation rule barred an insurer's claim against subcontractors whom the insurer was obliged to defend. (Pl. Br. App. 3 (\"[D]ue to Tishman's obligation to defend the subcontractors, the anti-subrogation rule bars these claims against the subcontractors[.]\") ). Here, in sharp contrast, Hamilton pursues a claim not against its own additional insured, but rather against the co-primary insurer of that additional insured. The difference is meaningful. The fact that Liberty Mutual's deductible would pass the cost of Hamilton's claim against Liberty Mutual\n   on to Gilbane does not mean that Hamilton is pursuing a claim against Gilbane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In sum, Hamilton's arguments in favor of set-off, while thoughtful, are unable to overcome the deductible endorsement to the Liberty Mutual Policy. As such, Hamilton is not entitled to a set-off from Liberty Mutual for its costs incurred in defending DASNY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For the reasons stated in this Opinion, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED and Defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
