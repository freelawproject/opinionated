Plaintiffs allege that the Alabama congressional redistricting plan violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege a constitutional violation. Section 2 does not require challenges brought under its authority to be heard by a three-judge panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant first raised this jurisdictional question in his \"Notice of Jurisdictional Issue\" on July 9, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 12). On November 2, 2018, Defendant filed his \"Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\" in which he contends that this court lacks jurisdiction because a three-judge panel must hear this case. (Doc. 27). Plaintiffs filed \"Plaintiffs' Brief in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\" on November 30, 2018. (Doc. 31). On December 21, 2018, Defendant filed \"Secretary of State John Merrill's Reply in Support of His Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Doc. 27).\" (Doc. 37). On January 16, 2019, this court held a motion hearing on the issue of whether a three-judge panel must hear this case. (Doc. 35). The jurisdictional issue is now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are eight African-American citizens of Alabama. One Plaintiff resides in Congressional District (CD) 1, one resides in CD 2, one resides in CD 3, and five reside in CD 7. The redistricting plan currently used in Alabama, Senate Bill 484, allegedly \"packs\" African-American voters into CD 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 484, 2011 Reg. Sess. (Ala. 2011). The Alabama legislature established CD 7 as a majority-minority district following the 1982 Amendments of the Voting Rights Act. Nearly one-third of Alabama's African-American population falls into CD 7. Prior to the passage of S.B. 484, the black voting age population (BVAP) of CD 7 was 58.33%. Now, the CD 7 BVAP is 60.91%. Plaintiffs argue that S.B. 484 moved African-American voters from predominantly white districts into CD 7 to \"pack\" the district designated as a majority-minority district with African-American voters. The plan also allegedly \"cracks\" African-American voters in CDs 1, 2, and 3 by splitting among three districts those African-American voters who could be grouped together in a second majority-minority district. Plaintiffs contend that the African-American population in these districts could be united to form a second majority-minority CD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs only raise a Section 2 violation of the Voting Rights Act, alleging vote dilution. They do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   raise a constitutional challenge to the redistricting plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant requests a three-judge panel under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202284\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant concedes that this case does not fall within the express language of \u00a7 2284's requirements for a three-judge panel. But Defendant argues that Plaintiffs selectively brought only a statutory claim precisely to avoid a three-judge panel, and, because the statutory claim is so similar to the corresponding constitutional claim Plaintiffs deliberately omitted, a three-judge panel should still hear the case. Further, Defendant maintains that the legislative history behind\n   the 1976 amendments to \u00a7 2284 and the policies behind \u00a7 2284 coupled with the Voting Rights Act lean in favor of convening a three-judge panel to hear this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that this case should not go to a three-judge panel because \u00a7 2284(a) plainly states that a three-judge panel shall only be convened when challenging the\n   <em>\n    constitutionality\n   </em>\n   of the apportionment of congressional districts or \"when otherwise required by Act of Congress.\" Plaintiffs maintain that \"the plaintiff [is] the master of the claim,\" so the court should honor their decision not to bring a constitutional challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beneficial Nat'l Bank v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, the parties do not contest whether a federal court may hear this case, but whether a three-judge panel must hear this case. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202284\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \"a district court of three judges shall be convened when otherwise required by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.\" If the court determines that the case must be heard by a three-judge panel, \"the judge to whom the request is presented shall ... immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202284\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2284(b)(1). If a three-judge panel is convened, a single judge may not enter a judgment on the merits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202284\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2284(b)(3). So, this court must determine the jurisdictional question of whether this case is properly before a single judge before the case can continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On its face, Plaintiffs' complaint only brings an action under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act-not under the 14th or 15th Amendments, which often accompany Section 2 causes of action; not under any other constitutional provision; and not under any act of Congress that \"otherwise require[s]\" a three-judge court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A claim solely alleging a Section 2 violation falls outside a plain reading of \u00a7 2284. Such a claim is neither a constitutional challenge nor \"when otherwise required by Act of Congress.\" A few provisions in the Voting Rights Act require a three-judge panel to hear certain actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Voting Rights Act of 1965,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2010303\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), 10304(a) (2012) (requiring a three-judge panel to hear Section 4 challenges and Section 5 challenges). But no provision of the Voting Rights Act requires a violation of Section 2 to go to a three-judge panel. So, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act cannot be considered \"when otherwise required by Act of Congress\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   within \u00a7 2284(a) to require a three-judge panel for this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties agree that a strict reading of the text of \u00a7 2284 excludes a Section 2 Voting Rights Act challenge-without a corresponding constitutional challenge-from the requirement to be heard by a three-judge panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant recognizes that Plaintiffs' complaint only asserts a claim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and not a constitutional violation. Defendant also recognizes that in 1976, when Congress amended \u00a7 2284, Congress made the amendments to\n   <em>\n    limit\n   </em>\n   the number of cases requiring a three-judge panel. And Defendant recognizes that \u00a7 2284 plainly reads: \"A district court of three judges shall be convened when otherwise required by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of the congressional districts or the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But Defendant wants this court to read beyond the plain text of the statute. Defendant wants this court\n   <em>\n    to read into\n   </em>\n   Section 2 a requirement that such a challenge\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   go to a three-judge panel, or\n   <em>\n    to strike\n   </em>\n   \"constitutional\" from the requirements to invoke a three-judge panel in \u00a7 2284. The court sees no need to go beyond the text of Section 2 or \u00a7 2284 when their plain meanings are so clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the Supreme Court noted long ago, \"when words are free from doubt they must be taken as the final expression of the legislative intent .... In other words, the language being plain, and not leading to absurd or wholly impracticable consequences, it is the sole evidence of the ultimate legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Caminetti v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3934939\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/242/470/#p490\">\n    242 U.S. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 490,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3934939\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/242/470/#p490\">\n    37 S.Ct. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3934939\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/242/470/#p490\">\n    61 L.Ed. 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1917). Canons of construction cannot be used \"to create ambiguity where the statute's text and structure suggest none.\"\n   <em>\n    Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p227\">\n    552 U.S. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p227\">\n    128 S.Ct. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p227\">\n    169 L.Ed.2d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Here, the court can find no ambiguity on the face of \u00a7 2284. Because the statute is unambiguous, the court sees no reason to go beyond the text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Even assuming the court had free rein to look beyond the text, Defendant's arguments for doing so fail. Defendant contends that the court should read into \u00a7 2284 congressional intent to include Section 2 challenges in addition to constitutional challenges to congressional and statewide legislative apportionment plans as matters to be heard by a three-judge panel. To do so, Defendant relies on a Justice Scalia quote: \"This canon [of reading a statute fairly] follows inevitably from the facts that (1) interpretation always depends on context, (2) context always includes evident purpose, and (3) evident purpose always includes effectiveness.\" Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law\n   </em>\n   63 (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant argues that \"when Congress last amended \u00a7 2284(a), it had no idea that in the future there would be a statutory claim for vote dilution.\" (Doc. 37 at 6). Defendant cites to a Senate Report from the 1976 amendments to \u00a7 2284 as evidence that Congress would have intended for Section 2 violations to be heard by a three-judge panel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The Senate Report explains that \"[t]he bill preserves three-judge courts for cases involving congressional reapportionment ... because it is the judgment of the committee that these issues are of such importance that they ought to be heard by a three-judge court.\" S. Rep. No. 94-204, at 9 (1976). And, as noted by Defendant in the motion hearing, Congress designed the panel format \"to lend greater dignity to the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Michael E. Solimine,\n   <em>\n    The Three-Judge District Court in Voting Rights Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.%20Mich.%20J.L.%20Reform%2079\">\n    30 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court recognizes Defendant's point that, when Congress amended \u00a7 2284 in 1976, litigators did not yet understand that congressional apportionment plans could be challenged under Section 2, and so Congress did not know at that time that \u00a7 2284 could subsequently be used to prevent Section 2 challenges from being heard by three-judge panels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Page v. Bartels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11101367\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/175/#p189\">\n    248 F.3d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"[I]n 1976 ... \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act was not available to litigants seeking to challenge apportionment. At that time, apportionment challenges were generally constitutional in nature.\"). Nevertheless, Congress\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have so amended Section 2 had it desired to send those cases invoking it to a three-judge court. But currently, \u00a7 2284 and Section 2 -reading them together and separately-do not provide three-judge panels for purely statutory Section 2 challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Congress has reviewed both the statutes since the 1976 amendments of \u00a7 2284. In 1976, Congress amended \u00a7 2284 to read as it does today. Act of Aug. 12, 1976, Pub. L.

And in 1982, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act so that Section 2 reads as it does today. Act of June 29, 1982, Pub.

That amendment changed the numbering of subsections and revised the declaratory judgment proceedings under Section 2, but did not amend Section 2 to place cases brought solely under its authority within the \"otherwise required by Act of Congress\" provision in \u00a7 2284. In 1984, Congress amended \u00a7 2284 for a second time, but did not change subsection (a). Act of Nov. 9, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-620, sec. 402, \u00a7 29(e),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%203335\">\n    98 Stat. 3335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3359.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When Congress amended Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, it could have amended-but did not-the Voting Rights Act to add a provision directing all Section 2 challenges to be heard by a three-judge panel. Even beyond 1982, Congress could have amended the Voting Rights Act at any point between 1976 and the present to add such a provision. That is, Congress could amend the statute to send the case to a three-judge panel \"as otherwise required by Act of Congress\" pursuant to \u00a7 2284.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Perhaps Defendant forgot that Congress revisited both statutes since the 1976 amendments to \u00a7 2284 and could have addressed the subsequent use of Section 2 of which-according to Defendant-Congress \"had no idea\" in 1976. (Doc. 37 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court must presume that Congress knows the laws it has enacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cannon v.

Several cases alleging only Section 2 violations have been heard by single judges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rural W. Tenn. African-American Affairs Council v.

So this court will apply the law before it and will not read new provisions into-or strike existing words from-the statutes at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As Justice Scalia wrote, \"Context always matters. Let us not forget, however,\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   context matters: It is a tool for understanding the terms of the law, not an excuse for rewriting them.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

The court refuses to write into \u00a7 2284 or into Section 2 a provision requiring complaints alleging Section 2 violations to be heard by a three-judge panel-or alternatively striking \"constitutional\" from \u00a7 2284-so that all apportionment challenges, statutory and constitutional, must be heard by a three-judge panel. If Defendant believes that Congress has made an oversight in amending \u00a7 2284 or Section 2 -and perhaps requiring Section 2 challenges to be heard by a three-judge panel would make sense-he can raise that issue with the governmental branch charged with drafting and enacting the law. This court adheres to the principle that \"the proper role of the judiciary [is] to apply, not amend, the work of the People's representatives.\"\n   <em>\n    Henson v.

Because Plaintiffs' complaint raises a challenge only under Section 2, which is not a constitutional challenge to an apportionment plan or an act of Congress requiring a three-judge panel, the court cannot send this case to a three-judge panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the reasons discussed above and at the hearing on January 16, 2019, the court will DENY Defendant's motion for a judgment on the pleadings as to the jurisdictional issue. (Doc. 27). This case will remain before this one judge, who will proceed with as much dignity as possible and as necessary given the nature of this case. The court will enter a separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. Now that the court has expressed confidence in its jurisdiction, the court will move on to separately rule on the remaining issues raised in Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 29th day of January, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a \"notice\" as an appropriate motion of pleading or filing, and Defendant's \"notice\" did not ask the court to take any action, the court didevaluate its jurisdiction without formally addressing the issue in writing. Because Plaintiffs did not assert a constitutional claim, the undersigned determined that the statutory claim did not trigger a three-judge court under \u00a7 2284. By contrast, Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings does ask the court to openly address the jurisdictional question, so the court now reviews its jurisdiction for a second time in this Memorandum Opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
