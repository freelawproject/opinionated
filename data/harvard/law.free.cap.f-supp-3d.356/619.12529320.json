Defendant, a citizen of Mexico, was indicated on one count of illegal reentry after removal in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant moves to dismiss the Indictment on the ground that the prior removal order was invalid and void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   because the immigration judge that issued the order lacked \"jurisdiction\" to do so. That is, in turn, because, he says, the charging document in the removal proceeding was deficient as it omitted the date and time of removal hearing.

That conviction triggered removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 17, 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") served a \"Notice to Appear\" (\"NTA\") on Defendant. Pursuant to Section 237(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\" or \"Act\"), as amended, the NTA charged him as removable for having committed an aggravated felony as defined in Section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NTA did not specify the date and time of his removal hearing, but instead ordered him to appear before an immigration judge in El Paso, Texas (\"IJ\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DHS filed the NTA with the Immigration Court in El Paso.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 3, 2002, that court issued a \"Notice of Hearing\" (\"NOH\") containing the date, time, and place of the initial hearing and served it on Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the hearing date was rescheduled four times at the request of Defendant's counsel, the hearing finally took place in September 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the hearing, Defendant and his counsel were present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IJ ordered Defendant removed from the United States, and Defendant waived his right to appeal this order to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, Defendant submitted an Application for Stay of Removal and a Request for Prosecutorial Discretion, but they were denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 15, 2002, Defendant was removed from the United States to Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   More recently, on July 11, 2018, a grand jury sitting in El Paso, Texas, returned a single-count Indictment (ECF No. 10) charging Defendant with illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It further holds that jurisdiction (as interpreted in Part II.
