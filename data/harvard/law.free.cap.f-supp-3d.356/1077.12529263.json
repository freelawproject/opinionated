AR 965. She wrote in a letter to the state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) that plaintiff had \"dissociative episodes\" almost daily where she \"loses attention and is easily distracted from even simple tasks such as cooking a meal. Needless to say, this will be problematical in most work settings.... She is extremely distrustful of other people [which] often manifests as anger and leaving the situation.\" AR 431. Ms. Sterchi also provided a medical source statement in July 2017. AR 965-70. Ms. Sterchi opined that plaintiff would have daily problems with staying on task for two-hour intervals and would be absent from work more than once a week due to \"episodes of dissociation.\" AR 966-67. If required to work full time, plaintiff\n   would be unable to work in coordination with or proximity to others at least 20% of the time, interact appropriately with the public, or respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors. AR 968. When under stress, plaintiff would have socially unacceptable \"anger outbursts\" at work. AR 968. Plaintiff would cease to be able to function effectively if required to get to work at a particular time, perform even simple repetitive tasks, or be supervised. AR 969. Ms. Sterchi also testified at the October 2017 hearing. Ms. Sterchi observes dissociation \"from the look in their eyes, ... there's this guardedness, [a] sort of blank milkiness sometimes....\" AR 68. Because her treatment of plaintiff involves bringing up traumatic memories, plaintiff \"appears to be in a somewhat disassociated state much of the time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180481\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1154/#p1161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Sterchi testified that, according to current research, dissociative episodes are triggered by \"a trauma memory\" and cause a flood of endogenous opioids, essentially \"sedat[ing]\" the person \"to cope with the distress....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180481\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1154/#p1161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that state, a person \"can't think straight, ... can't, sometimes, do simple tasks, remember instructions for simple tasks.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180481\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1154/#p1161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"[J]ust asking her to ... do something can, at times, trigger the disassociation....\" AR 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before Ms. Sterchi testified at the hearing, the ALJ asked plaintiff's counsel to \"please be brief because ... this is not an acceptable medical source. I know they have their heart in the right place, but I don't really find I give much weight to therapists.\" AR 66. Plaintiff asserts that \"[t]his comment was improper.\" Dkt 9 at 13. Plaintiff implies that the ALJ discounted Ms. Sterchi's opinions in part because she is not an acceptable medical source, but that was not one of the reasons the ALJ provided in his decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 31. Plaintiff does not otherwise argue that the ALJ's comment establishes reversible error, and the Court will not address it further.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carmickle v. Comm'r, Soc. Sec.

AR 31. Conflict with a claimant's activities \"may justify rejecting a treating provider's opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Ghanim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180481\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1154/#p1161\">\n    763 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Dissociation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The ALJ found that plaintiff's file from the state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) \"document[ed] a consistent stream of courteous and effective communication between the claimant and her case managers.\" AR 29-30. These courteous communications are emails, which are not face-to-face interactions where dissociation would even be detectable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 355, 368, 375-76. It is worth noting that in plaintiff's intake meeting, her case manager described her as \"guarded\" and, in a later meeting, observed that plaintiff \"appeared quite overwhelmed\" during a discussion of community college programs. AR 390. These descriptions are consistent with Ms. Sterchi's testimony. The DVR records do not contradict Ms. Sterchi's opinions and are not a germane reason to discount them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Dog Walking\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the hearing, Ms. Sterchi was aware of plaintiff's attempt to work part-time as a dog walker and testified \"I think she only lasted two or three days.\" AR 69-70. Plaintiff testified that the job was for two or three hours, about three days a week. AR 49. Asked how long the job lasted, plaintiff testified \"I think I stretched it out to like three or four weeks because I said I was out of town and gave some excuses for why I couldn't go. I was trying to get myself back together so I could keep working.\" AR 49. In other words, while plaintiff may have been considered an employee for three or four weeks, she did not go to work for much of that time. Plaintiff's dog-walking activities thus do not contradict Ms. Sterchi's opinions and are not a germane reason to discount them. In any case, whether plaintiff's work attempt failed after three days or three weeks, the failed work attempt does not undermine Ms. Sterchi's opinions that plaintiff could not maintain employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lingenfelter v.

David Widlan, Ph.D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After a February 2016 examination, Dr. Widlan opined that plaintiff would have marked,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , very significant, limitations in her abilities to adapt to changes in a routine work setting, communicate and perform effectively in a work setting, and complete a normal work day and work week without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms. AR 822. The ALJ gave Dr. Widlan's opinions \"limited weight\" as inconsistent with plaintiff's activities because plaintiff contacted community college programs, regularly attended therapy with Ms. Sterchi, and emailed \"proper[ly] and courteous[ly]\" with her DVR case managers. AR 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Contacting community colleges is not an activity inconsistent with Dr. Widlan's opinions. The ALJ seems to suggest that contacting programs means that plaintiff believed she could complete a program. However, even if Dr. Widlan's opinions were inconsistent with plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    beliefs\n   </em>\n   about what activities she could successfully engage in, his opinions were not inconsistent with plaintiff's actual\n   <em>\n    activities.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The record shows that plaintiff attended therapy with Ms. Sterchi for about 60 minutes once a week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 789-812. This is not inconsistent with Dr. Widlan's opinion that plaintiff was limited in her ability to attend work for eight hours a day, five days a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's ability to email with her case managers does not contradict Dr. Widlan's opinion that plaintiff would be limited in her ability to communicate face-to-face in a work setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Commissioner argues that Dr. Widlan's opinions could be rejected because \"Plaintiff's vocational rehabilitation case worker thought that she was so functional that she should 'enroll full-time once she begins schooling.' \" Dkt. 12 at 2 (quoting AR 390). This (1) is an improper post-hoc argument, (2) misrepresents the record, and (3) is not a specific and legitimate reason to discount Dr. Widlan's opinions. First, the ALJ did not employ such reasoning. Second, the record shows that the vocational rehabilitation counselor \"told [plaintiff] that I would ex[pect] her to enroll\n   full-time once she begins schooling.\" AR 390. There is no indication that such an expectation is based on the counselor's evaluation of plaintiff's functioning. Third, even if it were, the counselor's evaluation, with no supporting evidence and no medical expertise, is not a specific and legitimate reason to discount the conflicting opinions of an acceptable medical source. The Commissioner's argument is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The ALJ provided no specific and legitimate reason and, accordingly, erred in discounting Dr. Widlan's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Faulder Colby, Ph.D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Colby reviewed Dr. Widlan's and Ms. Sterchi's reports and some of plaintiff's medical records. AR 830. Dr. Colby concurred with Dr. Widlan's opined limitations.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR 831, 822. The ALJ gave Dr. Colby's opinions \"some weight only\" because they were based on reports that the ALJ discounted. AR 32. Because the ALJ erred in discounting Dr. Widlan's and Ms. Sterchi's opinions, the ALJ also erred in discounting Dr. Colby's opinions on the grounds that they were based on Dr. Widlan's and Ms. Sterchi's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Commissioner argues that the ALJ also rejected Dr. Colby's opinions in favor of the opinions of examining doctor M. Liddell, M.D. Dkt. 12 at 4. However, the ALJ did not identify how Dr. Liddell's opinions contradicted Dr. Colby's. In fact, both agreed that plaintiff's impairments would cause limitations in her ability to complete a normal work day and work week. AR 895, 831. Some unspecified conflict with Dr. Liddell's opinions was not a specific and legitimate reason to discount Dr. Colby's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court concludes the ALJ erred by discounting Dr. Colby's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The ALJ largely accepted Dr. Liddell's opinions, giving them \"appropriate weight,\" but noted that Dr. Liddell only \"limited\"-not \"precluded\"-completing workdays and workweeks and managing usual stress. AR 32. In this respect, Dr. Liddell's opinions are consistent with the other medical opinions in the record. Dr. Widlan and Dr. Colby opined \"marked\"-meaning \"very significant\"-limitations on plaintiff's ability to complete a normal work day and work week. AR 821-22, 831. They did not check the boxes for \"severe\"-meaning an \"inability\"-to complete a normal work day and work week.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2947754\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/1028/#p1038\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Liddell did not opine a specific level of limitation, which makes his opinions less helpful than the others'.

Dr. Breen wrote that plaintiff \"needs a job that is somewhat lower in demand than her intellectual abilities would predict and not highly paced.... If she is able to handle about half-time work for a period of time, then looking towards training might be appropriate to enhance her skills.\" AR 838. Plaintiff interprets this as Dr. Breen's opinion that plaintiff was restricted from full-time or highly paced work. Dkt. 9 at 4. However, the context of Dr. Breen's report is developing a treatment plan, not opining as to plaintiff's long-term limitations. Before the excerpt that plaintiff cited, Dr. Breen stated: \"I think that perhaps the best way of helping her is to first put her to work, see if she can tolerate routine work, and then look towards training. Investing in training before we know she is going to persist at work may not be fruitful.\" AR 838. In context, Dr. Breen's statements do not establish limitations on plaintiff's long-term or permanent abilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1509\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416.909 (\"your impairment ... must have lasted or be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months\"). After his proposed treatment was completed, his opinions of plaintiff's abilities may have changed. The Court concludes the ALJ did not err by failing to address Dr. Breen's statements as opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702935\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1217/#p1223\">\n    613 F.3d 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1223 (9th Cir. 2010) (ALJ need not provide reasons for rejecting a doctor's statements that do not specify work-related functional limitations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    F. State Agency Reviewing Doctors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In considering plaintiff's applications for benefits initially and on reconsideration, state agency nonexamining doctors Renee Eisenhauer, Ph.D., and Michael Regets, Ph.D., opined that plaintiff \"would do best in a stable, low pressure work setting with clear expectations of the work to be performed.\" AR 96, 125. The ALJ gave their opinions \"significant weight.\" AR 32. Plaintiff argues the ALJ erred by failing to include a limitation in the RFC to work that is low pressure with clear expectations. Dkt. 9 at 17. Clear expectations are accounted for by the RFC limitation to \"simple routine repetitive tasks....\" AR 28. Once the simple, routine tasks have been explained, the expectation is clearly to simply repeat them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court concludes the ALJ did not err in incorporating the state agency doctors' opinions into the RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's final decision is REVERSED and this case is REMANDED for further administrative proceedings under sentence four of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On remand, the ALJ should reevaluate the opinions of Ms. Sterchi, Dr. Widlan, Dr. Colby, and Dr. Liddell, reassessing the RFC as appropriate and proceeding to step five as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 416.920.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    20 C.F.R.

This does not appear to be an additional reason, and the Commissioner does not address it in her brief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 12 at 4-5. The Court will not address it further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
