This clause, however, is not\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   for Congress to switch on and off at its convenience the fundamental constitutional rights to Due Process and Equal Protection enjoyed by a birthright United States citizen who relocates from a State to Puerto Rico. Congress, likewise, cannot demean and brand said United States citizen while in Puerto Rico with a stigma of inferior citizenship to that of his brethren nationwide. To hold otherwise would run afoul of the sacrosanct principle embodied in the Declaration of Independence that \"All Men are Created Equal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are defendant Jose Luis Vaello-Madero and plaintiff United States' motions for Summary Judgment. (Docket Nos. 57, 59). Vaello Madero contends he is not required to return the payments he received in Social Security Income (\"SSI\") disability benefits upon changing his domicile to Puerto Rico since excluding a United States citizen residing in the territory from receiving the same runs afoul of the equal protection guarantees of the Due Process Clause. In turn, the United States posits that limiting SSI eligibility to residents of the fifty states and the District of Columbia is constitutionally permissible. Based on the foregoing analysis, Vaello-Madero's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and the United States' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts of this case are undisputed and have been jointly proposed by both parties. (Docket No. 51 at pages 2-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vaello-Madero resided in New York between 1985-2013. While there, he received SSI disability benefits, which were deposited into his New York bank account. In July 2013, he moved to Puerto Rico, and continued to receive SSI disability payments in his New York bank account until August 2016. Vaello-Madero was unaware that his relocation would affect his SSI disability entitlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vaello-Madero learned he was ineligible for SSI payments in June 2016. Via two notices that summer, the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") stopped its SSI payments, and retroactively reduced said payments to $ 0 for August 2013 through August 2016. The notices informed Vaello-Madero that the SSA could contact him \"about any payments we previously made,\" but did not inform him that he would have to return the amount of benefits collected while in Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 25, 2017, the United States commenced the current civil action against Vaello-Madero to collect $ 28,081.00 in overpaid SSI benefits received following his relocation from United States mainland to territory. Surprisingly, the United States moved for voluntary dismissal of its claims against Vaello-Madero claiming lack of jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), on the ground that the SSA's administrative requirements had not been met. (Docket No. 23). Vaello-Madero filed an opposition to the voluntary dismissal arguing that the dismissal \"raises the prospect that the United States might be trying to abandon its chosen forum in response to what it might perceive as a serious setback.\" (Docket No. 25 at 12). The Court agreed with Vaello-Madero, finding that since the United States brought suit, the Court had \"broad jurisdictional power\" to entertain the same. (Docket No. 36 at 3).\n   <em>\n    United States v. Vaello-Madero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525496\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/370/\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.P.R. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In support of his motion for summary judgment, Vaello-Madero argues that the Social Security Act's exclusion of Puerto Rico from the SSI benefits program under section 1382c(e) thereof violates the equal\n   protection guarantees of the Due Process Clause. The United States argues, in turn, that Congress' determinations as to eligibility requirements for government benefits hold a strong presumption of constitutionality. Furthermore, the United States claims that Congress' authority under the Territorial Clause enables it to pass economic and social welfare legislation for the territories where there is a rational basis for such actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Oral arguments were held on December 20, 2018 at the Luis A. Ferr\u00e9 Courthouse in Ponce, Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 88). Besides the parties, the Commonwealth, as well as the sole representative in Congress from Puerto Rico, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, as\n   <em>\n    amici curiae\n   </em>\n   , participated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the salient facts are not in controversy, and the issue at bar rather is entirely a legal-constitutional one, the Court shall directly proceed to address its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Today's ruling will not delve into the complex constitutional issues of Puerto Rico as a territory of the United States for the past 120 years. Instead, the Court's analysis will focus exclusively on Vaello-Madero's defense regarding the constitutionality of the restitution sought by the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Social Security Act and Supplemental Disability Benefits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The SSI program was created to aid the Nation's aged, blind, and disabled persons who qualify due to proven economic need.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201382\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Docket No. 59 at 1). Aside from the fact that the cost is minimal compared to the government's budget for such program, this is not a valid justification for creating classifications of United States citizens and justifying the same under the lax scrutiny of social and economic legislation.

As such, federal legislation that creates a citizenship apartheid based on historical and social ethnicity within United States soil goes against this very concept. It is in the Court's responsibility to protect these rights if the other branches do not. Allowing a United States citizen in Puerto Rico that is poor and disabled to be denied SSI disability payments creates an impermissible second rate citizenship akin to that premised on race and amounts to Congress switching off the Constitution. All United States citizens must trust that their fundamental constitutional rights will be safeguarded everywhere within the Nation, be in a State or Territory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
