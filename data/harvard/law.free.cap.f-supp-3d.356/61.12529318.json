While the Report does contain some language suggesting that portions of it are binding, the Report's preface states only that it \"outlines the current and envisioned state of Federal IT, and it provides specific recommendations to jumpstart a new wave of modernization efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization, 2, available at https://itmodernization.cio.gov/assets/report/Report%20to%20the%20President%20on%20IT%20Modernization%20-%20Final.pdf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather than mandating changes for other agencies, the Report's preface indicates that the Report is meant to provide recommendations. And, many of those recommendations specifically request that \"the President direct the implementation of the plan outlined\" by the Report.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 12, 16. Merely providing policy recommendations for the President to direct does not establish the substantial independence of the OAI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rushforth v. Council of Econ.

But, Plaintiffs' contention that the OAI assisted the President in drafting this legislation is similarly unavailing. Providing advice and recommendations to the President in drafting legislation is not a responsibility which affords an entity substantial independence. Rather, assistance in drafting legislation is the sort of responsibility which would be given to an entity whose role is to assist and advise the President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soucie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"803720,3583983\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/448/1067/\">\n    448 F.2d at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that an entity is not an agency if its sole function is to assist the President).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' reliance on the OAI's work with the Department of Veterans Affairs to address interoperability issues is also misplaced. Assuming that the OAI did \"work with\" the Department, Plaintiffs fail to allege that the OAI's actions were taken independent of the President or that the OAI did more than assist the Department in implementing the President's initiatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046512,3695051\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/553/\">\n    90 F.3d at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"to the extent that the NSC assists the President in coordinating the activities of the various agencies with national security responsibilities, it exercises no authority of its own\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs' assertion that the OAI has supplanted the OSTP is conclusory. Plaintiffs provide no support for the contention that the OAI has taken over the \"independent\" functions which were previously exercised by the OSTP. And, the Court will not assume that the OAI has taken over those \"independent\" functions, especially given that the OAI's sole mission is to \"make recommendations to the\n   President.\" 2017 Presidential Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition to the OAI's alleged responsibility for evaluating and directing the modernization of federal technology systems, Plaintiffs also contend that the OAI's role in developing and implementing the federal infrastructure plan demonstrates that the OAI wields substantial independence from the President. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 42-46. Plaintiffs allege that, in concert with the Department of Transportation, the Department of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Infrastructure Council, the OAI has \"worked to develop the government's infrastructure plan, including leading at least some portions of the plan's development.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But, even if the Court credits Plaintiffs' allegation that the \"OAI aided in the development\" of the federal infrastructure plan, participation in that task does not establish substantial independence from the President.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. After all, according to the plan itself which was referenced in Plaintiffs' Complaint, the White House, not the OAI released the plan.

If anything, assisting the White House in developing policies such as the federal infrastructure plan strengthens the argument that the OAI's primary function is to assist and advise the President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875099,3810742\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/1288/\">\n    981 F.2d at 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that a committee which made recommendations to the President \"concerning significant proposed regulations\" was not an agency under FOIA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs argue that the OAI's work with the \"Centers of Excellence\" establishes that the OAI is substantially independent from the President. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 47-52. The Centers of Excellence are used to spread best practices between federal agencies in order to improve quality and consistency in technology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Plaintiffs allege that the Centers of Excellence \"have evaluative and directorial authority over other agencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Plaintiffs contend that the OAI's authority over the Centers of Excellence establishes the OAI's independence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   But, Plaintiffs fail to name any source granting the OAI authority over the Centers of Excellence. Plaintiffs admit that the General Services Administration (\"GSA\") created the Centers of Excellence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. While Plaintiffs allege that the OAI directed the GSA to create the Centers for Excellence, Plaintiffs provide no support for this conclusory allegation. Plaintiffs further allegation that the OAI directed the GSA to undertake other reorganizations, such as creating the Technology Transformation Services and establishing a new Commissioner, similarly fails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. According to the GSA Press Release cited in Plaintiffs' Complaint, the GSA decided to undertake these reorganizations in order to be \"[c]onsistent with [its] vision\" of \"being a leading force in the campaign to modernize the federal government.\" Press Release, GSA, GSA Merges Technology and Acquisition (June 7, 2017)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-merges-technology-and-acquisition (cited in Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 49 n.21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the GSA acknowledges that the reorganization will make it \"better able to leverage its expertise and assets in support of the White House and its Office of American Innovation,\" nowhere does the GSA claim that the reorganization was directed or managed by the OAI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And, the GSA's statement that the reorganization was conducted in order to be \"[c]onsistent with [its] vision\" implies that the reorganization was undertaken on the GSA's own initiative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the OAI's responsibility for negotiating deals between public and private entities demonstrates substantial independence from the President. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 53-55. Plaintiffs allege that the OAI has engaged in multiple negotiations with private entities, including Foxconn and IT Contractor Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But, nowhere do Plaintiffs allege that the OAI engaged in these negotiations without the knowledge and consent of the President. Moreover, Plaintiffs do not allege that the OAI has acquisition authority independent from the President, nor do they reference any source providing the OAI with such authority. Based on the claims in Plaintiffs' Complaint, it is not even clear what role the OAI played in these alleged negotiations. Plaintiffs contend that Jared Kushner and Reed Cordish met with Foxconn executives who were considering buying a facility in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. But, Mr. Kushner is a Senior Advisor to the President and Mr. Cordish was an Assistant to the President at the time. Because Mr. Kushner and Mr. Cordish could have been operating in their capacities as White House staff, this allegation does not establish the independence of the OAI. The same is true for Plaintiffs' example involving Mr. Kushner's negotiations with IT Contractor Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. As Mr. Kushner is also a Senior Advisor to the President, his participation in the negotiation does not support the substantial independence of the OAI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to establish the OAI's substantial independence from the President based on the OAI's structure and responsibilities. This failure is unsurprising given that the OAI has little in common with the three entities within the EOP that the D.C. Circuit has previously held to be agencies for purposes of FOIA and analogous statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, the Office of Science and Technology, which the D.C. Circuit held to be an agency under FOIA exercised more independent authority than the OAI. In deciding that the Office was an agency, the D.C. Circuit noted that \"[t]he one house of Congress that explicitly considered the plan creating the [Office] clearly contemplated that the [Office] would function as a distinct entity and not merely as part of the President's staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Soucie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"803720,3583983\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/448/1067/\">\n    448 F.2d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Circuit Court also considered that the Office had the authority to independently evaluate federal programs and that Congress, not just the President, retained control over the information on federal programs accumulated by the Office.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"803720,3583983\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/448/1067/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"803720,3583983\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/448/1067/\">\n    at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Similarly, the OAI does not have the statutory authority or the independent responsibilities\n   similar to the Council on Environmental Quality. In\n   <em>\n    Pacific Legal Foundation v. Council on Environmental Quality\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"627146,5686171\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/636/1259/\">\n    636 F.2d 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.

The Circuit Court explained that the Council was created by legislative action and has the statutory authority to \"conduct environmental research and to monitor environmental trends.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"627146,5686171\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/636/1259/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"627146,5686171\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/636/1259/\">\n    at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, Executive Orders have expanded the responsibilities of the Council to include coordinating federal programs on environmental quality and directly issuing guidelines to federal agencies for the preparation of environmental impact statements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"627146,5686171\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/636/1259/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Council also publishes and revises the national contingency plan for the removal of oil and hazardous substances from navigable waters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"627146,5686171\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/636/1259/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Third, the OAI does not exercise the same independence from the President as does the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which the D.C.

In completing these tasks, the Board has the independent authority promulgate its own regulations, require the Secretary of Energy to report to it classified information, conduct hearings, compel testimony, hire staff, and obtain assistance from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5677175,10511\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5677175,10511\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/581/\">\n    at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on the above analysis, even if the OAI were not categorically barred from agency status under FOIA based on its position within the White House Office, the Court finds that the OAI is still not an agency because it does not exercise substantial authority independent of the President. Accordingly, the OAI is not subject to FOIA, and Plaintiffs' Complaint requesting that the Court compel the OAI to comply with FOIA fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because the Court has determined that Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted, the Court also concludes that Plaintiffs' request for jurisdictional discovery is not appropriate. Plaintiffs request jurisdictional discovery to determine whether or not the OAI falls within the jurisdiction of FOIA. Pls.' Opp'n, ECF No. 13, 23-24. But, even assuming that this case presents a jurisdictional problem, district courts have broad discretion in their resolution of jurisdictional discovery requests.\n   <em>\n    FC Inv. Grp. LC v.

Moreover, the Court concludes that jurisdictional discovery would not produce a different result in this case as D.C. Circuit precedent is clear that an entity within the White House Office, such as the OAI, is not an agency under FOIA. And, Plaintiffs have not set forth plausible allegations that the OAI is different than other entities within the EOP with the purpose of advising and assisting the President which the courts have concluded are not agencies for purposes of FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
