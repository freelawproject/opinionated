Defendant HSBC Mortgage Services, Inc. moved for judgment on the pleadings. ECF No. 15. The Court denied Plaintiff's motion to remand and granted the Defendants' motions to dismiss the FAC and for judgment on the pleadings, while granting Plaintiff an opportunity to amend her complaint. ECF No. 28. Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") on August 16, 2018. ECF No. 30. Defendants each moved to dismiss. ECF Nos. 31, 33. During the pendency of the briefing on the motion to dismiss, Plaintiff moved to remand a related case that had been removed to this Court. ECF No. 42. In a written order dated November 1, 2018, the Court dismissed with prejudice all of Plaintiff's claims in this case, save one. ECF No. 44.

SAC \u00b6 7; ECF No. 34, Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. A. The loan was secured by a deed of trust, which identified the lender as Crevecor Mortgage Inc. ECF No. 34, Ex. A.

F. On March 13, 2018, Caliber recorded a notice of trustee's sale and set the date of sale for April 9, 2018. ECF No. 7, Ex. G.

Defendants Caliber and Summit removed to this Court on April 18, 2018. ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the filing of the motion to remand, motion to dismiss the FAC, motion for judgment on the pleadings, and motion to expunge notice of pendency of action, the Court issued an order to show cause why Plaintiff, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   as administrator of the Estate of Thomas W. Hatch, may continue to prosecute the action. ECF No. 20. Plaintiff responded, ECF No. 25, and satisfied the Court that as the sole beneficiary of the Estate, she is entitled to represent the estate\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In an order dated August 2, 2018, the Court granted the motion to dismiss the FAC and the motion for judgment on the pleadings, denied the motion to remand, and held in abeyance the motion to expunge notice of pendency of action. ECF No. 28. Plaintiff then filed the SAC, which adds allegations concerning the effectiveness of the assignment of the deed of trust. In particular, Plaintiff raises questions about the transfer based on the allegation that Crevecor did not assign the deed of trust to HSBC until 2008, while HSBC received taxes from Hatch in 2004. SAC \u00b6 9. The SAC alleges upon information and belief that the assignment from MERS to HSBC that was attempted in 2005 failed to transfer \"any legal rights of ownership of the trust deed to HSBC\" and that the failure was the reason that HSBC did not follow through on attempts to foreclose on the property. SAC \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants again moved to dismiss. On October 12, 2018, during the pendency of the motions to dismiss, Plaintiff filed another complaint in California Superior Court for the County of Kern against the same defendants and involving the same mortgage as in this case. ECF No. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants removed that case to this Court on October 17, 2018, and on October 31, 2018, the Court dismissed it under the duplicative case doctrine.

Though the Ninth Circuit has not directly addressed whether a decrease in the amount in controversy in a diversity case can divest the court of original jurisdiction and permit a court to determine whether in its discretion to hear the case on supplemental jurisdiction, there is little to indicate that this would be its view of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court is persuaded that the dismissal of claims bringing the total amount in controversy below $75,000 did not dissolve the Court's original jurisdiction over the suit. The Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Wolde-Meskel v. Vocational Instruction Project Cmty. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397234\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/59/\">\n    166 F.3d 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1999), concluded that the Fourth Circuit's opinion permitting a district court to remand a case once the amount in controversy had decreased to less than $75,000, in\n   <em>\n    Shanaghan v. Cahill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7408477\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/106/#p112\">\n    58 F.3d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (4th Cir. 1995), had confused state-law claims that are supplemental to the court's original jurisdiction and state-law claims that are aggregated to satisfy the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65. The Second Circuit panel found that when examining a complaint in a diversity case that includes state-law claims that together exceed $75,000,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   supplemental jurisdiction is beside the point. Section 1367(c) provides that \"[t]he district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim ... if-... the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). This can have no bearing on aggregated claims, because (for one thing) the dismissal of an individual claim that was aggregated to create original jurisdiction, is emphatically not the dismissal of \"all claims over which [the court] has original jurisdiction,\" so long as it can be said that the court had on the filing-date original jurisdiction over the dismissed claim and the disaggregated claims that remain. The\n   <em>\n    Shanaghan\n   </em>\n   court concluded that one or more of the aggregated claims supplied original jurisdiction and that one or more was supplemental to that claim. But aggregated claims have never been treated individually for jurisdictional purposes, and nothing in \u00a7 1367 suggests that Congress intended otherwise. When state law claims are aggregated, regardless of the amounts at issue, all of them together are \"original,\" and none of the constituent claims are \"supplemental.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The nature of a supplemental claim is that the district court lacks original jurisdiction over it, and that it is related to a claim over which the court has original jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (supplemental claim is \"so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy\");\n   <em>\n    Sriram v. Preferred Income Fund III Ltd. Partnership\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508704\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/22/498/#p501\">\n    22 F.3d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501 (2d Cir.1994) (\"Because all of the claims seek to vindicate a wrong arising out of the same\n   course of conduct, the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the corresponding state claims was proper.\"). The nature of aggregated claims is that the district court has original jurisdiction over them by virtue of their aggregation; and relatedness, of course, is not a principle of aggregation under \u00a7 1332(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65. The Court finds this reasoning persuasive and holds that the Court cannot decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's sole remaining claim because the claim, as part of the bundle of claims that put more than the jurisdictional amount at issue and established original jurisdiction, was not supplemental at all.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Purple Passion, Inc. v.
