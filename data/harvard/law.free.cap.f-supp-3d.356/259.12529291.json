Plaintiff Mastercraft Decorators, Inc., brought this complaint against the former employee, Randy Orlando, and the competing company, Grandstand Glassware and Apparel, alleging eight claims for (1) tortious interference with contract; (2) tortious interference with prospective economic advantage; (3) breach of covenant not to compete; (4) breach of covenant not to solicit; (5) unfair competition; (6) misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information; (7) defamation and brand tarnishment; and (8) breach of fiduciary duty. ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Orlando filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. ECF No. 3. Defendant Grandstand filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and adopted the arguments in Orlando's motion. ECF No. 7. This order addresses both motions.
