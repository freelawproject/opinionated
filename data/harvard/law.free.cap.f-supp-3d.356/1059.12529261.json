But there are differences between the pleading standards of claims and defenses under Rules 8(a) and 8(c).\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   is based on the Supreme Court's reading of Rule 8(a), which requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" but affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c) must simply be \"affirmatively state[d].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of Beaver City v.

An \"affirmative state[ment]\" need not contain facts making the defense plausible, as under\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , because Rule 8(c) does not require a \"showing,\" as does Rule 8(a), but an affirmative defense must at least fairly identify the legal theory upon which it rests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyco Fire Prods.

The Court disagrees. Detecting the presence of a person at a door, sending a video of the person to be viewed, and speaking with the person at the door are all concrete steps requiring more than the abstract thinking capabilities of a person or a computer. Regardless of anticipation or nonobviousness under \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103 -neither of which is at issue in the present motion, and upon which the Court states no opinion-Claim 1 is patent-eligible under \u00a7 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Defendant's fourth through ninth affirmative defenses should be stricken because they are insufficiently stated. The fourth affirmative defense cites statutory limitations on damages (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20286\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 87 ) and limitations on jurisdiction where infringement is done by or for the United States (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201498\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The fifth affirmative defense cites a very specific estoppel issue. The sixth affirmative defense lists \"estoppel, waiver, laches, and unclean hands.\" The seventh affirmative defense lists \"exhaustion, implied license and restrictions on double recovery.\" The eighth affirmative defense is a denial of infringement, and the ninth affirmative defense is a denial that the case is \"exceptional\" under the meaning of the fee-shifting statute. The Court finds that the fourth through seventh affirmative defenses provide Plaintiff fair notice of the issues involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyco Fire Prods. LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835585\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/777/893/#p900\">\n    777 F.Supp.2d at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The eighth and ninth affirmative defenses are in fact passive defenses that need not have been stated as affirmative defenses. Infringement and exceptionality are things a plaintiff is bound to prove. The Court will not bother to strike these affirmative defenses, however, because they are not redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous, but merely superfluous. In any case, Defendant has withdrawn the challenged affirmative defenses in an amended pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motions to Dismiss (ECF Nos. 13, 26) are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Judge Du and the undersigned jointly reassigned related Case No. 3:17-cv-686 from Judge Du to this Court.
