Bredar, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Michelle Duncan-Bogley (\"Plaintiff\") brought this negligence action against the United States (\"the Postal Service\") and SDC New Ridge Parkway and Benson Avenue - Maryland, Inc., (\"SDC\") (collectively \"Defendants\") after she fell outside of the U.S. Post Office in Hanover, Maryland. Now pending before the Court are SDC's Motion for Summary Judgment and the Postal Service's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, filed pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56. (ECF Nos. 43, 44.) The issues have been briefed (ECF Nos. 43-1, 44-1, 45-1, 46-1, 51, 52), and no hearing is required,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2016). For the reasons stated below, the Motions will be reviewed under Rule 56 and will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 18, 2013, Plaintiff went to the U.S. Post Office in Hanover, Maryland. (USA M.S.J. Ex. I at 20:9-26:5, ECF No. 44-11; Ex. J at 5-6, ECF No. 44-12.) It was mid-morning and sunny. (USA M.S.J. Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I at 20:9-20:11, 26:4-26:5, ECF No. 44-11.) She retrieved mail from her business' P.O. Box and then went to exit the office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:12-21:21.) As Plaintiff was leaving, a man opened the door for her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:21-34:11.) Then, when she exited the threshold, her left foot landed on the uneven intersection of two concrete slabs outside of the Post Office, causing her to trip and sustain injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   USA M.S.J. Ex. J at 5-7, ECF No. 44-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties' experts agree that the difference in height between the concrete slabs where Plaintiff's foot landed was approximately three quarters of an inch. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDC M.S.J. Ex. D, ECF No. 43-5; Opp'n to SDC M.S.J. Ex. 3 at 75:12-76:13, ECF No. 46-2.) Plaintiff was not looking down when she exited the Post Office; she was \"more paying attention to the man opening the door.\" (USA M.S.J. Ex. I at 34:16-37:11, 170:15-170:19, ECF No. 44-11.) She acknowledged that, if she had been looking down, she would have seen the uneven intersection of the two pieces of sidewalk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:16-37:11.) There was nothing obstructing Plaintiff's view of the sidewalk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:7-39:17.) There have been no known similar incidents in recent years. (SDC M.S.J. Ex. G at 252:20-254:5, ECF No. 43-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff had visited the U.S. Post Office in Hanover several times before July 18, 2013. (USA M.S.J. Ex. I at 159:4-159:15, ECF No. 44-11.) She never noticed the uneven sidewalk on her prior visits, despite the fact that it is immediately in front of the entrance to the Post Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:19-47:3, 159:16-159:20; ECF No. 44-11 at 16.) By contrast, two of Plaintiff's employees, Karen Stelmack and Kim Goins, both stated in their depositions that they observed the sidewalk defect during their prior visits to this Post Office. (USA M.S.J. Ex. N at 13:2-13:22, ECF No. 44-16; Ex. O at 11:13-19:20, ECF No. 44-17.) Indeed, Stelmack even stated that she was able to observe the \"difference in level\" in the sidewalk when she exited the Post Office. (USA M.S.J. Ex. O at 19:4-19:20, ECF No. 44-17.) Stelmack believes that the sidewalk defect has been there \"for a long time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:13-12:1.) Similarly, Goins stated that she noticed the \"crack\" on her first visit to the U.S. Post Office in Hanover \"a couple years ago.\" (USA M.S.J. Ex. N at 13:7-13:22, ECF No. 44-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Postal Service leases a single suite within a commercial strip located at 7476 New Ridge Road in Hanover, Maryland. (USA M.S.J. Ex. A at 43:2-44:1, ECF No. 44-3.) The commercial strip is owned by SDC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USA M.S.J. Ex. C, ECF No. 44-5.) The Postal Service does not lease the sidewalk in front of its office from SDC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USA M.S.J. Ex. A at 33:4-35:11, ECF No. 44-3; Ex. C, ECF No. 44-5; Ex. D, ECF No. 44-6.) Rather, the sidewalk is a common area retained by SDC that stretches in front of the other businesses and properties in SDC's commercial strip. (USA M.S.J. Ex. A at 29:14-42:11, 91:14-91:18, ECF No. 44-3.) SDC's former property manager stated in her deposition that there were \"maybe six or seven\" tenants in the strip. (USA M.S.J. Ex. B at 54:20-55:15, ECF No. 44-4.) Under the express terms of the lease between the Postal Service and SDC, SDC is responsible for \"repairs to all common or joint use areas,\" and, specifically, \"repairs to sidewalk.\" (USA M.S.J. Ex. C, ECF No. 44-5.) The Postal Service, along with the other tenants in SDC's commercial strip, paid a common area maintenance fee with which SDC, through a property manager, maintained the exterior of its commercial strip. (USA M.S.J. Ex. A at 38:1-42:11, ECF No. 44-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 15, 2016, Plaintiff and her husband, James Bogley, filed the instant suit\n   against Defendants for negligence and loss of consortium. (ECF No. 1.) They filed suit against the Postal Service pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202671\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2680 (2012). The Court dismissed their loss of consortium claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required under the Federal Tort Claims Act and, therefore, dismissed James Bogley from the case. (ECF No. 20.) The parties then conducted discovery and Defendants filed the pending Motions. (ECF Nos. 43, 44.) Plaintiff opposed both Motions (ECF Nos. 45, 46), and Defendants replied (ECF Nos. 51, 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

(Opp'n to USA M.S.J. at 5-12, ECF No. 45-1; Opp'n to SDC M.S.J. at 6, ECF No. 46-1.) \"An invitee is in general a person invited or permitted to enter or remain on another's property for purposes connected with or related to the owner's business.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherman v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDC M.S.J. Mem. Supp. at 11, ECF No. 43-1.) The Postal Service, on the other hand, argues that summary judgment should be granted in its favor because it did not own, lease, or control the sidewalk area where Plaintiff fell and, therefore, did not owe Plaintiff a duty with respect to that area. (USA M.S.J. Mem. Supp. at 11-12, ECF No. 44-1.) The Court will address this argument and then turn to the parties' alternative arguments for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Maryland courts have never specifically addressed the issue presented here-whether a tenant in a multi-tenant commercial strip owes a duty to invitees with respect to the common areas abutting its premises.

Similarly, here, the imposition of such a duty on a tenant in SDC's multi-tenant commercial strip would lead to uncertainty with respect to the areas of the sidewalk and other common areas for which each tenant is responsible.

Moreover, two of Plaintiff's employees, Kim Goins and Karen Stelmack, stated in their depositions that they had each noticed the sidewalk defect during their prior visits to the Post Office. (USA M.S.J. Ex. N at 13:2-13:19, ECF No. 44-16; Ex. O at 10:24-11:20, ECF No. 44-17.)

There, the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that the issue of contributory negligence was a question for the jury where the plaintiff fell after stepping into a hole in the sidewalk that was three feet wide and had an average depth of 0.5 inches and a maximum depth of 1.75 inches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20594\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20594\">\n    at 594, 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This defect does not constitute a minor deviation in ground surface analogous to the 0.75 inch height differential between the two concrete slabs here. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Princess Anne\n   </em>\n   also noted that, unlike here, there was evidence from which the jury could find that the depression was not plainly visible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20594\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20594\">\n    at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court concludes that, as a matter of law, a reasonable person in Plaintiff's position exercising ordinary perception and care would have recognized the condition and the risks of the uneven intersection between the concrete slabs. The open and obvious doctrine imposes a duty on a plaintiff to exercise due care for her own safety. In this instance, that duty required Plaintiff to account for visible defects in ground surface.
