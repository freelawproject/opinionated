CLIA is a global organization that represents 51 cruise lines operating worldwide. CLIA Alaska represented cruise lines that entered Alaska waters. CLIA Alaska members included Carnival Cruise Lines, Crystal Cruises, Disney Cruise Lines, Holland America Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceana Cruises, Princess Cruises, Regent Seven Sea Cruises, Royal Caribbean International, and Silverseas Cruises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants are The City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska (CBJ) and Rorie Watt, in his official capacity as the City Manager. CBJ owns and operates the Cruise Ship Terminal and the Alaska Steam Ship Dock, which are two of the four cruise docks located in the downtown area of the City of Juneau. The other two cruise ship docks, AJ Juneau Dock and Franklin Dock, are privately owned. The Franklin Dock is owned by Princess Cruises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AJ Juneau Dock is owned in part by Holland America.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBJ, which has approximately 32,000 year-round residents, receives approximately 1,000,000 cruise ship passengers each year from early May through mid-September.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case involves challenges to two passenger fees imposed by CBJ. First, the Marine Passenger Fee (MPF) is a $5-per-passenger fee assessed on any marine passenger ship, with some exceptions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that enters any CBJ port. The MPF for each ship that enters any CBJ port is calculated based on the passenger manifest, and the owner or agent of the ship, not the individual passengers, is responsible for paying the MPF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBJ Code \u00a7\u00a7 69.20.030 and 69.20.040.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MPF was first imposed in 2000, at which time the stated purpose of the fee was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   to address the costs to the City and Borough for services and infrastructure usage by cruise ship passengers visiting Juneau, including emergency services, transportation impacts and recreation infrastructure use, and to mitigate impacts of increased utilization of City and Borough services by cruise ship passengers.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2012, CBJ amended the \"purpose and intent\" portion of the MPF ordinance. The purpose of the MPF is now \"to address the costs to the City and Borough for services and infrastructure rendered to cruise ships and cruise ship passengers visiting the City and Borough.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Revenue from the MPF is placed in the Marine Passenger Fund, and the proceeds of the Fund are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   appropriated in support of the marine passenger ship industry including:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Design, construction, enhancement, operation, or maintenance of capital improvements;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) Operating funds for personnel, training, commodities, rentals, services and equipment for services provided, made available to, or required as a result of marine passenger ships and marine passengers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) Projects and programs that promote safety, environmental improvements[,] efficiency of interstate and international commerce, or enforcement of laws caused or required by marine passenger ships and marine passengers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (4) Acquisition of land required to execute the activities listed in this section;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (5) Reserved; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (6) Surveys, analyses, polls, monitoring, and similar efforts to measure, describe or predict, or manage marine passengers, for items listed in subsection (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   CBJ Code \u00a7 69.20.120. In FY 2017, the revenue from the MPF was approximately $5 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CBJ allocates a portion of the revenue generated by the MPF to municipal government departments which perform functions \"that are available for use by cruise ship passengers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   These departments have included Emergency Medical Services, Libraries, Police, Parks and Recreation, Streets, Finance, and the City Manager's Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The allocated portion is transferred to the General Government Fund. \"The amount allocated is based on the number of hours cruise ship passengers spend in Juneau compared to the number of hours residents, independent visitors, conventioneers, and embarking/disembarking passengers spend in Juneau on an annual basis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Revenue from the MPF is also used to directly fund projects. Each year, the City Manager accepts proposals for projects to be funded by the MPF. CBJ Code \u00a7 69.20.120(b)(1). A draft list of proposals is prepared and put out for public comment as well as comment from the cruise line industry. CBJ Code \u00a7 69.20.120(b)(3). After comment and review by the finance committee, a final list is forwarded to the Assembly for approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The direct funding includes projects and services that are provided by CBJ. By way of example, for FY 2015, CBJ used revenue from the MPF\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   for downtown foot/bike police patrols, downtown restroom cleaning, downtown sidewalk cleaning, Air Medevacs, EMS services, Docks and Harbors general operations and building maintenance, downtown pay phones, emergency room staff at the Bartlett Regional Hospital, and the city bus service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The direct funding also includes projects and services that are provided by third parties via operating grants. By way of example, for FY 2015, operating grants funded by revenue from the MPF were given to Tourism Best Management Practices,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   SAIL - Accessible Training and\n   Trip Coordination,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Airlift Northwest,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Franklin Dock Enterprises,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   AJ Juneau Dock, LLC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Goldbelt,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Juneau Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grant funds were also used to pay for the downtown crossing guards and the Downtown Security Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, revenue from the MPF is also used for capital projects. By way of example for FY 2015, funds generated by the MPF were used for the Waterfront Seawalk,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   electrical winches, real-time weather monitoring and communications, and Last Chance Basin Hydro-Geo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The second fee being challenged is the Port Development Fee (PDF), which is a $3.00 fee imposed on, with a few exceptions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"vessels carrying passengers for compensation on port calls in the City and Borough....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to Assembly resolutions, the PDF has been imposed by CBJ since at least 2002, although the amount of the fee has increased over time to the current $3.00. The owner or agent of the vessel is responsible for paying the PDF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Funds generated by the PDF are intended to be used \"for capital improvements to the downtown waterfront for the provision of service to the cruise ship industry\" and any projects paid for with PDF funds are intended \"to benefit all\n   entities which remit the Fee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   In FY 2017, the PDF generated approximately $3 million in revenue. Since 2011, funds generated by the PDF have only been used for the 16B project\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Seawalk project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Claims and Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Claims/Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 13, 2016, plaintiffs commenced this action to challenge the MPF and PDF. In their first amended complaint, plaintiffs assert four causes of action. In their first cause of action, plaintiffs assert that the MPF and PDF violate the Tonnage Clause of the United States Constitution. In their second cause of action, plaintiffs assert that the MPF and PDF violate the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (RHAA), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In their third cause of action, plaintiffs assert that the MPF and PDF violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. In their fourth cause of action, plaintiffs assert that the MPF and PDF violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, and they allege that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provides a basis for their Tonnage Clause and Commerce Clause claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs seek declarations that 1) the MPF and PDF violate the Tonnage Clause, the Supremacy Clause, and the Commerce Clause, 2) defendants have deprived plaintiffs of their federal rights in violation of \u00a7 1983, 3) \"[d]efendants are legally barred from imposing or collecting\" the MPF and PDF \"to the extent that revenues therefrom are unlawful, excessive, or otherwise impermissible;\" and 4) \"[d]efendants are legally barred from further use of\" the MPF and PDF \"revenue to fund activities that are unrelated to and do not benefit the Cruise Lines' vessels and passengers or that do not reflect the direct cost of providing services to cruise vessels.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from 1) \"imposing or collecting the\" MPF and PDF \"to the extent that the amount thereof is excessive or otherwise impermissible;\" and 2) \"further use of the revenues from the\" MPF and PDF \"to fund activities that are unrelated to and do not benefit the Cruise Lines' vessels and passengers, or approximate their use of CBJ's port.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs contend that many of CBJ's uses of the MPF and PDF revenue are unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   revenues directed to general government operations; legal fees and costs (internal or external); infrastructure construction; maintenance, and improvements such as sidewalks, roadways, walkways, promenades; hospital costs; internet service and library upgrades; police and crossing guard costs; parks and beautification projects; and public transit.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs now move for summary judgment on their first, second, and fourth\n   causes of action and argue that it is not necessary for the court to address their third cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Claims/Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   By their motion to determine the law of the case, defendants ask the court to determine:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   1) Whether the Tonnage Clause permits the use of fees for services that benefit vessel passengers and/or the vessel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   2) Whether the Tonnage Clause permits the use of fees for services that benefit vessel passengers and/or the vessel even if those services may be available to and/or used by the general public;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   3) Whether the RHAA permits the use of fees for services that benefit vessel passengers and/or the vessel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   4) Whether the RHAA permits the use of fees for services that benefit vessel passengers and/or the vessel even if those services may be available to and/or used by the general public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants also cross-move for summary judgment. Defendants seek the dismissal of all of plaintiffs' causes of action, arguing that CBJ's use of MPF and PDF revenue has not been unconstitutional or unlawful. In addition, defendants state the defenses of statute of limitations, failure to exhaust administrative remedies, waiver, estoppel and/or quasi-estoppel, and laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Matters Not in Dispute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, in plaintiffs' amended complaint and in their opening brief, plaintiffs seem to contend that the court should void the MPF ordinance and PDF resolution and enjoin CBJ from collecting the MPF and PDF altogether because the fees were unconstitutional and unlawful. In their reply brief, plaintiffs acknowledge that the MPF ordinance and PDF resolution are not necessarily unconstitutional or unlawful on their face, but rather plaintiffs contend that some of CBJ's uses of the revenue generated by the MPF and PDF are unconstitutional or unlawful. Plaintiffs contend that they are asking the court to enjoin CBJ from using future revenue from the MPF and PDF in an unconstitutional or unlawful manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, plaintiffs do not seek the refund of MPF or PDF paid to date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, plaintiffs are associations of which cruise vessel owners are members. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for the benefit of their members. Defendants concede that plaintiffs have standing to sue on behalf of their members for purposes of raising constitutional and statutory challenges to the MPF and PDF which are imposed upon association members' vessels calling at the Port of Juneau. That is, defendants concede that plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief as presently pleaded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Determine the Law of the Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In their motion to determine the law of the case, defendants first ask the court to determine whether the Tonnage Clause and the RHAA permit revenue from the MPF and PDF to be used for services that benefit vessel passengers, but do not benefit the vessel itself. The court begins with the Tonnage Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Tonnage Clause of the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 10, Clause 3, provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Tonnage Clause \"seeks to prevent states with 'convenient ports' from placing other States at an economic disadvantage by laying levies that would 'ta[x] the consumption of their neighbours.' \"\n   <em>\n    Polar Tankers, Inc. v.

Moreover, plaintiffs are only requesting prospective relief, so whether the court considers expenditures related to the MPF and PDF prior to April 16, 2014 is irrelevant.

The PDF was first levied in 2002 and became $3.00 in 2008. But, plaintiffs did not file the instant suit until April 13, 2016. Thus, defendants argue that plaintiffs are barred from bringing a claim that the PDF violates the RHAA. And although defendants do not expressly make the same argument as to the MPF, presumably the same statute of limitations would apply to plaintiffs' claim that the MPF violates the RHAA and plaintiffs did not file the instant suit challenging the MPF within four years of that fee first being imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs' RHAA claim is not time barred. \"When a plaintiff alleges a continuing violation of the law, an overt act is required to restart the statute of limitations and the statute of limitations runs from the last overt act.\"\n   <em>\n    Eichman v.

Defendants argue that this inconsistency is significant because over the last eight years, plaintiffs' members have made a substantial amount of money by bringing their cruise ships to Juneau and using the infrastructure created in part with revenue generated by the PDF. Defendants argue that for plaintiffs to now change their position is unconscionable. As for the MPF, defendants argue that it is unconscionable for plaintiffs to now argue that the MPF is unconstitutional when plaintiffs' members have been requesting and using MPF funds for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiffs are indeed taking a different position than they have sometimes taken concerning expenditures from the PDF and MPF. Plaintiffs' members operate profitable tourist businesses, and the Juneau tourist business is also extremely beneficial to the City and Borough of Juneau. But the fact that both parties benefit from tourism is irrelevant to the question of whether or not the doctrine of quasi-estoppel applies in this case. It is true that plaintiffs' members have accepted benefits in the sense that their money has been collected by defendants and then expended for projects or services, some of which plaintiffs' members have requested. It would indeed bother the conscience of the court were plaintiffs' members to accept the benefit of projects or services which they requested and then challenge defendants for providing those projects or services by seeking a refund. But plaintiffs are not seeking a refund of any fees collected from their members. Again, the relief that plaintiffs are seeking here is forward-looking. At present, plaintiffs have taken no position and have gained no advantage - nor have they caused any disadvantage - with respect to future expenditures of revenue generated by the MPF and PDF. There is nothing unconscionable about plaintiffs asserting their constitutional and statutory rights as to the future use of fees collected from plaintiffs' members. Defendants' affirmative defense of quasi-estoppel fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The constitutional and statutory issues raised by the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are purely legal issues. There are no fact disputes to be resolved at this time because plaintiffs do not seek the refund of fees previously imposed and collected by CBJ. Although presently the court is not in a position to evaluate the constitutionality or lawfulness of PDF or MPF funded services or projects which defendants may offer in the future, the case is ripe for declarations of law applicable to plaintiffs' first and second causes of action and the constitutionality of the MPF ordinance and the PDF resolution in light of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (plaintiffs' fourth cause of action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The court begins with the issues raised in defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. Defendants first ask the court whether the Tonnage Clause permits the use of fees for services that benefit vessel passengers and/or the vessel. Applying the legal authorities set out above, the use of MPF and PDF fees for services which defendants provide to vessels is permissible. The Tonnage Clause is not violated by defendants' spending of MPF and PDF funds for those endeavors that facilitate the marine operations of plaintiffs' members' vessels. Such endeavors constitute services to a vessel. Expenditure of MPF and PDF fees for the benefit of passengers violates the Tonnage Clause unless those expenditures constitute a service to the vessel. For example, the supply and maintenance of equipment by defendants which is used by passengers for purposes of embarking or disembarking a vessel plainly benefits passengers. However, the expenditure of MPF and PDF funds for that type of service does not offend the Tonnage Clause because boarding and disembarking from a vessel plainly constitutes a service to the vessel as well. But expenditures of MPF and PDF funds for services to passengers only - such as crossing guards, repair and maintenance of sidewalks - violate the Tonnage Clause because they do not constitute a service to a vessel. There is no nexus to the marine operations of a vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Put somewhat differently, the question which plaintiffs' first cause of action puts\n   before the court is not whether CBJ's use of MPF and PDF funds benefits passengers. Passenger benefits are not relevant. The proper question as to each category of expenditure by defendants is: Does the expenditure provide a service to a vessel? If the answer is yes, the expenditure is constitutional. If the answer is no, the expenditure is unconstitutional under the Tonnage Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The second issue raised in defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment also concerns plaintiffs' first cause of action. Defendants ask whether the Tonnage Clause permits the use of fees for services that benefit the passengers or a vessel, even if those services may be available to and/or used by the general public. As discussed above, expenditure of MPF and PDF fees for services that benefit a vessel (that facilitate marine operations) are constitutional, whereas those expenditures that do not benefit a vessel are unconstitutional. Whether a particular service provided by defendants is available to and/or used by the general public is not relevant to plaintiffs' Tonnage Clause claim. Providing facilities that constitute a service to a vessel do not become unconstitutional because of incidental/parallel use by the general public. That said, services provided by defendants to passengers which are of like kind to those services generally provided by municipalities and generally funded by municipal tax revenues are unlikely to qualify as services to a vessel. Whereas a gangplank used by passengers and the general public is a service to a vessel, sidewalk repairs and access to the public library's internet, which passengers share with the general public, are unlikely to be a service to a vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The third issue raised by defendants in their cross-motion for summary judgment concerns plaintiffs' second cause of action. Defendants ask whether the RHAA limits the use of fees to those services only provided to a vessel, or if fees may properly be used for services benefitting only vessel passengers. As discussed above, the RHAA expressly limits the use of fees imposed upon a vessel or its passengers to services provided to the vessel. A service which is provided by defendants and is beneficial to a vessel does not become unlawful under the RHAA because passengers, in addition to the vessel, may benefit from the expenditure. But using fees imposed on a vessel for services which benefit passengers, but which do not also benefit the vessel, is unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, defendants ask with respect to plaintiffs' second cause of action whether the RHAA limits the use of fees to services to the passengers and the vessel to the exclusion of use or availability of use by the public. Again, the critical inquiry is whether or not a service provided by defendants and paid for with MPF or PDF funds constitutes a service to a vessel. Whether a service to a vessel incidentally benefits passengers or is used by passengers as well as the general public does not matter. Services provided by defendants, funded by MPF or PDF fees, which benefit passengers, or passengers and the general public, are unlawful under the RHAA unless those expenditures are shown to be a service to a vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In the end, defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' first and second causes of action because their use of MPF and PDF revenue for services to passengers is constitutional and lawful. Defendants' cross-motion is denied as to the plaintiffs' first and second causes of action for the reason that fees imposed by defendants upon vessels and used for services to passengers are unconstitutional and unlawful unless the services in question constitute a service to a vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Defendants also seek summary judgment on plaintiffs' third cause of action based upon the Commerce Clause. Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' Commerce Clause cause of action is denied. Fees imposed and collected for services to passengers that do not also benefit the vessel may violate the Commerce Clause because fees for such services likely unduly burden interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Finally, defendants seek summary judgment on plaintiffs' Supremacy Clause cause of action. \"It is a familiar and well-established principle that the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const., Art.

But, this argument fails. The MPF ordinance and PDF resolution are not preempted by the Supremacy Clause. It is not impossible for vessel owners to comply with both the federal law and the local law.

Defendants' cross-motion as to plaintiffs' Supremacy Clause claim is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Turning then to plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs seek a declaration that the MPF and PDF violate the Tonnage Clause of the United States Constitution (first cause of action) and Section 5(b) of the RHAA (second cause of action). The following rulings on plaintiffs' first and second causes of action are forward-looking. These rulings are based upon the court's determination of the law of the case as set forth above and the court's resolution of the substantive issues raised by defendants in their cross-motion for summary judgment. The court is not making factual determinations at this time. Moreover, the court does not presently have before it any claim or sufficient evidence upon which to make a determination as to the reasonableness of any costs of services which defendants supply to vessels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The MPF ordinance and the PDF resolution do not impose a tax nor do they raise fees for general revenue purposes. Rather, defendants' MPF ordinance and PDF resolution impose fees for proposed services. On their face, the MPF ordinance and the PDF resolution do not impose unconstitutional or unlawful fees for entry into the Port of Juneau. Based upon the MPF ordinance and the PDF resolution, defendants may, constitutionally and lawfully, impose and collect fees to pay the reasonable costs of services rendered to a vessel. But, MPF and PDF funds may not be expended for services benefitting passengers which do not also constitute a service to a vessel - that is, a service which advances the interstate marine enterprise of the vessel. Expenditures of fees\n   imposed upon vessels which enhance the tourist experience of passengers brought to Juneau by plaintiffs' members' vessels do not qualify as a service to a vessel, even though the enhancement of passengers' experience at Juneau may benefit plaintiffs' members financially. What is critical is that there be a service to a vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Based on the foregoing, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their first and second causes of action is granted in part and denied in part. Under both the Tonnage Clause of the United States Constitution and Section 5(b) of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act, imposing reasonable fees for the cost of services provided to vessels engaged in interstate marine commerce is constitutional and lawful. Imposition of such fees which do not constitute a service to a vessel is unconstitutional and unlawful. Plaintiffs' motion for judgment on their first and second causes of action is granted to the extent that the MPF ordinance and the PDF resolution impose fees that are used to fund services that are not services rendered to a vessel. The motion is otherwise denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' fourth cause of action is denied. As set out above, the MPF ordinance and the PDF resolution do not violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Defendants' motion for determination of the law of the case is denied in part because, contrary to defendants' arguments, PDF and MPF funds may not be expended for services provided to passengers, if those services do not also benefit the vessel. Defendants' motion for determination of the law of the case is granted as to defendants' contention that the use of PDF and MPF funds for services to vessels which also benefit the public does not render an otherwise permissible use of PDF and MPF funds unconstitutional or unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part. The motion is granted as to plaintiffs' first and second causes of action to the extent that the MPF ordinance and the PDF resolution impose fees that are used to fund services that are not services rendered to a vessel. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their first and second causes of action is otherwise denied. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their fourth cause of action is also denied. Plaintiffs' argument that it is unnecessary for the court to decide their Commerce Clause claim is accepted, given the court's rulings as to plaintiffs' first and second causes of action. Plaintiffs' Commerce Clause claim in their third cause of action is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment is denied as to plaintiffs' first and second causes of action because defendants' affirmative defenses fail and because fees imposed by defendants upon vessels and used for services to passengers are unconstitutional and unlawful unless the services in question constitute a service to a vessel. Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment is granted as to the Supremacy Clause claim in plaintiffs' fourth cause of action.
