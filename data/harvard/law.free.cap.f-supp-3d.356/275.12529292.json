Mullen (\"Plaintiff\"), the former police chief for defendant the Village of Painted Post (the \"Village\"), brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1983 for an alleged violation of his right to due process, and he also asserts a claim under New York State law. (Dkt. 2). Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). For the reasons discussed below, Defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are taken from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 2). The Court further takes judicial notice of the allegations set forth in the Verified Petition filed by Plaintiff in New York state court (Dkt. 21-2), which provide additional context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landow v.

As is required at this stage of the proceedings, the Court has treated Plaintiff's allegations as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is a retiree of the New York State Police and is receiving a pension from the New York State Retirement System with respect to that service. (Dkt. 21-2 at \u00b6 10). Pursuant to New York State Retirement and Social Security Law (\"RSSL\") \u00a7 212, such a retiree may return to work in the public sector and earn up to $30,000 per year without affecting his pension. In addition, RSSL \u00a7 211 sets forth criteria for a waiver permitting a retiree to return to public service and earn more than $30,000 without affecting his pension; Plaintiff was granted such a waiver with respect to his employment as the Village's police chief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The position of police chief is classified in the \"competitive class\" by the Steuben County Civil Service, and Plaintiff claims to have held the position as a permanent appointment. (Dkt. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13). Plaintiff contends that pursuant to New York Civil Service Law \u00a7 75 (hereinafter \"NYCSL \u00a7 75\"), \"an employee with a permanent appointment to a position in the competitive class may be removed from his position only upon a finding of incompetence or misconduct[.]\" (Dkt. 2 at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about September 14, 2017, Plaintiff was informed that the Village had identified a non-retired candidate for the role of police chief. (Dkt. 21-2 at \u00b6 20).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That\n   same day, Defendant Ralph Foster (\"Mayor Foster\") issued a memorandum to Plaintiff requiring him to select one of three options by October 2, 2017: (1) maintain his $60,000 per year salary and suspend his pension; (2) reduce his salary to $30,000 per year and continue to collect his pension; or (3) resign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about October 2, 2017, Plaintiff met with Mayor Foster and Defendant Brian Francis, a member of the Village's Board of Trustees (the \"Village Board\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). Plaintiff requested additional time and information before electing from the offered options, but the Village Board \"refused to give him additional time and notified him that he was terminated as Police Chief.\" (Dkt. 2 at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff commenced the instant action on October 23, 2017. (Dkt. 1). The Amended Complaint (the operative pleading) was filed on October 24, 2017. (Dkt. 2). Defendants answered the Amended Complaint on December 6, 2017. (Dkt. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 31, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Verified Petition challenging his termination in New York State Supreme Court, Steuben County, pursuant to N.Y. Civil Practice Law and Rules Article 78 (\"Article 78\"). (Dkt 21-2). Respondents filed a Verified Answer to Plaintiff's Verified Petition on March 6, 2018. (Dkt. 21-3). On March 28, 2018, the state court entered an order finding that Defendants had violated NYCSL \u00a7 75, \"notwithstanding any alleged outstanding issues with respect to the RSSL 211 waiver,\" and ordering that Plaintiff be reinstated to his position with full back pay and benefits. (Dkt. 21-4 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings on March 14, 2018. (Dkt. 17). Plaintiff filed a response on May 1, 2018 (Dkt. 21), and Defendants filed a reply on May 7, 2018 (Dkt. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Judgment on the pleadings may be granted under Rule 12(c) where the material facts are undisputed and where judgment on the merits is possible merely by considering the contents of the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    McAuliffe v.

Here, Plaintiff alleges that the actions at issue were taken by Mayor Foster and the Village Board, the entities vested with final decision-making authority regarding his employment. Accordingly, \"a post-deprivation procedural safeguard such as an Article 78 proceeding does not automatically satisfy due process, and the Court must undertake a\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   balancing analysis\" to determine whether Plaintiff's due process rights were violated.\n   <em>\n    Langton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342309\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/597/#p606\">\n    168 F.Supp.3d at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Considering the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that the procedures used in this case failed to satisfy the requirements of due process. Plaintiff alleges in the Amended Complaint that he was informed of the existence of a non-retired candidate on October 2, 2017, directed to elect among the offered options, and terminated when he requested additional time and information. (Dkt. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 15-19). Plaintiff's Article 78 Petition presents a somewhat different story, alleging that Plaintiff was initially presented with the options in a written memorandum from Mayor Foster on September 14, 2017, and required to respond by October 2, 2017. (Dkt. 21-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21). Plaintiff's Article 78 Petition further alleges that when he met with Mayor Foster on October 2, 2017, Mayor Foster refused to provide any clarification, presented him with documents that contained language different from that contained in the September 14th memorandum, and terminated Plaintiff when he requested additional time to review the revised language with his attorney. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under either of these versions of the facts, the Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law and taking into account the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors, that Plaintiff was afforded due process. With respect to the first\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor, Plaintiff had a substantial interest in his continued employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Moreover, the alleged procedures employed by Defendants carried an undue risk of erroneous deprivation, because Plaintiff was purportedly not afforded the opportunity to meaningfully consider the options before Defendants demanded that he chose among them, nor was he permitted to have a full discussion with Defendants regarding the options.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Langton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342309\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/597/#p606\">\n    168 F.Supp.3d at 607-608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the risk of erroneous deprivation \"high\" where the plaintiff and her counsel were not permitted access to the information on which the decision was made, which called into question \"the thoroughness of the Library Board's decision-making process\"). For similar reasons, additional procedures (namely, the provision of appropriate information and time for Plaintiff to consider his options and respond) would likely have provided value to the decision-making process. The Court further finds, on the record before it, that Defendants have not articulated a meaningful interest in failing to provide Plaintiff with the additional time and information he requested. Nothing in the pleadings suggests that time was of the essence such that no additional time could be extended to Plaintiff. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that judgment on the pleadings is not warranted as to Plaintiff's due process claims and denies Defendants' motion in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court's conclusion is not altered by Defendants' conclusory assertion that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his state remedies before commencing the instant action. \"Congress has neither explicitly nor implicitly required exhaustion of state remedies to bring section 1983 claims under the First or Fourteenth Amendments\n   outside of the context of prisoner suits.\"\n   <em>\n    Bal v.
