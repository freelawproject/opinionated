The Court cannot describe the reasons for Justice Scalia's abandonment of the doctrine better than the Justice himself:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   For decades, and for no good reason, we have been giving agencies the authority to say what their rules mean, under the harmless-sounding banner of \"defer[ring] to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations.\" This is generally called\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The canonical formulation of\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference is that we will enforce an agency's interpretation of its own rules unless that interpretation is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" But of course whenever the agency's interpretation of the regulation is different from the fairest reading, it is in that sense \"inconsistent\" with the regulation. Obviously, that is not enough, or there would be nothing for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   to do. In practice,\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference is\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference applied to regulations rather than statutes. The agency's interpretation will be accepted if, though not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a plausible reading -- within the scope of the ambiguity that the regulation contains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justification for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference. The first case to apply it,\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock,\n   </em>\n   offered no justification whatever -- just the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   that \"the administrative interpretation ... becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" Our later cases provide two principal explanations, neither of which has much to be said for it. First, some cases say that the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some special insight into its intent when enacting it. The implied premise of this argument -- that what we are looking for is the agency's\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   in adopting the rule -- is false. There is true of regulations what is true of statutes. As Justice Holmes put it: \"[w]e do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\" Whether governing rules are made by the national legislature or an administrative agency, we are bound\n   <em>\n    by what they say\n   </em>\n   , not by the unexpressed intention of those who made them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The other rationale our cases provide is that the agency possesses special expertise in administering its \"complex and highly technical regulatory program.\" That is true enough, and it leads to the conclusion that agencies and not courts should make regulations. But it has nothing to do with who should interpret regulations -- unless one believes that the purpose of interpretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion that the current leadership of the agency deems effective. Making regulatory programs effective is the purpose of\n   <em>\n    rulemaking\n   </em>\n   , in which the agency uses its \"special expertise\" to formulate the best rule. But the purpose of interpretation\n   is to determine the fair meaning of the rule -- to \"say what the law is.\" Not to make policy, but to determine what policy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to which the public owes obedience. Indeed, since the leadership of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agencies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency head can only be sure that the application of his \"special expertise\" to the issue addressed by a regulation\n   <em>\n    will be given effect\n   </em>\n   if we adhere to predictable principles of textual interpretation rather than defer to the \"special expertise\" of his successors. If we take agency enactments as written, the Executive has a stable background against which to write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks best.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Another conceivable justification for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, though not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it is reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of statutes that\n   <em>\n    Congress\n   </em>\n   enacted, as we do per\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , it is\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   reasonable to defer to them regarding the meaning of\n   <em>\n    regulations that they themselves crafted.\n   </em>\n   To give an agency less control over the meaning of its own regulations than it has over the meaning of a congressionally enacted statute seems quite odd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   But it is not odd at all. The theory of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   (take it or leave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority to administer a statute, including authority to issue interpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a degree of discretion, which the courts must respect, regarding the meaning of the statute. While the implication of an agency power to clarify the statute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congressional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities in its own regulations. For that would violate a fundamental principle of separation of powers -- that the power to write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest in the same hands. \"When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person ... there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\" Congress cannot enlarge its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   power through\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   -- whatever it leaves vague in the statute will be worked out\n   <em>\n    by someone else.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   represents a presumption about who, as between the Executive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be. (The Executive, by the way -- the competing political branch -- is the less congenial repository of the power as far as Congress is concerned.) So Congress's incentive is to speak as clearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   But when an agency interprets its own rules -- that is something else. Then the power to prescribe is augmented by the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak vaguely and broadly, so as to retain a \"flexibility\" that will enable \"clarification\" with retroactive effect. \"It is perfectly understandable\" for an agency to \"issue vague regulations\" if doing so will \"maximiz[e] agency power.\" Combining the power to prescribe with the power to interpret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice of resolving doubts about \"the construction of the Roman laws\" by \"stat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and tak[ing] his opinion upon it.\" And our Constitution did not mirror the British practice of using the House of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the fear that he who has \"agency in passing bad laws\" might operate in the \"same spirit\" in their interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference\n   encourages agencies to be \"vague in framing regulations, with the plan of issuing 'interpretations' to create the intended new law without observance of notice and comment procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   is not a logical corollary to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   but a dangerous permission slip for the arrogation of power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   It is true enough that\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference has the same beneficial pragmatic effect as\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference: The country need not endure the uncertainty produced by divergent views of numerous district courts and courts of appeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation, until a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by this Court. The agency's view can be relied upon, unless it is, so to speak, beyond the pale. But the duration of the uncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as long as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute. For as soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is pronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the process of amending the regulation to make its meaning entirely clear. The circumstances of this case demonstrate the point. While these cases were being briefed before us, EPA issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of Appeals judgment we are reviewing. It did so (by the standards of such things) relatively quickly: The decision below was handed down in May 2011, and in December 2012 the EPA published an amended rule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it argues here. And there is another respect in which a lack of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   -type deference has less severe pragmatic consequences for rules than for statutes. In many cases, when an agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the text arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion not to prosecute.

Shortly after his Senate confirmation in 1961, Stewart Udall, President John F. Kennedy's Secretary, assembled a taskforce to study the issue of American Indian self-determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Udall Tells of Plan for Reorganization\n   </em>\n   , N.Y.

In a stunning rebuke of the very concept of self-determination even at the ideational stage, Udall paternalistically told task force members that \"test[ing] our thinking against the thinking of the wisest Indians and their friends did not mean that we are going to let, as someone put it, the Indian people decide what the policy should be.\" 1961 Report of Task Force at 2.

He therefore proposed legislation that would:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   empower a Tribe or a group of Tribes or any other Indian community to take over the control or operation of Federally-funded and administered programs in the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare whenever the Tribal council or comparable community governing group voted to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Nixon proposed that discretion to take on a program or to not take on a program should lie completely with American Indians; it would not be necessary for the federal agency administering a program to approve the transfer of responsibility to a Tribe or Tribal organization, nor could a Tribe or Tribal organization be compelled into a transfer it did not want.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 3. Tribes or Tribal organizations also would, under Nixon's proposal, retain the \"right of retrocession,\" by which he meant that an American Indian group could elect to administer a program and then later decide to give it back to the federal government. Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 3. Nixon wanted appropriate technical assistance to help local organizations successfully operate programs they took over and for locally administered programs to be funded on equal terms with services that federal agencies continue to administer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Nixon said that his proposed legislation would triply benefit American Indians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 3. First, Nixon wrote, contracting out programs to Tribes or Tribal organizations would directly channel more money into American Indian communities, because American Indians -- not federal bureaucrats -- would be administering the programs and drawing salaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nixon's\n   Special Message to Congress \u00a7 3. Second, Nixon contended, contracting out programs to Tribes or Tribal organizations would \"help build greater pride and resourcefulness within the Indian community.\" Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 3. Third, Nixon asserted, American Indians would get better and more efficacious programs if the people whom the programs most directly affected were responsible for creating them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Nixon insisted that, \"[a]s we move ahead in this important work, it is essential that the Indian people continue to lead the way by participating in policy development to the greatest possible degree.\" Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 9. According to Nixon, the federal government has not always realized that it needs American Indian energy and leadership if its assistance is to be effective in improving the conditions of American Indian life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 9. Nixon concluded that his proposed legislation would turn a new page, however, striking a \"new and balanced relationship between the United States government and the first Americans....\" Nixon's Special Message to Congress \u00a7 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   During 1970 and 1971, Nixon Administration officials met with Tribal leaders at ten regional conferences and discussed the President's proposed legislation with them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Smithsonian Video.

Expounding in more depth on the same issue, Nixon said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Just as it is essential to put more decision-making in the hands of the State and local governments, I continue to believe\n   that Indian Tribal governments should assume greater responsibility for programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare which operate on their reservations.\n   <em>\n    As I first proposed in 1970, I recommend that the Congress enact the necessary legislation to facilitate this take-over of responsibility.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   1973 Address at 144 (emphasis in the original). Nixon continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Meanwhile the new statutory provisions for Indian Tribal governments under General Revenue Sharing will assist responsible Tribal governments in allocating extra resources with greater flexibility.\n   <em>\n    I shall also propose new legislation to foster local Indian self-determination by developing an Interior Department program of bloc[k] grants to Federally recognized Tribes as a replacement for a number of existing economic and resource development programs.\n   </em>\n   The primary purpose of these grants would be to provide Tribal governments with funds which they could use at their own discretion to promote development of their reservations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   1973 Address at 144 (emphasis in the original). Nixon concluded his remarks on American Indians with an expression of exasperation with Congress for having failed to pass the version of the ISDA that he had proposed in his Nixon's Special Message and said that, \"[t]o accelerate organizational reform, I have directed the Secretary of the Interior to transfer day to day operational activities of the Bureau of Indian Affairs out of Washington to its field offices.\" 1973 Address at 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The bill languished in committee for nearly a year before Nixon drove home the pressing need for it in his 1974 State of the Union Address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Richard Nixon, Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union, 26\n   <em>\n    Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States\n   </em>\n   56 (1974)(John Woolley &amp; Gerhard Peters eds. 2005)(\"1974 Address\"). Perhaps sensing that this address would be his final opportunity to advocate for American Indian self-determination in a State of the Union Address, Nixon spoke passionately:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   For too many years the American Indians -- the first Americans -- have been the last Americans to receive the rights and opportunities to which they are entitled. This Administration has taken the initiative to change this picture. For its part, the Federal Government must put behind it the role of autocratic manager of Indian reservations. We shall continue to encourage Indians and their Tribal governments to play an increasing role in determining their own future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   1974 Address at 75. Nixon noted that \"[o]ne measure of our attempt to foster a better, more humane policy is the level of Federal funding benefitting American Indians -- over twice what it was five years ago or about $1.6 billion.\" 1974 Address at 76. Nixon chided Congress for not having acted on his proposals \"to permit turning over to Indian Tribal governments the management and control of Indian programs,\" and \"to provide greater local control over federally assisted reservation programs through a program of Tribal grants.\" 1974 Address at 76. Nixon then closed his discussion of American Indian self-determination with a final promise to American Indians that had first taken embryonic form in his 1968 campaign speech in Omaha: \"I shall ask that the Bureau of Indian Affairs make specific plans to accelerate the transfer of significant portions of its programs to Indian Tribal management, although I repeat my assurance that, while accelerated, these transfers will not be forced on Indian Tribes not willing to accept them.\" 1974 Address at 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Even as the long shadows of possible impeachment over Watergate began to darken the Oval Office in the spring of 1974, Nixon pressed forward with his efforts to pressure the Senate into passing the ISDA. Resurrecting his strategy of sending out surrogates with speeches that he first had tried with Vice President Agnew's Albuquerque speech in 1969, Nixon dispatched his special counsel and the executive assistant to his special counsel to Albuquerque, New Mexico in March, 1974, to deliver two more speeches advocating for the ISDA and American Indian self-determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leonard Garment, Speech to Indian Law Students Association, Albuquerque, New Mexico (March 14, 1974)(available for scan or photocopy at the Nixon Presidential Library); Bradley H.

In the preamble to its report, the 1974 House Committee indicated that one of the bill's goals was to \"provide for the full participation of Indian Tribes in programs and services conducted by the Federal Government for Indians.\" 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7775. The bill, according to the 1974 House Committee, therefore \"authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to contract with Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations for the operation of programs provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service under guidelines and criteria established by the bill....\" 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Providing fellow House members with a quick rationale to support the bill, the 1974 House Committee indicated that S. 1017 provides \"flexible authority to efficiently\n   and realistically permit contracting of Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service programs to the Indian Tribes while maintaining the integrity of the programs and services funded by Federal appropriations.\" 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7782. According to the 1974 House Committee, S. 1017 simultaneously would expand the DOI Secretary's authority and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\"HEW\") Secretary's authority to enter into negotiated contracts with Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations under clear guidelines and contract requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The 1974 House Committee also explained, mostly at the DOI's and the General Accounting Office's recommendation, that it had adopted several major amendments to S. 1017 which the Senate passed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7782.

Just as important, the 1974 House Committee indicated that it had deleted four parts of the Senate bill authorizing new programs, based on the DOI's advice, because the DOI believed that such programs would be duplicative of existing programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7783.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Senate ISDA bill had made no explicit mention whether the HEW Secretary could reduce the amount of funding a Tribe or Tribal organization received if the Tribe or Tribal organization took control of administration of a program. The House Committee added subsection 106(h) that addressed this issue; it provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   the amount of any funds provided to a contractor under a contract shall not be less than the amount the Secretary would have expended had the United States performed the service itself.

Moreover, many Tribes contended that they were paying a financial penalty for the right to contract for the administration of federal programs, as federal agencies did not cover many costs associated with the contract's performance, and these costs therefore came from the Tribes' coffers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 1987 Senate Committee Hearing at 93-97 (Edward Loke Fight).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Federal agencies such as IHS recognized that many of these \"contract support costs\" (\"CSC\") -- first defined in the 1988 amendments, and including costs associated with audits, insurance, legal fees, and accounting fees -- are ones that the agencies would not have incurred themselves had they still been administering the same programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-393, at 4 (1987). In an effort to cover such costs for the Tribes, the BIA started to use a special line item in its Congressional Budget Requests that called for such CSC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-393, at 4. The House and Senate Appropriation Committees, however, requested the BIA to merge CSC with other program funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 99-761, at 4 (1986). Starting in 1985, the BIA decided to cover CSC in another way, grandfathering the costs on a one-time basis in one lump sum in existing contracts at one hundred percent of the level of need in the previous year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 99-761, at 4-5. The BIA never requested, however, that the additional CSC funding from Congress and never received sufficient funds to fully cover CSC that Tribes were incurring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-393, at 4. Because many Tribes lacked sufficient resources to continue operating programs without CSC, many threatened to invoke their right to retrocede contracts to federal agencies under the ISDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 99-761, at 5. Wishing to prevent a mass termination of Tribal contracts, the House of Representatives began to consider ISDA amendments in February 1987, that would (i) guarantee Tribes an adequate level of funding for CSC; and (ii) give Tribes a stronger voice in determining policies affecting the various federal programs for which they were contracting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-393, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     House Report No. 103-653\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   On October 26, 1987, the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs reported proposed ISDA amendments out to the floor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 100-393 (1987). The House Committee found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act ... has furthered the development of local self-government and education opportunities for Indian Tribes, but its goal and progress have been impeded by lack of clarity and direction on the part of Federal agencies regarding their role in implementing the Federal policy of Indian self-determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 100-393, at 1. The House Committee further found that the \"Federal responsibility for the welfare of Indian Tribes demands effective self-government by Indian Tribal communities,\" and that \"additional legislation is necessary to assure that Indian Tribes have an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians.\" H.R. Rep. No. 100-393, at 1 (1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The House Committee therefore proposed multiple ISDA amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 100-393, at 2-3. It recommended amending ISDA \u00a7 4 to define \"contract support costs\" as the reasonable costs for activities which must be carried on by a Tribal organization as a contractor to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and prudent management, but which --\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   (1) normally are not carried on by the respective Secretary in his direct operation of the program; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   (2) are provided by the Secretary in support of the contracted program from resources other than those under contract\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 100-393, at 2 (1987). The House Committee then tackled the issue of CSC funding levels, proposing that the ISDA \u00a7 106(h) be amended to read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   (1) The amount of funds provided under the terms of contracts entered into pursuant to this Act shall be no less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided for his operation of the programs or portion thereof for the period covered by the contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   (2) To the amount available under subsection (h)(1) of this section shall be added the negotiated contract support costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   (4) Costs incurred by the contracting agency in monitoring contracts shall not be subtracted from the amount of funds provided under subsection (h)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   (5) Contract support costs shall be awarded for all programs for which a Tribal organization has contracted pursuant to sections 102 and 103 of this Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   (6) Except for general assistance grants, once contract and grant obligations are negotiated, the contract or grant amount may be decreased only with the consent of the contractor or grantee or to reflect a reduction in congressional appropriations from the previous fiscal year as reflected in the appropriation line item from which the contract or grant funds are derived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   (7) Any savings realized by the contractor or grantee in the operation or administration of such contract or grant shall be used to provide additional services or benefits under the contract or grant and shall be carried over to the succeeding fiscal years without any reduction in the funding to which the contractor or grantee is otherwise entitled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   (8) The appropriate Secretary shall provide supplemental reports to the Congress on or before March 15 of each year identifying any deficiency of funds needed to provide required contract support costs and indirect costs to all contractors for that fiscal year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   (9) The appropriate Secretary shall advise the Congress in annual budget requests of the amount of funds which should have been appropriated in the preceding fiscal year in order to have funded at the full amount the indirect costs and contract support costs negotiated by Tribal organizations pursuant to this Act.

Rep. No. 100-393, at 2-3.

Comm. on Indian Affairs, 100th Cong. (1987)(\"1987 Senate Committee Hearing\"). At that hearing, Tribal witnesses described the ISDA as a constructive public policy that had, among other things, resulted in American Indians using healthcare facilities more frequently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 1987 Senate Committee Hearing at 30 (Ron Allen, Chairman, Jamestown Klallam Tribe, Sequim, Washington). At the same time, Tribal witnesses told the Senate Committee that inappropriate application of labyrinthine federal procurement law and federal acquisition regulations to self-determination contracts had resulted in excessive paperwork and unduly burdensome reporting requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1987 Senate Committee Hearing at 156-58 (Standing Rock).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Perhaps the single most serious problem with ISDA implementation, however, according to the Tribal witnesses at the hearing, was BIA's and IHS' failure to provide full funding for the indirect costs associated with self-determination contracts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   It is very difficult not to believe that the BIA has been playing the budget cutting game largely at the expense of Tribes. For a number of years in its [budget] justification the Bureau under-estimated ... Tribal administrative needs ... and funded Tribes for only a percentage of the indirect costs that were due them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   1987 Senate Committee Hearing at 172 (United South &amp; Eastern Tribes, Inc.). The Tribal witnesses said that the agencies' consistent failure to fully fund Tribal indirect costs had resulted in financial management problems for Tribes as they struggled to pay for federally mandated annual single-agency audits, liability insurance, financial management systems, personnel systems, property management and procurement systems, and other administrative\n   requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 1987 Senate Committee Hearing at 93-97 (Fight)(showing indirect CSC calculations and incomplete federal reimbursement for them). Tribal witnesses indicated that their Tribes had diverted trust resources needed for community and economic development to cover these CSC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1987 Senate Committee Hearing at 150 (Standing Rock).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The Senate Committee took note of these Tribal concerns and held another hearing featuring American Indian Tribal leaders on September 21, 1987 -- this one to discuss proposed ISDA amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Session on S. 1703 to Amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act: Hearing Before the S.

Daniel K. Inouye, Chairman, S. Select Comm. on Indian Affairs). Then-United States Senator Daniel Evans from Washington, the Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee, further shared with witnesses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   It is certainly my hope -- and I know that of the chairman and the members of the committee -- to attempt to move strongly in this field during this congress to try to open up new opportunities to finally fulfill, as closely as we can, the real concepts of self-determination that have been the goal of so many years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Second 1987 Hearing at 2 (Sen. Daniel Evans, Vice Chairman, S. Select Comm. on Indian Affairs). Tribal leaders, for the most part, praised the Senate Committee for the progress it had made to address these concerns over the previous few months, but still insisted there were structural problems with the ISDA's approach to CSC that needed to be remedied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second 1987 Senate Hearing at 24 (Suzan Shown Harjo, Executive Director, National Congress of American Indians). Most particularly, the Tribal leaders indicated that they preferred the language of the House bill amending the ISDA as it related to CSC recovery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   The second recommended change to accomplish is full recovery of costs and funding allocations. The House bill language amending the P.L. 93-638 [the ISDA], defining contract support costs and requiring full allocation of contract support costs, provides a more complete description of what contract funding allocations should be based upon. We\n   would like to see that language given full consideration.... By including this proposed language, Tribes would receive a fair allocation of funds, irrespective of their indirect cost rates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Second 1987 Senate Hearing at 78 (Joseph B. DeLaCruz, President, Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians). Unless Tribes could rely on such strong statutory protection for recovery of full CSC, Tribal leaders maintained that BIA and IHS would continue to fail to provide sufficient funds to cover CSC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second 1987 Senate Hearing at 83 (Clarence W. Skye, Director, United Sioux Tribes of South Dakota Development Cooperation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Taking such critiques to heart, the Senate Committee went to work on the amendments and scheduled a Third Hearing on them for the following month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Session on S. 1703 to Amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act: Hearing Before the S. Select Comm. on Indian Affairs, 100th Cong. (1987)(\"Third 1987 Senate Hearing\"). The Third Hearing, unlike the first two, provided the BIA and IHS witnesses with significant time to present their view of the amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third 1987 Senate Hearing at 25-52. The Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee grilled then-United States Senator John McCain from Arizona, the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, with the latter noting that the agency had veered very far from Nixon's clear intent in Nixon's Special Message to Congress, and had gotten \"bound up in conflicting and probably unnecessary regulations.\" Third 1987 Senate Hearing at 34 (Evans). Responding to a question about CSC from McCain from Arizona indicated that Tribes which found themselves short of CSC to cover overhead could simply dip into their program costs to pay for it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third 1987 Senate Hearing at 37 (Ross Swimmer, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, United States Department of the Interior). Responding to a question from then-Senator Daniel Evans, the IHS Director indicated that inadequate appropriations for CSC at the overall agency level meant that there was a chronic CSC shortfall spread around at the Tribal contractor level as well, but that there was no better solution, because funding excess CSC for one Tribe from a finite pot of money meant that IHS would need to shortchange other Tribes by the equivalent amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third 1987 Senate Hearing at 47-48 (Everett Rhoades, Director, Indian Health Services).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Tribal leaders at the hearing took issue with the Assistant Secretary's and the IHS Director's statements about CSC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third 1978 Senate Hearing at 53-61 (William Ron Allen, Chairman, Jamestown Klallam Tribe, Sequim, Washington). They rejected the suggestion that excess CSC should be funded out of the Secretarial amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Third 1978 Senate Hearing at 53-54 (William Ron Allen, Chairman, Jamestown Klallam Tribe, Sequim, Washington). Tribes also rejected any proposal that CSC should be funded using a flat fee or some other simplified approach, arguing that \"any kind of approach of a flat rate is just not workable within the system of addressing the true costs of the recovery of those costs by the Tribes administering BIA/IHS contracts and grants.\" Third 1978 Senate Hearing at 54 (Allen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   A little more than two months following the Third 1978 Senate Hearing, the Senate Committee had considered and marked up CSC amendments, reporting them to the full Senate on December 22, 1987.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 1 (1987). The Senate Committee called for a \"comprehensive reexamination\" of the ISDA \"to increase Tribal participation in the management of Federal Indian programs,\" and to \"remove many of the administrative and practical\n   barriers that seem to persist\" under the ISDA. S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The Senate Committee also commended ISDA's enactment twelve years earlier as the \"the major reason for assumption by Indian Tribes of responsibility for Federal Indian programs.\" S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 2-3. The transfer of responsibility had been a boon to American Indians, the Senate Committee said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   In addition to operating health services, human services, and basic governmental services such as law enforcement, water systems and community fire protection, Tribes have developed the expertise to manage natural resources and to engage in sophisticated economic and community development. All of these achievements have taken place during a time when Tribes have also developed sophisticated systems to manage and account for financial, personnel and physical resources.... Compared to state, county and municipal governments of similar demographic and geographic characteristics, the level of development attained by Tribal governments over the past twelve years is remarkable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 4. The Senate Committee further found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   Improvements in Tribal financial, personnel, property, and procurement systems have enabled Tribes to manage increasingly complex matters. In response to both federal and Tribal demands for accountability, most Indian Tribes that operate programs now have annual single-agency audits of Tribal finances. The Department of Interior Office of Inspector General has reported an increase in Tribal assumption of responsibility for Tribal financial management.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 4. The Senate Committee noted many more of the improvements that the ISDA had induced in American Indian communities, including custodial care placements for children, outreach to isolated American Indian families through community health workers, increased health facility use, and the construction of safe water and sanitation systems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 5. The common thread among all these successes, according to the Senate Committee, is that the ISDA has given Tribal communities an opportunity to \"plan and deliver services appropriate to their diverse demographic, geographic, economic, and institutional needs. S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   The Senate Committee also found that IHS' actions attempting to implement the ISDA largely had been praiseworthy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 6. As of 1987, the Senate Committee said, IHS directly operated forty-five hospitals, seventy-one health centers, and several hundred smaller health stations and satellite clinics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 6 (citing Indian Health Service, Fiscal Year 1988 Budget Request). Nevertheless, the Senate Committee noted with concern that many Tribes had reported that the IHS had refused to negotiate for the transfer of central office funds and had exhibited an overall resistance to Tribal efforts to redesign programs, and to reallocate resources and personnel in support of Tribal self-determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 6. The Senate Committee therefore provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   [T]he [HHS] Secretary shall negotiate annual funding agreements with each Indian Tribe. These agreements authorize the Tribe to plan, conduct, consolidate, and administer programs, services, functions, and activities to Indian Tribes or Indians. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement and at the request of the Tribe, the Secretary shall provide funds to carry out the agreement in a [sic] amount equal to the amount that the\n   Indian Tribe would have been eligible for under Self-Determination Act contracts and grants. The bill also provides that the Secretary shall interpret each Federal low [sic] in a manner that will facilitate inclusion of programs or activities under the agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 8. The Senate Committee then adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute that made several modifications to language in H.R 3508 as introduced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 8-13. The Senate Committee stated that it was concerned that \"if an Indian Tribe is participating as part of a consortium that Tribe should not be able to contract for any of the programs or activities which are already part of the consortium's self-governance agreement.\" S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 8. The Senate Committee also adopted language which instructed the HHS Secretary to \"interpret each Federal law and regulation in a manner that will facilitate the inclusion of programs and services and the implementation of agreements.\" S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   A more noticeable change to the ISDA that the Senate Committee proposed, however, was to add a sixth title to the statute focused squarely on Tribal self-governance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 14, 17-21. Section 403(g)(3) within that proposed sixth title stated that, subject to exclusions for community colleges, public primary and secondary schools, the Flathead Agency Irrigation Division, and the Flathead Agency Power Division,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   the HHS Secretary shall provide funds to the Tribe for one or more programs, services, functions, or activities in an amount equal to the amount that the Tribe would have been eligible to receive under contracts and grants under this Act, including amounts for direct programs and contract support costs and amounts for those activities that are specifically or functionally related, but not part of the service delivery program, without regard to the organizational level within the Department where such functions are carried out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 20. Furthermore, the Senate Committee clarified in a proposed Section 406(a): \"Nothing in this title shall be construed to limit or reduce in any way the services, contracts, or funds that any other Indian Tribe or Tribal organization is eligible to receive under section 102 or any other applicable Federal law.\" S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   The Senate Committee proposed to add section 106 to clarify provisions for funding self-determination contracts, including direct costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

Starting off with its proposed subsection 106(a), the Senate Committee said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   It is apparent from the wording of the new section 106(a) that the Committee is strongly committed to the principle of assisting Tribes to succeed in their efforts to plan, manage and operate programs and services under self-determination contracts.... The intent of these amendments is to protect and stabilize Tribal programs from inappropriate administrative reduction by Federal agencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 30. The Senate Committee alleged that the BIA had made many such reductions over the years in direct contravention of Tribal funding priorities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 30-31, and threw up subsection 106(a)(5) as a barricade to prevent any such chicanery in the future:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   Section 106(a)(5) would prevent the [HHS] Secretary from reducing funds for a self-determination contract, except in response to a reduction in appropriations\n   enacted by the Congress. Such a reduction should be a proportional, across-the-board reduction.... These amendments are intended to prevent Federal agencies from passing on the entire amount, or a disproportionate amount, of a reduction in Congressional appropriations, to Tribal contracts in order to protect the base for Federally-operated functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 31. The Senate Committee accused the BIA of cutting Tribal self-determination budgets to free up money for pay increases for BIA personnel, of financial mismanagement, and of over-aggressively reducing Tribal programmatic budgets under the guise of congressional-imposed sequestrations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.

That subsection, according to the Senate Committee, would \"require the [HHS] Secretary to add indirect costs to the amount of funds provided for direct program costs associated with self-determination contracts for the initial year of Tribal program operation, upon the request of the Tribal contractor.\" S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 33. The intent behind this provision, according to the Senate Committee, is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   to require the [HHS] Secretary to provide indirect costs for each contract year in addition to the program funding which would have been available to the Secretary to operate a contracted program and to prohibit the practice which requires Tribal contractors to absorb all or part of such indirect costs within the program level of funding, thus reducing the amount available to provide services to Indians as a direct consequence of contracting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 33. The Senate Committee then added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   The combined amount of direct and indirect costs shall then be available for each subsequent year that the program remains continuously under contract. While the Committee has concerns about the changes to the methods of budgeting for and allocating indirect costs funds, whether those methods be the so-called \"grandfather\" approach,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   the single line-item indirect cost fund, or some other method, the Committee does not believe that it should determine the method of distribution. The \"grandfather\" approach and the \"single fund\" approach both have advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of Federal agency budgets and from the perspective of individual Tribal contracts. It is the Committee's hope that the Department of the Interior Office of Inspector\n   General, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Indian Health Service will coordinate their efforts with the Tribes to develop the most effective method of distributing indirect cost funds. The Committee amendment will insure that, whatever method is used, the Tribal contractor will realize the full amount of direct program costs and indirect costs to which the contractor is entitled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   S.

Reagan believed, however, that the ISDA had not gone far enough, having been \"more rhetoric than action.\" Reagan Statement on Indian Policy at 796. Instead of fostering and encouraging Tribal self-government, Reagan said, \"Federal policies have by and large inhibited the political and economic development of the Tribes. Excessive regulation and self-perpetuating bureaucracy have stifled local decision-making, thwarted Indian control of Indian resources, and promoted dependency rather than self-sufficiency.\" Reagan Statement on Indian Policy at 796. Reagan established that his Administration intended to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   reverse this trend by removing the obstacles to self-government and by creating a more favorable environment for the development of healthy reservation economies.

Reagan acknowledged that \"[c]hange will not happen overnight,\" but he was determined to \"honor the commitment this nation made in 1970 and 1975 to strengthen Tribal governments and lessen Federal control over Tribal governmental affairs.\" Reagan Statement on Indian Policy at 797. Delving into specifics, Reagan noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   Tribal governments, like State and local governments, are more aware of the needs and desires of their citizens than is the Federal Government and should, therefore, have the primary responsibility for meeting those needs. The only effective way for Indian reservations to develop is through Tribal governments\n   which are responsive and accountable to their members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Reagan Statement on Indian Policy at 797. For generations, according to Reagan, federal employees had performed functions on American Indians' behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reagan Statement on Indian Policy at 797-98. Despite ISDA passage, Reagan continued, \"major Tribal government functions -- enforcing Tribal laws, developing and managing Tribal resources, providing health and social services, educating children -- are frequently still carried on by Federal employees.\" Reagan Statement on Indian Policy at 797.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Reagan asked Tribes to reduce their dependence on Federal funds by contributing to a larger percentage of the cost for their self-government and pledged to \"assist Tribes in strengthening their governments by removing the Federal impediments to Tribal self-government and Tribal resource development.\" Reagan Statement on Indian Policy at 797. At the same time, Reagan would not simply make Tribes fly before they were fully fledged, ensuring that \"[n]ecessary Federal funds\" would remain available for all Tribes, and developing a Small Tribes Initiative to provide financial support smaller Tribes need to develop basic Tribal administrative and management capabilities.

Although CSC funding had been incommensurate with Tribal needs since the ISDA's enactment in 1975, the shortfalls started to become acute at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, because of Congress' failure to anticipate the increased Tribal demand for self-determination contracts that arose after the 1988 ISDA amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GAO Report at 25-28.

The House Committee commended the IHS for having entered into self-determination contracts with fourteen American Indian Tribes during the previous two-and-a-half years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   H.R.

To the contrary, the House Committee said, Tribal self-determination is to be a permanent policy, and IHS must take steps to \"begin to plan for and implement changes that will result in reductions in the Federal bureaucracy which correspond to the transfer of program funds, resources, and responsibilities to Self-Governance Tribes.\" H.R.

According to the Senate Committee, the major impetus for the bill was the HHS and the DOI's incorrigibility; Congress mandated in 1988 to quickly promulgate simple regulations to govern Tribal self-determination contracts, but the agencies had done the opposite for six years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

The recently promulgated proposed regulations severely undercut Congress' intent in the original Act and those [1988] amendments to liberalize the contracting process and to put these programs firmly in the hands of the Tribes. The proposed regulations erect a myriad of new barriers and restrictions upon contractors rather than simplifying the contracting process and freeing Tribes from the yoke of excessive federal oversight and control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   S. Rep. No. 103-374, at 14. The Senate Committee explained that, because of the agencies' recalcitrance, its proposed 1994 ISDA amendments would cabin their rulemaking authority even more than the original ISDA and the 1988 ISDA amendments had.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

The Senate Committee micromanaged even further, sidestepping the DOI and the HHS and directing the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") to develop new cost principles unique to Tribal organizations for the DOI and the HHS to apply to self-determination contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

Rep. No. 103-374, at 10. The second new subsection would\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   Incorporate ... the longstanding canon of statutory interpretation that laws enacted for the benefit of Indians are to be liberally construed in their favor, and further to clarify that all functions, services, activities or programs or portions thereof, as well as all administrative functions, are contractible, as clearly provided in the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   S. Rep. No. 103-374, at 11.

As \u00a7 2804(f) allows \u00a7 1114 -- which criminalizes killing federal officers -- to apply, if a Tribal officer without a SLEC is not a federal employee for \u00a7 2804(f), the Court must dismiss Counts 1 and 5 against Cleveland. The Court does not, however, have sufficient information to determine definitively whether the Navajo Nation allowed the BIA to enforce Tribal law, which would enable the Secretary to authorize both federal and Navajo Nation law enforcement activity, and bring Tribal officers enforcing Tribal law under \u00a7 2804(f) and, consequently, criminalize killing such Tribal officers under \u00a7 1114. Accordingly,\n   the Court will allow the parties to submit additional information on this topic. If, as is most likely the case, the Navajo Nation did not authorize the BIA to undertake Tribal law enforcement activities, a Tribal officer without an SLEC, like Largo, is not a federal employee for \u00a7 2804(f)'s purposes, and through \u00a7 2804(f), for \u00a7 1114's purposes, and the Court will dismiss Counts 1 and 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   Contrary to the parties' suggestions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3; Response at 8-9, the Court need not and should not decide whether Largo was engaged in federal, official duties.

Tauz Abner Henderson\n   </em>\n   Order at 3. Taking together the Eighth and Tenth Circuit cases and Judge Humetewa's opinion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tauz Abner Henderson\n   </em>\n   , in determining whether the Secretary has \"authorized\" Tribal officers, the Court should begin its analysis in one of two places -- the SLECs or the 638 contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   The Court treats the Tenth Circuit's unpublished decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smith\n   </em>\n   as highly persuasive in determining the Court should begin its inquiry. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smith\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit suggested that \"the authority granted in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"371\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202804\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)\" resulted from a 638 contract.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"372\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20770217\">\n    1999 WL 770217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.

The Tenth Circuit does not mention SLECs. The Court reads this analysis to tie the authority provided by \u00a7 2804(a)(2) to the agreement between the BIA and the Tribe under \u00a7 2804(a)(1), which parallels 638 contracts in authorizing Tribes to undertake traditionally BIA activities. The Tenth Circuit's citation in United States v. Smith to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Young\n   </em>\n   supports this reading. The Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Young\n   </em>\n   uses broad language grouping the personnel for whose aid the BIA enters into an agreement with the persons that \u00a7 2804(f) designates as federal employees.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571848\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/334/\">\n    85 F.3d at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Judge Humetewa relies on \u00a7 2804(a)(3), which follows \u00a7 2804(a)(2)'s authorization to the Secretary, to conclude that \"the authority granted by the Secretary under subsection (a) is tied to the establishment of special law enforcement commissions, as well as the special law enforcement commission agreements referred to in \u00a7 2804(a)(3)(b).\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tauz Abner Henderson\n   </em>\n   Order at 4. Nothing in \u00a7 2804(a)(3) indicates that the Secretary transfers authority through SLECs. Rather, \u00a7 2803(a)(3)'s title, \"Program Enhancements,\" reflects that the provisions are addenda to the Secretary's authorization to enter agreements and confer authority rather than the recipe for conveying such authority.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202803\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Additionally, the Court is unconvinced by Judge Humetewa's citation to \u00a7 2804(a)(3)(B)(ii), which states: \"Each agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall reflect the status of the applicable certified individual as a Federal law enforcement officer under subsection (f).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202804\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(ii).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
