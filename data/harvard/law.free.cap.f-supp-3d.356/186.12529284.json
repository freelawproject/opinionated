Pl.'s Mem. 4, 10. First, Cameron asserts that the hearing officer erred in his determination at step four of the disability evaluation that Cameron was capable of work as a machine packager, which Cameron\n   submits does not reflect his prior work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-10.

Most of Cameron's responsibilities at the adhesive factory are consistent with those of a machine packager as described in the DOT.

Thus, it was logical for the hearing officer to consider the record evidence from the hearing for the previously adjudicated period.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Indeed, the hearing officer here did consider the medical evidence that was the basis for Hearing Officer Carter's prior RFC determination in conducting his own assessment.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 27. He noted that \"there is little evidence of record during this six-month period now under consideration,\" so he was largely limited to considering \"evidence just prior to and following [the] ... period\" before him.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The hearing officer considered many of the same medical reports on which Hearing Officer Carter relied, including the 2006 MRI results.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 28. In addition, he considered what amounted largely to an absence of new evidence that Cameron had sought treatment for back or neck pain during the period under consideration.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    While the absence of new evidence during the second period could suggest that Cameron's condition did not improve, it could also reasonably give rise to an inference that his complaints were overstated. This seems to be the conclusion that the second hearing officer drew. He noted that since an April 2012 x-ray of Cameron's hip showed no acute abnormalities, \"there is no evidence that he has complained of hip pain since.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Further, the second hearing officer gave weight to the fact that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    the record documents no complaints of, or treatment for, low back pain associated\n    with [his recurrent disc herniations], either prior to his amended alleged onset date or up through June 30, 2013, including no evaluations ... and no visits to pain management or to emergent care for treatment of acute pain.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The second hearing officer further explained why he did not give significant weight to evidence of Cameron's disorder of the left foot/great toe and Morton's neuroma (almost all of which originate from after Cameron's date last insured):\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    the record reflects that the claimant was only diagnosed with minimal degenerative changes ... and after receiving cortisone injections in August and September 2013, it documents no further complaints of, or treatment for left foot/great toe pain until ... almost a year after his date last insured, when the claimant reported ... that the steroid injections he had been given had been helpful, and that he was not taking any medication for pain at that time.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The second hearing officer reasonably relied on the absence of new medical evidence and new evidence of Cameron's activities (including a stint as a personal nursing assistant),\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , in addition to his independent and thorough consideration of the entire record to conclude that Cameron had the RFC to perform medium work with additional limitations,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 26.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    This is especially true when there was limited evidence in Hearing Officer Carter's report substantiating her assessment that Cameron was limited to \"sedentary work.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 73. In fact, Hearing Officer Carter's denial observes that contrary to some of Cameron's allegations, he was \"able to perform a wide and varied range of activities ... including shopping, doing chores such as cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry, paying his bills, driving, and going on walks with friends.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 76.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    A claimant who reapplies for disability insurance benefits soon after a denial with \"very little new evidence ... should not have high expectations about success.\"\n    <em>\n     Earley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517427\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/929/#p932\">\n     893 F.3d at 933\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Not only did Cameron's second application fail to supplement the first period's record with substantiating evidence of disability, but its lacunae for the subsequent period gave the hearing officer the opportunity to refine and revise Hearing Officer Carter's conclusions. Substantial evidence thus supports the hearing officer's RFC finding, notwithstanding its modifications to that of Hearing Officer Carter before him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <strong>\n     III.
