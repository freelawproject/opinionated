Miller has been denied the ability to purchase, possess, and use firearms on the basis of a 1998 misdemeanor conviction of the first degree, punishable by imprisonment for up to five years under the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code. Although the conviction does not disqualify Miller from purchasing, possessing, or using firearms under Pennsylvania law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   it does disqualify him under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Under federal law, a person convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment is banned from possessing a firearm for life.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The background of this case revolves around a 1998 misdemeanor conviction. Miller was pulled over for having window-tint on his car that, according to the patrolman who stopped him, was too dark.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    \u00b6 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Miller did not apply for a new exemption for his new car.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, with the aid of a typewriter, white-out, and a scanner, Miller replaced his previously owned car's Vehicle Identification Number (\"VIN\") on the exemption certificate with the VIN of his new car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Miller Dep. 45-49. Miller presented this altered PennDOT certificate to the Magisterial District Justice at his hearing regarding the window-tint violation. Based on the asserted authenticity of this certificate, he was found not guilty of the window-tint violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the hearing, the patrolman who had originally stopped Miller requested a copy of the PennDOT certificate that Miller had proffered to the court. When the patrolman attempted to verify its authenticity, PennDOT informed him that Miller had never obtained a window-tint exemption for his new car. PennDOT informed the patrolman that Miller had only ever received a window-tint exemption for his previously owned car. It then became apparent that the certificate evidencing the window-tint exemption proffered in court had been altered and was not authentic. As a result, Miller was charged with and later pleaded guilty to possessing and using documents issued by PennDOT that he knew were altered in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207122\">\n    75 Pa.

The Court agrees that the\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   factors call for a balancing test, given that no factor is dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As to the first factor, Pennsylvania has classified Miller's crime as a misdemeanor. It is punishable by imprisonment\n   for up to five years, and although the \"maximum possible punishment is 'certainly probative' of the offense's seriousness,\" the classification by the state legislature as a misdemeanor is an important consideration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204699974\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/#p339\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   351-52 ). Indeed, such a classification is \"a powerful expression of [the state legislature's] belief that the offense is not serious enough to be disqualifying.\"\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/#p339\">\n    836 F.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although labeling an offense as a misdemeanor is not conclusive, it is important in the Second Amendment context because it reflects the legislature's assessment of the seriousness of the offense. As the D.C. Circuit has observed, \"[w]hen the legislature designates a crime as a felony, it signals to the world the highest degree of societal condemnation for the act, a condemnation that a misdemeanor does not convey.\"\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519762\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/152/#p155\">\n    913 F. 3d at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20254691\">\n    2019 WL 254691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Here, given that the legislature has classified this type of offense as a misdemeanor, this factor weighs in Miller's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As to the second factor, the Court must consider whether the offense had a violent element. In the instant case, the crime was wholly non-violent. Although \"it is possible for non-violent crimes to be serious, the lack of a violence element is a relevant consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20254691\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, here, this factor weighs in Miller's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to the third factor, the Court considers the actual punishment imposed. As the label of a misdemeanor reflects the legislature's assessment of the offense, the actual punishment imposed reflects a judicial assessment of the gravity of the offense. Here, Miller was sentenced to a year of probation, which he completed successfully. Just as it was important in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   that the challengers each received minor sentences, it is important in Miller's case, too. As the Third Circuit noted, \"severe punishments are typically reserved for serious crimes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20254691\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, this factor also weighs in Miller's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to the fourth factor, the Court considers whether there is cross-jurisdictional consensus regarding the seriousness of the offense.

Here, Miller has also not shown a cross-jurisdictional consensus that many states consider his crime to be non-serious.

Whatever the relative merits of the parties' arguments, the Court need not compare the similarities and differences between Miller's crime and the crimes in the Government's survey because even if this factor is given some weight in the Government's favor, it does not outweigh the other three factors that weigh in Miller's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After balancing the\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   factors and viewing the agreed-upon facts in the light most favorable to the Government, the Court concludes that the crime of which Miller was convicted in 1998, which disqualifies him from purchasing, possessing, or using a firearm, is not a \"serious crime\" under\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Intermediate Scrutiny\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Having found that Miller has met his burden to distinguish himself from individuals convicted of \"serious crimes,\" the Court next considers the second prong:\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   whether \u00a7 922(g)(1), as applied to Miller, survives at least some form of heightened scrutiny.
