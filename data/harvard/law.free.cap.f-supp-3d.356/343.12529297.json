Mason concedes in his opposition papers that \"Kwatinetz executed the Employment Agreement on behalf of the Company,\" rather than in his individual capacity. Opp'n at 11. Because Kwatinetz signed the agreement on behalf of a disclosed principal, Big3, the arbitration agreement would only bind Kwatinetz if there were evidence that Kwatinetz \"clearly and explicitly intended to be subject to the arbitration clause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20144190\">\n    2015 WL 144190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 ;\n   <em>\n    In re D &amp; B Const. of Westchester, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Misc.%203d%201125\">\n    21 Misc. 3d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=875%20N.Y.S.2d%20819\">\n    875 N.Y.S.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204809405\">\n    2008 WL 4809405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Sup. Ct. 2008) (explaining that it is \"well settled that an agent who signs on behalf of a known principal cannot be held to have made a commitment in his or her individual capacity\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mason has not pointed to any evidence showing that Kwatinetz possessed the requisite intent to be bound to the arbitration clause. Mason argues that such intent can be inferred from (1) the fact that the employment agreement refers to the petitioners in various sections and (2) \u00a7 16(d) of\n   the employment agreement, which refers to arbitrating claims that involve executives of Big3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The sections of the employment agreement that mention the petitioners, however, are entirely unrelated to arbitration. Section 2(a), for example, states that Mason was to be the senior-most executive officer of Big3 behind the petitioners. Section 5(c) refers to Mason's capital contributions and ownership interest in the LLC. Section 14(f) provides that Mason would have good reason to resign if the agreement were assigned to another company, other than a company managed by the petitioners. In sum, none of these provisions relate to arbitration. These clauses do not \"clearly and explicitly\" evince an intent on behalf of the petitioners that they be bound to arbitrate. Indeed, Mason points to no cases holding that mere mention of a nonsignatory in an agreement is enough to bind that nonsignatory to the agreement. That the petitioners are mentioned by name in the agreement, in clauses entirely unrelated to arbitration, is not enough to bind the petitioners -- as agents of a disclosed principal -- to the principal's contractual agreement to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mason also relies on \u00a7 16(d) of the employment agreement to argue that the petitioners are bound to arbitrate. That subsection, entitled \"Class Action and Collective Waiver,\" provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [t]he arbitrator shall not have authority to hear or decide class or collective actions, or any representative actions on behalf of other employees. The arbitrator's authority to resolve disputes and make awards under this Section 16 is limited to disputes between: (i) Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and (ii) Executive and any current or former officers, directors, employees and agents, if such individual is sued for conduct arising out of their employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Epstein Decl., Ex. 1 at 15. Mason alleges that romanette (ii) binds the petitioners, along with any other current or former officer, director, employee, or agent of Big3 to submit to arbitration. Section 16(d), however, is not a grant of jurisdiction to the arbitrator over nonsignatories to the agreement. Because romanette (ii) refers to nonparties to the agreement, romanette (ii) must refer to situations where those nonparties consent to arbitrate. Mason's suggestion that romanette (ii) should be construed as an agreement by nonsignatories to be bound to arbitrate is unreasonable. Under Mason's construction, romanette (ii) would apply to bind all employees of Big3 to arbitrate, regardless of their knowledge of or distance from the agreement. A reasonable construction of the contract is that \u00a7 16(d) applies in situations where nonsignatories agree to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mason next argues that the petitioners are estopped from avoiding arbitration because the petitioners directly benefited from Mason's services to Big3, which were provided for in Mason's employment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nonsignatories are estopped from avoiding arbitration when they receive a direct benefit from a contract that contains an agreement to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20144190\">\n    2015 WL 144190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. \"In order for a party to be estopped from avoiding arbitration, that party must have knowingly exploited the agreement containing the arbitration clause\" and received direct benefits from the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Veera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201606054\">\n    2005 WL 1606054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A benefit is direct when it \"flow[s] directly from the agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Lang v.

The \"mere fact of a nonsignator[y's] affiliation with a signatory will not suffice to\n   estop the nonsignatory from avoiding arbitration, no matter how close the affiliation is,\"\n   <em>\n    Oppenheimer &amp; Co. v.

By arguing that the petitioners should be required to arbitrate because of actions they took on behalf of their principal, Big3, Mason seeks to abrogate the corporate form.
