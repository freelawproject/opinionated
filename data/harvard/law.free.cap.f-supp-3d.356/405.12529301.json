(\"MGI\"), Match Group, LLC, and Vimeo, Inc. The first amended complaint alleged that the named defendants infringed six patents through the provision of four online services: Match.com, Tinder, OkCupid, and Vimeo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 17, at 24-53. The six patents include U.S. Patent Nos. 6,240,450 ; 6,397,040 ; 6,578,079 ; 7,243,105 ; 7,974,200 ; and 9,177,297.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendants' corporate structure is relevant to this motion. IAC is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in New York City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. MGI, also a Delaware corporation, is an IAC subsidiary; according to the complaint, IAC \"owns over 81% of [MGI's] stock value, and controls over 97% of [MGI's] voting rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Vimeo, Inc., is also a subsidiary of IAC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Additionally, Match Group, LLC, and Humor Rainbow, Inc., are subsidiaries of MGI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 16. Vimeo, Inc., operates Vimeo. Match Group, LLC, operates Match.com and Tinder. And Humor Rainbow, Inc., operates OkCupid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants IAC and MGI have filed a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss British Telecom's first amended complaint for failure to plead state a claim on which relief can be granted. Dkt. No. 20. IAC and MGI argue that British Telecom has failed to plead facts plausibly demonstrating that IAC or MGI owns or operates any of the alleged infringing services or that either company is liable for any acts of alleged infringement by any of the other defendants. Dkt. No. 21, at 1. According to IAC and MGI, \"[n]either IAC nor MGI operates the accused services[;] [n]evertheless, [British Telecom's first amended complaint] seeks to hold the two companies liable for the alleged infringement by their subsidiary companies that do operate the accused services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. British Telecom disagrees, stating that, aside from vicarious liability, the first amended complaint shows that IAC and MGI \"own and operate each of the underlying accused services, websites, and applications.\" Dkt. No. 27, at 2, 5-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motion to dismiss asserts that IAC and MGI are not liable for infringement on either of two theories: (1) vicarious liability based on an alter ago theory, and (2) vicarious liability based on an agency theory. In response, British Telecom does not allege liability on an alter ego theory, but relies only on an agency theory. Dkt. No. 27, at 11 n.2. The Court will therefore focus on whether British Telecom's first amended complaint is sufficient to meet the pleading requirements for British Telecom's agency theory of liability. Because the Court finds that the pleadings are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under an agency theory of vicarious liability, it is not necessary to address whether the first amended complaint shows that IAC or MGI actually owns or operates the accused services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When presented with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the\n   court applies a two-part analysis: (1) \"the factual and legal elements of a claim should be separated,\" and (2) accepting all of the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true, the court \"must then determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a 'plausible claim for relief.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fowler v.

With regard to MGI, the first amended complaint alleges that MGI: (1) \"represents to the public and shareholders that Match, Tinder and OkCupid are its proprietary brands, operated by [MGI]\"; (2) \"provides the technology\n   and network systems that perform the steps for the Match.com, Tinder, and OkCupid products/services that infringe [British Telecom's] patents\"; (3) \"share[s] [user] information with other Match Group companies to ... improve [users'] chances at building significant connections with others\"; (4) \"directly hires and fires officers of its subsidiaries, including Humor Rainbow, Inc. and ...

No. 17, at 11-17. Those factual allegations, accepted as true, amount to more than bald, conclusory assertions that should be disregarded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BlackBerry Ltd. v.

The first amended complaint notes, at the outset, that in IAC's Annual Reports, \"[a]ll references to 'IAC,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us' ... are to IAC.\" Dkt. No. 17, at 9. It then cites to language from numerous Annual Reports in which IAC allegedly discusses its relationship (using the pronoun \"we\") to the alleged infringing products and services. This language includes: (1) \"[t]hrough Match Group, we operate a dating business ... [and] provide these [dating] services through websites and applications that we own and operate\"; (2) \"we also offer access to our services via various mobile devices through our Match, OkCupid, [and] Tinder ... applications\"; (3) \"[w]e also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems.\" Dkt. No. 21, at 9-12.

While the connection between the grandparent company and its sub-subsidiaries is more attenuated than the connection between MGI and its subsidiaries, the requisite \"evidence of agency required at the pleading stage is minimal....

It cites language from IAC's Annual Reports including: (1) \"[w]e offer basic video hosting and sharing services ... and the ability to sell videos\"; (2) \"[t]hrough Vimeo, we offer video creators ... tools to share, manage distribute and monetize content online, and provide viewers with a clutter-free environment to watch content\"; (3) \"[w]e market Vimeo's services ... through our owned and operated website and mobile applications\"; and (4) \"[w]e also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems\" (language also used to describe IAC's relationship with MGI's subsidiaries).

The\n   <em>\n    Akzona\n   </em>\n   court justified its finding of no agency relationship by comparing its facts to what it deemed to be the stronger facts of the\n   <em>\n    Japan Petroleum\n   </em>\n   case, which also found no agency relationship.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7857882\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/607/227/#p237\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, in\n   <em>\n    Japan Petroleum\n   </em>\n   , following a motion to dismiss based on the plaintiff's agency theory, the court \"deferred its ruling in order to permit the parties to conduct discovery.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031087\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/456/831/\">\n    456 F.Supp. at 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Akzona\n   </em>\n   distinguishable from the current case, in which general agency is at issue and the parties have yet to conduct discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   IAC and MGI also attempt to draw parallels between this case and\n   <em>\n    BlackBerry Ltd. v.

Del. Mar. 20, 2018). In\n   <em>\n    BlackBerry\n   </em>\n   , the court found that Plaintiff BlackBerry's direct infringement claims against two defendants were based entirely on the defendants' agency relationship to a third defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court held that the complaint, consisting of merely three paragraphs related to the defendants' relationships, \"d[id] not state facts supporting the existence of an agency relationship between any of the [d]efendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   IAC and MGI argue that, as in the case of the allegations in\n   <em>\n    BlackBerry\n   </em>\n   , the allegations in this case are \"wholly conclusory.\" Dkt. No. 31, at 7. Again, the Court disagrees. Here, the first amended complaint consists of over 30 paragraphs of factual allegations, with references to Annual Reports, news articles, and websites, discussing the relationship between IAC, MGI, and their subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries. Such allegations far exceed the allegations in\n   <em>\n    BlackBerry\n   </em>\n   , and are sufficient to show that British Telecom has a plausible claim for relief against IAC and MGI under an agency theory of vicarious liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Therefore, IAC and MGI's motion to dismiss for failure to plead facts plausibly demonstrating that IAC or MGI owns or operates any of the alleged infringing services or that either company is liable for\n   the alleged infringement of the other defendants is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Humor Rainbow, Inc. was not named as a defendant in the first amended complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
