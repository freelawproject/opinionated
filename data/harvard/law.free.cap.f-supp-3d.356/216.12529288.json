In doing so, the Court considered Defendant's United States Sentencing Guidelines range, which is determined by his total offense level and his criminal history category (\"CHC\"). The parties disagree about Defendant's criminal history calculation. Defendant argues that his state court conviction and sentence for tampering with evidence-cleaning up evidence of the murder of Edward Brooks in the Miller house basement-is for conduct relevant to the instant offense and therefore is not a \"prior sentence\" which should be included in the criminal history calculation. The Government argues that Defendant's state court sentence is not related to Defendant's federal conviction and therefore should be included in his criminal history calculation. The Court agrees with Defendant for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 23, 2015, James Bryant was indicted in this case for conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute\n   cocaine base in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(c) and 846.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 8 (Indictment) ].

The disputed prior sentence is Bryant's state court sentence for tampering with physical evidence. Thus, the question is whether the conduct for which Bryant was sentenced in state court was part of the same course of conduct as the drug conspiracy conduct for which this Court now sentences him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bryant was part of a conspiracy to distribute drugs along with Chris Miller, Maurice Wearing, Edward Brooks, and others. Wearing supplied Miller with drugs. And Bryant and Brooks were drug runners for Miller. Bryant and Brooks both also lived in the Miller house, out of which the Miller drug operation was run, for periods of time. One night, after learning that Brooks was using drugs, making him an unreliable and potentially risky runner, Miller killed Brooks in the basement of the Miller house. Bryant and Wearing, among others, assisted Miller in the concealment of the murder of Brooks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This clean-up and concealment was in furtherance of the drug conspiracy. Both the drug conspiracy and the clean-up occurred in the same place and at the same time by the same people. The conspirators cleaned-up the murder to avoid detection and investigation of the murder and the murder scene. Such an investigation would have at least temporarily, and possibly permanently, curtailed operation of the drug conspiracy. Thus, Bryant's participation in the concealment of the murder was one in a continuing series of acts done by him in furtherance of the drug conspiracy. Because the clean-up conduct, for which Bryant was sentenced in state court, was part of the same scheme or plan as the drug conspiracy conduct, it is not properly included in Bryant's CHC calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This is consistent with decisions by the Second and Eighth Circuits on this issue. In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Brennan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n    395 F.3d at 70-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant had previously been sentenced for bankruptcy fraud for concealing bearer bonds and casino chips and for money laundering of the bonds and their proceeds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court included that sentence in the CHC calculation when sentencing the defendant for criminal contempt for violation of a freeze order on the defendant's assets-the defendant had failed to declare certain assets and made transfers in violation of the freeze order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n    at 63-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit found that the defendant's bankruptcy fraud and criminal contempt \"were part of the same course of conduct, in that they constituted a repeated pattern of similar criminal acts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n    at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). \"All involved concealing, laundering, investing, and using of [the defendant's] assets for [his] own purposes without the knowledge or consent of the bankruptcy estate or [his] judgment creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, the Second Circuit concluded that the sentencing court should not have imposed criminal history points based on the defendant's bankruptcy fraud sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042794,9166007\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/59/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Like in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   , here, Bryant's prior sentence arose out of conduct relevant to the current conviction-had these individuals not been involved in and seeking to maintain and further the Miller drug conspiracy, the murder likely would not have taken place and there would be no need for the cover up. The conduct at issue in both the prior sentence and this conviction were part of a common scheme and for the purpose of preserving and furthering the drug conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In contrast, the Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stone\n   </em>\n   concluded that the defendant's conduct leading to his driving while intoxicated on marijuana (\"DWI\") conviction and sentence was in no way related to the conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine the court had sentenced him for in the present case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9349832\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/1030/#p1032\">\n    325 F.3d at 1031-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that the defendant's case was not analogous to the facts in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Weiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508152\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/284/878/#p882\">\n    284 F.3d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882-84 (8th Cir. 2002), where the court found that Weiland's state court conviction for possession of marijuana was relevant conduct-part of a common scheme or plan-to his federal charge for conspiracy to distribute marijuana and methamphetamine.\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9349832\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/1030/#p1032\">\n    325 F.3d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This was because \"[n]either the distribution nor the possession of marijuana was included in Stone's indictment\" for conspiracy and the DWI was therefore severable from the drug conspiracy conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9349832\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/1030/#p1032\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A marijuana DWI is undeniably unrelated to a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy, as they do not involve similar conduct, are not part of a common scheme or plan, and the conduct was not aimed at the same purpose. The distinctions between the facts in\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   and those here are evident and, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   , Bryant's tampering with evidence conviction is directly related to and cannot be severed from the drug conspiracy conduct for the reasons discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the clean-up conduct does qualify for a 2-level obstruction adjustment\n   to Bryant's offense level under Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1, which prescribes that an adjustment should be made for obstructing or impeding the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and the obstructive conduct related to either the defendant's offense of conviction and any relevant conduct or a closely related offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Application Note 1 to \u00a7 3C1.1 states that \"[o]bstructive conduct that occurred prior to the start of the investigation of the instant offense of conviction may be covered by this guideline if the conduct was purposefully calculated, and likely, to thwart the investigation or prosecution of the offense of conviction.\" The Court finds this adjustment applicable here and concludes that Bryant's resulting total offense level is 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Bryant's CHC is III, rather than IV, and his total offense level is 27. Based on these parameters, the Guidelines range is 87 to 108 months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    All surveillance footage time references are from the time stamps, which investigators determined to be one hour and two minutes behind Eastern Daylight Time.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    [Dkt. 340 at \u00b6 18].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Defendant's Sentencing Memorandum uses the offense level agreed to in the plea agreement, 29.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    [Dkt. 342 at 6].
