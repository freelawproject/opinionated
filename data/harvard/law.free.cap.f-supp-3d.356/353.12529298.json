In Claim 19, however, the dual purpose of teaching a method to (1) \"induc[e] voiding postponement\"; while (2) \"reducing the risk that the patient develops hyponatremia\" is directed at particular routes of administration.

Serenity proposes the following construction: \"delivering desmopressin by way of a mucosal tissue, such as the sublingual mucosa.\" Joint Disputed Claim Chart at 6.

Ferring's construction seeks to import the additional limitation that, in order for desmopressin to be transmucosally delivered or administered, it must be\n   <em>\n    absorbed.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Disputed Claim Chart at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Claim construction \"begins and ends in all cases with the actual words of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Becton Dickinson &amp; Co. v.

For instance, the specification notes that \"transmucosal include[es] buccal and sublingual (orodispersible tablets, wafers, film and effervescent formulations\" (321 Patent at 23, 17); that \"these amounts and ranges of desmopressin may be administered by any method known in the art, including ... transmucosal (buccal and sublingual, e.g., orodispersible tablets, [etc]\" (321 Patent at 22, 16:51-54); and that \"the available evidence showed that desmopressin administered in the oral cavity (sub-lingually) was not significantly absorbed.\" 321 Patent p. 16, 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, \" transmucosal\" is construed as \"delivering desmopressin by way of a mucosal tissue, such as the sublingual mucosa.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     transmucosal delivery/ transmucosal ... delivery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Transmucosal delivery,\" appearing in claims 2, 6, 10, and 13 of the 203 Patent, is a term Ferring proposes should be construed as \"transmucosal absorption,\" while Serenity proposes \"delivering desmopressin by way of a mucosal tissue,\n   such as the sublingual mucosa.\" ECF No. 158-1 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As discussed above, repeated references by Dr. Fein to transmucosal delivery in the specification suggests he contemplated delivery as a different step in the process from absorption (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   discussion immediately\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ).

While it is true Dr. Fein originally filed patent applications for the 203 and 321 Patents that included numerical dose ranges of desmopressin, he expressly amended those claims to remove dose-specific language.

The Patent Examiner's Notice of Allowance distinguished the 203 Patent from the prior art on the basis of its recited blood/ plasma concentration (expressed as Cmax) of desmopressin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 191-32 (\"[T]he claims are distinguished over the art, as the art did not recognize achieving a Cmax of 10 pg/ml or less\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The linear relationship between dosage of desmopressin and blood/ plasma concentration of the drug-based on various routes of administration and associated bioavailabilities-allows a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice Dr. Fein's low dose discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Allowance, ECF No. 191.32 (\"[I]t would not pose an undue burden to determine what [dose] would be necessary to achieve the requisite desmopressin [concentration] as in the claims, particularly since the examples show a linear correlation between dose and cmax.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, \"a dose of desmopressin sufficient to achieve a maximum desmopressin plasma/ serum concentration no greater than 10 pg/ml\" has a well-understood meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

The claim term \" about 2 ng/kg\" is construed as \"about 2ng/kg based on the standard 70 kg human body weight estimate.\" The rest of the claim term has a well-understood meaning to persons of ordinary skill in the art and requires no further construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     delivering to the bloodstream of the patient an amount of desmopressin no more than about 1 ng/kg\n    </em>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   This claim term, appearing in claim 2 of the 321 Patent, is construed consistent with claim 1 of the 321 Patent (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   discussion immediately supra). Serenity's proposed construction is adopted. The claim term \" about 1 ng/kg\" is construed as \"about 1 ng/kg based on the standard 70 kg human body weight estimate.\" The rest of the claim term has a well-understood meaning to persons of ordinary skill in the art and requires no further construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     an amount of desmopressin sufficient to produce in the patient a urine osmolality ranging above about 300 mOsm/kg\n    </em>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   This claim term, appearing in claim 8 of the 321 Patent, has a well-understood meaning to persons of ordinary skill in the art and, for the same reasons discussed above, requires no further construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 367-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     delivering to the bloodstream of the patient ... no more than about 1 ng/kg desmopressin to produce an antidiuretic effect\n    </em>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   This claim term, appearing in claim 19 of the 321 Patent, is construed consistent with claim 1 of the 321 Patent (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ): \"about 1 ng/kg\" is construed as \"about 1 ng/kg based on the standard 70 kg human body weight estimate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     about 2 ng/kg desmopressin\n    </em>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   This claim term, appearing in Claims 1 and 17 of the 321 Patent, is construed consistent with the identical claim term discussed above: \"about 2 ng/kg\" is construed\n   as \"about 2 ng/kg based on the standard 70 kg human body weight estimate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 368.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     about 1 ng/kg desmopressin\n    </em>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   This claim term, appearing in claims 2 and 19 of the 321 Patent, is construed consistent with the identical claim term discussed above: \"about 1 ng/kg\" is construed as \"about 1 ng/kg based on the standard 70 kg human body weight estimate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 367.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Shared Preamble and the Asserted Claims of the 203 and 321 Patents are construed consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The parties' Joint Disputed Claims Chart (ECF No. 158-1), which purported to address the disputed claim terms and proposed constructions, did not include Ferring's proposed construction for the Shared Preamble.
