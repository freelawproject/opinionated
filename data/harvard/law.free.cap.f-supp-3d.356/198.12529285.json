Furthermore, all her substantial ties and bridges to Puerto Rico remained.\n   <em>\n    SeeAlers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288034\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/59/#p64\">\n    152 F.Supp.3d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Her driver's license was from Puerto Rico, she was financially supported by her parents in Puerto Rico, her official school documents listed her address in Puerto Rico, as did all her medical records, she was considered an out of state student, and she would return to Puerto Rico while school was not in session. (Docket No. 59 at 7-9). Plaintiff argues that \"defendant relies on the fact that at the time the complaint was filed, plaintiff [was] in Florida because she was studying and did not perform some acts that case law has established could be considered to determine domicile.\" (Docket No. 52 at 1). The issue, however, is not that Plaintiff did not perform\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the acts that could be considered to determine domicile, but rather that Plaintiff performed\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that could suggest a change of domicile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated through the facts the specific intent to remain in the state of\n   <em>\n    Florida\n   </em>\n   , as required under case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jimenez-Franceschini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754265\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/867/276/#p280\">\n    867 F.Supp.2d at 280-281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She also did not demonstrate through the preponderance of the evidence a change in domicile prior to filing the Complaint, as all substantial ties remained in Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288034\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/59/#p64\">\n    152 F.Supp.3d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court must follow the presumption that her original domicile of Puerto Rico continued.\n   <em>\n    SeeAlicea-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1586904\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/12/243/#p244\">\n    12 F.Supp.2d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The facts simply fail to demonstrate that Plaintiff had at any point, up to the instance of filing, changed her domicile from Puerto Rico to Florida. An out of state student who at no time was registered as \"in-state,\" with no concrete plans to remain after graduation, who has never requested state residence or a driver's license, was never employed, and never changed her address to an in-state one, has not, pursuant to case law, demonstrated a change in domicile. The assumption remains that Plaintiff maintained her original domicile of Puerto Rico. Even taking Plaintiff's sworn statements as true, she fails to demonstrate any change in domicile. Consequentially, the Court finds that Plaintiff was domiciled in Puerto Rico at the time of filing the Complaint. Thus, diversity jurisdiction does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
