Stearns, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Eric Wickberg is the plaintiff in this putative class action brought against Lyft, Inc. The Complaint alleges that Lyft misclassified him and other potential class members as independent contractors, rather than employees, and avoided paying them the minimum wage and overtime. Lyft now moves to stay the action and compel arbitration or, in the alternative, to strike the class allegations. For the reasons to be explained, Lyft's motion to compel arbitration will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lyft is a ridesharing platform that uses a smartphone application to connect riders with available drivers for a fee. Wickberg is a Massachusetts resident who has driven for Lyft since September of 2017. When he enrolled online as a driver with Lyft on January 28, 2017, Wickberg clicked a checkbox that stated, \"I agree to Lyft's [September 30, 2016] terms of services.\" Lauzier Decl.

On May 3, 2018, Wickberg reaffirmed acceptance of a nearly identical arbitration provision posted by Lyft on February 6, 2018. However, on May 20, 2018, Wickberg wrote to Lyft's General Counsel stating that he \"would like to opt out of arbitration with respect to claims that are not part of a pending settlement action.\" Lieu Decl.

First, the terms appear \"three-quarters of the way down\" on a screen that offers \"no contextual clue\" that the driver is entering into a binding contract with Lyft. Opp'n (Dkt # 19) at 6. Second, the placement of the terms could be read to suggest that they referred to the driver's personal information or the use of the promo or referral codes. Third, the terms were \"buried amidst a multi-screen sign-up process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Fourth, the terms are \"the smallest font on the page and ... visually dwarfed by other more prominent text.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. And finally, the hyperlinked text \"is not italicized, bolded, underlined, or in classic blue coloring to indicate that it is a hyperlink.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, most drivers, according to Wickberg, \"would not think they were agreeing to a binding employment contract; they would not realize that they could click on the hyperlink to view the contract's terms, nor would they have reason to know that there was an arbitration provision in Lyft's contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wickberg primarily relies on\n   <em>\n    Cullinane v.

The Court determined that the layout and design of Uber's registration screen rendered the hyperlinked \"Terms of Service &amp; Privacy Policy\" insufficiently conspicuous.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517388\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/53/#p61\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517388\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/53/#p61\">\n    at 63-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even though the hyperlink did possess some of the characteristics that make a term conspicuous, the presence of other terms on the same screen with a similar or larger size, typeface, and with more noticeable attributes diminished the hyperlink's capability to grab the user's attention.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, as Lyft points out, Uber's agreement in\n   <em>\n    Cullinane\n   </em>\n   is notably different from Lyft's.

By contrast, Lyft's display of the arbitration agreement conforms to what the First Circuit held would be a conspicuous and enforceable agreement.

In\n    <em>\n     Applebaum v. Lyft, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , a court in the Southern District of New York invalidated an online Lyft agreement because \"the text is difficult to read: 'I agree to Lyft's Terms of Service' is in the smallest font on the screen, dwarfed by the jumbo-sized pink 'Next' bar at the bottom of the screen and the bold header 'Add Phone Number' at the top.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265860\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/454/#p466\">\n     263 F.Supp.3d 454\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 466 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (emphasis omitted). Similarly, in\n    <em>\n     Talbot v. Lyft, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , a California state court invalidated a Lyft agreement identical to the one at issue here because \"nothing supports the conclusion that (i) the pink words 'Terms of service' were a hyperlink or that (ii) they linked to the contract that governed the working relationship between Lyft and drivers.\" No. 18-566392, at 8 (Cal. Sup. Ct. Oct. 19, 2018). I find these cases unpersuasive, as they apply New York and California law, and not the law of Massachusetts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    There are four general categories of online contracts:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    Browsewrap exists where the online host dictates that assent is given merely by using the site.
