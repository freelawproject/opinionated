Jeannot has filed a Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. For the reasons noted below, Defendants' Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Housing Authority manages and operates a police department commonly known as the \"Philadelphia Housing Authority Police Department.\" (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 8.) Jeannot began working there as a police officer in approximately September 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 7, 2017, Jeannot was working a shift from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM with his partner for the night, Officer Roland Rodgers (\"Officer Rodgers\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) During his personal time on the shift, Jeannot filled a prescription for Adderall at a Rite Aide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Jeannot alleges that his physician prescribed Adderall \"so that he could maintain the focus, concentration and cognitive functions necessary for him to perform his duties as a police officer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) He further claims that\n   he provided prior notice to his supervisor that he was prescribed Adderall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later that night, Jeannot and Officer Rodgers responded to a domestic dispute \"which [Jeannot] resolved peacefully.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Jeannot claims that Officer Rodgers secretly recorded him during the response to the domestic call and was away from the patrol car speaking on the phone for a significant amount of time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Jeannot, Officer Rodgers recorded him at the instruction of Defendants because of \"the Defendants' perception and suspicion that [he] was abusing his prescription medication and/or other narcotics, acting erratic as a result of abusing such prescription ... and otherwise behaving in a manner which purportedly made him unfit to perform his duties....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the morning of May 8, 2017, at approximately 1:50 AM, Officer Rodgers received a call from the sergeant who said to return to the police headquarters to complete some \"Municipal Police Officer Training.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) When Jeannot and Officer Rodgers returned to the headquarters, the on-duty sergeant informed Jeannot that he could go home early, or else he would have to sit in the office for the remainder of the shift without anything to do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Jeannot went home around 3:45 AM and provided his patrol log and paperwork for the night to Sergeant Matthew Richardson, who said, \"Ok, you're good to go. See you later.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later that same day, Jeannot received a knock on his front door from Lieutenant Hakeem Dunbar (\"Lt. Dunbar\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Lt. Dunbar informed Jeannot that he was under investigation and was being placed on restrictive duty, but he would not give a reason why such actions were being taken. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Jeannot was placed on restrictive duty, he was required to provide Lt. Dunbar with his locker combination for his firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, Lt. Dunbar told Jeannot that he was required to come to his shift the following day in business casual clothing, rather than in his uniform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lt. Dunbar said he could not speak about the reason for restrictive duty, but he asked whether anything \"unusual happened\" the previous night and whether Jeannot \"was ... not feeling well the night before.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Jeannot believes these inquiries to mean Defendants perceived him as \"having abused his prescription medication and was purportedly acting in an erratic manner thereby affecting his ability to perform the essential functions of his duties as a police officer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Jeannot arrived for his next shift, Lt. Dunbar stated he was taking Jeannot to Episcopal Hospital for a drug test based on reasonable suspicion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Jeannot inquired why, if he was on reasonable suspicion on the night/early morning of May 7 and 8, 2017, did the police department not require a drug test then. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Lt. Dunbar responded that the sergeant had made a mistake, but that if everything came back clear, Jeannot would be back working on the street in a few days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Jeannot received a call from his union shop steward \"confirming that Defendants perceived Plaintiff as acting in an erratic manner due to an alleged abuse of Adderall or some other prescription drug/opioid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The following day, another union member informed Jeannot that he \"should 'tell the truth about whether the drug screening would reveal some other narcotic.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) The union member said that if Jeannot was abusing his prescription medication, \"they could get 'ahead of this' and get [Jeannot] into drug 'rehab.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Lastly, the union representative[ ] added that, based upon the Defendants' perception of\n   [Jeannot's] drug abuse, if any other narcotic or opioid was revealed in the drug screening, [Jeannot] would be 'screwed.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Jeannot assured the union member that he was \"confident that no other narcotic/opioid would be revealed in the drug screening and that he believed the Defendants' perception of his alleged drug abuse was unfounded.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jeannot asserts that several police officers confirmed that Defendants perceived Jeannot as a potential prescription drug abuser and unable to perform his job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Jeannot further alleges that Defendants \"approached several officers and asked them whether they had observed anything unusual about [Jeannot's] behavior while on duty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 26, 2017, Jeannot was placed on suspension with a recommendation for \"Discharge/Probationary Separation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Allegedly, Defendants did not provide him with the results of the drug test or an opportunity to make a statement in response to the reasonable suspicion of his apparent drug use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) Regarding his use of Adderall, Jeannot claims that he \"has a written doctor's note stating that his prescription of Adderall would not interfere with his ability to perform his duties as a police officer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) He further avers that the doctor's note \"demonstrate[s] that the Adderall was a reasonable accommodation to assist with his mental thinking, focus and concentration and allow him to perform the essential functions of his position\" as a police officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Jeannot asserts that Defendants have failed to comply with the written directives relating to his discipline or administration of the drug test. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Despite numerous demands for an explanation of Defendants' actions, Jeannot has not received a clear response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Jeannot filed a grievance with his union to seek redress of Defendants' conduct and disciplinary action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) According to Jeannot, Defendants did not \"engage in any interactive discussions to discuss his prescription of Adderall, potential reasonable accommodations, or any other concerns regarding\" Jeannot's ability to perform his duties as a police officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Defendants ultimately terminated his employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Jeannot timely filed suit in this Court following his charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and his receipt of a right-to-sue letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.) In response to Defendants' first Motion to Dismiss, he filed a First Amended Complaint that contained seven counts. Counts I and II alleged actual and perceived disability discrimination in violation of the ADA and PHRA, respectively;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count III alleged retaliation in violation of the PHRA; Count IV alleged aiding and abetting liability under the PHRA; Count V was under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; Count VI was under \u00a7 1983 for retaliation in violation of the First Amendment; and Count VII alleged violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. No. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants again moved to dismiss the entire action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Doc. No. 11.) Before disposing of the motion, the Court signed a \"Stipulation for Partial Voluntary Dismissal of Claims\" that dismissed Counts V through VII without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 14.) On October 2, 2018, we issued an Order and Memorandum Opinion (\"October Order\") that: (1) dismissed with\n   prejudice Jeannot's claim of actual disability discrimination in Counts I and II of the First Amended Complaint; (2) dismissed without prejudice Jeannot's claim of perceived disability discrimination in Counts I and II; (3) dismissed with prejudice Jeannot's claim of retaliation in Count III; and (4) dismissed without prejudice Jeannot's claim of aiding and abetting liability in Count IV. (Doc. Nos. 18, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 12, 2018, Jeannot filed his Second Amended Complaint. Notably, it includes many of the same claims found in the First Amended Complaint. Count I and II restate the perceived disability discrimination claim, as well as the previously dismissed with prejudice claim of actual disability discrimination. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-68.) Count III again alleges a state law claim for retaliation, which was also dismissed with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-71.) Jeannot also reasserts his withdrawn claim of violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-88.) However, Jeannot has also included a new claim for violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants again filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on October 23, 2018. (Doc. No. 21.) The present motion seeks dismissal of all claims, except for the perceived disability discrimination claims in Counts I and II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Claims Previously Dismissed with Prejudice or Voluntarily Withdrawn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To better clarify the issues presented in the instant motion, we initially dismiss the\n   actual disability discrimination claims in Counts I and II and the retaliation claim in Count III. These claims were previously dismissed with prejudice in our October Order, and we adopt our reasoning as explained there to the present motion. (October Order 6-7, 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Likewise, we dismiss all references by Jeannot concerning any claims of FMLA violations. The FMLA cause of action was voluntarily withdrawn by Jeannot on September 14, 2018. (Doc. No. 14.) Jeannot reiterates this in his Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss by acknowledging that the claim was dismissed from the action. (Pl.'s Resp. in Opp'n 1 n.1.) Moreover, it is clear that the sole paragraph relating to an FMLA claim is an inadvertent inclusion, as there is no further mention of such a claim anywhere else in the Second Amended Complaint or Jeannot's briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For these reasons, Defendants' Motion is granted with respect to Jeannot's actual disability discrimination claim in Counts I and II, retaliation claim in Count III, and any reference to an FMLA violation claim in paragraph 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Jeannot's Aiding and Abetting Claim under the PHRA against Defendants Bard and Britt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As we set forth in our October Memorandum Opinion, under the PHRA, it is unlawful for any \"person[ ] [or] employer ... to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice ... or to attempt ... to commit any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20955\">\n    43 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Jeannot again brings a claim of aiding and abetting against Bard and Britt. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Previously, we concluded that Jeannot's aiding and abetting claim failed for two reasons: (1) we had dismissed all primary violations of the PHRA or federal law counterpart, and therefore, the claim could not stand alone; and (2) that, nevertheless, Jeannot failed to plead any facts that Bard and Britt had any relationship to the claims of discrimination. (October Opinion 11-12.) Since Defendants do not move to dismiss the perceived disability claim from Jeannot's Second Amended Complaint, a primary violation survives in this case and allows an accompanying claim for aiding and abetting. Consequently, our first reason for dismissal has been remedied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, Jeannot's claim still fails to plead any relationship between Bard and Britt and his claims of discrimination. To find individual liability, a plaintiff must show that a \"supervisory employee ...

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. in Opp'n 6-7.) First, Jeannot argues that he has a property interest in his position as a municipal police officer and that Defendants deprived him of that interest without conducting either \"pre-termination or post-termination proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Second, Jeannot believes that he has a liberty interest in his \"right to take his prescriptions and protect his physical and mental health.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) According to Jeannot, that liberty interest was \"stripped\" from him when Defendants \"failed to follow their procedures for conducting the drug test, failed to inform [him] of the ... test results, engaged in [an] adverse employment action by suspending and terminating him, retaliated against him after he complained about [their] illegal and improper conduct, and otherwise punished him for simply taking his prescriptions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Jeannot's Deprivation of Liberty Interest Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We begin by quickly addressing Jeannot's second, and more novel, argument. Aside from a handful of generic references to Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Jeannot offers no legal or factual basis to support his claim that he was deprived of a liberty interest without due process. \"The liberty interests protected by procedural due process are broad in scope.\"\n   <em>\n    Robb v.

While Jeannot was informed by Lt.

However, regardless of Bard and Britt's policymaking authority, Jeannot's claim fails because he does not allege their conduct was unconstitutional. As we discussed previously, the only action allegedly taken by Bard and Britt was to sign Jeannot's Notice of Suspension. (Notice of Suspension;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476534\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/562/#p564\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section IV-B.) This action establishes only that Bard and Britt made the decision to suspend Jeannot with the intent to terminate. However, Jeannot does not allege that Bard or Britt made the decision to deprive him of his due process rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pembaur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204596\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/469/#p480\">\n    475 U.S. at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204596\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/469/#p480\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We hold that municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 attaches where-and only where-a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made ... by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.\") Therefore, he cannot hold the municipality liable for their actions in signing the Notice of Suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Relatedly, the third theory of liability fails for similar reasons. It is clear from Jeannot's factual allegations that Bard and Britt did not authorize any decision made by a subordinate to deprive Jeannot of his due process rights. To properly allege that a policymaker ratified a subordinate's decision, a plaintiff must show that the policymaker approved of the decision, as well as\n   <em>\n    the basis\n   </em>\n   for the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Praprotnik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13744\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/112/#p127\">\n    485 U.S. at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13744\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/112/#p127\">\n    108 S.Ct. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Since, at that time, neither party had moved to amend the case caption, we adopted the same spelling. For the same reason, we continue to do that again here, despite a signed document by Mr. Britt being attached to Jeannot's Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint that clearly shows his name as \"William.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    We take the facts alleged in the Second Amended Complaint as true, as we must when deciding a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Connelly v.

In his Response in Opposition, he admits in a footnote that it was previously withdrawn and he does not include it among the list of remaining claims in this case. (Pl.'s Resp. in Opp'n 1 n.1.) However, it is possible that the footnote was inadvertently carried over from a previous filing in this Court, as the footnote makes no mention of Jeannot's entirely new claim of due process that he added in his Second Amended Complaint. Additionally, Jeannot provides a brief, two-sentence defense of his equal protection claim in his Response. For these reasons, we address Jeannot's equal protection claim on the merits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Specifically, this claim resembles a subset of the \"class-of-one\" theory: \"vindictive class-of-one.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Esmail v.
