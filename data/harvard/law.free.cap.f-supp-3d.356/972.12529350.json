He claims that because his offense was nonviolent, the BOP had to grant him early release after he completed its Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP) in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statute gives the BOP discretion to reduce the sentences of prisoners who participate in RDAP if they were convicted of a \"nonviolent offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). But the BOP's exercise of this discretion does not depend on whether an offender's conviction meets the categorical definition of \"crime of violence.\" Of course, an inmate convicted of a violent crime as defined by federal statutes\n   like\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) would naturally be ineligible for early release under \u00a7 3621. But even if a prisoner is statutorily eligible for early release consideration, the BOP may deny early release in its discretion to certain categories of nonviolent offenders. Those categories include prisoners convicted of an offense involving the \"carrying, possession, or use\" of a firearm or that \"by its conduct\"-if not \"by its nature\"-presented a serious potential risk of physical violence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20550.55\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(ii), (b)(5)(iii) (2016). So even if Petitioner's offense were not a crime of violence, the BOP still reasonably applied these two early-release exclusions in its regulation to Petitioner's firearms offense under \u00a7 5861(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Whether released early or not, Petitioner also seeks to block the BOP from notifying state and local authorities of his eventual release from federal custody. Currently, his projected release date is sometime in September 2019. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204042\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), the BOP may disclose to law enforcement authorities the names, criminal histories, and conditions of supervised release of federal prisoners convicted of a \"crime of violence\" as defined by \u00a7 924(c)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204042\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). For the same reasons that Petitioner considers his conviction nonviolent for early-release purposes, he contends that notification under \u00a7 4042(b) is prohibited because he committed no crime of violence. Yet he presents no evidence that the BOP has reached a \"final\" agency decision to make notification of Petitioner's release. And in any event, he fails to show that such statutory notification meets the \"in custody\" requirement for federal habeas jurisdiction. For these reasons, the Court lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to block the BOP preemptively from notifying state and local authorities of Petitioner's eventual release from federal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To overturn the BOP's decision denying him early release, Petitioner must prove that it \"is contrary to established federal law, violates the U.S. Constitution, or exceeds the statutory authority Congress vested in the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Staacke v.

Petitioner does not claim-nor could he-that he has a constitutional right to early release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal &amp; Corr.

So Petitioner must show that the BOP either exceeded its statutory authority or violated \"established federal law.\" He can do neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For his statutory claim, Petitioner contends that because his conviction is not a categorical \"crime of violence,\" the BOP misapplied \u00a7 3621, which authorizes early release for prisoners convicted of a \"nonviolent offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). True, the BOP found Petitioner ineligible for early release in part because it classified his offense as a crime of violence \"in all cases.\" BOP Prog. Stmt. 5162.05 \u00a7 3.a (2009) (so classifying all offenses under \u00a7 5861 ). Whether that categorization under the BOP's agency policy is a permissible interpretation of \u00a7 3621 is debatable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But even if Petitioner's offense is not a categorical crime of violence, that does not mean the BOP must grant him early release under \u00a7 3621.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner's argument to the contrary misunderstands the BOP's statutory authority and how it evolved. The agency's earliest efforts to exercise its authority under \u00a7 3621 predicated eligibility for early release on the definition of \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)(3),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20550.58\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995)-an approach that the Ninth Circuit invalidated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834342\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/566/#p569\">\n    109 F.3d at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But since then, \"the BOP dropped the reference to \u00a7 924(c)(3) and instead asserted its discretionary authority to determine eligibility for early release under \u00a7 3621(e).\"\n   <em>\n    Peck v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622986\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/767/#p770\">\n    697 F.3d 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 770 (9th Cir. 2012). This shift meant that the BOP could \"disqualify otherwise statutorily eligible inmates\" convicted of nonviolent offenses based on additional discretionary criteria having nothing to do with categorical definitions of \"crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622986\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/767/#p770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Both the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit then ratified this approach as consistent with Congress' grant of authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

So even if Petitioner's conviction is categorically nonviolent as he maintains, the BOP can still properly deny him early release without exceeding its statutory authority. While a conviction for a nonviolent offense is necessary for early-release eligibility, it is not alone sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505549\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/230/#p244\">\n    531 U.S. at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505549\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/230/#p244\">\n    121 S.Ct. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That leaves, then, only the question whether the BOP's denial of Petitioner's request \"is contrary to established federal law.\" For this, the Court can look to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and review whether the BOP complied with its own regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inland Empire Pub.

In so doing, the Court evaluates whether the BOP's decision was \"arbitrary [and] capricious\" or an \"abuse of discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). But the \"scope of review under the 'arbitrary and capricious' standard is narrow,\" and the Court is not free \"to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Veh. Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.

In other words, the Court must presume agency action is valid and uphold it so long as there was a reasonable basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sacora v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076084\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/1059/#p1068\">\n    628 F.3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1068 (9th Cir. 2010). Under this deferential standard of review, the BOP's denial was based on a reasonable interpretation of its regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To begin with, the BOP found that Petitioner's offense was disqualifying as an \"offense that, by its nature\n   <em>\n    or conduct\n   </em>\n   , present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical force.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20550.55\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(iii) (emphasis added). The emphasized portion is important, for even if Petitioner's offense were nonviolent \"by its nature,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B), and thus not a categorical crime of violence, the regulation separately permits the BOP to evaluate his offense \"conduct\" as well-meaning\n   the \"particular facts relating to petitioner's crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Leocal v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    543 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Through that lens, the BOP permissibly looked to Petitioner's \"offense conduct described in [his] Presentence Investigation Report\" and reasonably found that \"transferring multiple firearms\"-including machine guns with obliterated serial numbers-in violation of federal registration requirements presented \"a serious potential risk that the illegally obtained firearms could be used against the person or property of another.\" (ECF 1 at 23). It is hard to find that assessment unreasonable. The Ninth Circuit itself has recognized that mere \"possession of an unregistered firearm of the kind defined in [the National Firearms Act], even if by a non-felon, involves a [ ] blatant disregard for law and a substantial risk of improper physical force.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523313\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/946/615/#p621\">\n    946 F.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (9th Cir. 1991). The BOP could thus surely decide that no matter the categorical \"nature\" of Petitioner's offense of conviction, his offense \"conduct\"-selling improperly registered and untraceable firearms, including machine guns with obliterated serial numbers-presented a serious potential risk of violence to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The BOP also reasonably interpreted Petitioner's offense of illegal firearm transfer in violation of \u00a7 5861(e) as a crime involving the \"carrying, possession, or use of a firearm.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20550.55\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(ii). As already discussed, that exclusion does not depend on a categorical match with any statutory definition of \"crime of violence.\" So contrary to Petitioner's argument, whether he could legally carry or possess firearms as a licensed firearms dealer at the time of his offense is beside the point. The disqualifying conduct of \"carrying, possession, or use\" of a firearm need not result in a freestanding conviction based on that specific conduct for the regulation to apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505549\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/230/#p244\">\n    531 U.S. at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505549\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/230/#p244\">\n    121 S.Ct. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( section 550.55(b)(5)(ii) applies so long as inmate \"possessed a firearm\n   <em>\n    in connection with\n   </em>\n   [his] nonviolent offense[.]\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    Peck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622986\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/767/#p770\">\n    697 F.3d at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applicability of \u00a7 550.55(b)(5)(ii) does not require that regulation's prescribed conduct be a \"crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nor should it matter that the text of this regulation says only \"carrying, possession, or use\" of firearms-not their \"transfer.\" The lack of that word means only that the regulation is ambiguous, not that its application to a firearm transfer offense is prohibited. If the BOP's interpretation of an ambiguity in its own regulation is reasonable, the Court must uphold it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auer v.

Here, the BOP could reasonably decide that the crime of unlawfully transferring firearms necessarily involves the requisite \"possession\" under \u00a7 550.55(b)(5)(ii) : a person must naturally possess something, after all, in order to transfer it. And Petitioner does not deny that his crime involved the \"carrying, possession and use\" of firearms, only that those discrete actions were \"lawful under Title 26\" even if his later \"transfer\" of them turned out to violate \u00a7 5861(e). (ECF 1 at 18). But the fact of his possession-not its legality-is what matters. As a result, the BOP's decision denying Petitioner early release based on \u00a7 550.55(b)(5)(ii) was not an unreasonable interpretation of its regulation under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, Petitioner's release-notification claim is not ripe for review under the APA, nor is it cognizable under \u00a7 2241.
