Counts 3 and 4 were the predicate crimes of violence for Count 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under a written plea agreement, on June 30, 2006, Larode pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree as charged under Count 2 and to using a firearm during a crime of violence as charged under Count 5. Counts 1, 3, and 4 were dismissed on the Government's motion. The plea agreement incorporated a signed statement of facts that established the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 11, 2005, defendant Ossie K. Larode approached Mr. Byung Ki Kim outside the McDonald's restaurant located at 1000 North Henry Street, in Alexandria, Virginia, knocked the keys to a 2003 Cadillac Seville from Kim's hand, threatened to shoot Kim if he didn't back away, got in the vehicle and drove off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Kim telephoned a report of the carjacking to the Alexandria Police Department, and Alexandria police and other law enforcement officers began looking for the vehicle. One of those officers spotted the vehicle in Alexandria and began a pursuit that eventually was joined by other officers and led to Interstate 395 in the vicinity of the Pentagon. As Larode drove by the Pentagon, he suddenly turned the wrong way on to [sic] an exit ramp that led from the Pentagon South Parking Lot to Interstate 395, and sped toward the South Parking Lot, followed by several pursuing\n   officers. As he left the ramp he continued the wrong way on South Rotary Road, which runs along the perimeter of the parking lot and which is in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   At that same time, James Feltis, a federal employee and officer with the Pentagon Police Department, was on duty outside a traffic control booth on South Rotary Road. Apparently, thinking that Larode was simply lost or confused, Feltis stepped into the traffic lane and into the path of the Cadillac and signalled [sic] for him to stop. Instead and without making any effort to slow down or stop, Larode struck Feltis, critically injuring him and knocking him into the air.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Feltis was medevaced to Inova Fairfax Hospital, in Fairfax, Virginia, where he died, having never regained consciousness, on February 14, 2005, as a proximate result of the injuries he incurred when he was struck by Larode. Throughout his attempt to elude the pursuing officers, including the time immediately before his striking of Feltis, defendant Larode drove the stolen Cadillac recklessly with extreme disregard for human life. His taking of Feltis' life was unlawful and did not result from accident, inadvertence or other [sic] innocent reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   After striking Feltis, Larode continued the wrong way on South Rotary Road, up the wrong way on the ramp to Washington Boulevard with several officers still in pursuit and entered Washington Boulevard still going the wrong direction. Larode then tried to turn in the right direction, and as he did so, his car was struck and stopped by one of the pursuing officers. Once Larode stopped, one of those officers ordered him to get out of his vehicle. When he didn't, the officers broke the drivers [sic] side window and pulled Larode from the vehicle. A struggle ensued between Larode and the officers, during which Larode assaulted three Pentagon Police Department officers, who were assisting in subduing Larode, and all of whom at the time were employees of the United States engaged in the performance of their official duties. In the course of Larode's assaulting the Pentagon Police Department officers, he got possession of one of the other officers' service firearms, a Glock .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol, and fired it three times at them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Larode's assaulting of the three Pentagon Police Department officers was unlawful as was his using, brandishing and discharging the pistol during and in relation to that assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Statement of Facts [Dkt. No. 55] \u00b6\u00b6 1-6. Larode's plea was accepted, and he was sentenced to a total of 382 months' imprisonment, consisting of 262 months for Count 2 and 120 consecutive months for Count 5, among other penalties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Larode did not appeal either his conviction or his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 23, 2016, Larode filed a motion pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   arguing that his conviction for using a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) should be vacated in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), which held that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(\n   <em>\n    ii\n   </em>\n   ) -what is known as the \"residual clause\" of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\")-was unconstitutionally vague,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    at 2556-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government moved to dismiss Larode's \u00a7 2255 motion. In December 2016, the Court stayed these proceedings to await the decision in what became\n   <em>\n    Sessions v.

After the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   opinion was issued, the stay in these proceedings was lifted, and the Government was ordered to show cause why Larode's motion should not be granted.

The Court identified two particular aspects of the ACCA's residual clause that made it constitutionally problematic. First, the Court's jurisprudence had previously established that a court tasked with deciding whether the ACCA's residual clause covers a prior conviction must employ the \"categorical approach,\" under which the court must \"picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in 'the ordinary case,' and ... judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    James v.

The Court observed that there are many strategies a court may employ in deciding what the \"ordinary case\" of a crime involves, that those strategies often produce contradictory conclusions, and that the residual clause \"offers no reliable way to choose between these competing accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2557-58. Second, \"the residual clause leaves uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2558. The Court made clear that the constitutional defect in the ACCA's residual clause stemmed from the combination of these two characteristics.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"It is one thing to apply an imprecise 'serious potential risk' standard to real world facts; it is quite another to apply it to a judge-imagined abstraction.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that under a \"straightforward application\" of\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 16(b)'s residual clause, like the residual clause in \u00a7 924(e), is also unconstitutionally vague.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1214-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   Court reasoned that \u00a7 16(b)\"has the same two features ... combined in the same constitutionally problematic way\" as \u00a7 924(e) : it requires courts to use the categorical approach\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and at the same time does not make clear \"what threshold level of risk\" must be satisfied to classify a\n   given crime as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    at 1213-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Larode contends that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), which is similar to \u00a7 924(e) and nearly identical to \u00a7 16(b), is also unconstitutionally vague and that therefore his conviction for violating \u00a7 924(c) must be set aside. The Government responds that Larode's \u00a7 2255 motion is barred by a bevy of procedural obstacles and, in any event, fails on the merits.

The Government disagrees, arguing that the residual clause may fairly be read to require a \"conduct-specific\" approach-one based on the defendant's actual, real-world behavior rather than on a generalized analysis of the nature of the crime charged-and that such an approach would avoid any constitutional defects in the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This Court has adopted the Government's view in other \u00a7 924(c) cases,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526827\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/326/228/#p236\">\n    326 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   243-47 ;\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527072\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/330/1076/#p1086\">\n    330 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1093-97 ;\n   <em>\n    Royer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526662\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/719/#p728\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d at 737-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as have multiple federal courts of appeals,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Larode carjacked a Cadillac and fled, leading police on a dangerous pursuit \"with extreme disregard for human life.\" Statement of Facts [Dkt. No. 55] \u00b6 3. As Larode sped the wrong way down a one-way road, his car struck Feltis, throwing him into the air, knocking him unconscious, and injuring him so severely that he would die a month later. Once three Pentagon Police Department officers finally managed to stop Larode's car and pulled him out of the vehicle, he proceeded to struggle violently with the officers. During the struggle, he grabbed an officer's service firearm and fired it at the officers three times. There is simply no doubt that by violently fighting with the three federal officers and firing a gun at them, Larode committed a criminal offense that \"by its nature ... involve[d] a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another\" would be used,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B).

As discussed above, the predicate offenses for Larode's \u00a7 924(c) conviction were assaulting a federal officer in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20111\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and attempted murder of a federal officer in violation of \u00a7 1114. Because assaulting a federal officer qualifies as a crime of violence under the force clause-at least where, as here, the defendant is charged under \u00a7 111's enhanced-penalty provision-the Court need not address whether attempted murder of a federal officer also qualifies under that clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Under Fourth Circuit precedent, analyzing whether an offense falls within the force clause's ambit requires the Court to apply the categorical approach,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   considering\n   only \"the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the ... offense\" and ignoring any particular facts about the defendant's actual conduct.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
