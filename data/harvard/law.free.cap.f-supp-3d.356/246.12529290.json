In this Court's view, the bail factors support continued detention rather than release by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defense asserts federal fraud charges, though \"serious,\" are not the type of dangerous or obstructive criminal activity that demand long-term pretrial detention. According to the defense, \"white-collar fraud defendants are almost always released on bail prior to trial, unless there is specific evidence that the defendant is willing to subvert the justice system or otherwise cannot be trusted to comply with the Court's orders.\" Def.'s Appeal at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   According to the Government, Defendant and his employer, Privinvest, are at the center of a $ 2 billion fraud, bribery, and money laundering scheme. The Indictment alleges the $ 2 billion in loan funds went to Privinvest, and Defendant personally received $ 15 million for his role in the scheme. Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 24-26. Defendant and his co-conspirators allegedly orchestrated and paid bribes and kickbacks, procured secret government guarantees, and bloated borrowing and lending by corrupt government officials and bankers. Gov.'s Opp'n. at 7. These actions resulted in staggering losses to not only foreign, but American investors, and devasted the economy of Mozambique, causing \"Mozambican companies and the Mozambican government [to default] on $ 2 billion in loans and ... miss[ ] more than $ 700 million in loan payments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If convicted, Defendant faces a cumulative statutory maximum of 55 years imprisonment. In sum, the Government argues \"this serious potential sentence,\" \"the staggering losses to investors,\" and \"the real world effect of the defendant's actions\" highlight the seriousness of this case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The federal fraud charges, which implicate devasting loss amounts upwards of $ 2 billion, are indeed serious. Moreover, Defendant is not just alleged to be a participant, but the principal figure in a fraud, bribery, and money laundering scheme of international proportions. As this Court has observed, a defendant's \"alleged ties to a large [ ] syndicate indicate that he has strong connections to people who have the resources to, ability to, and interest in helping him flee the jurisdiction\" favors denying bail. Moreover, if convicted, Defendant will face lengthy and onerous maximum penalties. When faced with the possibility of a significant prison term, defendants have a strong incentive to flee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabhnani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3511280\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/63/#p75\">\n    493 F.3d at 66-67, 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting defendants had a strong motive to flee in part because they were charged with a serious crime and, if convicted, they would likely face a lengthy sentence of incarceration-a statutory maximum of 40 years imprisonment and a Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Weight of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defense argues the Government fails to proffer sufficiently strong evidence against Defendant. According to the defense, the Indictment focuses on evidence of bribes paid to co-conspirators and false statements made to investors, which do not support the allegations of wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering charged against Defendant. Def.'s Reply at 7. The defense also asserts Defendant has strong extraterritoriality and willfulness defenses. Because the Indictment, as the defense characterizes it, \"does not allege that any securities transaction occurred in the United States\" and \"fails to set forth with any specificity the Government's allegation as to the defendant's domestic conduct,\" applying the federal fraud and money laundering statutes to the defendant's extraterritorial conduct would be a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to due process. Def.'s Reply at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Government argues the overwhelming evidence against the defendant favors his detention because it provides him with a motive and incentive to flee. The Government has proffered numerous emails sent by Defendant that allegedly show he participated in an agreement to pay $ 50 million in bribes, instructed kickback payments to investment bankers, and planned and executed a money laundering scheme involving false invoices to mask payments to co-conspirators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Opp'n at 8. The Government has also gathered correspondent bank records confirming these alleged bribes and kickbacks in fact occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Mem. at 16. As an example, the Government references an email exchange showing a \"a thinly-veiled reference to bribes,\" in which a Mozambican government co-conspirator requested '50 million chickens,' and the defendant responded, 'LOLLLLL. I love your chicken bro. Done.' \" Indictment \u00b6 32(a) ). This \"arrangement\" ultimately resulted in $ 50 million in bribes paid to Mozambican government officials according to the Government. Gov.'s Mem. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because it is \"contrary to our legal system to impose punishment for a crime that a defendant has not yet been shown to have committed,\" courts are cautious in affording undue weight to this factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
