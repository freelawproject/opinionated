The shop stood on land ol one Crampton, having been built there under a lease from him. Henry S. Halsey, the brother of the defendant Halsey, on April 8, 1825, being then owner of the shop, and Emeline his wife, mortgaged to the plaintiff a small lot of land opposite to the shop and also by the same deed mortgaged the shop to the plaintiff, to secure a note for 169 dollars, payable in two years from that date. The shop was pulled down before the expiration of the two years, and there was no evidence of any entry into it by the plaintiff before it was pulled down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-9\">Henry S. Halsey had absconded before the shop was pulled jown, leaving his wife in possession of the premises, which he had agreed to convey to his brother, the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-10\">The defendant Avery was standing by, at some distance from the shop, with a team, while the defendant Halsey was pulling it down, but did not assist in taking it down. After Avery\u2019s team was loaded with the materials, and he was moving with it on the road, the plaintiff threatened to prosecute him if he did not carry it back. Avery however drove on with his load, and met one Fosket, to whom he said he did not know but he-had got into trouble, and asked him what he should do. Fos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ket said he was going to get leave of the plaintiff to buy the materials of the defendant ; and then went and asked the plaintiff if he had any objections to his purchasing ; who said he had none, for he had been informed that he should have his remedy against the defendant. Fosket then told Avery he had bought the materials and Avery drove on his load.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-3\">The jury found a verdict against each of the defendants, assessing damages at seventy-five dollars against Nathan Halsey, and two dollars against Avery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\">Judgment was i0 be entered on the verdict, or the plaintiff to become nonsuit, according to the opinion of the Court, or if the action should be supported against Halsey, and not against Avery, a verdict of not guilty was to be entered for Avery.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Aryu\">\n<em>Sept 9th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-5\"><em>Dwight </em>and <em>Bishop, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5Tu\">contended that the plaintiff, not being in possession, could not maintain trespass ; and that the mortgager was the only person who could maintain trespass, while in possession. <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>6 Johns.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOE\">delivered the opinion of the Court. In regord to personal property or chattels, the law is that trespass may be maintained by one who has the actual or constructive possession. Constructive possession is where the general owner, although the chattel is in the actual possession of another, has the right to reclaim it immediately, the person in possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>not being entitled to retain it against his will. A strong case to illustrate this position is put in Bac. Abr. Trespass, C, 2. If the owner of a chattel, which is in York, gives it to J S. who is in London, and it is taken or injured by a stranger, J. S. may maintain trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The blacksmith\u2019s shop, the subject of this suit, was mort gaged to the plaintiff to secure the payment of a debt in two years. We presume this mortgage to be valid against Henry S. Halsey the mortgager. The plaintiff, as mortgagee, had a right to the possession immediately. At the time the shop was pulled down, it was unoccupied, and therefore the possession was, according to the title, in the mortgagee. It is very clear that he had a right to an action of trespass for destroying it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">As to the other defendant, he was a trespasser in taking away the materials ; the trespass was complete, when he moved off with the lumber, and the right of action then vested. The subsequent transactions with Fosket could not amount to a re lease, accord or relinquishment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\"> See <em>Lunt </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>13 Maine R.
