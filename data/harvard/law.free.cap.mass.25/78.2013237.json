Issues were joined on these pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">At the trial, the defendant, to support bis second plea, offered evidence to prove, that after the execution of the indenture <em>the </em>plaintiff did buy and sell lottery tickets in the shop occupied by him. To this evidence the plaintiff objected, because it related to matter posterior to the execution of the indenture, and also, because the object of the indenture could not be proved by paroi evidence ; but it was admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff on the first issue ; and for the defendant, on the second.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-10\">The plaintiff moved for a new trial, on the ground that the evidence ought not to have been admitted.
