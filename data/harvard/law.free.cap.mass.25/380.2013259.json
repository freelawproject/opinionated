In April following, Sheldon, Strong and Lyman, being selectmen and assessors, put into the hands of A. Searl, who was one of the surveyors of highways, a paper signed by them as selectmen, and directed to Searl, which was as follows : \u2014 \u201c Tax $ 23-87. Sir, You will repair the road from &amp;c.

It was admitted that the credit to Kentfield was given correctly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">It was agreed, if paroi evidence to this purpose was admis sible, that according to the usual course of proceeding adopted by Southampton, the sum of money voted at their annual March meeting for the support of highways was soon afterward apportioned by the selectmen, who were also assessors, according to the next preceding valuation, among such of the inhabitants as were supposed to be liable to be taxed, though not with any great care that the apportionment should be entirely accurate ; that papers similar to the one before described were by them put into the hands of the different surveyors, containing the names of the inhabitants supposed to be taxable within their respective districts, and the sum so apportioned to each of them ; that each person named therein worked upon the highways or not, as he pleased, and subject to the discretion of the surveyor, without much regard to the amount of his apportionment, the surveyors keeping an account of the work performed ; and that at about the close of the year a tax-bill was made out, including therein all sums of money raised by the town, as well for the support of highways as for other purposes ; when those persons who had thus labored upon the highways, or had other claims against the town, were allowed for their work and other claims in a geneial credit bill. The paper first mentioned was such an apportionment of the sum so voted for highways in 1816, and the general credit bill for 1816, bearing date March 10, 1817, contains the name of Kentfield, with an allowance of 17 cents. But neither did the general tax-bill of 1816, bearing the same date with the geneeral credit bill last mentioned and embracing all the moneys voted by the town in 1816, whether for highways or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>purposes, contain any tax against Kentfield, nor was his name on the valuation of that year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-3\">\" It was further agreed, that the collector of taxes for 1816, m the settlement of his tax-bill, had the benefit of all allowanees on the general credit bill for that year, and that the sum of 17 cents allowed to Kentfield was thus received by the collector from the town ; that he supposed he had paid it over to Kentfield, but not finding it receipted on the bill, he had recently, and since the present question has been raised, but without the knowledge or direction of the agents of the town, paid over the sum to Kentfield, with annual interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">The defendants were to be defaulted or the plaintiffs to be come nonsuit, according to the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-7\"><em>Bales </em>and .Dewey, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE7\">The assessment of <em>half </em>of a poll tax in 1815 was illegal and void.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Aug6\">\n<em>Sept 21st</em>\n</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-8\">The paper made out in April, 1816, was not a highway tax, and the work on the highway was not performed in reference to it as a tax. A voluntary payment of a sum not regularly taxed does not come within the statute of 1793, c. 34.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-9\">But if it was a tax, as it was founded on the valuation of the preceding year, it is void considered as a tax for 1816. <em>Nason </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>1 Pick. 140. Being however voted and assessed before May, 1816, it was a tax for the year 1815.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-11\"><em>Strong </em>and <em>Forbes, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AETq\">A highway tax is not paid like other taxes; it is paid in labor. <em>St. </em>1786, <em>e. </em>81, \u00a7 3 ; <em>St. </em>1796, c. 58, \u00a7 4. As the sum of 300 dollars was voted in 1816, it must be considered as a tax for that year. The <em>St. </em>1786, c. 81, is silent as to the valuation upon which a highway tax is to be assessed. Towns may raise money for repairs of highways, at any meeting regularly warned, and the assessment here had reference correctly to the valuation of 1815.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-13\">But the <em>St. </em>1793, c. 34, in saying \u201c taxes duly assessed,\u201d does not mean <em>legally, </em>but <em>fitly </em>assessed ; the propriety or fitness of which is recognised by the person against whom the tax is intended to be enforced. Here the fitness has been acquiesced in by the pauper, and the tax was paid by him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-14\">Besides, it is against public policy to allow towns to avail themselves of the fraud or incapacity of their officers. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the intention of the assessors to make a regular highway tax, and they considered that it would be the same thing if they in-eluded the bill of expenses in the general tax-bill, instead of having a separate column for a highway tax; whereby they made <em>the </em>general tax illegal. It is not competent to the plaintiffs to say they made an assessment in 1817 embracing this highway tax as well as other town charges. If a man were assessed higher in the assessment of 1817, than in the paper given to the surveyor, he would be denied the privilege of paying his highway tax in labor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">The plaintiffs had evidence of the pauper\u2019s ability to pay the highway tax, for he actually paid it; and to omit his name in the tax-bill made out in 1817, was a legal fraud, which will not avail the plaintiffs. <em>Wrentham </em>v. Attleborough, 5 Mass. R. 430.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Sept. 24th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AP9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A_L\">The tax for 1815 is objected to, because it was only upon half a poll. It is said there cannot be a poll tax for less than a poll; and this seems to be reasonable, but as it is obvious that what is called an assessment in 1816 was illegal, it is not necessary to determine that point. The word <em>tax </em>in' the paper delivered to the surveyor is the only thing in it which would lead one to suspect it was meant for a tax. It was not founded on a valuation of 1816, and cannot be a legal tax for that year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is said, however, that the plaintiffs are not to be permitted to show its illegality, as it was the act of their own officers. We need not decide that question, as we are satisfied this was not intended to be an assessment of a tax. It was merely an apportionment of a sum on individuals in the surveyor\u2019s district according to the taxes of a former year, and they performed labor without reference to the sums set against their names, and had credit for it, and it was afterwards carried into the general credit bill with other claims against the town, and was allowed to the collector in the settlement of his tax-bill. The town never had the benefit of it. The pauper therefore has gained no settlement in Southampton by the payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The defendants say however, that as the pauper paid 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>cents, it was evidence of his ability to pay. But if he was liable at all, he should have been assessed for all the other taxes of 1816. And it is contended that the omission to tax him \"was fraudulent in law. But as he was able the year before to pay only half \"of a poll tax, there seems to be but a slight foundation for that suggestion. If there were a question of fraud, it should be tried by the jury ; but under the circumstances of the case we think there is no ground for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\"> See <em>Waldron </em>v <em>Lee, </em>5 Pick. 323; <em>Granger </em>v. <em>Parsons, 2 </em>Pick. 3\u00cd\u00cd3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
