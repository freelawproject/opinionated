But here the jury agreed on a verdict, in substance, before separating, and the object of the Court in sending them out again was merely to put it into form. It is said, however, that the first verdict amounted to nothing. This is not a fair construction of it. The jury intended to negative the averments in .the declaration ; and the verdict might have been put into form in court, without sending them out. The first verdict is substantially the same as the amended verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"ACv\">\n<em>Motion for new trial overruled</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\"> Even in a capital case. <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>6 N.
