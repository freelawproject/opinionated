The case is like grants of adjoining land, where the monuments have been destroyed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-5\">Hoar, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVWd\">objected that no judgment could be rendered upon the verdict, because it does not state what was the devise ; and the Court cannot amend a special verdict. Bac. Abr. Verdict, <em>D. </em>The Court cannot say that the will now presented to them., js the one to which the verdict refers. He also contended that the devise created a tenancy in common.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b545-13\">\n<em>Oct. 17th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b545-6\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aat\">delivered the opinion of the Court. We think it quite clear, that by the will of Israel Walker, the farm was devised to the two sons as tenants in common, and not one half to each in severalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">But we are sorry to find, upon examining the authorities cited and others upon the subject, that no judgment can be rendered upon this special verdict of the jury, it being deficient in substance, and not capable of being amended but by consent Indeed some of the authorities do not make that exception , with which however we do not agree, as we can see no good reason why a special verdict, which, in practice, is little more than an agreed statement of facts put into this form, should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>be corrected, both parties consenting. But without such con sent, (and there is none in this case,) there can be no amend ment, and if the verdict is defective, there can be no judgment</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
