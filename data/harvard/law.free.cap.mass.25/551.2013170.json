Trial before <em>Morton </em>J. on the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-12\">Francis D. Kidder, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that he was a clerk in the store of Mason &amp; Brooks : that the defendant, one of the firm, sold the plaintiff a pipe of brandy at 1 dollar 12 cents a gallon, which he represented to be pure French brandy ; that it was charged to the plaintiff on the books of the firm and his name was put on the head of the cask, but that it was left in the store for a few days by the defendant\u2019s consent, until the plaintiff should send for it; that before the brandy was removed, the defendant drew out about 40 gallons, and supplied its place by American brandy worth 40. or 50 cents a gallon ; and that Brooks, the defendant\u2019s partner, was present at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-13\">Brooks, being called as a witness for the defendant, contradicted the material parts of Kidder\u2019s statement. On cross-examination the plaintiff\u2019s counsel inquired of him, whether he, or his partner, ever had, in any instance, adulterated brandy or other spirits. This question he answered in the negative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Many questions on this subject were put by the counsel on both sides, the defendant\u2019s counsel making no objection to the inquiry. The Court having adjourned to the next day, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on the opening of the Court, proposed to inquire of the witness, whether in particular cases, which were named, and in sales to certain persons who were then in court as witnesses, the defendant or the witness had not adulterated brandy or other spirits. The defendant\u2019s counsel stated that the defendant did not object to the questions, but that he thought them irrelevant and that they ought not to be put or answered. But the judge permitted the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to put them and required them to be answered. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to this decision, and, a verdict having been found for the plaintiff, moved for a new trial for this cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-4\"><em>T.

The defendant would avail himself of a willingness on his part to have the questions put, but would reserve the right to object to them as improper. There was in truth no objection made at the time, and it is now too late to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\n<em>Judgment according to verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
