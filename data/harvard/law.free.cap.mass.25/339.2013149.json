J., the following evidence was produced. On June 24, 1820, Garlick, who was then owner of the closes described in the writ, executed an agreement with William Middlebrook, David Dell, and Stephen Mead and sons, by which they were to have the use of the quarry for ten' years, with the right of way through the closes for the purpose of going to the quarry and carrying away the marble ; and the parties entered into and occupied the closes pursuant to the agreement. This agreement was not recorded. On September 14, 1822, Garlick, for a valuable consideration, conveyed the same closes to Farnum, the plaintiff, by a deed which contains the following clause; \u2014 \u201creserving also the use of the quarry on said Burhans lot until the expiration of the lease I have heretofore made to Stephen Mead and others,\u201d (meaning the agreement before referred to.) This agreement or lease was cancelled on October 5, 1822, by consent of the parties to it, and the names and seals torn off</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Garlick continued to use the quarry occasionally after the cancelling of the lease, under the reservation in the deed ; and on November 26, 1826, his supposed right in the same was taken on execution and sold in due form to the defendant; and the acts complained of were the passing through the closes to the quarry mentioned in the reservation, for the purpose of taking marble therefrom, and repassing through the same with loads of the marble to a mill where it was to be wrought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">It was insisted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that even if the defendant had any right to enter on and pass over the land and take stone from the quarry, yet that he pursued a course different from the route which had been usual. But there was evidence that the plaintiff had fenced out the old road, and that the route taken was that which would do the least injury to the plaintiff\u2019s land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff; which was to be set aside, and the plaintiff nonsuited, if a right or interest remained in Garlick at the time of the sale on execution, which passed to the defendant; otherwise judgment was to be rendered -on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-6\"><em>Hubbard </em>and <em>Hubbell, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANp\">The reservation in Garlick\u2019s deed was only till the \u201c expiration of the lease.\u2019' When, therefore, the lease terminated by the agreement of the parties, though before the end of the ten years, all Garlick\u2019s right under the reservation ceased.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsV\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The principal question in this case is upon the construction of a clause in the deed of Garlick to the plaintiff, which is in terms a reservation of the right to use a stone-quarry upon one of the lots described in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Before the execution of this deed, Garlick, then owner of the land, had leased the quarry, with the right of ingress and egress, to Middlebrook and others, for ten years then unexpired. The object of the reservation was to secure the rights of the lessees during the continuance of the lease ; and the presumption of law is, that whatever diminution of value this occasioned to the title conveyed to the plaintiff, was accounted for in the consideration paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">This lease, or agreement which had the effect of a lease, was, by consent of all the parties to it, cancelled after the execution and delivery of the deed to Farnum, and he contends that, on such cancellation, he held the land under the deed, free from the right secured by the reservation. We do not think this is the true construction of the reservation ; but that its effect was to exclude from the operation of the grant, the use of the quarry by Farnum, during the time provided in the agreement for its continuance. This is the most natural construction, and such as was intended by the parties at the time. The words \u201cuntil the expiration of the lease\u201d mean, until it shall expire according to the terms of it, and not the termination of it by a new agreement between the parties to it. And the reservation enures to the use of the lessor as well as the lessee ; for it saves the quarry from the operation of the deed, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the time, as much as it would, if the reservation had been for the unexpired time, without any mention of the lease. Therefore Garlick, or those lawfully holding under him, would not be liable in trespass, for taking stones from the quarry.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">And as the way, used for access to the quarry, was not limited or defined, the shutting up the way commonly used gave the right to pass to and from, in any course least prejudicial to the owner of the land. This, according to the verdict oi the jury, was done by the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
