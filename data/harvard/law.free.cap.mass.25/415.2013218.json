The original writ contained only one count, which was for money had and received by Clark to the use of Ezekiel Lamb as executor of Daniel Lamb. At the return term three new counts were filed ; one for money had and received to the use of the testator, and a promise in consideration thereof to pay the executor ; another, on an <em>insimul compulassent </em>between Ezekiel as executor and Clark, of money due to Eze<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>kiel as executor, and a promise to, pay him as executor ; ana a third, for money had and received to the use of the testator, and a promise to pay the testator. Clark pleaded, 1. <em>non assumpsit </em>to the whole declaration ; on which issue was joined to the country. 2. To the first, second and third counts, that the causes of action did not accrue to Ezekiel in his capacity of executor, within six years ; and issue was joined on that fact. 3. To the fourth count, that the action did not accrue to the testator within six years ; and issue was joined on that fact. 4. <em>Non assumpsit infra sex </em>annos, to the whole declaration.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b436-7\">\n<em>Sept. 23d.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-9\">At the trial, before <em>Wilde </em>J., the jury returned a verdict that \u201c the defendant (Clark) did promise the plaintiff (E. Lamb) in manner and form as he has alleged in his declaration, within six years next before the commencement of said action,\u201d and assessed the damages. Judgment was entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-10\">It was assigned for error, that the verdict does not find the whole\" of the issue joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-11\">After error brought, <em>Wilde </em>J. certified from recollection, that the principal part of the evidence offered by the plaintiff was applicable to the second and third issues, and that it tended to show that Clark had fraudulently obtained from the testator divers notes of hand due to him, and had collected some of the notes within six years before the commencement of the action ; that the counsel of Clark contended that the statute of limitations began to run from the time when the notes were obtained, which was more than six years before the action was brought, but that the jury were instructed to find for the plaintiff for all the sums of money -which Clark had received on the notes within six years before the commencement of the action ; that the greater part of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, as to the damages, applied to this subject of inquiry ; and that there was no sufficient evidence to support the verdict as to the amount of damages, vnless the jury had found for the plaintiff as to the notes of hand so collected as above mentioned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-12\"><em>G.

R. 251; <em>Atkins </em>v. Sawyer, 1 Pick. 351. The certificate is not within the rule of the Court of King\u2019s Bench; it is not made from the minutes, but from the recollection of the judge. If such a certificate is admissible, any verdict may. be set aside upon paroi evidence. [ <em>Wilde </em>J. My minutes I suppose may be obtained, but my recollection was distinct, and I had the minutes of the defendant\u2019s counsel before me when the certificate was made.] In England the verdict is drawn by the clerk ; here it is by the foreman of the jury, under the direction of his fellows ; so that if in England the court may alter the writing of the clerk, this Court will not therefore be authorized to alter a verdict taken according to our practice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-4\"><em>Bates </em>and <em>Dewey</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0IN\">relied on <em>Petrie </em>v. Hannay, 3 T. R. 659. They cited likewise, <em>St. </em>1784, c. 29, \u00a7 14; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Hingham &amp;c. </em>Turnpike, 4 Pick. 349; 2 Dunlap\u2019s Pr. 702.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">The opinion of the Court was afterwards drawn up by</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b437-13\"><em>April term </em>18<em>30</em></decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\"> In the report of this case in 6 Pick. 512, in the first edition and in some copies of the second, ;t is erroneously stated that the judgment was rendered <em>tn </em>the Court of Common Pleas in 1826, and that the motion for a new trial was made in that court</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b437-6\">Wilde J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5r\">The question now to be decided on this writ of error is, whether the verdict in the original action may be amended conformably to the facts as certified by the judge ; and we are clearly of opinion, that according to all the authorities it may be so amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In the case of <em>Chapman </em>v. Gale, 2 Lev. 22, which was debt against an executor, judgment was entered up against him <em>de bonis propriis, </em>and thereupon error was brought, and it was assigned, that the judgment should have been <em>de bonis testatoris, si Spc. </em>Upon the affidavit of the attorney, that he gave his clerk instructions to enter it up according to the plea, and that it was a mere mistake of the clerk, the judgment was amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">In the report of this case by Keble, (2 Keb. 810,) it is said, that the amendment was allowed by consent of parties ; but Levinz is rather to be relied on ; and of this opinion was Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in the case of <em>Short </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>5 Burr. 2730, in which a similar amendment was allowed after writ of errot brought and <em>in nullo est erratum </em>pleaded. In the case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>3 T. R. 749, it was decided that the <em>postea </em>may be amended by the judge\u2019s notes at any time, even after final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>judgment and writ of error brought, and it was said this pract\u2019ce was as ancient as the time of Charles the First. So in the case of <em>Rees </em>v. Morgan, 3 T. R. 349, a judgment was amended after writ of error brought, and also in the cases of <em>Usher </em>v. <em>Dansey, </em>4 Maule &amp; Selw. 94 ; <em>King </em>v. <em>Keat, </em>1 Salk. 47; <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Skypp, </em>Cro. Car. 338; <em>Eddowes </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>1 Doug. 376; and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Breedon, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"ADm\">But the case of <em>Petrie </em>v. <em>Hannay, </em>3 T. R. 659, is directly in point and cannot be distinguished from the case under consideration. There the defendant pleaded the general issue and the statute of limitations. A verdict was found for the plaintiff on the first issue, and no notice taken of the last. After error brought and joinder in error, (which was assigned on this point,) the court allowed the verdict to be amended by the judge\u2019s notes, on payment of costs. In the case of <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>King, </em>l Barn. &amp; Aid. 161, an amendment was refused ; but this was after a lapse of eight years from the rendition of judgment, and seven years after the writ of error had been brought and after the reversal of the judgment; so that the defendant in error had, as Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>thought, slept the sleep of death over his rights. <em>Abbott </em>J. says, \u201c the application should be made recently after the \u00bfrial, for the judge bears then in memory much of what has passed at the trial; whereas it is impossible to suppose, that at a great distance of time, \u00e1ny human memory can recollect the circumstances.\u201d This case, therefore, is not opposed to the general rule ; but rather confirms it, with a reasonable qualification ; so that the course of practice in England has been long well established, and it has been adopted here so far as cases have occurred requiring its salutary aid. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>7 Mass. R. 358; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>11 Mass. R. 57; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Holker, 15 </em>Mass. R. 374; <em>Patten </em>v. <em>Gurney, </em>17 Mass. R. 182.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And I cannot imagine any reasonable objection that can be made to this course of practice ; on the contrary, a different course, as contended for by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>greatly obstruct the administration of justice. In all proceedings mistakes will occur, notwithstanding all ordinary care, and when they do thus happen, they ought, if possible, to be corrected without injury to either party. The course of practice adopted by the courts was founded on this principle, and it applies with perfect justice to the present case. If there were any doubt as to the facts which occurred at the trial, or any question made, whether there had been a full trial on the meri's, the proper course would be to grant a <em>venire de nova, </em>But the case has been fully heard and considered, both as to the facts and the law ; and upon the merits of the case there non be no question which has not been already disposed of. The effect of the statute of limitations was fully consideied, and a large portion of the original plaintiff\u2019s demand was thereby barred. The only error or mistake arose from a mere slip in drawing up the verdict, and clearly this ought not to be allowed to vacate the judgment. The verdict is, therefore, to ne amended, and on payment of costs the plaintiff in error is to become nonsuit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-5\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c, </em>100, \u00a7 22; <em>Jones </em>v <em>Kennedy, </em>11 Pick. 125; <em>Hanley </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>5 Hammond, 227; <em>Roulain </em>v. <em>M\u2018Dowell, </em>1 Bay, 490; <em>Sagre </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>12 Wendell, 135; <em>Payson </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>15 Pick. 212; <em>Rowell </em>v. <em>Brace, </em>5 N.
