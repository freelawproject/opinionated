The netting was made of double twine, and was fastened by nailing it on each side, and at the top and bottom of the window, for the purpose of letting in the air and keeping out cats and other smaller animals. Within the network there was a glass window, which had not been shut. <em>Putnam </em>J. instructed the jury, that if the defendants broke, cut or tore away the net so fastened, it was in law a breaking of the dwellinghouse. The defendants being found guilty, moved for a new trial because the foregoing instruction was wrong.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-8\"><em>Bates </em>and <em>G.

The window was the natural protection against an entry by man. To constitute a breaking, the thing broken must be a part of the house 1 Hawk. P.

The question in this case is, whether there was a breaking or not. The lifting a latch and opening the door, though not bolted or locked; the shoving up a window, though not fastened; the getting down a chimney, and various other acts done to effect an entry, are held to be a breaking.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The offence consists in violating the common security of a dwellinghouse, in the nighttime, for the purpose of committing a felony. It makes no difference, whether the door is barred and bolted, or the window secured, or not; it is enough that the house is secured in the ordinary way; so that by the carelessness of the owner in leaving the door or window open, the party accused of burglary be not tempted to enter. Shutting the window-blinds and leaving the windows open for air, is a common mode of closing a house, in the warm season ; if the blinds are forced, it is a breaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The objection is, that the lattice-work of the dairy window was of twine only. Suppose it were of wire, or thin slats of wood, would there be any difference ? This, network was nailed down on all sides; it was torn away by the defendants, and they entered the breach. This is quite sufficient to constitute a burglarious breaking and entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">\n<em>Motion for a new trial overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>Coxe, (N.
