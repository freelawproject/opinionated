Hill refused to comply with the request, and Oakes now applied for a <em>mandamus </em>to compel him to grant such a certificate. The case involved the question, whether any person had a right to become a member of the parish without their consent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-14\">The petition was supported by <em>Fletcher, </em>and opposed by <em>Shaw </em>and <em>Peabody.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APk\">The counsel on both sides were desirous of obtaining the opinion of the Court upon the merits of the case.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"pA5CY\"><em>Jan. 3d, </em>182 V.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"pABX\">\n<em>March 17th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b56-15\">But at this March term the Court said they had come to the conclusion, that it was not proper to issue a <em>mandamus. </em>They remarked that an action was pending in which the same ques\u2022tions might be tried, and that a determination on this summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>process might affect the rights of persons who had no opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-10\"> See <em>Oakes </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>10 Pick. 333, and 14 Pick. 442.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
