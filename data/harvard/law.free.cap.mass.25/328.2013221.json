The dividing line', which was first laid out in 1734, was a straight line. A crooked fence was erected more than fifty-eight years before the trial, and included on the Burghardt side a part of the other lot; but the owners o\u00ed\" the two lots occupied respectively up to this fence for more than thirty years. The plaintiff recently erected a fence on the straight line, which the defendant tore down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\">The question was, whether evidence of acts and declarations of the parties since the expiration of the thirty years, was admissible to show that the old fence was built for mutual accommodation, without any view to title, and that the occupation was not adverse.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-9\"><em>Barnard </em>and Hall, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHM\">cited <em>Burrell </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>11 Mass.

If the premises are well founded, the argument is sound and the conclusion logical. But the very question was, as to the nature and character of that antecedent possession ; and the acts and declarations of the parties owning the estates, made after thirty years, which had a tendency to show their motives and views during the thirty years, were proper to show the nature of the occupancy, and rebut the inference which would otherwise follow from the fact of possession. Surely, if a written agreement had been produced, showing that Burghardt was allowed to maintain a crooked fence, until Church should choose to have one back upon the true divisional line, it would defeat all claims to the land in dispute on account of the thirty years\u2019 possession. Confessions of the party in possession claiming under that title, his acts and declarations having a tendency to show such arrangement and \u25a0 understanding, are equally competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\n<em>Judgment according to verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
