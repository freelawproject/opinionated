J., it appeared, that the note was used at the trial in the Common Pleas, but the case was taken from the jury and brought up by demurrer. It having been suggested by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the note had not been seen by any one since the trial in the Common Pleas, the judge admitted the affidavit of the plaintiff to show that it was not in his possession, and that he did not know where it was, and then allowed him to give such evidence as he could of the loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARWx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>It appeared from the evidence of the clerk of the court and \u00b0f counsel in the case, that the note was read to the jury at the trial in the Common Pleas, that it agreed with the description of it in the writ, that it was not then suggested that there was any variance between the note and the declaration, and that the defence made was founded on the existence of the note. It also appeared from the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that they had not seen the note since the trial in the Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">Isaac B. Barber, the attorney who filled the writ, testified, that he drew the writ from the original note then in his possession, that he brought it with him to court, where it was used on the trial in the Common Pleas, that he had searched among his papers and could not find it, and that he had not seen it since the trial. After he had given this evidence, it was objected that he was not a competent witness, having indorsed the writ. The judge, however, considered the evidence as proper for the Court to act on, in determining whether the plaintiff should be allowed to go to the jury without the production of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACxD\">No defence being made to the note, the judge informed the counsel, that he should instruct the jury that on this evidence they ought to return a verdict for the plaintiff, and that judg ment would be rendered thereon for the plaintiff on his giving a sufficient bond of indemnity to save the defendant harmless from any future claim on the note. Whereupon the defendant consented to be defaulted, reserving for the whole Court the-question, whether the evidence was sufficient and conclusive, without any thing to contradict it, to prove the loss of the note, and to entitle the plaintiff to recover without producing it. And judgment was to be rendered for the plaintiff on bis filing the bond, if this proceeding is right; otherwise the default was to be taken off and a new trial granted.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b410-7\"><em>Sept </em>22d.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AMZ\"><em>Wells, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAVO\">contended that the evidence of he plaintiff and of the indorser of the writ were not admissibl. to prove the loss of the note. <em>Coleman </em>v.

The evidence of the loss of the note was not sufficient ; it does not appear that any search has been made for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>it, on the files of the Court of Common Pleas. 1 Stark. Ev. 349, 350; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Fales, </em>5 Mass. R. 101; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Has</em>brouck 12 Johns. R. 192. <em>[Parker </em>C. J.

Spooner, 3 Pick. 284; [2a edit. 286, note 1; <em>Poignand </em>v.

The affidavit of Donelson was properly received, in order to satisfy the Court that the note was not in his possession nor anywhere within his control. The evidence of the loss was rightly directed to the Court. And as to the clerk\u2019s not saying he had searched his files, it ought to be taken as a fact that a search was made. His testimony would have been a fraud on the Court, if he had not looked among his files for the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The testimony of Barber would have been rejected, if it had been offered to the jury, because his indorsement of the writ made him interested. But if his affidavit might not, like that of the plaintiff, have been received on a preliminary question to the Court, still the objection came too late, being after he was sworn and examined. This was a waiver of the objection, the evidence of his interest beiftg within reach of the defendant\u2019s csunsel when he was offered as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
