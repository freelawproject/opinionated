They also proved, that at 7 o\u2019clock on Saturday evening Sawyer informed the plaintiff that he, Sawyer, had previously attached the property, and forbade the plaintiff\u2019s removing it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-11\">The defendants offered to prove by a witness, that on December 16th he saw Sawyer at work on a fence by the roadside, opposite to the barn and in view of it; and that Sawyer then told the witness, that he had attached the hay in the barn and was then watching it. But the evidence was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-12\">The judge charged the jury, that Sawyer\u2019s return was not, of itself, sufficient evidence of the attachment by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aftg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The jury found a verdict against Sawyer, but in favor 01 ^le other defendant ; and Sawyer moved for a new trial on account of the misdirection of the judge.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b418-3\">\n<em>Sept. 22J.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A7qd\">Bigelow, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxC\">contended that Sawyer\u2019s return was sufficient evidence of the attachment, at least <em>prima facie.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5u\">delivered the opinion of the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> By the report it appears, that the only ground taken for a new trial was the supposed misdirection of the judge to the jury, in stating that the return on the writ by Sawyer was not of itself sufficient evidence of an attachment. It certainly was not, against an officer claiming to have attached the same property.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">But it is evident there were other points intended to be taken in relation to the validity of both attachments. The attachment made by the plaintiff'on Saturday was valid, if there was no lawful lien upon the property at that time. He went within view of the hay with his writ, declared that he attached it, and posted a notification to that effect on the barn-door. There was then no person present claiming the possession of the hay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question then is, whether the defendant Sawyer had before made a lawful attachment, as the return of the writ imports. There is no evidence, apart from his return, of any act done by him. He was seen, on the evening of Saturday, working on a fence between the debtor\u2019s house and barn ; and he told the person offered as a witness, that he had attached the hay and was watching it. This evidence was rejected ; and we think, rightly, as it was only the declaration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>party, unaccompanied by any act tending to show an attachment, and therefore does not come within the exception to the rule which excludes the declaration of parties, as being part of the res <em>gestee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Nor was his notice to the plaintiff, that he had attached the hay, of any avail, it being given after the plaintiff had made his attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Motion for a new trial overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> See this case explained in <em>Bruce </em>v. Holden, 21 Pick. 190; where it is said that both of the returns were <em>prim\u00f3, facie </em>evidence of attachment, and that the first in point of time would have prevailed, but for other evidence showing that Sawyer had either failed originally to seize the property or to give publicity to his attachment, or had relinquished his possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"> See <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>16 Pick. 146; <em>Duncklee </em>v <em>Falest </em>5 N Hamp R. 528.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
