Hicks, at the time of his death, resided in Vermont, where administration was granted to the defendants. They represented the estate to be insolvent, on January 4, 1827 ; and commissioners were appointed, agreeably to the laws of Vermont, for the purpose of adjusting the claims of the creditors. The commissioners gave due notice, received the claims of creditors, and made a return of their commission, with a list of the claims allowed by them. The amount of the claims allowed by the judge of probate in Vermont exceeded the value of the real and personal estate of the intestate. No notice of the issuing of the commission was given to the plaintiff, either personally or by advertising in this Commonwealth, till after the commission was closed ; and his claim was not presented to the commissioners or allowed by the judge of probate. The intestate was the owner of real estate in this Commonwealth. The administrators took out letters of administration here, and obtained license to sell the real estate for the payment of the debts. No commission of insolvency was issued here and the property here was sufficient to pay the demand of the plaintiff in full. Notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claims was given to the administrators, before the assets in this Commonwealth were withdrawn therefrom.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b498-8\">\n<em>Oct. 3d</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALny\"><em>J.

As the estate is insolvent, a creditor here is not to be paid his whole debt to the prejudice of creditors in Vermont, but only a <em>pro rata </em>dividend. There is no difficulty in this case as to the <em>modus operandi. </em>Judgment is to be taken for the whole debt, but no execution is to issue. The administra tors will ascertain the amount of the assets and debts in both States, and pay the creditors here, <em>pro rata. </em>They will be protected in Vermont for what they are compelled to do here by our law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> Provision is made for such a case by the Revised Stat. c. 70, \u00a7 23 <em>et seq. </em>See <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Heydock, </em>6 Vermont R. 374; <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>1 Mason, 381; <em>Jennison </em>v. <em>Hapgood, </em>10 Pick. 77; <em>Miller's Estate, </em>3 Rawle, 312; <em>Hooker </em>v. <em>Olmstead, </em>6 Pick. 481; <em>Olivier </em>v. <em>Townes, </em>14 Martin, 93, 99<em>; De Sobry </em>v. <em>De Laistre, </em>5 Harr. &amp; Johns. 193, 224; Story\u2019s Comm, on Confl, Laws 423; 2 Kent.
