The town of Ashby had for many years prior to the date of the bond, managed its parochial affairs as a town, without organizing itself as a parish. Some time before the date of the bond, a second parish was formed in the town, and was duly organized as a parish. From the time of the forma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>tian of the second parish, to the time of the trial, the first parish had managed their parochial affairs by the officers chosen by the town, without any special organization for the manage* ment of parish business. The taxes in question were assessed by the assessors chosen by the town, for the payment of the salary of the minister of the first parish. Wellington was chosen collector of taxes for the town for the year 1826. Wellington, being called on by the plaintiffs, produced the book containing a list of the assessments. While the list was in Wellington\u2019s hands, he collected of one Stephen Wyman, named in it, the amount assessed upon his polls and estate, and gave Wyman the following receipt, viz. \u201c Ashby, February 21, 1829.
