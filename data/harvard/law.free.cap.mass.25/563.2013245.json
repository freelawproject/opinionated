No answer was returned. This notification was objected to by the de fendants ; and the court ruled that it was insufficient and or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>dered a nonsuit; whereupon the plaintiff\u2019s filed their exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-4\">It was admitted at the argument, that no overseers had been chosen by the town of Ashby at the time when the notice was given.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-5\"><em>Hoar, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArKi\">cited <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Hinsdale, </em>6 Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AryV\">afterward drew up the opinion of the Court. The only question is on the sufficiency of the notice ; and the objection is, that it does not appear to have been given by the overseers of Ashby. It is in all respects sufficiently particular ; but it is signed by the selectmen <em>as such, </em>not stating the capacity of overseers, in which they acted. By statute, they, as selectmen, there being no other persons chosen for the office, were overseers, <em>virtute officii. </em>So that the objection is not to their want of authority, but to their not having denominated themselves overseers, in their letter of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">As it is by a general law, that the duty of overseers is devolved upon the selectmen, when no persons are specially designated to that office, the overseers of Lunenburg cannot pretend ignorance of it; and we think, that having received notice of a matter relating to the poor, signed by persons calling themselves selectmen, they ought to have presumed they were acting in the capacity of overseers.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The case of <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Hinsdale </em>refers only to cases where there are overseers ; and only requires that the notice should come from them, or an agent appointed by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">The case of <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>is very strong in support of the ground taken by the plaintiffs, that selectmen having authority as overseers, may be bound in the latter capacity, without naming themselves as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The case of <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Brewer </em>is directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">\n<em>Judgment of C.
