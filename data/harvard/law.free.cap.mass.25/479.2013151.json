The real estate of the testator was valued at 5100 dollars, and in his will was devised as follows. \u201c <em>Item third. </em>I give and devise my homestead, or the farm whereon I now live, the same being all the real estate which I am now seised and possessed of, consisting,\u201d &amp;c. to his four sons, Silvanus, Chapin, Albert, and Joseph, and his four daughters Elzada, Almira, Milley, and Zilpha. After giving one specific and several general legacies, and among others that to the plaintiff, Miranda Humes, the residuary clause follows : \u2014 \u201cI also give, bequeath, and devise, in common and undivided and in equal proportions, all my estate, real and personal, not herein before bequeathed and devised,\u201d to the four sons and four daughters named above.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b502-8\">\n<em>Oct.

Adams, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIE\">contended that the executor was bound to sell the real estate to pay the legacies. It was no doubt the intention of the testator that the legatees should have a portion of his estate. The devisees of the real estate can only claim as residuary devisees, and not under the specific devise, for the last provision in the will is to prevail over the previous one. He cited <em>Dawes </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>4 Mass. R. 208; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>6 Mass. R. 169; <em>St. </em>1783, <em>c. </em>24, \u00a7 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>18. The assets should be marshalled, so as to have the debts paid out of the real estate, leaving the personal estate free to pay the legacies.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_q8\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The action cannot be maintained against the executor, because he has no funds out of which to pay the legacy. The personal estate is all consumed by debts and expenses of administration, except the stock, farming utensils, &amp;c. which are specifically devised. The real estate is not charged with the payment of legacies, and besides is also specifically devised. It does not come into the hands of the executor, and he has no authority to sell it. That a devise of a farm or any definite parcel of real estate may be specific, the authorities cited sufficiently show.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">It was supposed by the counsel for the plaintiffs, that there being a general residuary devise to those to whom the real estate is given in a preceding clause, this operates as a revocation of the particular devise. But it cannot so operate contrary to the clear intention of the testator, which was, in this residuary clause, to give what might by possibility not have been before disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
