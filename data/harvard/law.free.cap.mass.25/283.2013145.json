The house is erected on piers driven into the mud below low-water mark in Charles river. The bill alleges that the moiety in question was mortgaged by one Farnum to the defendant, and that the equity of redemption was taken and sold on execution and purchased by the plaintiff. The proceedings set forth are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>according to the mode of levying on a right in equity tti redeem real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-4\">The defendant demurred to the bill, on the ground that the bathing-house was a personal chattel and not real estate, and that Farnum had no such right or interest as could be taken and sold on execution as stated in the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-5\"><em>Field </em>and <em>B. </em>Sumner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1N\">in support of the demurrer, cited <em>Wells </em>v.
