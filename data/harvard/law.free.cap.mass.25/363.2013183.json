Denny.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-9\">At the time of the execution of this contract, Alpheus Smith was indebted to the plaintiff in a large sum of money, and Horace Smith was indebted to Alpheus upon three promissory notes, one of which, dated January 21, 1824, was for the sum of 2000 dollars, payable in good merchantable machine cards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>at cash price, in three years from the date, with interest annually. By an instrument under seal, dated April 13, 1825, Denny, as guardian of Alpheus, assigned to the plaintiff \u201c the balance which may be due \u201d on this note, \u201c after deducting what may be due to Horatio G. Henshaw from said Alpheus, not exceeding 500 dollars, which said note is now in the hands of Austin Flint, and is there to remain until said Henshaw is paid.\u201d The plaintiff at the same time executed an agreement, ui which it is stated, that the amount due to him could not then be ascertained, and he agrees, in case the property assigned should exceed the debt, to pay over the balance to the defendant, \u201c it being understood that the cards received by virtue of the assignment shall be sold as soon as may be, and at the best advantage, and the proceeds shall be applied first to the payment of the debt to H. G. Henshaw, and the residue to the discharge of said Carew\u2019s claims.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-4\">There was an indorsement upon the note, under date of January 27, 1824, of a payment of 286 dollars 27 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">The demand of Henshaw against Alpheus Smith was on a promissory note, dated January 31,1824, on which Henshaw recovered a judgment in March, 1826, for 569 dollars, being the principal, interest and costs. In April, 1826, Horace Smith, at the request of Henshaw, engaged to make the cards in about a month, to pay Henshaw the amount of his judgment; and Henshaw stated that he should write to Carew for his consent; which if he did not obtain, he should wish the cards to be delivered and he should take them on execution, and have them sold on execution to satisfy his judgment. Accordingly on May 10, 1826, Horace Smith had prepared cards for delivery, and two persons were called in to appraise them. A quantity appraised at 1308 dollars 50 cents, was sold by auction by a deputy-sheriff, under the execution, the proceeds of which were no more than sufficient to satisfy the execution, and the sum of 1308 dollars 50 cents was then indorsed by Flint as so much paid upon the note. It appeared that the plaintiff had notice of the intention to turn out the cards and to sell them on execution, Washburn, the attorney of Henshaw, having written to Packard, agent of Carew, a letter dated March 21, 1826, in which he says, that Henshaw is in want of his money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>and that Horace Smith is ready to pay the cards due on me note in Flint\u2019s hands; and Washburn asks, whether Carevv \u201c will take all the cards and pay Henshaw\u2019s debt, or let Hen shaw take enough to pay himself and leave the rest for Carewl Have you or Carevv any objection to Horace\u2019s paying Henshavv, within a fortnight, cards enough to satisfy his debt ? If either of you have any thing to say on the subject, I wish you to write me soon ; as the cards will be ready for sale in a fortnight, and Henshaw has judgment on his note, and will sell them on execution when turned out to him.\u201d But there was no evidence that Carew consented to this proposition, otherwise than In not answering the letter. He lived more than thirty miles from Leicester, where these transactions took place. When the note guarantied became due, the plaintiff called on Horace Smith for the cards, and Horace showed him cards ready for delivery. '1 he plaintiff asked if those were all ; and was informed that they were. These cards had before been appraised by two persons, having been examined by a person who accompanied the plaintiff for that purpose, and who stated that they were merchantable according to the contract. This person looked at the exterior of the bundles, without opening 01 s'parating them. They were then delivered to the plaintiff at the appraisement. The balance of the note thus paid was about 670 dollars. The defendant was present at this time. The plaintiff, being asked by Flint if he should give up the note to Horace Smith, turned to the defendant and asked him. The defendant said he had nothing to do with it. Where pan the plaintiff said it might be given up '; and thereupon it was given up by Flint as paid. The cards were afterwards transferred to Springfield, where they were received by an agent of the plaintiff. There was evidence tending to prove that they were not of a merchantable quality, and were worth much less than the sum at which they were opp aised, being packed so as to deceive ; and there was evidence to contradict this ; but the judge who tried the cause being of opinion that the acceptance of them by the plaintiff, upon such examination as took place, was a payment <em>pro </em>tanto, as it respected the defendant\u2019s guaranty, and that if any fraud was practised, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>defendant was not answerable for it, this evidence was considered irrelevant and was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-3\">The plaintiff insisted that the guaranty covered the whole of the note, except the claim of Henshaw to the amount of 500 dollars, without regard to the sum indorsed upon the note, paid before entering into the guaranty, and offered evidence to show that he did not know of this indorsement. But the judge was of opinion, that the evidence was irrelevant, whether the parties were or were not ignorant of the indorsement, unless the defendant knew and concealed the fact from the plaintiff; of which there was no evidence. The judge was of opinion, that the guaranty covered the sum due on the note at the time when the contract was entered into, and no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-4\">The defendant insisted that the legal effect of his contract of guaranty was only to the extent of what should be due on the note, after deducting the appraised value of the cards taken to satisfy the debt of Henshaw and costs of suit and of sale. <em>viz. </em>1308 dollars 50 cents, and also deducting the sum previ ously indorsed ; so that the plaintiff having received cards for the balance according to this computation, the guaranty was satisfied and discharged. The judge was of opinion, that no further allowance could be made on account of Henshaw\u2019s debt, than 500 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">The plaintiff insisted, that by reason of the judgment and execution, and the proceedings under them, Henshaw had lost his lien on the note, and therefore that the defendant was liable for the whole amount of the note upon his guaranty ; but this was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\">The question as to the correctness of all these opinions was reserved for the consideration of the whole Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-7\"><em>J.

As to the extent and construction of guaranties, see Fell on Guar. 116, 129; Chitty on Contr. 21; Cumpston <em>v. M'Nair, </em>1 Wendell, 461; <em>Merle </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>2 Campb. 413; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Pritchard, 2 </em>Campb. 436 and 12 East, 227; 3 Wheat. 148, note <em>Cremer v.

The note, as contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>plated by the parties, is recited in the contract, and this iec\u00a1tal is to govern. <em>Arlington </em>v. <em>Merricke, </em>2 Saund. 411; <em>Barker </em>v. Parker, 1 T. R. 287.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-9\">The lien of Henshaw was discharged by the manner in which he proceeded to enforce his demand, and so the 500 dollars should not be deducted. The assignment was subject to the lien, and that being removed, the whole note was assigned. <em>Cleverly v. Brackett, 8 </em>Mass. R. 150; <em>Swett v Brown, </em>5 Pick. 180; <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Mason, 215, 217; Metcalf\u2019s Yelv. 67 e ; <em>Cowell </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>16 Ves. 281; <em>Cortelyou </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>2 Gaines\u2019s Gas 211.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-10\">The plaintiff did not assent that the cards should be sold before the note fell due ; he had no notice of the day and place of sale; and whatever might be the rights of Henshaw as to his lien, the premature delivery and sale of the cards were a breach of the defendant\u2019s guaranty. <em>Garlick </em>v. <em>Janies, </em>12 Johns. R. 146; <em>Cortelyou </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>2 Gaines\u2019s Gas. 204 ; Metcalf\u2019s Yelv. 177 <em>a.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-11\">The sale of the cards by the officer by auction, and at Leices ter, wffiich was not a suitable market, and upon the short notice of four days, was a breach of the guaranty. The plaintiff was at least entitled to have the cards sold in a prudent manner, and not at a great sacrifice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-12\">The cards delivered to the plaintiff were deficient in quality through the fraud of Horace Smith. There was therefore no payment to the plaintiff, and although he might have an action against H. Smith, he is not obliged to look to him, but may rely, for his remedy, upon the guaranty.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b386-7\">\n<em>Sept. 17th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-13\"><em>Bates, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b386-14\">Wilde J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATL\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff claims to recover in this action the whole amount of the note assigned to him by the defendant; and the defendant, on his part, contends that, upon the facts appearing in the report, he is by law wholly discharged from his responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">The defendant was the guardian of one Alpheus Smith, who was indebted to the plaintiff in a large amount, and the note in question was assigned for the purpose of satisfying that demand ; the plaintiff agreeing to account with the defendant, as guardian of Smith, for the amount he should receive on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>note assigned, and to pay over the balance, if any there should be, after satisfying his own demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">By the terms of the assignment, the plaintiff became entitled to the balance due on the note assigned, after deducting the claims of one H. G. Henshaw, to whom the note had been pledged, which claims were however not to exceed the sum of 500 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">It appears that after the assignment of the note, Henshaw commenced a suit against Alpheus Smith for the recovery of his demand, and proceeded therein to judgment and execution ; and it has been argued for the plaintiff, that Henshaw thereby virtually relinquished his lien on the note. We think however that this is immaterial in the present action ; for if the lien on the note was discharged by these proceedings, still, by the terms of the assignment and guaranty, Henshaw\u2019s claim, to the amount of 500 dollars, was to be satisfied out of the proceeds of the note , and as to this amount the plaintiff has no title under the assignment and guaranty. So that the only question on this part of the case is, as to the amount to be deducted for Henshaw\u2019s claim \u2014 whether it shall be limited to the sum of 500 dollars, or is to be extended to the amount of sales which were made on Henshaw\u2019s execution to satisfy that amount. And we think, that by the obvious construction of the defendant\u2019s contract, the amount of sales must be allowed. Henshaw\u2019s debt, not however to exceed the sum of 500 dollars, was to be paid. The limitation clearly applies to the debt, and not to the amount of sales which might be made to pay it. The whole of Henshaw\u2019s debt, provided it should not exceed 500 dollars, was to be discharged by the sale of cards, to be delivered according to the terms of the note. Whether the cards would sell for more or less than the appraised value, could not have been ascertained at the time of the contract, nor is there any reason to suppose that such a question was within the contemplation of the parties. Henshaw was under no obligation to receive his pay in cards ; and when Horace Smith, the maker of the note, turned them out at an appraised value, the plaintiff, if he wished to avoid any loss by a forced sale, should have prevented it by paying Hen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>shaw\u2019s demand, as he might have done, for he had notice of the intended sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The plaintiff must have been aware of the construction now put on the contract of assignment and guaranty, by Wash-burn\u2019s letter to Packard, the plaintiff\u2019s agent; yet he made no objection to the sales under Henshaw\u2019s execution ; but on rhe contrary, he impliedly ratified and confirmed them, by receiving the balance of the note and delivering the note up to the maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">We are therefore clearly of opinion, that the amount of sales, to the extent of satisfying Henshaw\u2019s demand to the amount of 500 dollars, must be allowed in payment in favor of the defendant. So far as the sales exceeded the amount necessary for this purpose, the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action ; and the cards thus sold are to be accounted for at their just value, and the indorsement of 1308 dollars 50 cents must be reduced accordingly, to the amount necessary to satisfy the sum of 500 dollars, and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">As to the sum of 286 dollars 27 cents, indorsed before the assignment of the note, that also we think must be allowed. It was contended at the trial, that this sum ought not to be allowed without proof that the plaintiff or his agent had knowledge of the indorsement, at the time of the assignment of the note ; and evidence on this point was offered by both parties, which however was thought immaterial, no evidence being offered to show any fraudulent concealment on the part of the defendant; and we are all of the same opinion. We can not infer from the language of the assignment or the guaranty, that the defendant intended to stipulate that any particular sum was due on the note. The intention was to assign the balance actually due, whatever the amount might be, subject to a deduction to the extent of Henshaw\u2019s debt under the limitation specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">The amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand was not known, nor could it be ascertained whether the balance due on the note was sufficient, or more than sufficient, to discharge the demand Accordingly the balance, after making the stipulated deduction, was to be received and accounted for by the plaintiff, but the amount of the balance was not ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The sum of 669 dollars 61 cents, received in cards from Horace Smith, must also be allowed. If there was any fraud or deception as to the quality of the cards practised by him, the defendant is not responsible for it. The cards were accepted by the plaintiff, and it was his business to examine their quality, and the loss, if any, should fall on the plaintiff, rather than on the defendant, who had no concern in that transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\n<em>Judgment for plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
