In answer to the complaint and to the interrogatories, the administrator stated, that previous to April 1, 1806, he had labored for his father for about sixteen years, for most of which time he claimed compensation ; that on that day he received from his father a deed, dated June 23, 1792, given by J. Bates to him (the respondent), and which he understood was procured by his father\u2019s giving up- a deed formerly given to him (the father) by Bates, bearing the same date; that he believed, and he has no doubt his father believed, that the amount due to the respondent and the sum which the respondent then secured and afterwards paid to his father, were a full equivalent to the interest which his father had in the farm ; that at the time of receiving the deed, the respondent delivered to his father the instrument above set forth ; that no consideration ever passed to him from his father, for the giving of this instrument, nor did the respondent ever expect to pay the sums therein mentioned ; that the instrument remained in his father\u2019s hands until his decease in August, 1825, (when it came into the respondent\u2019s hands,) without any demand or request on the respondent for the payment of any thing thereon ; but on the contrary, his father repeatedly told him, that he (the father) never should claim of the respondent any payment on the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>strument, and that the services which the respondent had rendered him and was from time to time rendering him, were a full equivalent to all the sums which he might or could demand by virtue of the instrument, and that he considered the instrument to be fully settled and paid by these services; that the respondent fully believed that the services which he rendered to his father, from the date of the instrument to the time of his decease, were of more value to him and more injurious to the respondent, than the payment of the 50 dollars would have been. Re further stated, that the instrument was handed to him by S. Fiske, one of the executors named in the will of Ephraim Bacon, (which was not proved and allowed,) and that it came into his possession with other papers of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\">The complainants, reserving all manner of advantage of ex ception to the insufficiencies and impertinence of the answer, for replication say, that they will aver and prove their bill anu complaint to be true, certain and sufficient in law to be an swered to, and that the answer is uncertain, untrue and insufficient to be replied to, without that, that any other matter or thing whatsoever in the answer contained, material or effectual in the law to be replied unto, or to be confessed and avoided, traversed or denied, is true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\">The Court of Probate allowed the administrator\u2019s account, and adjudged that he should be discharged and not held for any thing which might be supposed due to the estate of the intestate on the lease above mentioned. The court further adjudged, that no collateral evidence ought to be admitted to contradict the answers of the administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-9\">The complainants appealed from this decree, for several reasons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-10\">1. Because the judge of probate refused to strike out from the answer of the administrator certain matters not relevant to any interrogatory put by the complainants, but altogether irrelevant, impertinent and improper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">2. Because the administrator was not required to prove the truth of ceitain allegations by him made in his answer, whereby he attempts to discharge himself from the payment of the obligation purporting a lease, although these allegations were denied by the complainants to be true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Az4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>3. Because the complainants were not permitted to produce an7 evidence to contradict or explain divers allegations contained in the answer, though they offered so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-4\">4. Because the judge decided that the answer was sufficient in law and conclusive to discharge the respondent from any liability as administrator, upon the obligation above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">5. Because the judge refused to admit evidence to charge the administrator for goods, effects, credits or assets not credited in his second administration account, which was open and pending before the judge.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b510-6\">\n<em>Oct. 5th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AIQ\"><em>J. Davis </em>and Tufts, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3V\">Two points are decided by the judge of probate ; first, that the answer of the administrator discharged him from liability upon the instrument produced ; and secondly, that no evidence was admissible to impeach his answer. In both respects the decree is erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXqu\">The complaint had a two-fold object; \u2014 that the administrator should produce the lease, and that he should answer as to other property. In respect to the lease, the complaint is like a bill in chancery to produce papers. Com. Dig. <em>Chancery, </em>3B 1, 3I1. The administrator was called on simply to produce.the lease ; which it was incumbent on him to do, in order</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-8\">that the appellants might be in as good a situation as before he was appointed administrator. He produces the lease and swears that he has complied with its terms. We contend that he is not to use his own statement in discharge of himself, and that it ought to be struck out of his answer, as irrelevant and improper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-9\">But if the answer is to stand, it is not sufficient to discharge the administrator. Where a defendant, in his answer, admits his liability and sets forth also some fact to discharge himself, he is bound by his admission, but he must prove the fact alleged in his discharge. Blake\u2019s Ch. Pract. 247; Hart v. <em>Ten Eyck, </em>2 Johns. Ch. Rep. 87.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-10\">The judge of probate erred likewise, in determining that the appellants should not offer evidence to disprove the statements in the answer. It has always been the usage to litigate an administrator\u2019s account, although he shall have sworn to its correctness. His oath is not conclusive. Toller, (3d ed.) 492, cites 4 Burn\u2019s Eccles. Law, 427 ; <em>Selectmen of Boston </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>v. </em>Boylston, 4 Mass. R. 318. On a bill of discovery in chancery, the plaintiff may offer evidence to disprove the answer. Whether this complaint is considered like a bill of discovery, or as auxiliary to the proceedings in the probate court, it may be contradicted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-4\">The object of the appellee is to drive the appellants to their remedy upon the probate bond, hoping that in such case they will be obliged to use the whole of his answer; but though the appellants would probably find no great difficulty in maintaining a suit on the bond, yet it is apprehended that substantial justice may be done by requiring the administrator to prove in the Court of Probate, that he has paid all sums due upon the instrument in question.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-5\">JVeteion, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsQ\">To what extent and in what manner the judge of probate shall proceed in interrogating an administrator in regard to the settlement of his accounts, has not been determined ; whether he is invested with only the power of spiritual courts ; or whether he is to proceed like a court of equity on a bill against an executor to account, or like a court of equity upon a bill of discovery ; or whether he has power to proceed in all these three ways. In the spiritual courts, if the administrator is examined on oath touching the inventory, no evidence is admissible to contradict bis answer. Toller, 253. There is no good reason for supposing that the legislature intended to give the judge of probate all the powers of a court of equity, in relation to the examination of an administrator ; and in a court of equity, if the complainant makes the administrator his witness, the whole answer must oe taken together. This complaint cannot be likened to a bill of discovery, for that is used only in aid of another suit; but here the object seems to be to charge the administrator. 1 Madd. Ch. Pr. 196. To effect the object of the complainants, the Court of Probate must unite in itself the powers of spiritual courts and courts of chancery, in the three modes of proceeding before mentioned. But it is apprehended that only the powers of spiritual courts were intended to be conferred on the judge of probate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">This complaint must be founded upon <em>St. </em>1783, c. 32, \u00a711; but this statute does not provide for the examination of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>executor or administrator, but only of other persons who are supposed to have concealed or embezzled effects of the deceased. <em>Selectmen of Boston </em>v. Boylston, 4 Mass. R. 318. If the heirs can file such a complaint against the administrator, it must be in the nature of a bill of discovery, and then his answer cannot be contradicted.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b512-6\"><em>March 26th, </em>1830,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-10\">The answer contains nothing irrelevant or impertinent. If the administrator had simply produced the paper, he would have made himself liable upon it; it was therefore proper for him to state all the circumstances, whereby it would appear that he was not chargeable.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-11\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av5\">drew up the opinion of the Court. We think the proceedings of the judge of probate in this case were incorrect, and that his decree allowing the second account of administration must be reversed. It was heretofore deter mined, that the administrator was obliged to answer under oath touching any matters relating to his account and tending to charge him with any estate or effects which he may have omitted either by mistake or design. Without this power he may defraud the heirs or creditors without any opportunity to detect, him. As in the present case ; there was an obligation from him to his father, found uncancelled among the papers of the deceased, which came to his hands as administrator. He might have burnt or otherwise have destroyed it, and there might be no proof that it was ever in existence. Merely swearing to his account gives little security, without the authority in the judge of probate, at the instance of those interested in the estate, to examine him critically under the sanction of his oath. It was objected on a former hearing, that it is con trary to justice and to the principles of the constitution, to sub ject a party to such an inquisitorial power, and by means of it to make him furnish evidence against himself. But the same objection will lie to the trustee process and to bills in equity, which require answers under oath. It should be recollected that an administrator is a trustee, accepting the trust voluntarily, and so having no right to complain of the liabilities incident to the trust. Such has been the practice in the Probate Courts, and it has been sanctioned by this Court in the case of <em>Selectmen of Boston </em>v. Boylston, 4 Mass. R. 318, and <em>Stearns </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Stearns, </em>1 Pick. 157.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But it certainly does not follow, that because he may be so examined, he will have a right to discharge himself by his own statement and declaration, unaccompanied by any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The rule is, that any answer that is within the proper scope and limits of the question put to him, shall be available in his favor ; as in confessions in suits at common law, the whole shall be taken together, not as conclusive, but as evidence for the consideration of the jury. But because he is put upon interrogatories, to allow him the general liberty of avoiding the effect of his admissions by going into independent matter, without any proof to support it, would be often to render this mode of inquiry wholly ineffectual for the purposes for which it was instituted. We think the judge ought to have rejected the irrelevant matter if not supported by proof, and that the appellants ought to have been allowed to contradict his statement by evidence ; and because this was refused, the decree is reversed and the case remitted to the judge of probate for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-14\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c. </em>67, \u00a7 7</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
