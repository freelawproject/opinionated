At the trial, in the Common Pleas before <em>Strong </em>J., the plaintiffs contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the settlement of Abner Putnam was derived from his grandfather, Elisha Putnam, through his father. In order to prove that the settlement of the grandfather was in Oxford, they offered in evidence a registry copy of a deed of land, dated September 30, 1754, executed by him, in which he was described as being of Oxford ; and a copy of his last will, dated May 20, 1758, in which he was described as \u201cnow resident \u25a0n Oxford.\u201d</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>Oct 3d,</em>\n</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-7\">The defendants objected to the admission of this evidence, but it was admitted by the judge ; and it was read to the jury, as evidence of the grandfather\u2019s gaining a settlement in Oxford under <em>Prov. St. </em>12 &amp; 13 <em>Will. </em>3, <em>c. </em>10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-8\">The defendants then offered evidence to prove that the grandfather, for a long time before the year 1754, had a legal settlement in Sutton ; and that afterwards, for a series of years previous to 1784, the father was supported as a pauper by that town ; but did not offer to prove that his legal settlement was m that town. But this evidence was rejected by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs.

Delprat, 4 Mass. R. 702; <em>Gray </em>v. Goodrich, 7 John's R. 95; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>1 Wheat. 6. The words \u201c now resident in Oxford,\u201d used in the will, indicate a temporary residence only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-11\"><em>J. Davis </em>and <em>Allen, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0p\">in order to show that the will and deed were admissible in evidence, cited 1 Stark. Ev. 307; <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Rawlings, </em>7 East, 279; <em>Higham v. Ridg way, </em>10 East, 109; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Robson, </em>15 East, 32; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Pembroke, </em>11 East, 504. The evidence offered by the de fendants, in regard to the settlement of the grandfather in Sutton, was rightly rejected, for it has no tendency to prove that lie had a settlement there, at the time when we show it to have been in Oxford. The fact of the father\u2019s subsequently receiving relief as a pauper in Sutton, is no evidence of his settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>there. <em>King </em>v. Chaderton, 2 East, 27; <em>King </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>8 East, 498.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b501-4\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5p\">__ delivered the opinion of the Court. We think the registry copy of the deed and the copy of the will were properly admitted in evidence, as facts tending to show that the residence of the grandfather was in Oxford ; from which his settlement, Qnder the then existing pauper laws, might be inferred by the jury. We consider this species of evidence as different from the mere verbal declaration of a pauper as to his residence, which has been ruled not to be evidence. The designation of his residence m a solemn instrument, such as a deed or a will, is in the nature of a fact rather than a declara tian, being made when there was no controversy, and when no possible interest could exist to give a false designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u2022 But this evidence, which is merely presumptive, being admitted, it was proper to let the other party into proof of facts and circumstances, which would have a tendency to rebut the presumption arising from it. And we consider the facts offered to be proved by the defendants, to be of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The original settlement of the grandfather being in Sutton, his temporary residence in Oxford was not inconsistent with it; for he might have been in the place at both the periods mentioned in the deed and will, and yet never have gained a settlement there. He might have been warned out, or not have remained there a year at any one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Then the fact offered to be proved, that the father, many years afterwards, was maintained as a pauper by the town of Sutton, might furnish presumptive evidence, that the grandfather\u2019s settlement in Sutton continued and was transmitted to the father, or that the latter had gained a settlement there in his own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">This would not be sufficient, independently, to prove his settlement in Sutton, but was admissible to contradict the inference, drawn from the presumptive evidence, that the grandfather had gained a settlement in Oxford. On this ground only, we think that the verdict must be set aside, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
