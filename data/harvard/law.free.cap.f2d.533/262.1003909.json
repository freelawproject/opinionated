Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al, </em>5 Cir., 1970. 431 F.2d 409. Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-29\">GEE, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b322-30\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to quash the search warrant, to suppress the seized materials and to return property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>illegally seized in connection with a charge of distributing obscene material. We do not reach the legality vel non of the search warrant because we find the district court\u2019s order to be nonappealable, and we therefore dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">This motion, made pursuant to Fed. R. Crim.P. 41(e), was made prior to appellant\u2019s indictment, but \u201cthe mere circumstance of a preindictment motion\u201d does not make the order final and appealable. <em>Di-Bella v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 121, 131, 82 S. Ct. 654, 660, 7 L.Ed.2d 614, 621 (1962). Only if this motion was a collateral attempt to retrieve property and not an effort to suppress evidence in related criminal proceedings is it appealable. <em>DiBella </em>defines a Rule 41(e) motion as independent \u201c[o]nly if the motion is solely for return of property and is in no way tied to a criminal prosecution in esse against the movant.\u201d 369 U.S. at 131-32, 82 S.Ct. at 660, 7 L.Ed.2d at 621. The Court goes on to suggest that a prosecution is <em>in esse </em>\u201cwhen at the time of the ruling there is outstanding a complaint, or a detention or release on bail following arrest, or an arraignment, information, or indictment.\u201d 369 U.S. at 131-132, 82 S.Ct. at 660, 7 L.Ed.2d at 621. The order denying this motion was dated September 12, 1975; appellant was not indicted until November 13, 1975, and apparently was never detained. So according to the literal language of <em>DiBella </em>there was no criminal prosecution <em>in esse </em>at the time this appeal was brought. But in <em>Application of United States, </em>427 F.2d 1140 (5th Cir. 1970), this court relied on <em>DiBella </em>to hold that where appellants were under indictment at the time of their appeal their motion to suppress was an integral part of a criminal proceeding and was not appealable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the subsequent indictments were not essential to the finding of nonappealability because three of the appellants were not indicted by the grand jury, and yet the court found that their Rule 41(e) motion was made primarily to suppress evidence from the anticipated grand jury hearings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore was not made \u201csolely for return of property\u201d as <em>DiBella </em>requires.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peachtree, </em>456 F.2d 442 (5th Cir. 1972), this court relied on <em>DiBella </em>to find that even in the absence of formal criminal charges at the time a search warrant was issued, the order authorizing the warrant was merely a step in a criminal prosecution and was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Because appellant\u2019s motion, if granted, would prevent the grand jury\u2019s consideration of the seized materials, we find its denial an interlocutory ruling and dismiss this appeal because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 limits our jurisdiction to appeals from final decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">. For a similar decision taking subsequent indictments into consideration to hold a Rule 41(e) motion nonappealable, <em>see Parrish v. United States, </em>376 F.2d 601 (4th Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">. If the motion to return property is granted, that property is not admissible in any hearing or trial, Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e), so the motion operates as a motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\">. Judge Boreman\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Parrish v. United States, supra </em>n. 1, objected to looking at subsequent events to decide questions on appeal, but found it \u201cperfectly obvious\u201d that the Rule 41(e) motion made prior to arrest and prior to indictment was not made solely for the return of property and therefore fell into that class of nonappealable orders described in <em>DiBella. </em>The Eighth Circuit, on the other hand, found jurisdiction to review a Rule 41(e) motion made prior to arrest, arraignment and indictment because no criminal prosecution was <em>in esse. United States v. Alexander, </em>428 F.2d 1169 (8th Cir. 1970). We respectfully reject this view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
