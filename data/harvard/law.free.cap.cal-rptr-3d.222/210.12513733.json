The Court of Appeal here concluded that article XIII C does not constrain voters' constitutional power to propose and\n   adopt initiatives, and that under article II, section 11 and Elections Code section 9214,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the initiative at issue should be submitted to the voters at a special election, not at a\n   general election, as article XIII C would require. In light of the text and other indicia of the purpose associated with the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, we agree with the Court of Appeal that article XIII C does not limit voters' \"power to raise taxes by statutory initiative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale, Inc. v.

A contrary conclusion would require an unreasonably broad construction of the term \"local government\" at the expense of the people's constitutional right to direct democracy, undermining our longstanding and consistent view that courts should protect and liberally construe it. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Associated Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 18 Cal.3d at p. 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20P.2d%20473\">\n    557 P.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) As Ulysses once tied himself to the mast so he could resist the Sirens' tempting song (Homer, The Odyssey, Book XII), voters too can conceivably make the clear and important choice to bind themselves by making it more difficult to enact initiatives in the future. The electorate made no such clear choice to tie itself to the mast here. Without a direct reference in the text of a provision-or a similarly clear, unambiguous indication that it was within the ambit of a provision's purpose to constrain the people's initiative power-we will not construe a provision as imposing such a limitation. (See\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale\n   </em>\n   , at p. 252,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We therefore affirm the Court of Appeal's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The California Cannabis Coalition is a nonprofit corporation that drafted the medical marijuana initiative at issue here in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The initiative proposed to repeal an existing City of Upland (City) ordinance banning medical marijuana dispensaries; to adopt regulations permitting and establishing standards for the operation of up to three dispensaries within the City; and to require that each dispensary pay the City an \"annual Licensing and Inspection fee\" in the amount of $75,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In September 2014, initiative proponents Nicole De La Rosa and James Velez\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a notice of their intent to circulate the initiative petition (\u00a7 9202), and the city attorney prepared a ballot title and summary (\u00a7 9203). The petition plaintiffs circulated included a request that the initiative be considered by voters at a special election. At least 15 percent of the City's registered voters signed the petition, meeting the statutory threshold for\n   triggering consideration of the initiative\n   ( \u00a7 9214 ), and the City accepted a certificate of sufficiency from the San Bernardino County Registrar of Voters on February 9, 2015. At that point, section 9214 obliged the City to either (1) adopt the initiative without alteration; (2) immediately order a special election; or (3) order an agency report and, once the report was presented, adopt the initiative or order a special election. (\n   <em>\n    Tuolumne Jobs &amp; Small Business Alliance v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2014)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263637\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/59/1029/#p1033\">\n    59 Cal.4th 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1033,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20601\">\n    175 Cal.Rptr.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=330%20P.3d%20912\">\n    330 P.3d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Tuolumne Jobs\n   </em>\n   ); see \u00a7\u00a7 1405 [time for special election], 9212 [referral to city agency for report].) The City elected to order an agency report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Various city departments thereafter prepared a joint agency report. Among other things, the report concluded that the\n   $75,000 \"fee\" for the initiative would exceed the costs incurred from issuing a license to and conducting annual inspections of the dispensaries. The report estimated actual costs to be slightly more than $15,000 and found the excess amount of the fee to constitute a general tax. As such, the report determined that the initiative could not be voted on during a special election as required by section 9214, but rather, under article XIII C, section 2, had to be submitted to the voters at the next general election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 9, 2015, the city council received the agency report and adopted a resolution consistent with the report's conclusions. The city council also provided notice and direction for submitting the initiative to the voters on November 8, 2016, the next general election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs then filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court. They alleged that the City violated section 9214 by failing to submit the initiative to the voters at a special election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also argued that article XIII C, section 2 did not apply because the $75,000 charge proposed by the initiative was not a tax, nor was it imposed by local government. The court denied the writ petition, determining that the charge constituted a tax and had to be placed on the next general election ballot. The court, however, did not specifically address whether article XIII C, section 2 applies to taxes imposed by voter initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeal reversed. The court held that article XIII C, section 2 only governs levies that are imposed by local government and, therefore, it does not apply to the voter initiative at issue\n   here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the court noted that the people's initiative power must be protected and construed liberally, with doubts resolved in favor of its exercise whenever possible. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Rossi v. Brown\n   </em>\n   (1995)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1989429\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/9/688/#p695\">\n    9 Cal.4th 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 695,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20363\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20P.2d%20557\">\n    889 P.2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Rossi\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    Associated Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 18 Cal.3d at p. 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20P.2d%20473\">\n    557 P.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The court determined that neither the text nor the history of article XIII C contains any evidence that the enactors' intended purpose included constraining future voters' ability to raise taxes via statutory initiative. The court accordingly directed the superior court to issue a writ of mandate compelling the City to place the initiative on a special ballot in accordance with section 9214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We granted the City's petition for review on June 29, 2016. On November 8, 2016, the initiative at issue was submitted to the voters and defeated, with 64.38 percent voting no.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the case is thus technically moot, it nonetheless presents important questions of continuing public interest that may evade review.

Article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (b) provides, \"No local government may impose, extend, or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote.... The election required by this subdivision shall be consolidated with a regularly scheduled general election for members of the governing body of the local government....\" Despite no mention of voter initiatives, the City and the concurring and dissenting opinion (conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 230-231, 401 P.3d at 66-67) contend this provision nonetheless applies to such instruments and, notwithstanding section 9214, requires that initiatives imposing, extending, or increasing a general tax must first be submitted to the electorate at a regularly scheduled general election, rather than a special election. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   By its terms, article XIII C, section 2 only applies to actions taken by a \"local government.\" To cabin uncertainty about what \"local government\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   connotes, article XIII C then defines the term to mean \"any county, city, city and county, including a charter city or county, any special district, or any other local or regional governmental entity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1, subd.

But that case considered whether a constitutional provision conferring local legislative power on \"[a]ny county, city, town, or township\" precluded a\n   city's charter from authorizing voters to exercise the city's power via initiative. (\n   <em>\n    Pfahler\n   </em>\n   , at p. 81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20P.%20270\">\n    88 P. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

We did not suggest, however, that the terms \"local government\" and \"electorate\" are equivalent or not meaningfully distinguishable, particularly when considering whether explicit restrictions on the former should impliedly be imposed on the latter. (See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 87,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20P.%20270\">\n    88 P. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [distinguishing between actions of a city council and electors].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, construing local government as an entity distinct from the public is consistent not only with how the term is used in the provision's text, but also with how it is used in its findings and declarations. (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996) text of Prop. 218, p. 108 [\"This measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which\n   <em>\n    local governments\n   </em>\n   exact revenue\n   <em>\n    from taxpayers\n   </em>\n   \" (italics added) ]; see also\n   <em>\n    Orange Citizens for Parks &amp; Recreation v.

Contrary to the concurring and dissenting opinion (conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 231, 232, 234, 401 P.3d at 66, 68, 69), this understanding also proves compatible with section 9200, which provides that \"[o]rdinances may be enacted by and for any incorporated city,\" encompassing situations where the electorate enacts an ordinance, via initiative,\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, the only portion of article XIII C even mentioning the voters' direct democracy rights appears in section 3. ( Art. XIII C, \u00a7 3 [citing art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 8 &amp; 9, respectively the people's initiative and referendum powers].) The concurring and dissenting opinion (conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 235, 401 P.3d at 70) concludes this language means the voters knew the initiative power could affect local taxes and, further, must mean voters intended to (silently) subsume tax-related initiatives within the ambit of article XIII C, section 2. But section 3's single reference to the initiative power proves, at best, too slender a reed to support the substantial limitations that the City and the concurring and dissenting opinion would have us read into Proposition 218's provisions. If anything, the reference in section 3 makes the omission of any limitations on the initiative power in section 2-or anywhere else in article XIII C-even more glaring. To infer from that absence a calculated decision\n   to squelch voters' initiative rights is essentially to embrace a presumption against the initiative power, rather than in favor of it. Such a conclusion\n   would be profoundly at odds with our obligation to \" 'jealously guard' \" the voters' exercise of their initiative power. (\n   <em>\n    Associated Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 18 Cal.3d at p. 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20P.2d%20473\">\n    557 P.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Confronted with the text of article XIII C, a reasonable reader would be unlikely to infer that Proposition 218 was designed to regulate the initiative power through an explicit reference in section 3 and an implicit one in section 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Third, even if it were conceivably possible to treat the term \"local government\" in article XIII C as an unusually oblique reference to the voters who comprise the relevant electorate, the difficulty in accepting\n   this inference ratchets up given how the definition of \"local government\" closes with the phrase, \"or any other local or regional governmental entity.\" (Art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (b).) That the elected officials and civil servants more commonly understood to be part of a local government can be surprised by the actions of the voters they serve belies the idea that the amalgam of individuals who constitute the electorate comprise a local or regional governmental entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   What's more, the principle of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   suggests that when \"specific words follow general words in a statute or vice versa,\" the general words ordinarily are best construed in a manner that underscores their similarity to the specific words. (\n   <em>\n    International Federation of Professional &amp; Technical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2007)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673671\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/42/319/#p342\">\n    42 Cal.4th 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20693\">\n    64 Cal.Rptr.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20P.3d%20488\">\n    165 P.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Interpreting \"city\" to include the electorate would give that term a much broader meaning than the adjoining specific term, \"local or regional governmental entity.\" (Art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (b).) Thus, our interpretation of local government is consistent with the ordinary understanding of the term, the text of related provisions, and the\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   principle. By contrast, the interpretation of the City and the concurring and dissenting opinion would require us to insert words-such as \"electorate,\" \"voters,\" or \"people\"-into section 1, subdivision (b) and section 2, subdivision (b) of article XIII C. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858 [\"In the construction of a statute or instrument, the office of the Judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted ...\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Our interpretation is also consistent with article XIII D of the state Constitution, which, like article XIII C, was added by Proposition 218. (\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 49 Cal.4th at p. 285,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20620\">\n    109 Cal.Rptr.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20P.3d%20350\">\n    231 P.3d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Article XIII D addresses the imposition of assessments and property-related fees by local agencies, and section 4 of that article contains a variety of procedural requirements that must be fulfilled before an \"agency\" may adopt an assessment ( Cal. Const., art. XIII D, \u00a7 4 [e.g., notice and hearing requirements].) Article XIII D defines agency as \"any local government as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 1 of [article XIII C ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2, subd. (a).) Under the City's interpretation then, \"agency\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   in article XIII D also includes voters-an understanding that seems, at best, quite an improbable version of what was plausibly contemplated when this provision was enacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The alternative is to treat the term \"local government\" as encompassing the entire coterie of individuals constituting the electorate-thus burdening voters' power to propose and adopt initiatives concerning taxation. (\n   <em>\n    Rossi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9 Cal.4th at p. 702,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20363\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20P.2d%20557\">\n    889 P.2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) If this quite significant consequence were consistent with the most reasonable understanding of Proposition 218's purpose despite the absence of text in articles XIII C or D bolstering this view, one would assume there would be some mention of such a goal elsewhere in Proposition 218 or its ballot materials. (\n   <em>\n    Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (2001)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    531 U.S. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    121 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [enactors do not \"hide elephants in mouseholes\"]; see\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at p. 250,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The City and the concurring and dissenting opinion cite no such evidence. Nor can we find any. To the contrary: The crux of the concern repeatedly reflected in the ballot materials\n   is with local governments and politicians-not the electorate-imposing taxes. Nowhere in the materials\n   is there any suggestion that Proposition 218 would rescue voters from measures they might, through a majority vote, impose on themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For example, Proposition 218's findings and declarations state, \"\n   <em>\n    local governments have subjected taxpayers\n   </em>\n   to excessive tax, assessment, fee and charge increases.... This measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which\n   <em>\n    local governments exact revenue\n   </em>\n   from taxpayers\n   <em>\n    without their consent\n   </em>\n   .\" (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996) text of Prop. 218, p. 108, italics added (1996 Ballot Pamp.).) The ballot materials are in accord. The argument in favor of the measure, for example, stated that it \"does NOT prevent government from raising and spending money for vital services.... If\n   <em>\n    politicians want to raise taxes\n   </em>\n   they need only convince local voters that new taxes are really needed.\" (1996 Ballot Pamp.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , argument in favor of Prop. 218, p. 76, italics added;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , rebuttal to argument against Prop. 218, p. 77 [\"Proposition 218 simply gives taxpayers the right to vote on taxes and\n   <em>\n    stops politicians' end-runs\n   </em>\n   around Proposition 13\" (italics added) ].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, these materials indicate both that article XIII C employs the term \"local government\" as it is commonly understood and that the provision's intended\n   purpose did not include limiting voters' \"power to raise taxes ... by statutory initiative.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (See\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at p. 250,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This reading finds further support in the ballot materials concerning two related initiative constitutional amendments: Proposition 13, which added article XIII A in 1978, and Proposition 26, which amended article XIII C in 2010. The ballot materials concerning both initiatives similarly evince a specific concern with\n   <em>\n    politicians\n   </em>\n   and their imposition of taxes without voter approval.

The City contends it applies to the electorate because, in the City's view, the voters are the ones who ultimately impose\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   local tax. The City notes that, under the provision, no local government may impose a general tax \"unless and until\"\n   (art. XIII C, \u00a7 2, subd. (b)) the tax is submitted to the voters and approved by a majority vote. For support the City cites\n   <em>\n    Guardino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1960664\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/11/220/#p253\">\n    11 Cal.4th 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20207\">\n    45 Cal.Rptr.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20P.2d%20225\">\n    902 P.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But in that case, we simply noted that a local government's imposition of a general tax \"will not take effect\" absent subsequent approval by the voters-in other words, the voters' approval acts as a precondition (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 240,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20207\">\n    45 Cal.Rptr.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20P.2d%20225\">\n    902 P.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) to a tax measure becoming operative. But that does not transform voters into the \"local government\" referenced in article XIII C, section 2. Nor does it mean it is always and only the electorate that imposes a tax. Suppose a constitutional provision required that no city council could impose a zoning restriction unless and until the restriction was submitted to and approved by the city attorney. Does that mean that it is the city attorney-and not the city council-that actually imposes zoning restrictions? No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The City also argues that article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (b) constrains voter initiatives because \"statutory and constitutional limits on the power of local government apply equally to local initiatives.\" The City primarily relies on\n   <em>\n    Legislature v.

While our cases noted that the restrictions at issue made little sense in light of the distinct initiative process (e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at p. 252, fn. 5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"electorate does not generally follow 'legislative' procedures when exercising the initiative power\"] ), nothing suggests those observations formed the metes and bounds of our holding.

The City cites no such evidence, because there is none here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Indeed, as we observed in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at page 252,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , when an initiative's intended purpose includes imposing requirements on voters, evidence of such a purpose is clear. In article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (d), for example, the enactors adopted a requirement providing that, before a local government can impose, extend, or increase any special tax, voters must approve the tax by a two-thirds vote. That constitutes a higher vote requirement than would otherwise apply. (\u00a7 9217 [providing for a majority vote].) That the voters explicitly imposed a procedural two-thirds vote requirement on themselves in article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (d) is evidence that they did not implicitly impose a procedural timing requirement in subdivision (b). (See\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale\n   </em>\n   , at p. 252,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Moreover, had the voters wanted the procedural requirements contained in article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (b) to apply to the initiative power, Proposition 218 could have made that clear by providing, \"No local government or initiative may impose, extend, or increase ...,\" by defining local government to include the electorate exercising its initiative power, or by imposing an absolute ban, i.e., \"No general tax shall be imposed, extended, or increased....\" (See\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale\n   </em>\n   , at p. 253,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [discussing similar language in Cal.

Not so. The Court of Appeal in this case concluded that the ordinary meaning of \"impose\" is \"to establish,\" not to collect (e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ponderosa Homes, Inc. v. City of San Ramon\n   </em>\n   (1994)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6042504\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/23/1761/#p1770\">\n    23 Cal.App.4th 1761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1770,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%2026\">\n    29 Cal.Rptr.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing Webster's 3d New Internat. Dict. (1970) p. 1136), and because it found no reason to depart from this understanding of the term, it construed the meaning of \"impose\" in article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (b) as consistent with this understanding.

In that case, we construed a statute added by Proposition 62, a statutory initiative adopted at the 1986 general election. The relevant language provided, \"No local government or district may impose any special tax unless and until such special tax is submitted to the electorate ...\" ( Gov.

A contrary conclusion would work an implied repeal of section 9214, something against which we have a strong presumption.

Such evidence might include an explicit\n   reference to the initiative power in a provision's text, or sufficiently unambiguous statements regarding such a purpose in ballot materials. The concurring and dissenting opinion queries \" 'by what authority' \" we require clear evidence of an intended purpose to constrain exercise of the initiative power. (Conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 237, 401 P.3d at 72.) Our answer is rooted firmly in the longstanding and consistent line of cases emphasizing courts' obligation to protect and liberally construe the initiative power (e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Associated Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 18 Cal.3d at p. 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20P.2d%20473\">\n    557 P.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) and to narrowly construe provisions that would burden or limit its exercise (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Rossi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9 Cal.4th at p. 696,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20363\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20P.2d%20557\">\n    889 P.2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those cases underscore the centrality of direct democracy in the California Constitution, and the status of our presumption liberally construing the initiative power as a paramount structural element of our Constitution. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Associated Home Builders\n   </em>\n   , at p. 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20P.2d%20473\">\n    557 P.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [describing the initiative as \" 'one of the most precious rights of our democratic process' \"].) A clear statement rule is consistent with, and indeed, appropriately advances our duty to safeguard the exercise of the initiative power. Although limits may be placed on it, and in some cases they have been, the best way to implement our oft-repeated references to the importance of the initiative is to avoid presuming that a provision constrains that power without a clear statement or equivalent evidence that such was the provision's intended purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In reaching a contrary conclusion, the concurring and dissenting opinion starts from the premise that the electors must have wanted to tie their own hands with respect to the imposition of local taxes. This very premise then undergirds the opinion's reading of the term \"local government\" as necessarily including the electorate. Nothing supports this premise, despite the opinion's confident assertion-as if it were discussing the attitudes of an individual well known only to select observers-that \"[w]hether a local government tax has been enacted by voter initiative or by vote of the city council is not article XIII C's concern.\" (Conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 240, 401 P.3d at 74). Defending this assertion is difficult for the simple reason that nothing in the text of article XIII C, or its context, supports the conclusion that the term\n   \"local government\" was meant to encompass the electorate. Any reasonable construction of article XIII C, section 2 must take into account the robust importance of the initiative power in other constitutional provisions-irrespective of whether or not the\n   \"voter initiative\" is \"article XIII C's concern\" (conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 240, 401 P.3d at 74).\n   (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Associated Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 18 Cal.3d at p. 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20P.2d%20473\">\n    557 P.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [describing the importance of the initiative power].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In playing down the importance of giving full effect to these provisions, the concurring and dissenting opinion turns our case law on its head-by essentially demanding evidence that the electors intended to\n   <em>\n    exempt\n   </em>\n   the initiative power from article XIII C, section 2 as a precondition for preserving that power in unencumbered form. (E.g., conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 231-231, 235, 401 P.3d at 66-67, 70.) To impose this requirement would be a stark departure from our precedent, and one impossible to square with our decisions on the power of initiative. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    DeVita\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9 Cal.4th at pp. 785-786,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20699\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20P.2d%201019\">\n    889 P.2d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [refusing to infer limits];\n   <em>\n    Rossi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9 Cal.4th at p. 696,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20363\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20P.2d%20557\">\n    889 P.2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [emphasizing breadth of initiative power and looking for express evidence of intent to limit].) Our analysis in those decisions consistently begins with the presumption that the initiative power is not constrained, then searches for clear evidence suggesting that electors could reasonably be understood to have imposed restrictions upon their constitutional power.

A hypothetical city council, it suggests, could conceivably collude with a public employee union to place a levy on the ballot as a means of raising revenue for a goal supported by both. To repay the union for campaign support, or simply because the union and council agree on the policy, the council accepts the union's contract proposal-which will be funded by increasing a utility tax. Under our interpretation, the City reasons, the city council could meet with the union, and the union could mobilize city employees to collect signatures on an initiative proposing the tax increase. Once enough signatures are collected-15 percent under section 9214 or 10 percent under section 9215-the city council could simply adopt the ordinance without submitting the tax increase to the voters. ( \u00a7\u00a7 9214, subd. (a), 9215, subd. (a).) Thus, the city council could effectively skirt article XIII C, section 2's command that \"[n]o local government may impose, extend, or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) These facts are not presented here, and we decline to take up what would happen should they arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The sequence of the City's actions with respect to the initiative causes us to make a final observation. Upon receiving a petition signed by not less than 15 percent of the city's voters, section 9214 obliges a city to (1) adopt the ordinance without alteration; (2) immediately order a special election; or (3) order an agency report and, once the report is presented to the city council, adopt the ordinance or order a special election. These deadlines are mandatory (\n   <em>\n    Tuolumne Jobs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 59 Cal.4th at p. 1038,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20601\">\n    175 Cal.Rptr.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=330%20P.3d%20912\">\n    330 P.3d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and the City erred when it ignored them. Its unilateral determination that the proposed initiative constituted a general tax and was therefore governed by article\n   XIII C, section 2 did not relieve it of its obligation to adhere to section 9214 -particularly given that the initiative purported to propose a \"fee\" and was thus, facially at least, not a tax measure. In the future, cities should follow section 9214 and order a special election. At that point, either the city or other interested parties may pursue any appropriate legal challenge to the measure either in the pre-, or more likely, postelection context. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Legislature v. Deukmejian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 34 Cal.3d at pp. 665-666,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20781\">\n    194 Cal.Rptr. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=669%20P.2d%2017\">\n    669 P.2d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [discussing the propriety of preelection review].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Multiple provisions of the state Constitution explicitly constrain the power of local governments to raise taxes.

Only by approving a measure that is unambiguous in its purpose to restrict the electorate's own initiative power can the voters limit such power, tying themselves to the proverbial mast as Ulysses did. Unless a provision explicitly constrains the initiative power or otherwise provides a similarly clear indication that its purpose includes constraining the voters' initiative power, we will not construe provisions as imposing such limitations. (See\n   <em>\n    Kennedy Wholesale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at p. 252,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We conclude that article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (b) does not limit voters' power to propose and adopt initiatives concerning taxation.

The city council refused, concluding that one of the initiative's provisions imposed an \"annual Licensing and Inspection fee\" that was in fact a disguised general tax, and, as such, required voter approval at a general, rather than special, election under article XIII C of the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. XIII C (article XIII C), added by Prop. 218, approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996) (Proposition 218).) I agree with the majority that the city council erred in refusing the request, though for a narrow reason: The city council should have put the initiative on the special election ballot and left questions about the validity of the fee to be sorted out in the courts. That conclusion would suffice to dispose of this case, which, as the majority says, is now moot in any event. (See maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 216, 401 P.3d at 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The bulk of the majority opinion, however, addresses the separate question whether article XIII C, which imposes certain requirements for voter approval of local government taxes, applies at all to taxes enacted by initiative. The majority says no: In the majority's view, when article XIII C speaks of taxes imposed by local government,\n   it means taxes enacted by the city council or other public officials; local taxes enacted by voter initiative are exempt. (See maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 227, 401 P.3d at 63.) But article XIII C contains no such exemption, and I see no basis for interpreting it as though it did. It is a basic tenet of the system that when a city's voters enact legislation by initiative, they do so \"by and for\" the city itself. ( Elec. Code, \u00a7 9200.) A tax passed by voter initiative, no less than a tax passed by vote of the city council, is a tax of the local government, to be collected by the local government, to raise revenue for the local government. None of this could have been lost on the electorate that, also by initiative, amended the California Constitution to set ground rules for voter approval of local taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   I concur in the judgment and in part II.D. of the majority opinion.

The city, the court concluded, instead refers to the municipal corporation and body politic. On that understanding, the court concluded that the California Constitution's reference to lawmaking by the \"city\" encompassed the \"direct exercise of legislative power by the people\" of the City of Los Angeles.

And that reading makes perfect sense in the context of Proposition 218-an initiative passed for the stated purposes of \" 'limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent' \" (\n   <em>\n    Jacks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 3 Cal.5th at p. 267,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513591\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/859/#p258\">\n    219 Cal.Rptr.3d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513591\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/859/#p258\">\n    397 P.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )-and particularly in the context of article XIII C (entitled \"Voter Approval for Local Tax Levies\"), a provision we have previously described as applicable to \"all local taxes\" (\n   <em>\n    Jacks\n   </em>\n   , at p. 256,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513591\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/859/#p258\">\n    219 Cal.Rptr.3d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513591\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/219/859/#p258\">\n    397 P.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). After all, a local tax law passed by initiative is still a local tax law, just like any law passed by elected officials-a law of the local government, to be enforced by local government, for the purpose of raising revenue for local government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The majority's primary response is that the term \"local government\" is an \"unusually oblique\" way of referring to voters, if that is what article XIII C was meant to do. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 221, 401 P.3d at 58.) The majority also points to article XIII C's definition of \" '[l]ocal government,' \" which includes the catchall phrase \"any other local or regional governmental entity\" ( art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (b)), and to the definition of the term \" '[a]gency' \" in article XIII D, which was also added by Proposition 218 and which incorporates article XIII C's definition of local government (maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 221-223, 401 P.3d at 58-60, citing art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (a)). According to the majority, it is \"improbable\" that Proposition 218 voters would have chosen the words \"local government,\" \"local or regional governmental entity,\" and \"agency\" to refer to the voters acting by initiative. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 222\n   , 401 P.3d at 58-60; see\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 221-223, 401 P.3d at 58-60-.) In the majority's view, these terms are more readily read as \"referring to a locality's governing body, public officials, and bureaucracy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 220, 401 P.3d at 57; see\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 220-223, 401 P.3d at 557-60-.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As I see it, there is nothing improbable about the conclusion that when article XIII C says \"[n]o local government may impose\" taxes without satisfying certain voter approval requirements, it means that all local government taxes must satisfy these requirements. (Art. XIII C, \u00a7 2(b).) The power to tax is a power of government. (See\n   <em>\n    Watchtower B. &amp; T. Soc. v. County of L.A.\n   </em>\n   (1947)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2233599\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/30/426/#p429\">\n    30 Cal.2d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2233635,2233623\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/182/178/\">\n    182 P.2d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 11 [the Legislature may not delegate the power to levy taxes to a private person].) And inasmuch as only government can impose taxes, it should not be surprising that Proposition 218 is directed to government and \"governmental entit[ies].\" ( Art. XIII C, \u00a7 1, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   But equally to the point, Proposition 218's enactors did not leave us guessing about what they meant by the term \"local government\": The term is defined, and the definition includes, as relevant here, \"city.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) It is true, as the majority emphasizes, that the voters are not the city itself. But neither is the city council. (See\n   <em>\n    Pfahler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 150 Cal. at p. 81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20P.%20270\">\n    88 P. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"The common council or other local legislative body and other charter officers do not constitute the 'city,' but are merely agents or officers of the city.\"];\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 85-86,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20P.%20270\">\n    88 P. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [rejecting \"the erroneous assumption ... that the city council is the 'city' \"].) Both bodies are, however, empowered to exercise the legislative authority of the city, and the products of their efforts equally become the city's law. If a tax enacted by the city council is a tax imposed by the city, so too is a tax enacted by the voters on the city's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As should by now be clear, this understanding of article XIII C does not require us to conclude, as the majority suggests, that the term \"local government\" is simply a synonym for \"voters,\" or vice versa. We likely would not, for example, read a provision requiring local government to submit a \"local coastal program for Coastal Commission approval\" as calling for citizen drafting sessions in local polling places. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 220, fn. 11, 401 P.3d at 57-58 fn. 11.) But what this example illustrates is a point about the allocation of power and responsibility within local government, not any fundamental incompatibility in terms. We do not read the coastal program provision in this manner, not because we believe the voter initiative process is categorically outside the bounds of local government, but because we understand that the voter initiative process is not the sum total of local government; many local government functions (including, typically, the drafting of local coastal programs) are discharged by other means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The case before us, by contrast, concerns the government's power to establish taxes-a power that is shared by the people and their elected representatives. (See\n   <em>\n    Rossi v. Brown\n   </em>\n   (1995)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1989429\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/9/688/#p695\">\n    9 Cal.4th 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699-705,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20363\">\n    38 Cal.Rptr.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20P.2d%20557\">\n    889 P.2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Rossi\n   </em>\n   ); maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 219, 401 P.3d at 56.) The question is whether a tax law of a local government-here, the City of Upland-is a tax imposed by the local government, even though it happens to have been enacted by vote of the electorate rather than of the city council. (Art. XIII C, \u00a7 2(b).) To answer that question in the affirmative in no way implies that the terms \"local government,\" \"local or regional governmental entity,\" and \"agency\" are interchangeable with \"voters.\" (See maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   at 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 221-23, 401 P.3d at 58-60.) It simply requires reaffirmation of the settled principle that when the voters act in their legislative capacity through the initiative process, they enact legislation \"by and for\" the governmental entity in question. ( Elec. Code, \u00a7 9200 ; see\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 9217; see also\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 9100, 9125, 9300, 9323.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority also relies on section 3 of article XIII C, which provides that \"the initiative power shall not be prohibited or otherwise limited in matters of reducing or repealing any local tax, assessment, fee or charge,\" and \"[t]he power of initiative to affect local taxes, assessments, fees and charges shall be applicable to all local governments....\" ( Art. XIII C, \u00a7 3 ; see maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 221, 401 P.3d at 58.) But section 3 cuts against, not in favor of, the majority's conclusion. It confirms that Proposition 218's enactors were aware of \"[t]he power of initiative to affect local taxes,\" and, moreover, understood the connection between the initiative power and the conduct of local government. Had the enactors intended to exempt voter initiatives from article XIII C, section 2's restrictions on new or increased local government taxes, it would have been easy enough to say so. That the enactors provided for no such exemption, despite clearly signaling their awareness of \"[t]he power of initiative to affect local taxes,\" is strong evidence that no such exemption exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority attempts to derive support for its voter initiative exemption from various extratextual considerations, but its efforts are unavailing. The majority begins by observing that Proposition 218's ballot materials do not say, in terms, that the voter approval requirements in article XIII C, section 2 were designed to apply to voter initiatives, and at various points indicate that Proposition 218 was concerned with \"politicians\" raising taxes. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 222-224, 401 P.3d at 59-61.) These references are not surprising, given that most local tax increases have, indeed, been initiated by elected officials, and few political campaigns are hampered by inveighing against \"politicians.\" But the ballot materials make clear that the overarching purpose of Proposition 218 was more generally to \"constrain local governments' ability to impose fees, assessments, and taxes.\" (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996) analysis of Prop. 218 by Legis. Analyst, p. 73.) And the arguments in favor of Proposition\n   218 also refer generally to guaranteeing the right to vote on local taxes and fees, with the particulars depending on the type of exaction at issue. (See, e.g., Ballot Pamp., argument in favor of Prop. 218, at p. 76 [\"Proposition 218 guarantees your right to vote on local tax increases\"];\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , rebuttal to argument against Prop. 218, at p. 77 [\"Proposition 218 expands your voting rights. It CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEES your right to vote on taxes.\"].) Nothing in the ballot materials suggests that Proposition 218's enactors intended to create an exemption for the subset of local taxes that are enacted by voter initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As the majority acknowledges, despite the broad statements in the ballot materials concerning the right to vote on taxes, article XIII C does more than simply secure the right to vote on taxes (a right voters generally have, with or without article XIII C, when a tax is proposed by initiative petition). Article XIII C secures the right to vote in a particular manner, and defines the applicable margin of victory. In particular, article XIII C, section\n   2(b) secures the right to vote on local general taxes at a general, rather than special, election, and section 2(d) provides that the imposition of local special taxes requires a two-thirds supermajority, rather than a simple majority. Article XIII C thus secures for the voters a set of rights concerning local taxes that they might not otherwise have under the usual rules governing passage of voter initiatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority suggests in passing that the specific aim of article XIII C, section 2(b)'s general election requirement may be one specific to taxes proposed by elected officials: that is, to ensure that politicians are required to face the voters on the same ballot as the taxes they have proposed. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rprt.3d at 223, fn. 14, 401 P.3d at 60 fn. 14.) Perhaps. Or perhaps the aim is to ensure that general taxes are \"voted on in general elections with their traditionally larger\n   turnouts, not done in a corner in the middle of January in an odd-numbered year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Jeffrey v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2002)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1151130\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/102/1/#p8\">\n    102 Cal.App.4th 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20175\">\n    125 Cal.Rptr.2d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"The obvious import of Government Code section 36502 is that a local term-limits initiative should not be sneaked through the electorate by scheduling it in a special municipal election where the turnout percentage is unlikely to reach double digits.\"].) Certainly the proponents of the initiative here appear to regard the requirement as a meaningful constraint on their ability to enact the proposed legislation; otherwise the case would not be before us. We cannot, in any event, simply dismiss article XIII C, section 2(b)'s general election requirement as beside the point in the context of local taxes enacted by voter initiative (and I do not understand the majority to seriously contend otherwise).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The critical language we are construing here, moreover, appears in essentially identical form in article XIII C, section 2(d), which requires that special taxes be approved by a two-thirds vote of the electorate. That provision, in language that closely parallels that of section 2(b), provides that \"[n]o local government may impose, extend, or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a two-thirds vote.\" ( Art. XIII C, \u00a7 2(d).) If a local tax enacted by voter initiative is not a tax \"impose[d]\" by \"local government,\" as the majority insists, then from here on out, special taxes can be enacted by a simple majority of the electorate, as long as proponents can muster the necessary quantum\n   of support to require consideration of the measure. (See Elec. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 9122, 9217, 9320 [a proposed initiative measure is enacted if approved by a majority of the voters]; see also, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20175\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 9116, 9118, 9214, 9215, 9310, 9311 [ballot thresholds for counties, general law cities, and districts]; S.F. Charter, \u00a7 14.101 [ballot thresholds for one charter city].) It is unlikely that Proposition 218's enactors, who deliberately chose a supermajority requirement for the imposition of special taxes, intended such a result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, even if any doubts might remain after considering article XIII C's text, purposes, and history, those doubts ought to be resolved in favor of applying article XIII C's requirements to the enactment of new city taxes by\n   voter initiative. Proposition 218 instructs that its provisions must \"be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.\" (Prop. 218, \u00a7 5, reprinted\n   at Historical Notes, 2B West's Ann.

As to the second argument, the court noted that the supermajority voting requirement was addressed expressly and exclusively to the Legislature, and, if applied to initiatives, would expressly conflict with\n   another constitutional provision providing for a majority vote.

Moreover, with respect to both arguments, the court stated: \"For the voters to have limited their power in the manner that plaintiff suggests would ... have made no sense,\" because \"it would still be possible for a simple majority of voters to raise taxes by amending section 3.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 250,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20325\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=806%20P.2d%201360\">\n    806 P.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Here, again, article XIII C, section 2 (b) is not explicitly aimed at governing bodies and is not plausibly understood to eliminate the power of the voters to impose, extend, or increase local general taxes by initiative.

Ultimately, the majority tells us, the rule is for the voters' own good: to prevent voters from too readily \"tying themselves to the proverbial mast as Ulysses did\" to resist the siren song of power. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 230, 401 P.3d at 65-66; see\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 214, 401 P.3d at 53.) And so in the name of cutting the voters loose from their self-imposed restraints, the majority thwarts the evident intent of the voters who passed Proposition 218 for the sake of governing all local taxes, not just some.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The final part of the majority opinion does make one point with which I agree. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 229, 401 P.3d at 65.) This case arose because plaintiffs submitted a valid initiative petition containing signatures of at least 15 percent of the voters of the City of Upland, which obligated the city council either to adopt plaintiffs' proposed medical marijuana ordinance outright or to submit it to the voters at a special election. ( Elec. Code, \u00a7 9214.) The city council did neither; it instead unilaterally determined that the annual licensing and inspection\n   fee included in the proposed ordinance, if enacted, would be a new general tax, such that the measure had to be voted on at a general, not special, election. This was not the city council's determination to make, and plaintiffs were entitled to a writ of mandate compelling the city council to order a special\n   election for the purpose of considering the proposed initiative measure.

Article XIII C is a constitutional restriction on the taxation power of local government, and, by its terms, it applies to the imposition of all local government taxes. Whether a local government tax has been enacted by voter initiative or by vote of the city council is not article XIII C's concern.

Nor can we ignore the distinction between the electorate and the governmental entities identified in article XIII C, section 1, subdivision (b).

The opinion rightly focuses on the purpose of article XIII C. (E.g., conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 231, 233, 401 P.3d at 66, 68 [highlighting the \"stated purposes\" of Prop. 218], 10 [emphasizing the provision's \"overarching purpose\"].) But it identifies no evidence or other reason to conclude that the provision encompasses the imposition of taxes by the electorate via initiative.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The City identifies another purpose of requiring that general taxes only be considered during regularly scheduled general elections. It contends that this requirement forces politicians to face the voters at the same time as any tax proposal he or she may have supported or to answer questions about the politicians' stance on tax measures. But such a purpose makes limited sense in the context of taxes imposed by voter initiatives.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The concurring and dissenting opinion posits that the ballot materials' repeated reference to \"politicians,\" and silence regarding voter initiatives, simply reflects that \"most local tax increases have, indeed, been initiated by elected officials.\" (Conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 235, 401 P.3d at 70.) That is certainly one possibility. Another more plausible one is that the silence with regard to initiatives reflects that the drafters either were not concerned with initiatives proposing taxes-perhaps because such was a rare or unheard of occurrence or because such would constitute an expression of direct democracy-or they simply did not have that issue in mind.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Indeed, a critical aspect of our analysis involves understanding what \"impose\" means in the context of article XIII C. The concurring and dissenting opinion conveniently assumes its conclusions about this term by concluding in effect that only local governments can impose taxes because, administratively, only local governments can collect and spend them. (E.g., conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 231, 401 P.3d at 66 [\"A tax passed by voter initiative, no less than a tax passed by vote of the city council, is a tax of the local government, to be collected by the local government, to raise revenue for the local government\"], 4 [\"A local government tax is a local government tax, no matter how it may have been legislated into being\"].) Here, \"impose\" most plausibly means to establish or enact, and article XIII C, section 2 applies only if it is the local government doing so. The concurring and dissenting opinion emphasizes that when the electorate exercises its initiative power, it is acting in a legislative capacity. (E.g., conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 6768, 401 P.3d at 232-233.) No doubt. But that is not sufficient to establish that the electorate is indistinguishable from representative politicians for the purposes of triggering article XIII C, section 2, particularly when that provision gives no indication whatsoever that it was designed to interfere with the exercise of the initiative power.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Although the City does not cite the provision, we note that article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (c) provides, \"Any general tax imposed, extended, or increased, without voter approval, by any local government on or after January 1, 1995, and prior to the effective date of this article, shall continue to be imposed only if approved by a majority vote of the voters voting in an election on the issue of the imposition....\" But this language does not alter our conclusion since, here, the tax would only have been imposed if a majority of the voters had voted for it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The concurring and dissenting opinion indicates it has \"no quarrel with this general principle\" (conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 237-238, 401 P.3d at 72-73), but its analysis does not sufficiently grapple with the necessary implications of that presumption. Our cases underscore courts' obligation to \" 'jealously guard' \" (\n    <em>\n     Associated Home Builders\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n     ,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    18 Cal.3d at p. 591,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2041\">\n     135 Cal.Rptr. 41\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20P.2d%20473\">\n     557 P.2d 473\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ) and \"liberally construe\" (\n    <em>\n     Perry v.

While the concurring and dissenting opinion acknowledges our precedent in passing (conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 237238, 401 P.3d at 72-73), it nonetheless begins its analysis looking for evidence that article XIII C, section 2-which makes no reference to initiatives-evinces an intent to exempt initiatives from its provisions (conc. &amp; dis. opn.,\n    <em>\n     post\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 230, 401 P.3d at 66). This approach relegates our previous conclusions regarding the initiative power to the status of an afterthought, likely to hold little relevance in this case or perhaps any case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Elections Code provides initiative procedures for general law cities, counties, and districts.

Like the majority, I set to one side this method of enactment, which is not at issue in this case (see maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 229-230, 401 P.3d at 65), and instead focus on ordinances proposed by initiative petition and submitted to the voters for approval.

This response simply ignores the first preposition (\"by\"). If what the majority means to suggest is that some ordinances enacted under that article of the Elections Code are enacted \"by\" a city, while others may be enacted \"for\" a city by some group of third party actors, it suffices to observe that no such distinction appears on the face of the statute, and long-held understandings of the nature of the initiative power are to the contrary. (See\n    <em>\n     Pfahler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 150 Cal. at p. 81,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20P.%20270\">\n     88 P. 270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The majority suggests that construing article XIII C, section 2(b) to apply to initiative measures \"would work an implied repeal of [Elections Code] section 9214, something against which we have a strong presumption.\" (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d at 227, 401 P.3d at 63.) That is, according to the majority, section 2(b)'s requirement of a\n    <em>\n     general\n    </em>\n    election for a local general tax would effectively override a city council's statutory duty to call a\n    <em>\n     special\n    </em>\n    election for certain ordinances proposed by initiative petition. But the way to harmonize these provisions is to recognize that, while Elections Code section 9214 sets out the general requirements for local initiatives, the more specific requirement of article XIII C, section 2(b) applies when an initiative measure-or a provision thereof, if severable-concerns general taxes. As a technical matter, a city council can fulfill its duty to call a special election under section 9214 even if the measure voted on at the special election cannot go into effect because it imposes, extends, or increases a general tax, and must be approved by the voters at a general election under section 2(b). But to the extent there is any conflict, section 2(b) must control, since article XIII C applies \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of th [e] Constitution\" (art. XIII C, \u00a7 2 ), including the provision allowing the Legislature to prescribe procedures for local initiatives (Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 11, subd. (a)).

Sections 2(b) and 2 (d) are, in all pertinent respects, indistinguishable. They are written in almost identical language, each providing that \"[n]o local government may impose, extend, or increase\" a particular kind of tax \"unless and until that tax\" is approved in a particular manner.
