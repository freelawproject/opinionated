Real parties in interest are insurers that issued excess comprehensive general liability (CGL) policies to Montrose in relevant years. The present dispute concerns the sequence in which Montrose may access its excess CGL policies to cover its liability for environmental injuries caused by DDT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Through a motion for summary adjudication, Montrose sought a declaratory judgment that it may \"electively stack\" excess policies-i.e., that it may access any excess policy issued in any policy year so long as the lower-lying policies for the\n   <em>\n    same policy year\n   </em>\n   have been exhausted. All of the excess insurers opposed Montrose's motion for summary adjudication; many of the excess insurers also sought through a cross-motion for summary adjudication a ruling that no insurer had a duty to pay a covered claim until Montrose had \"horizontally exhausted\" its lower-lying excess policies in all triggered policy years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court rejected \"elective stacking\" in favor of \"horizontal exhaustion,\" ordering that higher-level excess policies could not be accessed until lower-level policies had been exhausted for all policy years. It thus denied Montrose's motion for summary adjudication and granted the excess insurers' cross-motion for summary adjudication. Montrose then filed the present petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court's summary adjudication order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We agree with the trial court that \"elective stacking\" is inconsistent with the policy language of at least some of the\n   more than 115 excess policies at issue and is not compelled by California Supreme Court authority. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly denied Montrose's motion for summary adjudication. Our holding is not as expansive as the trial court's, however. Specifically, we do not hold that policies must be horizontally exhausted at\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   coverage level and for\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   year before higher-level policies may be accessed. Instead, we conclude that the sequence in which policies may be accessed must be decided on a policy-by-policy basis, taking into account the relevant provisions of each policy. We therefore reverse in part the trial court's grant of the insurers' motion for summary adjudication.\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   From 1947 to 1982, Montrose manufactured DDT at a facility in Torrance, California. During the 1960's, conservationists began to raise concerns about the effects of DDT on the environment, and in 1972 the federal government prohibited its use within the United States. Montrose continued to manufacture DDT for export at its Torrance facility until 1982. (\n   <em>\n    Montrose Chemical Corp. v.

Above the \"primary\" insurance policies were multiple layers of \"excess\" CGL coverage, which provided additional coverage once underlying insurance was exhausted. In the early years, Montrose purchased just a few layers of excess coverage; in some later years, Montrose appears to have purchased more than 40 layers of excess coverage, with aggregate limits of\n   liability in excess of $120 million. Montrose asserts that because the policies provide for different amounts of coverage in different years, the layers of excess coverage are not uniform. To provide just a single example, in some policy years the first layer excess policies provided coverage of up to $1 million; in other years, the first layer excess policies provided coverage\n   of up to $2 million, $5 million, or $10 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In August 1990, Montrose filed the present action,\n   <em>\n    Montrose Chemical Corporation of California v.

Montrose's Motion for Summary Adjudication\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Montrose moved for summary adjudication of the 32nd cause of action. Montrose asserted that a controversy had arisen between it and its excess insurers about the manner in which it could obtain indemnification under the excess policies. According to Montrose, the excess insurers had taken the position that Montrose could not access coverage under any excess policy until its liabilities exhausted\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the lower-lying excess coverage in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   policy period. Montrose depicted the insurers' approach as follows, assuming a hypothetical coverage portfolio and $100 million of liability resulting from continuous property damage over five years. In this example, Montrose must exhaust its first and second layer excess policies (each layer representing $10 million of coverage) in each policy year before accessing any of its third layer excess policies:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-50\">Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 $50 mil Layer 5 $40 mil Layer 4 $30 mil Layer 3 $20 mil Layer 2 $10 mil Layer 1</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Montrose rejected the insurers' horizontal exhaustion approach, asserting that it instead was entitled under the language of the excess policies and the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   to \"electively stack\" its coverage-i.e., to \"select any policy to indemnify its liabilities, provided the policies immediately underlying that policy are exhausted\" in the same policy period. Montrose provided the following example of how elective stacking might work, using the same hypothetical losses and coverage portfolio depicted above. In this example, Montrose accesses coverage from the first through third excess insurance layers for policy years two and three, and the first through fourth excess insurance layers for policy year four, without accessing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   excess coverage for policy years one and five:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-52\">Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 $50 mil Layer 5 $40 mil Layer 4 $30 mil Layer 3 $20 mil Layer 2 $10 mil Layer 1</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    B. Insurers' Oppositions and Cross-Motion for Summary Adjudication\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A group of excess insurers (hereinafter, the Continental insurers)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed an opposition\n   to Montrose's motion for summary adjudication, and separately filed their own cross-motion for summary adjudication. That motion sought summary adjudication on two grounds: (1) the 32nd cause of action (by which the Continental insurers sought a determination that Montrose was not entitled as a matter of law to electively stack its excess policies), and (2) the following \"issue of duty\": \"All underlying policy limits across the years of continuing property damage must be exhausted by payment of covered claims before any of the Insurers' excess policies ha[s] a duty to pay covered claims.\" The Continental insurers contended that well-established California law and the language of the relevant policies required Montrose to \"exhaust\n   coverage from\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   underlying insurers in each of the triggered policy periods, such that higher-level excess insurers' obligations are triggered only when all primary and lower-level excess policies have been exhausted.\" (Italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Travelers Indemnity and Travelers Surety (formerly known as Aetna) (the Travelers insurers) opposed Montrose's motion for summary adjudication, but did not separately move for summary adjudication. The Travelers insurers urged that California law did not apply to their policies, and that under the clear language of the policies, Montrose had to demonstrate that the underlying insurers \"\n   <em>\n    have paid or been held to pay\n   </em>\n   the full amount of their respective limits of liability\"-not merely that Montrose's liabilities \"\n   <em>\n    are sufficient to exhaust\n   </em>\n   the underlying policy(ies) in the same policy period.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Travelers insurers, Montrose's assertion that its primary policies should be \"deemed\" exhausted was \"misleading because the parties have not stipulated-and the Court has not found or ordered-that Montrose's primary policies be 'deem[ed]'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   exhausted. Montrose, of course, will have the burden of proving that, in fact, its underlying insurance (including with respect to primary coverage) has been exhausted before it can seek coverage under its excess policies. That factual issue is not before the Court, and may not be decided in the guise of Montrose's Motion currently before the Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    Order Denying Montrose's Motion and Granting Continental Insurers' Cross-Motion for Summary Adjudication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The superior court denied Montrose's motion and granted the Continental insurers' cross-motion. The court began by describing the issues raised by the competing motions for summary adjudication:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"[I]t's the insurers' contention that Montrose cannot access coverage under any of the excess policies until Montrose exhausts all the underlying excess coverage in each policy period. This approach is generally referred to as a 'horizontal exhaustion.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"In contrast, Montrose argues that it should instead be entitled to vertically stack all excess coverage triggered [in] each individual policy period, in effect allowing Montrose to select any available excess policy to indemnify its liabilities assuming that the policies immediately underlying that policy are exhausted for this specific policy in question. The approach is referred to as a 'vertical exhaustion.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court then discussed the law generally applicable to primary and excess insurance:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"Before coverage can attach under an excess policy, the policy limits of the underlying primary policy or policies must typically be exhausted. [Citation.] [\u00b6] Normally, primary coverage is exhausted when a primary insurer pays its policy limits to settle a claim or to satisfy a judgment against the insurer. [Citation.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Under California law, vertical exhaustion applies where an excess policy expressly provides coverage in excess of a specific primary policy for that same policy period. In such a scenario, excess coverage will attach after the specifically identified primary insurance has been exhausted, notwithstanding the existence of other underlying policies.

[\u00b6] ... and limit the underlying insurance policies [that must be exhausted], the horizontal exhaustion doctrine should apply.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The court then turned to the facts of the case before it:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"In the present case, Montrose argues that pursuant to the California Supreme Court holding in [\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   ], Montrose should be entitled to\n   access its excess coverage under an elective stacking approach whereby a policyholder may select any\n   triggered policy in its portfolio to indemnify its liabilities, provided that the policies underlying that policy are exhausted in accordance with their terms. [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"Ultimately, Montrose fails to cite any binding authority which persuades this court that the court should not follow the well-established rule that horizontal exhaustion should apply in the absence of policy language specifically describing and limiting the underlying insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \"Montrose additionally asserts that the language in [the] excess policies at issue here is inconsistent with application of the horizontal exhaustion doctrine.

While this may be true, this argument overlooks the fact that the present case is a continuous loss scenario; thus, Montrose's contention that exhaustion should be applied vertically with respect to each individual policy period is undermined by the very authority supporting its own stacking arguments as noted by the California Supreme Court decision in [\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,]\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3931726\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/55/186/\">\n    55 Cal.4th 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=145%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%201\">\n    145 Cal.Rptr.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=281%20P.3d%201000\">\n    281 P.3d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], which decision allows the insured to stack the policy limits of those policies triggered in more than one policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"Therefore, the stacking approach endorsed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   would direct ... that the aggregate value of all underlying policies throughout the duration of a continuous loss must be exhausted before excess coverage is accessible to the insured....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The court concluded: \"The 'other insurance' provisions contained in the present excess policies must be read to require the exhaustion of all underlying insurance before [the excess insurers'] obligations to indemnify Montrose attach. The presence of 'other insurance' clauses would preclude the use of a vertical exhaustion approach even for those excess policies specifically identified in a particular underlying policy that must first be exhausted.

We summarily denied the petition. Montrose filed a petition for review. The Supreme Court granted review and transferred the matter to this court with directions to issue an order to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We issued an order to show cause and received supplemental briefing. The Continental insurers and the Travelers insurers\n   filed briefs in opposition to the petition, and ITT LLC and Santa Fe Braun, Inc. filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Montrose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY OF ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Montrose urges the court to adopt what it terms an \"elective stacking\" approach. Under this approach, where a policyholder is liable for a continuing injury that potentially is covered by primary and excess policies in multiple policy years, the policyholder \"may elect to proceed 'vertically' to exhaust policies for a single coverage year, once the underlying policy exhaustion provisions are satisfied.\" Montrose urges that \"elective stacking\" is consistent with Supreme Court precedent \"recognizing that policyholders are entitled to look to any independent contract to cover the full extent of their liability (up to policy limits) in accordance with the terms of each individual policy,\" as well as with the language of the relevant excess policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Continental insurers urge a \"horizontal exhaustion\" approach. They contend that the excess policies at issue contain provisions \"that make them excess to vertically underlying policies in the same policy period\n   <em>\n    plus\n   </em>\n   'other valid and collectible' insurance, that is, other insurance that is not vertically underlying and also triggered by the same occurrence.\" The Travelers insurers separately urge declaratory relief is premature because Montrose has not demonstrated that it has exhausted its underlying primary policies, and there\n   is no basis for issuing a writ of mandate because Montrose has failed to demonstrate that it lacks an adequate remedy at law or is at risk of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As we now discuss, we reject Montrose's \"elective stacking\" approach. Specifically, we conclude that Montrose is not entitled to a declaration that it may access\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the more than 115 excess policies at issue so long as its liabilities are sufficient to exhaust the underlying policies for the same policy year. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly denied Montrose's motion for summary adjudication and granted the insurers' cross-motion for summary adjudication of the 32nd cause of action because we conclude that Montrose is not entitled to the declaration sought in that cause of action\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   However, we do not adopt the trial court's conclusion that all excess policies must be horizontally exhausted. Instead, because there is tremendous variation among the policies at issue, we decline to adopt a single exhaustion scheme that applies to Montrose's entire coverage portfolio, and instead direct that each policy be interpreted according to its terms. We therefore conclude that the trial court erred in granting the Continental insurers' motion for summary adjudication insofar as it sought to summarily adjudicate the issue of duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \"A motion for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.\" ( Code Civ.

Before the court in\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   was the question of whether the insured could access policies in effect during multiple triggered policy periods, as the insured contended, or whether it could access only those policies that covered a single policy period, as urged by the insurers.

As\n   <em>\n    Continental\n   </em>\n   directs, we turn to the language of the relevant policies to decide that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Language of the Excess Insurance Policies Does Not Mandate \"Elective Stacking\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Policies' \"Plain Language\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Montrose acknowledges that the starting point of policy interpretation is \"the 'plain language' of the written provisions of the insurance contract,\" and it asserts that each of the excess policies at issue contains \"express language\" stating \"that coverage thereunder attaches upon the exhaustion of a specified amount of underlying insurance issued\n   <em>\n    in the same policy year\n   </em>\n   .\" (Italics added.) The latter assertion is the linchpin of Montrose's plain language analysis: If Montrose is correct that the policies provide for coverage as soon as lower-layer policies\n   <em>\n    within the same policy period\n   </em>\n   are exhausted, then elective stacking necessarily follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The problem with Montrose's analysis is that it is largely unsubstantiated by the policy language. That is, while Montrose repeatedly asserts that the excess policies attach upon the exhaustion of lower layer policies within the same policy period, it does not identify the provisions that supposedly have that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Our analysis of the policies, moreover, leads us to conclude that many of the policies attach not upon exhaustion of lower-layer policies within the same policy period, but rather upon exhaustion of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   available insurance. A few examples will illustrate the point:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    American Centennial Policies Nos. XC-00-03-64, XC-00-06-75, and XC-00-12-16.\n   </em>\n   The insuring agreements of these policies state that the insurer \"agrees to pay on behalf of the insured the ultimate net loss in excess of the\n   retained limit\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   hereinafter stated.\" The declarations then identify the underlying policies to which the American Centennial policies are specifically in excess (the \"scheduled policies\"); for example, for policy year 1980 to 1981, the American Centennial policy references a Canadian Universal CGL policy, written for policy period March 1980 through March 1981, with a combined single limit of $1,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Focusing on only the insuring agreements and declarations, Montrose would have us conclude that the American Centennial policies attach upon the exhaustion of the scheduled policies-in the example provided above, when Montrose's liabilities exceed $1,000,000, thus exhausting the limits of the Canadian Universal policy. But that interpretation ignores other relevant policy provisions, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    The \"retained limit\" clause\n   </em>\n   : This clause provides: \" '[T]he company's liability shall be only for the ultimate net loss in excess of the insured's retained limit defined as the greater of: [\u00b6] ... the total of the applicable limits of the underlying policies listed in [the declarations] hereof,\n   <em>\n    and the applicable limits of any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured.'\n   </em>\n   \" (Italics added.)

The indemnification provisions of these policies require the insurers \" '[t]o indemnify the insured for the amount of loss which is in excess of the applicable limits of liability of the underlying insurance [identified in the schedule of primary and umbrella\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   coverage].\" The\n   schedules of primary and umbrella coverage identify the underlying policies to which the Continental and Columbia policies are specifically in excess; for example, policy no.

But that analysis ignores the other relevant policy provisions, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    Definition of \"loss\":\n   </em>\n   Continental's and Columbia's policies define \"loss\" (as used in the indemnification provisions) as \" 'the sums paid as damages in settlement of a claim or in satisfaction of a judgment for which the insured is legally liable, after making deductions for all recoveries, salvages\n   <em>\n    and other insurances\n   </em>\n   (whether recoverable or not) other than the underlying insurance and excess insurance purchased specifically to be in excess of this policy.' \" (Italics added.) These policies thus define loss\n   <em>\n    in terms of\n   </em>\n   other insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    \"Other insurance\" clauses\n   </em>\n   : The \"other insurance\" clauses state: \" 'If, with respect to a loss covered hereunder, the insured has other insurance, whether on a primary, excess or contingent basis, there shall be no insurance afforded hereunder as respects such loss; provided, that if the applicable limit of liability of this policy is greater than the applicable limit of liability provided by the other insurance, this policy shall afford excess insurance over and above such other insurance in an amount sufficient to give the insured, as respects\n   the layer of coverage afforded by this policy, a total limit of liability equal to the applicable limit of liability afforded by this policy.' \" This provision \" 'does not apply with respect to the underlying insurance or excess insurance purchased specifically to be in excess of this policy.' \" It thus expressly states that the Continental and Columbia policies shall not cover losses for which the insured has other insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   We caution that the foregoing discussion addresses just a few of the excess policies at issue, and thus nothing we have said should be understood to apply to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the excess policies before us. To the contrary, there is tremendous variation among the relevant policies, and each must be interpreted according to its own language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   There may well be some policies that, as Montrose argues, are triggered by the exhaustion of only the underlying\n   scheduled insurance for the same policy year. To demonstrate that it is entitled to elective stacking as to its entire policy portfolio, however, Montrose must show that\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   policy is susceptible of being read in this fashion.

Scottsdale disagreed, urging that its insurance was excess to all other primary insurance available to the developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   To resolve the issue, the court reviewed the language of the Scottsdale excess policy. The court noted that there was \"no dispute\" that Scottsdale's $5 million coverage was purchased as excess to the $1 million primary policy issued by State Farm. However, \"the express provisions of the [excess] policy further provide that Scottsdale's liability was also excess to 'the applicable limits of\n   <em>\n    any other underlying insurance\n   </em>\n   collectible by the [insured parties].'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   (Italics added.) This express description as to the scope of Scottsdale's excess coverage is entirely consistent with, and is reinforced by, other policy\n   language dealing with Scottsdale's duty to defend and the impact of 'other insurance.'

While Montrose is correct that the underlying layer of insurance in\n   <em>\n    Community Redevelopment\n   </em>\n   was a primary layer, rather than a lower-lying excess layer, Montrose suggests no reason why we should differently interpret\n   <em>\n    first-layer\n   </em>\n   excess policies (that is, excess policies immediately above primary policies) and\n   <em>\n    higher-level\n   </em>\n   excess policies (excess policies immediately above other excess policies). Montrose also suggests that\n   <em>\n    Community Redevelopment\n   </em>\n   is not relevant because it \"had nothing to do with a policyholder's right to\n   <em>\n    indemnity\n   </em>\n   coverage,\" but rather addressed the duty to defend. In fact, although the specific question before the court in\n   <em>\n    Community Redevelopment\n   </em>\n   was whether the excess insurer had an obligation \"to 'drop down' and provide a defense,\" the answer to that question depended on whether the excess insurer's exposure for either defense\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   indemnity was excess to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   other\n   lower-lying policies, or to only the lower-lying policy to which the excess policy specifically referred-the very issue before us in this case.

We do not agree that our holding in this case has the effect of \"obligating\" any policyholder to seek indemnification under any particular policy.\n   <em>\n    All\n   </em>\n   we hold today is that insureds must exhaust lower layers of coverage before accessing higher layers of coverage\n   <em>\n    if the language of the excess policies so requires\n   </em>\n   -a result hardly inconsistent with sound public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Montrose next argues that mandatory horizontal exhaustion penalizes policyholders for their \"prudent decision\" to purchase additional coverage. Not so. Horizontal\n   exhaustion dictates only the\n   <em>\n    sequence\n   </em>\n   in which policies are accessed, not the total coverage available to the insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is nothing unfair about requiring an insured to access policies in the manner their provisions dictate.

We do\n   not doubt that allocating more than $200 million in liability across more than 100 policies covering nearly 25 years is likely to be a complicated process. That complexity, however, is not relevant to our analysis, as we cannot, in the service of expediency, impose obligations that are inconsistent with the terms of the contracts Montrose itself negotiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    D. Conclusion: The Trial Court Properly Denied Montrose's Motion for Summary Adjudication of the 32nd Cause of Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Having concluded that the trial court properly rejected Montrose's \"elective stacking\" approach, we now consider the effect of this conclusion on Montrose's motion for summary adjudication of the 32nd cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   To reiterate, the 32nd cause of action sought a declaration that \"a. In order to seek indemnification under the Defendant Insurers' excess policies, Montrose need only establish that its liabilities are sufficient to exhaust the underlying policy(ies) in the\n   <em>\n    same policy period\n   </em>\n   , and is not required to establish that all policies insuring Montrose in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   policy period (including policies issued to cover different time periods both before and after the policy period insured by the targeted policy) with limits of liability less than the attachment point of the targeted policy, have been exhausted; and [\u00b6] b. Montrose may select the manner in which [to] allocate its liabilities across the policy(ies) covering such losses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   To be entitled to summary adjudication of the 32nd cause of action, Montrose must demonstrate that the judicial declaration it sought applies not just to\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the excess policies, but to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of them. For the reasons discussed, while such a declaration may be appropriate with respect to some of the policies-an issue we do not reach-such broad relief manifestly could not apply to all of them. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying Montrose's motion for summary adjudication of the 32nd cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Having concluded that the trial court properly denied Montrose's motion for summary adjudication of the 32nd cause of\n   action, we readily conclude that the court properly granted the insurer's cross-motion for summary adjudication of that cause of action. Montrose's and the Continental insurers'\n   competing motions for summary adjudication of the 32nd cause of action were mirror images of one another. Because Montrose was not entitled to the declaratory relief it sought\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law,\n   </em>\n   summary adjudication of the 32nd cause of action in favor of the Continental insurers was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    The Present Record Does Not Support a Universal \"Horizontal Exhaustion\" Approach; Thus, the Trial Court Erred in Granting the Insurers' Motion on the Issue of Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   We now reach the final issue raised in this writ proceeding: whether the Continental insurers were entitled to summary adjudication on the issue of duty. To repeat, the Continental insurers sought a declaration that: \"All underlying policy limits across the years of continuing damage must be exhausted by payment of covered claims before any of the Insurers' excess policies ha[s] a duty to pay covered claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   As we have said, California law requires that insurance contracts be interpreted according to their terms, and there is tremendous variation among the terms of the excess policies at issue in this matter. Further, although the parties have stipulated as to some of the language of the relevant policies, they did not provide the trial court, and have not provided this court, with all of the policy language or with copies of the policies themselves.
