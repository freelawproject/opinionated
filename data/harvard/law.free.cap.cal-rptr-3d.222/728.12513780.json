They brought these coordinated class actions alleging they were improperly denied pay for time they spent under their employer's control before and after their work shifts. Ruling that plaintiffs' entitlement to overtime pay is controlled by federal, rather than California, law, the trial court entered judgment for defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We shall reverse the judgment in part as to the subclass of unrepresented employees and affirm as to the subclass of represented employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged they were not paid for all the time they spent at the correctional institutions under defendants' control. Specifically, they were expected to sign in and sign out on time sheets that reflected only their officially assigned work day. Plaintiffs were required to be at their assigned posts at the beginning of their official shifts. However, the sign-in and sign-out locations were often significantly removed from plaintiffs' actual work posts, and they were not compensated for the time it took to travel from those locations to their work posts after signing in or to return to those locations to sign out at the end of a shift. Second, plaintiffs alleged that they were required to spend time before checking in and after checking out on such activities as being briefed before a shift, briefing relief staff at work posts after a shift, checking out and checking in mandated safety equipment, putting on and removing mandated safety equipment, waiting in lines, submitting to searches at security checkpoints, and taking inventories of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment. Plaintiffs were either not allowed to or were discouraged from adjusting their time logs to reflect these additional tasks. Plaintiffs alleged causes of action for failure to pay\n   contractual overtime ( Lab. Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 222, 223 ) (first cause of action), failure to pay the California minimum wage (\u00a7\u00a7 1182.11, 1182.12, 1194; 8 Cal. Code Regs. \u00a7 11000 et seq. ) (second cause of action), failure to keep accurate records of hours worked (\u00a7 1174) (third cause of action), and failure to pay overtime in breach of common law contractual obligations (fourth cause of action). They sought unpaid overtime wages, unpaid California minimum wages, liquidated damages, and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Stoetzl\n   </em>\n   action, the trial court certified a class of \"[a]ll persons who are or who have been employed as Correctional Officers, Correctional Sergeants, Correctional Lieutenants, Medical Technical Assistants, Senior Medical Technical Assistants, Correctional Counselors I, Correctional Counselors II, Youth Correctional Officers, and/or Youth Correctional Counselors to work at adult and/or youth correctional institutions within the [CDCR] in the period commencing April 9, 2005 until the notice of pendency of this class action is given.\" The\n   <em>\n    Stoetzl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kuhn\n   </em>\n   actions were later coordinated.

The court granted class certification in the\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kuhn\n   </em>\n   actions and, by stipulation, certified two subclasses for the three coordinated cases, one of unrepresented supervisory employees (consisting of Senior Medical Technical Assistants, some subclassifications of Correctional Officer II's, Correctional Sergeants, and\n   Correctional Lieutenants) and one of represented employees (consisting of the remaining job classifications).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court granted the motion without leave to amend as to the causes of action for failure to pay overtime in violation of sections 222 and 223 and failure to keep accurate records of hours worked, and denied the motion as to the remaining causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Represented Employees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The California Correctional Peace Officers' Association (CCPOA) is the exclusive collective bargaining representative for members of the subclass of represented employees. Labor relations between CCPOA and the State are governed by the Ralph C. Dills Act ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 3512 et seq. ) (the Dills Act), which provides for collective bargaining over wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. The Department of Human Resources (CalHR, formerly known as the Department of Personnel Administration or DPA) represents the Governor of California as the state employer for purposes of collective bargaining with the CCPOA. The Dills Act allows parties to agree to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to supersede certain provisions of law. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 3517.61.) After the parties reach an agreement, they submit a joint MOU to the Legislature, when appropriate, for approval. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 3517.5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The FLSA establishes overtime pay requirements for hours worked in excess of 40 per week. (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).) An exemption from this requirement exists for peace officers: An employer may establish a regular work period of up to 171 hours in a 28-day period, and must pay overtime only after the employee works more than 171 hours in the work period. This is known as the \"7k Exemption.\" (See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20553.201\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 553.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553.230.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The State, through CalHR, and CCPOA have negotiated multiple MOU's since 1982 on behalf of the represented plaintiffs' collective bargaining unit, State Bargaining Unit 6. Before 1998, the MOU's generally provided for a 40-hour workweek. The MOU in effect from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 1999 contained a section entitled \"7k Exemption,\" which began, \"CCPOA and the State agree that the employees listed below are working under the provisions of Section 207k of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the parties\n   acknowledge that the employer is declaring a specific exemption for these employees under the provisions specified herein.\" It provided for a \"7k schedule\" of 168 hours in a 28-day work period for certain job classifications and defined \"overtime\" as hours\n   worked in excess of 168 hours. For Correctional Officers, Medical Technical Assistants, Youth Correctional Officers, and Youth Correctional Counselors, the 168 compensated hours consisted of 160 hours of regular posted duty, four hours for pre- and post-work activities, and four hours for training. Section 11.12 of the 1998-1999 MOU stated that \"CCPOA agrees that generally this is sufficient time for all pre and post work activities during each work period, and that the compensation allotted for these activities under this provision is full compensation for all of these activities,\" that \"[t]he State and CCPOA agree that they have made a good faith attempt to comply with all requirements of the FLSA in negotiating this provision. If any court of competent jurisdiction declares that any provision or application of this Agreement is not in conformance with the FLSA, the parties agree to Meet and Confer immediately ... ,\" and that \"CCPOA agrees that neither it nor any of its employees acting on their own behalf or in conjunction with other law firms shall bring any suit in court challenging the validity of this provision under the FLSA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The State's chief negotiator for the 1998-1999 MOU, David Gilb, testified that the 7k schedule was designed to address the question of whether employees' work started when they picked up their equipment or when they reported to their posts. During negotiations, he defined pre- and post-work activities as work that began when employees picked up their tools in the central control area. The work could include walking from the control area to the post and participating in a brief pre-shift meeting. The State took the position that under the FLSA, it was not obligated to compensate employees for time they spent between entering the institution and picking up their equipment or the time after the equipment was returned, and CCPOA's negotiators understood this was the State's position. During the course of the negotiations, there was no discussion of whether the State would have to comply with California wage and hour laws. A member of the CCPOA's negotiating team, David Lewis, testified that he did not believe California law applied to the 7k schedule and that he did not raise the subject of California law because the parties were negotiating under federal law. The Legislature approved the 1998-1999 MOU, and it was signed by the Governor and chaptered into law by the Secretary of State. (Stats. 1998, ch. 820, \u00a7 2, p. 5135.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The MOU in effect from July 1, 1999 to July 2, 2001 continued the relevant provisions of the 1998-1999 MOU. CCPOA's negotiators understood that when a provision was \"rolled over\" from one MOU to the next, the\n   bargaining history was rolled over as well. This MOU was approved by the Legislature, signed by the Governor, and chaptered into law. (Stats. 1999, ch. 778, \u00a7 6(b), p. 5613.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The MOU in effect from July 1, 2001 to July 2, 2006 provided for a 7k schedule of 164 compensated hours in a 28-day work period, four of which were for pre-and post-work activities for represented Correctional Officers, Medical Technical Assistants, Youth Correctional Officers, and Youth Correctional Counselors. Correctional Counselor I and Correctional Counselor II Specialists also had a 164-hour schedule. \"Overtime\" was defined as any hours worked in excess of that schedule, and required pay at one and a half times the regular rate of pay. The MOU provided, \"CCPOA agrees that generally this is sufficient time for all pre and post work activities during each work period, and that the compensation allotted for these activities under this provision is full compensation for all of these activities. This section shall not result in changes to the shift start/stop times.\" It included provisions\n   identical to those in the earlier MOU's reciting that the parties had made a good faith attempt to comply with the FLSA and that CCPOA would not bring an action challenging the validity of the 7k schedule under the FLSA. Like its predecessors, the 2001-2006 MOU was approved by the Legislature, signed by the Governor, and chaptered into law. (Stats. 2002, ch. 1, \u00a7 2, p. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CCPOA and the State continued to give effect to these provisions from July 2, 2006 to September 18, 2007, as the parties negotiated unsuccessfully for a new MOU to succeed the 2001-2006 MOU. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 3517.8, subd. (a).) On September 18, 2007, the State imposed on CCPOA and the represented employees the terms of its \"last[,] best[,] and final offer,\" without substantive modification to the provisions discussed above. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 3517.8, subd. (b).) The Legislature did not approve or ratify these terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State and CCPOA entered into a new MOU on May 16, 2011, which was set to expire July 2, 2013. The 2011-2013 MOU recited that the parties were working under the provisions of section 207(k) of the FLSA (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) ), continued the 164-hour, 28-day work period for represented employees, consisting of 160 hours for posted duty and four hours for pre- and post-work activities, and defined \"overtime\" as any hours worked in excess of that schedule. It did not include the language found in the earlier MOU's providing that four hours constituted sufficient compensation for pre- and post-work activities. In a side letter, the parties agreed that no changes to the MOU's language would have a prejudicial effect on either side's arguments in the\n   <em>\n    Stoetzl\n   </em>\n   action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At all times relevant to this action, it has been the State's practice to pay represented employees overtime compensation, at one and a half times the regular rate of pay, for all reported time worked in excess of 164 hours in a 28-day work period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   b. Unrepresented Employees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Labor relations between the unrepresented employees are governed by the Bill of Rights for State Excluded Employees ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 3525 et seq. ), which does not permit collective bargaining. No MOU governs their hours, wages, or other terms and conditions of employment. Their regular working schedule was 40 hours of regular compensated duty during each work week. Correctional Sergeants, Correctional Lieutenants, and Senior Medical Technical Assistants were paid overtime at one and a half times the regular rate of pay for reported time in excess of that. Unrepresented employees did not receive the four hours of block pay for pre- and post-work activities that some represented employees received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   CalHR used the California Pay Scale Manual to document the salaries for state employees. The Pay Scale Manual established \"Work Week Groups\" under the FLSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The unrepresented workers are members of Work Week Group 2. The manual provided: \"Overtime for employees\n   in classes not eligible for exemption under Section 7K of the FLSA is defined as all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a period of 168 hours or seven consecutive 24-hour periods.\" Under the heading, \"Hours Worked,\" it stated, \"For the purpose of identifying hours worked under the provisions of the FLSA, only the time spent which is controlled or required by the State and pursued for the benefit of the State need be counted....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under the heading, \"Determination of Coverage under FLSA,\" the Pay Scale Manual provided: \"The provisions of Work Week Group 2 are made applicable to all classes which are determined by the Director of the Department of Personnel Administration to include positions subject to the FLSA.\" The DPA had determined that all the job classifications included in the Unrepresented Employees subclass were subject to the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    3. Trial Court's Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court ruled in favor of the State on all issues at the Phase I trial. As to represented employees, it concluded the legal standard for determining what constituted compensable hours worked was the \"first principal activity\" test of the FLSA rather than California's \"control test.\" It based this conclusion on the language of the MOU's, which it found \"unambiguously establishes that the parties agreed that the FLSA's first principal activity test is the controlling legal standard\"; evidence that the parties understood they were negotiating under federal law and agreed to adopt the FLSA's test; and the fact that the MOU's were approved by the Legislature and chaptered into law. As to the unrepresented employees, the trial court concluded CalHR had acted within its legislatively delegated authority in applying the FLSA as the standard for measuring compensable hours. As to plaintiffs' claim for common law breach of contract, the court ruled that this claim was subject to the general rule that the terms and conditions of public employment are controlled by statute and ordinance, rather than contract, and that, in any case, plaintiffs had not established the existence of an agreement between the State and plaintiffs to pay overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory and Regulatory Scheme Governing California Minimum Wage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"The IWC is a five-member appointive board initially established by the Legislature in 1913. For the first 60 years of its existence, the IWC's mission was to regulate the wages, hours and conditions of employment of\n   <em>\n    women and children\n   </em>\n   employed in this state, in furtherance of such employees' 'health and welfare.' To this end, the commission-beginning in 1916-promulgated a series of industry- and occupation-wide 'wage orders,' prescribing various minimum requirements with respect to wages, hours and working conditions to protect the health and welfare of women and child laborers.... [\u00b6] ... [T]he California Legislature in 1972 and 1973 amended the applicable provisions of the Labor Code to authorize the IWC to establish minimum wages, maximum hours and standard conditions of employment for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   employees in the state, men as well as women. [Citations.] The constitutionality of this legislative expansion of the IWC's jurisdiction to all California workers is explicitly confirmed by article XIV section 1 of the California Constitution which declares: 'The Legislature may provide for minimum wages and for the general welfare of employees and for those purposes may confer on a commission legislative, executive and judicial powers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Industrial Welfare Com. v.

The court therefore concluded the Legislature did not intend the district's labor relations to be governed\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   by the applicable Public Utility Code provisions, but rather, that the district's rules and regulations, \"including those adopted by a resolution approving a collective bargaining agreement, must themselves be promulgated\n   <em>\n    subject to\n   </em>\n   the limitations and restrictions of other applicable laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 333,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20525\">\n    127 Cal.Rptr. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <em>\n    Grier\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that a labor agreement approved by the\n   <em>\n    Legislature\n   </em>\n   is subject to inconsistent labor laws of general application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that even if the parties\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have bargained away the protection of Wage Order 4, they in fact\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   agree to have the represented plaintiffs' compensable time measured by federal, rather than state, law. Both the language of the MOU's and the circumstances of their negotiation demonstrate otherwise. Each MOU contained a section entitled \"7K Exemption,\" which recited that the employees were working under the provisions of Section 207(k) of the FLSA and that the State was declaring a specific exemption for them, and established a 164-hour, 28-day work period consisting of 160 hours for posted duty and four hours for pre- and post-work activities. In each of the MOU's except that formed in 2011, CCPOA and the State agreed that four hours was generally sufficient for all such activities, that they had \"made a good faith attempt to comply with\n   <em>\n    all requirements of the FLSA\n   </em>\n   in negotiating this provision,\" and that \"[i]f any court of competent jurisdiction declares that any provision or application of this Agreement is not in conformance with the FLSA, the parties agree to [m]eet and [c]onfer immediately.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Italics added.) And, as we have explained, the regulations governing compensable hours of work for employees subject to a 7k exemption provide that only the amount of time allowed by a contract or under the custom or practice need be counted.

Plaintiffs cannot now rewrite their agreement to include hours worked that are not contained in the MOU's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The evidence also supports the trial court's finding that, when negotiating the 1998-1999 MOU, the parties understood they were proceeding under the FLSA's standards and employees would not be entitled to compensation for the time they spent between entering the institution and picking up their equipment or the time after the equipment was returned. This agreed-upon schedule continued for all succeeding MOU's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court properly concluded, as both a factual and legal matter, that the FLSA, not California's minimum wage law, governed plaintiffs' claims as to the represented employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    2. Unrepresented Employees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court concluded the FLSA also provided the legal standard for\n   measuring the compensable hours worked by the subclass of unrepresented employees. The court reasoned that CalHR had established work week groups\n   detailed in the California Pay Scale Manual, that all the job classifications in the subclass were contained in Work Week Group 2, and that CalHR had determined that Work Week Group 2 positions were subject to the FLSA. The \"Work Week Group Definitions\" in the Pay Scale Manual included a section describing \"Work Week Groups Established Under [FLSA].\" A subsection entitled \"Hours Worked\" provided that, \"For the purpose of identifying hours worked under the provisions of the FLSA, only the time spent which is controlled or required by the State and pursued for the benefit of the State need be counted.\" In a subsection entitled \"Determination of Coverage under FLSA,\" the document stated that \"provisions of Work Week Group 2 are made applicable to all classes which are determined by the Director of the Department of Personnel Administration to include positions subject to the FLSA.\" A subsection entitled \"Work Periods\" provided that \"The beginning of a work week may be changed if the change is intended to be permanent and it is not designed to evade the overtime provision of the FLSA.\" The subsection entitled \"Overtime Compensations\" establishes standards for \"FLSA overtime worked.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   After reviewing these provisions, the court concluded, \"At all relevant times and consistent with its legislatively delegated authority, CalHR has applied the FLSA as the standard for measuring plaintiffs' compensable hours worked. It follows that, as applied here, the FLSA standard of compensability constitutes state law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge this conclusion, arguing that CalHR could not, and did not, supersede Wage Order 4, which defines \"hours worked\" to mean \"the time during which an employee is subject to the control of an employer.\" ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 11040, subd. (2)(K).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants, on the other hand, contend that CalHR, using its delegated authority to set salaries for unrepresented employees, fixed the FLSA as the controlling legal standard for compensable hours worked by virtue of the definition of Work Week Group 2 found in the California Pay Scale Manual.

The manual does not expressly state that law enforcement employees are not subject to the provisions of the wage orders applicable to their job classifications, nor does it contain any provisions concerning compensation for pre- and post-work activities. Wage Order 4, on the other hand, explicitly provides that its \"Definitions\" (section 2) and \"Minimum Wages\" (section 4) provisions apply to employees of the State. ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 11040, subd. 1(B).) The section related to \"Hours and Days of Work,\" which governs \"Daily Overtime\" and \"Alternative Workweek Schedules,\" does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply to state employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., subds. (1)(B), (3).) We may reasonably construe the regulatory schemes to mean that entitlement to overtime compensation is controlled by the FLSA but that the meaning of \"hours worked\" is governed by Wage Order 4. Such a construction does violence to neither regulatory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude the unrepresented employees are entitled to pay for all hours worked under the applicable California standard rather than the FLSA's standard.

The language chosen by the IWC does not support [defendant's] argument that a broad importation [of federal rules] was intended.
