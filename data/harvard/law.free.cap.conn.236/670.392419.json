J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2l\">The dispositive issue in this civil action lies at the intersection of two lines of authority, one that, as a matter of common law duty, requires adults to exercise caution in supplying alcoholic beverages to intoxicated minors, and the other that, as a matter of statutory law, permits tortfeasors to diminish their liability for their own tortious conduct by requiring the apportionment of liability among all tortfeasors. The issue arises out of a motor vehicle accident in which an intoxicated minor caused a one car crash that led to the death of a passenger in the car that the minor was operating. In this wrongful death action, the operative question before us is whether there are circumstances under which a bar, the place where the intoxicated minor was served alcohol, may limit its potential liability by joining as defendants those patrons of the bar who, as social hosts or as purveyors of alcohol, furnished alcoholic beverages to the minor. Contrary to the ruling of the trial court, we conclude that a third party complaint joining such patrons states a cognizable cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The plaintiff, Mary F. Bohan, administratrix of the estate of Thomas F. Bohan (Bohan), filed a three count complaint against the defendants John J. Last and Randall\u2019s, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which she alleged that the defendants had intentionally, negligently and in violation of the Connecticut Dram Shop Act, General Statutes \u00a7 30-102,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> served or permitted the service of alcoholic beverages to Anthony W. Ferro, a minor, and that Ferro, when driving a car while intoxicated, had caused Bohan\u2019s death. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-102 and 52-572h (c) and (d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Book \u00a7 103,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendants moved to cite in four additional defendants in order to permit a determination of the proportionate share of damages for which each defendant might be liable. The additional defendants sought to be joined were Ferro and three patrons of Randall\u2019s Restaurant,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> namely, Michael Piroli, Michael Simeone and Michael Lombardi, each of whom allegedly had provided alcohol to Ferro. The trial court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>permitted the joinder of the additional defendants but expressly declined to rule on the substantive merits of the defendants\u2019 third party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The plaintiff moved to strike those portions of the defendants\u2019 third party complaint that alleged tortious liability on the part of Piroli, Simeone and Lombardi.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The defendants\u2019 complaint alleged that these three individuals were social acquaintances of Ferro who had engaged in tortious conduct by intentionally or negligently causing alcohol to be furnished to him at Randall\u2019s Restaurant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Hodgson, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs motion to strike those counts of the defendants\u2019 complaint that were directed toward Piroli, Simeone and Lombardi.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The defendants then filed a substitute third party complaint with respect to the relevant counts, in which they alleged that Simeone and Lombardi<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had acted tortiously in their capacities as social hosts and as purveyors of alcohol to Ferro. In response, the plaintiff first filed a request to revise, alleging that the substitute complaint did not differ substantially from the previously filed complaint. After the trial court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>sustained the defendants\u2019 objection to the request to revise, the plaintiff moved to strike the relevant counts of the defendants\u2019 substitute complaint. The trial court, <em>Hodgson, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs motion and thereafter rendered judgment against the defendants. The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In an appeal from a judgment granting a motion to strike, we operate in accordance with well established principles. We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>780, 629 A.2d 357 (1993); <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Wawruck, </em>209 Conn. 407, 408, 551 A.2d 738 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In this case, the facts alleged are notable for their sparsity. For the purposes of our ruling, we assume that the defendants will be able to establish that, on August 11, 1991, Ferro was a minor who had been permitted entry into Randall\u2019s Restaurant, a bar where alcoholic beverages were being served. The defendants do not allege, however, that Ferro\u2019s presence at Randall\u2019s Restaurant resulted from the conduct of Simeone or Lombardi, singly or jointly, in inviting Ferro to accompany them there or to meet them there. At oral argument in this court, counsel for the defendants expressly disavowed any claim that Simeone and Lombardi had acted as \u201csocial hosts\u201d in that sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The crucial factual allegations in the defendants\u2019 substitute complaint are, therefore, the allegations that Simeone and Lombardi acted as purveyors of alcoholic beverages to Ferro. The complaint alleges only that each of these men tortiously \u201cprocured alcoholic beverages and gave and purveyed them\u201d to Ferro. The complaint\u2019s only other relevant allegations state nothing more than that, \u201cby procuring and purveying alcoholic beverages to Anthony Ferro, a minor,\u201d Simeone and Lombardi \u201ccontributed to and helped cause the behavior of Anthony Ferro, and further contributed to the injuries and death of Thomas F. Bohan.\u201d In counts three and five, Simeone and Lombardi are alleged to have engaged in negligent misconduct, and in counts four and six, each is alleged to have engaged in intentional tortious misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">For their claim that their substitute complaint states a cognizable cause of action, the defendants rely on the following allegations of fact and law. Ferro was the driver of a car that was involved in a one car collision that resulted in the death of the passenger in the car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Bohan. At the time of the accident, Ferro was a minor and was intoxicated. On the night of the accident, Simeone and Lombardi purveyed alcoholic beverages to Ferro at Randall\u2019s Restaurant. The alcohol that Simeone and Lombardi purveyed to Ferro caused Ferro to become intoxicated. Ferro\u2019s intoxication was the cause of the one car collision. According to the defendants, these allegations are sufficient to allow them to pursue the claim that Simeone and Lombardi bear some legal responsibility for Bohan\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">For many years, the law of this state provided broad immunity from legal liability for those who contribute to the carnage that drunk drivers inflict on innocent users of our highways and byways. Although we have never held that purveyors of alcohol have no common law duty to exercise due care to protect the foreseeable victims of those who drink and drive, we have, nonetheless, declined to recognize a claim in negligence. Such a claim \u201c \u2018has uniformly failed for the reason that the subsequent injury has been held to have been proximately caused by the intervening act of the immoderate consumer whose voluntary and imprudent consumption of the beverage brings about intoxication and the subsequent injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quinnett </em>v. Newman, 213 Conn. 343, 345-46, 568 A.2d 786 (1990); <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>201 Conn. 385, 389, 517 A.2d 624 (1986); <em>Kowal </em>v. <em>Hofher, </em>181 Conn. 355, 357-58, 436 A.2d 1 (1980); <em>Slicer v. Quigley, </em>180 Conn. 252, 255-56, 429 A.2d 855 (1980); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Steffens, </em>170 Conn. 356, 358, 365 A.2d 1174 (1976); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Bunk, </em>154 Conn. 644, 647, 228 A.2d 510 (1967); <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Morelli, </em>154 Conn. 432, 436-37, 226 A.2d 383 (1967). Until recently, the only derogation of this rule of common law immunity was the limited statutory remedy provided by the Dram Shop Act, presently codified at \u00a7 30-102. See footnote 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>207 Conn. 88, 540 A.2d 54 (1988), we reexamined the logic of our common law decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>in the context of the liability of social hosts who allegedly had provided alcohol to underage guests at a graduation \u201ckeg\u201d party. For two interrelated reasons, we concluded that the hosts were liable in tort because one of the minor guests, who was intoxicated, drove his car and killed another guest as both he and the victim were leaving the party. First, we questioned whether, in the case of a minor, there was logic to the common law presumption that intoxication results from the voluntary conduct of a person who has exercised a knowing and intelligent choice to consume intoxicating liquor. Id., 93-94. We noted that, in other areas of the law, minors have been held not to have assumed the same degree of responsibility as we assign to adults. Id., 97; see, e.g., <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Feldspar Corp., </em>203 Conn. 34, 40-41, 522 A.2d 1235 (1987) (minor exempted from exclusive operation of workers\u2019 compensation law because of youth and immaturity in context of illegal and hazardous employment). Second, we found it persuasive that our state\u2019s public policy, as manifested in numerous relevant civil and criminal statutes,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201creflect[s] a continuing and growing public awareness and concern that children as a class are simply incompetent by reason of their youth and inexperience to deal responsibly with the effects of alcohol.\u201d <em>Ely </em>v. Murphy, supra, 94. With respect to minors, therefore, we concluded that a social host or other purveyor of alcohol will be liable, to the minor served or to innocent third parties thereafter injured, if a court or a juiy finds, as a matter of fact, a proximate cause relationship between the service of alcohol and the damages ensuing from the minor\u2019s consumption of the alcohol.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Applying the principles of <em>Ely </em>v. Murphy, supra, 207 Conn. 88, to the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 substitute complaint against Simeone and Lombardi states a cause of action. Simeone and Lombardi are alleged to have acted as purveyors of alcohol to Ferro. We disagree with the plaintiffs contention that the term \u201cpurveyor\u201d is inherently limited, as a matter of law, to those who prearrange to provide goods and services, but we agree that merely socializing at a bar does not suffice. At this juncture, it is premature to speculate about the manner in which Simeone and Lombardi acted as purveyors, about their negligence or intentional misconduct, or about the causal connection between their misconduct and the accident that took Bohan\u2019s life. As in <em>Ely, </em>the only issue now before us is whether the plaintiffs motion to strike was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">It is no great extension of <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 97, to hold that, under some circumstances, purveyors of alcohol to minors at a bar may be hable to such minors, or to innocent third parties, even if the purveyors do not act as social hosts. Wherever minors become intoxicated, whether in a bar or in a private residence, they are unlikely to appreciate fully the consequences of their intoxication. Wherever minors become intoxicated, their subsequent intoxicated misconduct creates a risk of personal injury and death not only to themselves, but also, as in <em>Ely </em>and as in this case, to innocent third parties. In light of <em>Ely, </em>we disagree, therefore, with the conclusion of the trial court that only a permittee bears legal responsibility for the service of alcohol to minors in a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The reasoning of <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 93-95, equally refutes the plaintiffs contention that holding a purveyor of alcohol liable for injury to innocent third parties would be inconsistent with the general rule of law that, \u201cabsent a special relationship of custody or control, there is no duty to protect a third person from the conduct of another. See 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 315 (1965); F. Harper, F. James &amp; O. Gray, The Law of Torts (2d Ed. 1986) \u00a7 18.7; W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 56.\u201d <em>Kaminski </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>216 Conn. 29, 33-34, 578 A.2d 1048 (1990). The fact that the common law imposes no duty to act as a good Samaritan does not confer immunity on those who negligently choose to act. If the conduct of a negligent actor \u201ccreates the risk of a particular harm and is a substantial factor in causing that harm, the fact that the harm is brought about through the intervention of another force does not relieve the actor of liability, except where the harm is intentionally caused by a third person and is not within the scope of the risk created by the actor\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Merhi </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>164 Conn. 516, 522, 325 A.2d 270 (1973); 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 442 B; see also 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 435 (1) and cases cited infootnote 10 of this opinion. We reaffirmed this principle <em>in Ely v. Murphy, </em>supra, 97, and reaffirm it again today. In appropriate circumstances, a purveyor of alcohol to a minor is liable not because he has custodial control over, or a special relationship with, the minor, but because he has negligently plied the minor with alcohol.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>We are persuaded, however, that the common law liability of purveyors at a bar differs from that of social hosts in one significant respect. <em>In Ely v. Murphy, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 89, in which the adult hosts knowingly served beer at a high school graduation open house, it was reasonable to presume that they knew or had reason to know that a significant number of their guests were minors. Such a presumption is not equally plausible when social acquaintances gather casually at a bar. We conclude, therefore, that the defendants\u2019 substitute third party complaint is cognizable only if we construe it to allege that, in purveying alcohol to Ferro, Simeone and Lombardi knew, or had reason to know, that Ferro was not old enough to drink alcoholic beverages legally at the time when they purveyed alcohol to him at Randall\u2019s Restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We recognize that, <em>in Ely </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 93, we relied on statutory embodiments of public policy that impose criminal liability without regard to scienter. General Statutes \u00a7 30-86, for example, subjects \u201c[a]ny person who delivers or gives [alcoholic] liquors\u201d to a minor to a fine of \u201cnot more than one thousand five hundred dollars or [imprisonment of] not more than eighteen months, or both.\u201d We nonetheless hold that it is appropriate to limit the common law liability of purveyors of alcohol to those who knew or had reason to know that they were making alcohol available to a minor. On numerous occasions, we have reexamined and readjusted our common law principles to assure a proper and harmonious accommodation between judge made law and statutory law. See, e.g., <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>227 Conn. 505, 513-16, 630 A.2d 1328 (1993) (statutory rules governing support orders as source of common law rules governing alimony orders); <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>180 Conn. 491, 494-95, 429 A.2d 946 (1980) (statutory rules governing commercial transactions as source of common law rules governing real property transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tions). We have never held, however, that such a realignment of common law principles requires the common law to mirror every aspect of the comparable statutoiy law, and we decline so to hold today.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the substitute third party complaint filed by the defendants against Simeone and Lombardi states a cognizable cause of action. In appropriate circumstances, adults have a duty to refrain from negligently or intentionally supplying alcohol to minors, whether such adults act as social hosts in their homes or as purveyors in a bar, because minors are presumed not to have the capacity to understand fully the risks associated with intoxication. In accordance with well established principles of proximate cause, this common law duty encompasses responsibility to innocent third party victims of intoxicated minors, such as Ferro\u2019s unfortunate passenger in this case. We are not, however, prepared to engraft strict liability on this common law duty. Accordingly, we hold further that, unless the purveyors of alcohol knew or had reason to know that the person to whom they supplied alcohol was a minor, they have no common law duty to third party victims of the minor\u2019s intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\"> Randall\u2019s, Inc., is a Connecticut corporation that operates a West Haven bar called Randall\u2019s Restaurant.
