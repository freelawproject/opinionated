Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>213 Conn. 625, 569 A.2d 1105 (1990), and <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>220 Conn. 30, 594 A.2d 977 (1991),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was erroneous and should be abandoned. Because we conclude that neither <em>Gould </em>nor <em>Coon </em>was wrongly decided we decline to overrule them.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiff, James Lash, is the administrator of the estate of Michael Lash, who was killed on October 21,1988, while he was a passenger in a vehicle that was struck head-on by a vehicle driven by Mark Rondo. Rondo and the operator of the vehicle occupied by Lash, the plaintiffs decedent, were also killed, and several passengers in each of the two vehicles sustained injuries. Rondo\u2019s vehicle was covered by a $500,000 liability policy under which the plaintiff received payments totaling $118,373.50. The remainder of Rondo\u2019s liability coverage was exhausted by other injured claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The plaintiffs decedent was insured under certain underinsured motorist policies issued by the defendant insurance carriers. The defendants and the amount of underinsured motorist coverage provided by each include: Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, $500,000; Allstate Insurance Company, $200,000; Hartford Casualty Insurance Company, $100,000; Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, $25,000; and General Accident Insurance Company, $20,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff, in his capacity as administrator, sought recovery under each of these policies, and the claim was submitted to arbitration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The arbitration panel, following our decisions in <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 30, and <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 625, concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under any one of the policies issued by the defendants because none of them contained underinsured motorist limits greater than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>liability limits of Rondo\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>DeMayo, J., </em>denied the plaintiffs application to vacate the arbitration award and rendered judgment for the defendants. The Appellate Court, in a per curiam decision, affirmed the judgment of the trial court;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Lash </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>36 Conn. App. 623, 652 A.2d 526 (1995); and this certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The plaintiff maintains that he is eligible to recover underinsured motorist benefits up to $845,000 under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the policies issued by the defendants. The plaintiffs contention is predicated on two separate but interrelated claims: first, a tortfeasor is underinsured within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-336 (e) if the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance are less than the <em>total amount </em>of underinsured motorist coverage available to the claimant; and second, a claimant is eligible for underinsured motorist benefits if the payments <em>actually received </em>by the claimant under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy are less than the limits of the claimant\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage. The plaintiff concedes that his first claim is foreclosed by our holding in <em>Coon,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that his second claim is foreclosed by our holding in <em>Gould.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>He asserts, however, that both of those decisions were wrongly decided and should be overruled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We address the plaintiffs second claim first because it requires little discussion. In <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 299, 673 A.2d 474 (1996), also released today, we rejected an argument identical to the plaintiffs claim that our holding in <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 625, should be abandoned. For the reasons set forth in <em>Florestal, </em>we reaffirm the construction of \u00a7 38a-336 (e) that was adopted by this court in <em>Gould.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The plaintiff also asserts that we should overrule <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 30, in which we concluded that underinsured motorist coverage under separate policies covering the claimant may not be aggregated or \u201cstacked\u201d for purposes of determining whether a vehicle is underinsured within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-336 (e). At the outset, we note that principles of stare decisis militate against the plaintiffs claim that we should abandon our holding in <em>Coon. </em>\u201cStare decisis, although not an end in itself, serves the important function of preserving stability and certainty in the law. Accordingly, a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>logic require it. . . . This is especially true when the precedent involved concerns the interpretation or construction of a statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In <em>Coon, </em>the tortfeasor was insured under a liability policy that provided coverage of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident. The claimant was insured under two separate uninsured motorist policies, one that provided $20,000 of underinsured motorist coverage and another with underinsured motorist limits of $50,000. In concluding that \u00a7 38a-336 (e) unambiguously prohibited the aggregation of the underinsured motorist limits of the two policies in determining whether the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was underinsured, we explained that \u201c[t]he application of \u00a7 38a-336 requires two distinct steps: (1) determining whether a vehicle is in fact under-insured, so that coverage is available; and (2) calculating the amount of the actual award due the victim.\u201d <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 36. As to the first step, we concluded that while \u00a7 38a-336 \u201cdoes not prohibit stacking of coverage in determining the total amount of the award due the victim . . . [t]he statute is unequivocal, however, in establishing the mechanism for determining whether a vehicle is under-insured, and it specifically limits consideration of underinsured motorist coverage to each policy separately.\u201d Id., 37. Thus, \u201cthe analysis directed by \u00a7 38a-336 requires a comparison between the aggregate of liability limits available to the victim against the under-insured motorist limits in <em>each single policy </em>against which the victim has a claim.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The plaintiff claims, contrary to our conclusion in <em>Coon, </em>that \u00a7 38a-336 (e) is not clear on its face and, therefore, that our reliance on the statutory language was misplaced. The plaintiff further asserts that our construction of \u00a7 38a-336 (e) does not accurately reflect the intent of the legislature because it leads to results that are incompatible with the purpose underlying the enactment of our uninsured and underinsured motorist statutes. We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">As in every case involving the construction of a statute, we begin our analysis with a review of the pertinent statutory language. The plaintiffs assertion to the contrary notwithstanding, there is nothing ambiguous in the language of \u00a7 38a-336 (e): the word \u201cpolicies\u201d refers to the insurance carried by the tortfeasor and the word \u201cpolicy\u201d refers to the underinsured motorist coverage available to the claimant. We cannot assume that the legislature, in enacting a statutory provision that uses a particular word in the plural and then the same word in the singular, intended for two different words to have the same meaning, especially when, as here, the two different terms are used in the same sentence and refer to two different things. We must presume, rather, that the legislature\u2019s use of the singular in referring to the \u201cuninsured motorist portion of the <em>policy </em>against which claim is made\u201d and its use of the plural in referring to \u201cthe sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies\u201d was deliberate and purposeful. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (e). We see no basis, therefore, to conclude that \u00a7 38a-336 (e) is not clear on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The plaintiff contends that even if \u00a7 38a-336 (e) is unambiguous, we must resort to other aids to ascertain the intent of the legislature because a literal interpretation of that subsection leads to unfair and arbitrary results. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 744, 613 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>A.2d 804 (1992) (\u201ceven if a statute is clear on its face, if a literal interpretation of that statute would lead to unworkable results, resort to other aids to determine legislative intent is appropriate\u201d). The plaintiff offers several hypothetical fact patterns to support his argument that our holding in <em>Coon </em>leads to unjust results. For example, he posits a case in which two insureds, A and B, sustain injuries in an automobile accident that is caused by a tortfeasor with $150,000 of liability insurance. Both A and B have underinsured motorist coverage totaling $200,000, but A is covered under a single policy with underinsured motorist limits of $200,000 and B is covered under two policies with underinsured motorist limits of $100,000 each. Under <em>Coon, </em>A is eligible for underinsured motorist benefits because the limits of his underinsured motorist policy are greater than the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy. By contrast, B is not eligible to recover underinsured motorist benefits because the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy are greater than the limits of each of the underinsured motorist policies under which B is covered. The plaintiff claims that since both A and B have the same amount of underinsured motorist coverage available to them, this result is unfair and, therefore, our interpretation of \u00a7 38a-336 (e) must be contrary to the intent of the legislature. We are not persuaded that our holding in <em>Coon </em>is inconsistent with the legislative intent underlying the enactment of \u00a7 38a-336.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The plaintiff asserts that the pertinent \u201clegislative history . . . clearly demonstrates that the uninsured and underinsured motorist statutes were intended to ensure that victims of automobile accidents receive full financial redress for their injuries.\u201d The plaintiffs claim overstates the objective of the legislature in providing for underinsured motorist coverage. Contrary to the assertion of the plaintiff, \u201cthe purpose of underinsured motorist coverage is neither to guarantee full compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>sation for a claimant\u2019s injuries nor to ensure that the claimant will be eligible to receive the maximum payment available under any applicable policy.\u201d <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 310. It is, rather, \u201cto give a personal injury claimant access to insurance protection to compensate for the damages that would have been recoverable if the under-insured motorist had maintained <em>an adequate policy of liability insurance. Bodner v. United Services Automobile Assn., </em>222 Conn. 480, 499, 610 A.2d 1212 (1992); <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, 225 </em>Conn. 566, 573, 624 A.2d 892 (1993). Section 38a-336 furthers this legitimate public policy even though certain inequities may arise in some underinsured motorist cases and some accident victims with underinsured motorist coverage will be denied satisfactory compensation for their injuries. See <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 310-11. Thus, any anomalous situation created by our construction of \u00a7 38a-336 (e) must be remedied by \u201clegislative consideration and action rather than . . . by judicial fiat.\u201d <em>Simonette </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 466, 473, 338 A.2d 453 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Indeed, the legislature has responded to our decision in <em>Coon </em>in a manner that strongly supports the conclusion that <em>Coon </em>was correctly decided. In 1993, the legislature enacted the Automobile Insurance Reform Act; Public Acts 1993, No. 93-297 (P.A. 93-297); which, among other things, eliminated stacking of underinsured motorist coverage for all purposes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although P.A. 93-297 is not applicable to this case,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it is apparent that the legislature, in considering the very issue that we addressed in <em>Coon, </em>validated, rather than overruled, our construction of \u00a7 38a-336 (e). For us to renounce our holding in <em>Coon </em>after the legislature has signalled its approval of the construction of \u00a7 38a-336 (e) that we adopted therein would be contrary to the fundamental objective of statutory construction, namely, \u201cto ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In light of the clearly expressed intent of the legislature, \u201cwe are constrained to adhere to our holding in <em>[Coon] </em>despite the unfortunate fact that, under <em>[Coon], </em>some accident victims with underinsured motorist coverage will be denied satisfactory compensation for their injuries.\u201d <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>supra, 236 Conn. 310-11. Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim must fail.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The plaintiff also claims that \u00a7 38a-336 (e), as construed in <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 625, and <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 30, and as applied to the facts of this case, violates the equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Florestal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 313-16, we have today considered, and rejected, a constitutional challenge identical in all material respects to the equal protection claim raised by the plaintiff. We reject the plaintiffs claim for the same reasons that we enumerated in <em>Florestal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, KATZ and LANDAU, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (e) provides: \u201cFor the purposes of this section, an \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 means a motor vehicle with respect to which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the applicable limits of liability under the uninsured motorist portion of the policy against which claim is made under subsection (b) of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">At all times relevant to this appeal, the above subsection was codified as \u00a7 38a-336 (d). In 1993, \u00a7 38a-336 was amended by No. 93-297 of the 1993 Public Acts, which added a new subsection (d), causing the previous subsection (d) to be renumbered as subsection (e). Because \u00a7 38a-336 as amended is also relevant to the outcome of this appeal, and because the content of the new subsection (e) and the old subsection (d) are identical, all references in this opinion are to the current statutory provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\"> <em>Gould </em>was overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Coon.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\"> The plaintiffs decedent was also insured under a policy issued by the Nationwide Insurance Company with underinsured motorist limits of $20,000.

The plaintiff argued, however, that those decisions were wrongly decided and, furthermore, that the application of our holdings in those cases to the facts of this case rendered \u00a7 38a-336 (e) unconstitutional. The Appellate Court refused to address the first contention because that court is bound by this court\u2019s precedent. The Appellate Court also declined to review the plaintiffs constitutional claim, stating that \u201c[e]ven though the equal protection claims presented here were not raised or considered in <em>Coon </em>and <em>Gould, </em>it is not our function, as an intermediate appellate court, to review whether those decisions render that statute unconstitutional. Whether to overrule a prior Supreme Court decision on grounds not raised in the argument of that case is a matter appropriately reserved for the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Lash </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>36 Conn.

Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 35-37. Thus, for purposes of determining whether a tortfeasor is underinsured within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-336 (e), the underinsured motorist limits of the policies available to the claimant may not be aggregated, or \u201cstacked.\u201d Accordingly, the plaintiff, under our holding in <em>Coon, </em>may not recover underinsured motorist benefits under any of the policies issued by the defendants because the amount of liability coverage provided under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy, $500,000, is equal to or greater than the underinsured motorist limits of the defendants\u2019 policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> In <em>Gould, </em>we held that in determining whether a vehicle is underinsured within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-336 (e), the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s Lability poLcy must be compared with the Lmits of the claimant\u2019s underinsured motorist policy rather than the payments actually received by the claimant under the liability policy. <em>American Motorists Ins.

Under the construction of \u00a7 38a-336 that we adopted in <em>Gould, </em>therefore, the tortfeasor was not underinsured, even though the plaintiff recovered substantially less than the Lmits of the tortfeasor\u2019s poLcy, because the applicable underinsured motorist Lmits of each of the poLcies issued by the defendants; see footnote 8; was equal to or less than the LabiLiy Lmits of the tortfeasor\u2019s poLcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> The plaintiff could also prevail, at least partially, if we were to overrule either <em>Gould </em>or <em>Coon, </em>but not both.

If any person insured for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is an occupant of an owned vehicle, the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage afforded by the policy covering the vehicle occupied at the time of the accident shall be the only uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage available.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"><em> </em>Public Act 93-297 took effect on January 1, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> \u201cThe [plaintiff] correctly assertfs] that under our construction of \u00a7 38a-336, [he] would have been able to obtain a greater recovery had the tortfeasor been uninsured. [He] further maintain[s] that this result is inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s principal reason for amending our uninsured motorist statutes in 1979; Public Acts 1979, No. 79-235; to include underinsured motorist coverage, namely, \u2018to remedy the \u201canomalous situation\u201d . . . where an injured party could find himself in a better position if the tortfeasor had no liability insurance than if he had only the statutory minimum amount. \u2019 <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 390-91, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>220 Conn. 30, 594 A.2d 977 (1991). As we have indicated, however, we may notpresume that the legislature soughtto address every possible anomalous situation that may arise under the statutory scheme governing uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. Moreover, we must construe \u00a7 38a-336 (e) \u2018without reference to whether [we think that provision] would have been or could be improved by the inclusion of other provisions.\u2019 <em>Battersby </em>v. <em>Battersby, </em>218 Conn. 467, 471, 590 A.2d 427 (1991); see also <em>Simonette </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>[supra, 165 Conn. 466]. Accordingly, our duty is not to second guess the wisdom of a clear expression of legislative will but, rather, to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. See <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>232 Conn. 17, 26, 653 A.2d 156 (1995). In light of the plain language of \u00a7 38a-336 (e) and the legislature\u2019s apparent validation of our interpretation of that statutory subsection as reflected in its enactment of [\u00a7 38a-336 (d)], we reject the plaintifffs] argument that <em>Gould </em>must be overruled in order to avoid an anomalous result in this case.\u201d <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins.
