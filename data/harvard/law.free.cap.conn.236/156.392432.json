We conclude that they are not and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The parties have stipulated to the following facts. The plaintiff, a Delaware coiporation with its principal place of business in Stamford, manufactures, markets and distributes aerospace equipment in an international market. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Smiths Industries, Inc. (Smiths), a Florida corporation, which is not authorized to do business in Connecticut. Smiths Industries International Sales Corporation (Smiths International), also a wholly owned subsidiary of Smiths, is a coiporation properly organized under the laws of the United States Virgin Islands and qualifies as a foreign sales coiporation (FSC) under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 (a) (1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A FSC is, in essence, \u201ca legal entity through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>which a parent corporation may channel export sales and receive a tax benefit under circumstances in which the export sales would otherwise generate profits taxable at normal rates.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> P. Day, \u201cForeign Sales Corporations: Connecticut Tax Implications,\u201d 60 Conn. B.J. 307, 310 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In September, 1987, the plaintiff entered into a sales representative and commission agreement with Smiths <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>International for the purpose of selling the plaintiffs products in an international market.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Smiths International agreed to perform or to contract for the performance of all activities necessary for the sale of the plaintiffs products as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 925 (c) (1994),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including marketing and sales promotion, processing customers\u2019 orders, and billing. At the end of fiscal years 1988 and 1989, the plaintiff compensated Smiths International for its sales activities by paying to Smiths International commissions properly due pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 925 (a) (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, for purposes of its Connecticut corporation business tax for those two years, the plaintiff deducted the commission expenses pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-217 (a) (A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Furthermore, Smiths International declared and paid dividends to Smiths in an amount equal to the commissions Smiths International had received from the plaintiff. The commissions were the sole source of funds for those dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Following an audit of the plaintiff for the fiscal years 1988 and 1989, the commissioner, by invoking his discretion under General Statutes \u00a7 12-226a<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to adjust income where it has been \u201cimproperly or inaccurately reflected,\u201d disallowed 8/23 of the commission expense deduction for each of the two years.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the commissioner recognized that Smiths International was properly created and formed under federal law as a valid FSC, he nevertheless considered it to be valid on paper only because it had no economic substance. By determining that it had no economic reality, he felt justified in disregarding its existence in the arrangement between the plaintiff and Smiths. In eliminating Smiths <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>International, the commissioner viewed the transaction as one strictly between the plaintiff and Smiths in which the plaintiff paid commissions directly to Smiths and, in return, Smiths paid dividends to the plaintiff. Accordingly, the commissioner considered the commission expenses incurred by the plaintiff to be directly related to the dividends. Because \u201cexpenses related to dividends\u201d are not deductible under \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the commissioner disallowed the deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the trial court, <em>Aronson, J., </em>which dismissed the appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court based its judgment on two theories. First, it found that \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1) alone authorized the commissioner\u2019s decision to disallow the commission expense deductions. The trial court, in essence, reasoned that the plaintiff had violated that provision by deducting expenses related to dividends. The court also affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision to invoke his discretionary powers under \u00a7 12-226a, and agreed with the commissioner that although Smiths International had been properly formed as a sanctioned FSC, it was in essence a paper corporation that had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>economic substance. The court concluded, therefore, that the commissioner had properly invoked his authority under \u00a7 12-226a to reorganize the transaction as one solely between the plaintiff and Smiths and, consequently, to adjust the plaintiffs income. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201cThe scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); <em>Zachs v. Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 689, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201cIn this case, the trial court\u2019s determinations were based on a record that consisted solely of a stipulation of facts, written briefs, and oral arguments by counsel. The trial court had no occasion to evaluate the credibility of witnesses or to assess the intent of the parties in light of additional evidence first presented at trial. The record before the trial court was, therefore, identical with the record before this court. In these circumstances, the legal inferences properly to be drawn from the parties\u2019 definitive stipulation of facts raise questions of law rather than of fact. Cf. <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>221 Conn. 530, 545, 606 A.2d 684 (1992); <em>Bell Food Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherbacow, </em>217 Conn. 476, 482 n.7, 586 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>Canaan National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Bank </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>217 Conn. 330, 335, 586 A.2d 562 (1991); <em>Mizla </em>v. <em>Depalo, </em>183 Conn. 59, 63 n.8, 438 A.2d 820 (1981). Accordingly, our review of the ruling of the trial court in this case is plenary.\u201d <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 53-54, 607 A.2d 424 (1992). Because we conclude that the inferences the trial court drew from the stipulation of facts are legally and logically incorrect, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We begin our discussion with the interrelationship among \u00a7 12-217 (a) (A), which permits a taxpayer to take a deduction that is allowable under the federal corporation income tax laws; <em>D.A. Pincus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>235 Conn. 865, 871-72, 670 A.2d 1278 (1996); \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1), which provides that a taxpayer may not, however, deduct \u201cexpenses related to dividends\u201d from gross income; <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 220, 226-30, 567 A.2d 371 (1989); and \u00a7 12-226a, which permits the commissioner to adjust income where it has been improperly or inaccurately reflected. Section 12-226a grants the commissioner broad discretion to adjust computations of income whenever he finds that the taxpayer\u2019s determination of income is improper or inaccurate. We agree with the commissioner that such impropriety or inaccuracy need not be an intentional misrepresentation of income, but can instead be a mere inaccuracy of income as compared to what the commissioner deems in his discretion to be a proper reflection of the taxpayer\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Section 12-226a is virtually identical to the adjustment provision in New York Tax Law \u00a7 211 (5) (McKinney 1986).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe fact that a statute is almost a literal copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of a statute of a sister state is persuasive evidence of a practical reenactment of the statute of the sister state; as such it is proper to resort to the decisions of a sister court construing that statutory language.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 5, 411 A.2d 3 (1979). The New York Court of Appeals has interpreted \u00a7 211 (5) to give the tax commission wide discretion to determine whether income has been improperly or inaccurately reflected and will uphold the commission\u2019s decision if it has a rational basis. See, e.g., <em>Campbell Sales Co. </em>v. <em>New York State Tax Commission, </em>68 N.Y.2d 617, 619-20, 496 N.E.2d 213, 505 N.Y.S.2d 54 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1088, 107 S. Ct. 1295, 94 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1987) (commission\u2019s decision upheld unless it is abuse of discretion). We also note that the federal tax laws contain a provision, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 (1994),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that has the same spirit as \u00a7 12-226a, yet is more restrictive in that its language is less discretionary. Nevertheless, it has been interpreted to grant to the United States Secretary of the Treasury broad discretion to allocate income and deductions between related corporations for the purpose of preventing evasion of taxes or to reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>income clearly. See <em>W. Braun Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>396 F.2d 264, 266-68 (2d Cir. 1968) (concluding that secretary arbitrarily invoked \u00a7 482 to allocate income between related corporations where no evidence of lack of business purpose to corporate structure).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In the present case, in order to conclude that income has been improperly or inaccurately reflected pursuant to \u00a7 12-226a, the commissioner implicitly found that the plaintiff had failed to comply properly with \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1) in that it had deducted expenses related to dividends. In this case, because the commissioner\u2019s invocation of \u00a7 12-226a relies on \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1), which allows the taxpayer a deduction, the taxpayer \u2014 the plaintiff \u2014 has the burden to prove that it properly took the deduction. See <em>Kelly-Springfield Tire Co. </em>v. <em>Bajorski, </em>228 Conn. 137, 141-42, 635 A.2d 771 (1993) (\u201cambiguities in the language or the applicability of statutes governing tax liability are resolved in favor of taxpayers if the issue is the authority to impose a tax, and in favor of the tax commissioner if the issue is the right to a deduction or exemption\u201d); see also <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>224 Conn. 426, 432, 619 A.2d 443 (1993); <em>B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 8-9, 490 A.2d 991 (1985). We conclude that because the plaintiff has sustained its burden, the trial court improperly upheld the commissioner\u2019s decision to disallow the deductions taken by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The trial court first concluded that the commissioner properly had disallowed the deductions because the plaintiff had failed to comply with \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1). The court based its conclusion upon paragraph fourteen of the parties\u2019 stipulation, which provides that \u201c[t]he FSC declared and paid dividends to Smiths in an amount equal to the entire FSC [c]ommission [ejxpense and said FSC commissions were the sole source of the funds for such dividends.\u201d From that stipulation, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>inferred that Smiths International had no source of income other than the commissions it had received from the plaintiff. The court then inferred that, if Smiths International had no other income, it must have had no expenses. The court therefore concluded that Smiths International must have been a mere paper corporation, without economic substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The trial court relied on this court\u2019s definition of \u201cexpenses related to dividends\u201d in <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 228, in which we stated that commission expenses are \u201cexpenses related to dividends\u201d when \u201cthey are directly responsible for generating the dividends paid by the [domestic international sales corporations] to their parent companies\u201d to conclude that the plaintiff had failed to comply with \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1). Using that definition, the trial court determined in the present case that \u201c[the plaintiff] is directly responsible for generating the dividends paid by [Smiths International] to Smiths because [Smiths International\u2019s] sole income, according to the stipulation of the parties, is from the commissions paid to [it] by . . . [the plaintiff] . . . .\u201d The trial court concluded, therefore, that because Smiths International was a paper corporation created solely to divert funds from the plaintiff to Smiths in order to enable the plaintiff to take advantage of the deduction otherwise permitted under \u00a7 12-217 (a) (A), the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1) and the commissioner properly had disallowed the deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s inferences are not logically and legally supportable because the court misinterpreted the parties\u2019 stipulation and ignored the law. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The parties stipulated in paragraph fourteen that Smiths International had \u201cdeclared and paid dividends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>to Smiths in an amount equal to the entire . . . [c]om-mission [ejxpense and [that those] commissions were the sole source of the funds for such dividends.\u201d The trial court\u2019s inference from that stipulation that Smiths International had no expenses, that its sole income was the commissions it received from the plaintiff, and that therefore it was a paper corporation, is legally and logically incorrect for several reasons. It was stipulated that Smiths International was a valid FSC, which meant as a matter of law that it could not have been a mere paper corporation without economic substance because of federal requirements to engage in certain activities that gave it economic substance. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921 through 927 (1994). For example, it was required to maintain a place of business, maintain books and accounting records and employ a staff \u2014 activities which by necessity generated expenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition, as a FSC, Smiths International was required to pay federal income tax on the nonexempt portion of its income and to pay income or franchise taxes to the United States Virgin Islands, the territory in which it is incorporated. Furthermore, according to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 926 (a) (1994), the source of funds for dividends paid to the shareholder of a FSC must be any earnings and profits attributable to foreign trade income.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the commissions received by Smiths International <em>had </em>to be the primary source of funds for the dividends it paid to Smiths. Although, in paying the dividends in accordance with federal requirements, Smiths International exhausted the entire commission, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>indication in the record that Smiths International did not have income from other sources. In fact, because Smiths International served as the sales representative for another subsidiary of Smiths, it received income, in the form of commissions, from that company.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (d) (1994)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provides that a FSC can have investment income in the form of interest, dividends, royalties, annuities and rents. See Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.921-2 (f) (1995).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, the inferences that the sole source of income generated by Smiths International was the commissions it received from the plaintiff and that its only expenses were the dividends it paid Smiths were not legally and logically correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The trial court also concluded that the commissioner was correct in invoking his discretion under \u00a7 12-226a to adjust the plaintiffs income by ignoring the separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>existence of Smiths International in order to \u201cconsider the payment of the commission[s] as if [they] were made directly by [the plaintiff] to Smiths.\u201d In relying on its earlier interpretation of paragraph fourteen of the stipulation, the trial court stated that because the arrangement between the plaintiff, Smiths International and Smiths did not have economic substance and because these parties were not dealing at arm\u2019s length, the arrangement was \u201ca sham.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded that the commissioner had properly adjusted the plaintiffs income in order to prevent \u201cdecreas [ing] the amount of tax paid by [the plaintiff] to the State of Connecticut in favor of passing on ultimately to Smiths that portion of the tax free dividend that would have been paid to Connecticut. \u201d Because the trial court relied on its earlier improper interpretation of paragraph fourteen and the inferences it drew therefrom, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Moreover, to the extent that the trial court afforded special deference to the commissioner\u2019s decision to invoke \u00a7 12-226a to disallow the deductions, we conclude that the commissioner\u2019s decision does not warrant such deference. \u201cOrdinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review </em>Board, 226 Conn. 670, 678, 628 A.2d 957 (1993). Where, however, a question of law is involved, we \u201c[invoke] a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny, as in this case, the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>is not entitled to special deference.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 678-79. Because the commissioner\u2019s determination of whether the commission expenses in question were related to dividends raised a question of law and because we have not, until today, decided when the commissioner may properly invoke \u00a7 12-226a, we do not grant the commissioner special deference in his use of \u00a7 12-226a in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Regulations that were adopted by the department of revenue services while this case was pending further support our conclusion that the trial court was incorrect in concluding that the commissioner properly had invoked his discretion under \u00a7 12-226a.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>226a-l (c) (1) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that \u201c[\u00a7] 12-226a of the general statutes authorizes the [cjommissioner to disregard an arrangement under which related companies may operate where one company so dominates and controls the other that income of the companies is improperly or inaccurately reflected, and it is neither realistic nor feasible to reconstruct the transactions between them using the arm\u2019s-length consideration standard.\u201d This regulation further provides that \u201c[i]n determining whether an arrangement under which related companies may operate results in the improper or inaccurate reflection of the activity, business, income or capital of the companies, the [cjommissioner shall consider whether (A) the companies are motivated by business purposes other than tax avoidance or are principally motivated by tax avoidance purposes . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-226a-l (c) (2). \u201cIn determining whether related companies are motivated by business purposes other than tax avoidance or are principally motivated by tax avoidance purposes and whether the separate businesses of the companies have economic substance, the [cjommissioner shall consider whether (A) the related person has an identifiable place of business with supporting business records; (B) the related person maintains books and related accounting records; (C) the related person has a staff of employees or engaged contractors adequate in number and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>sufficient expertise to conduct its business affairs; (D) the company so controls and dominates the finances, policy and business activities of the related person that the related person has virtually no separate existence; (E) the form employed for doing business is a sham; and (F) the separate businesses have economic substance because a reasonable possibility of obtaining a profit exists, apart from achieving tax benefits. No one factor is controlling in determining whether the company and the related person are motivated by business purposes and whether the arrangements have economic substance. An arrangement between a foreign sales corporation, as defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 and meeting the requirements of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921 to 927, and its shareholders shall not be considered an arrangement that is principally motivated by tax avoidance purposes.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-226a-l (c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The commissioner argues that this regulation supports his conclusion that Smiths International is a mere paper corporation because it fails to meet the factors enumerated in the regulation for a company with economic substance and its existence, therefore, is principally motivated for tax avoidance purposes. We disagree. In this case, because the parties stipulated that Smiths International is a valid FSC in satisfaction of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921 through 927, it necessarily has an identifiable place of business in the United States Virgin Islands, maintains business records, has employees or contractors, and has other sources of income by which it can make a profit. Therefore, because Smiths International satisfied the factors listed in the regulation and because Smiths International was a FSC that comported with all the federal requirements, we conclude that the relationship between the plaintiff, Smiths International and Smiths was not motivated by tax avoidance purposes, that each of these companies had economic sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>stance and that they dealt with each other at arm\u2019s length.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The commissioner additionally relies, as did the trial court, on <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 220, to support its position that it properly disallowed the deductions taken by the plaintiff. This reliance is misplaced. <em>In Bolt Technology Corp., </em>the plaintiff (Bolt) was the parent corporation of Bolt International Coiporation, which was organized as a domestic international sales corporation (DISC) whose primary function was to handle the sales and leasing activities of its parent company. Id., 222-23. Bolt compensated the DISC on a commission basis, those commissions being the DISC\u2019S sole source of income. Bolt, in turn, received dividends from the DISC. Id., 224. On its Connecticut corporation business tax returns, Bolt deducted the commission expenses paid to the DISC. Id. The commissioner disallowed the deduction because it was an \u201cexpense related to dividends\u201d and, therefore, was not deductible under \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1). Id., 225. We affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The commissioner argues in this case that Smiths International is similar to the DISC in <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>because the commissions received from the plaintiff here were also Smiths International\u2019s sole source of income and that, therefore, they are related to the dividends paid to Smiths because \u201c[i]f [the plaintiff] had been a shareholder in [Smiths International] or had established its own FSC, it would have received these dividends rather than Smiths.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The fundamental differences between DISCs and FSCs, reflected in the history of their creation, cause <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>to be unpersuasive. Congress created the DISC in 1971 as a means of encouraging exports. The statutory provisions establishing the DISC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>permitted the parent corporation to defer one half of its income to a DISC by using safe-harbor pricing rules and permitted it to be a mere paper corporation. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 991 through 997 (1994); <em>Dresser Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>911 F.2d 1128, 1131 (5th Cir. 1990); <em>Thomas International Ltd. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>773 F.2d 300, 301 (Fed. Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1045, 106 S. Ct. 1261, 89 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1986). Furthermore, DISCs were not subject to federal income taxation. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 991 (1994); <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 223. In response to their creation, the European Economic Community claimed that DISCs constituted an illegal export subsidy in violation of the United States\u2019 trade obligations adopted in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because they lacked economic substance and the pricing rules used for DISC transactions bore no relation to arm\u2019s length prices. To resolve this controversy and, at the same time, maintain an export incentive, Congress replaced DISCs with FSCs, which comply with the United States\u2019 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade obligations in that they have economic substance and operate at arm\u2019s length. Therefore, because FSCs in general, and the one in this case in particular, have economic substance, which DISCs lacked, the commissioner improperly relied on <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>to conclude that the commissions received from the plaintiff in this case were Smiths International\u2019s sole source of income. In fact, the commissioner could only have reached that conclusion by misinterpreting paragraph fourteen of the stipulation. As we stated earlier, however, the parties have stipulated that Smiths International is a valid FSC, properly created under federal law, and therefore necessarily had expenses and other potential sources of income. Furthermore, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Bolt Technology Corp., </em>which actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>received dividends from its DISC, the plaintiff in this case did not establish its own FSC and, consequently, did not receive dividends from Smiths International. Those dividends were paid directly to Smiths, the parent corporation of Smiths International.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The commissioner\u2019s determination that this three party arrangement can be ignored and that the transactions among them are, in essence, simply between the plaintiff and Smiths is unreasonable. The arrangement, which has economic purpose and reflects an arm\u2019s length relationship, does not warrant an adjustment under \u00a7 12-226a. We agree with the plaintiff that \u201c[t]he [commissioner] arbitrarily invoked his discretion under [\u00a7 12-226a] to impute dividends received by Smiths to [the plaintiff] so that he could then disallow [the plaintiffs] commission expenses as \u2018expenses related to dividends\u2019 under [\u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1)].\u201d The trial court\u2019s conclusions, therefore, that the plaintiff failed to comply with \u00a7 12-217 (a) (D) (1) and that the commissioner did not abuse his discretion under \u00a7 12-226a in determining that the plaintiff had improperly reflected its income, are both legally and logically incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In this

This guideline, with language similar to \u00a7 12-226-1 (c) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, purports to offer guidance to the commissioner on the proper use of \u00a7 12-226a.

The guideline further provides that \u201c[i]n determining whether the parties were motivated for business purposes or whether the businesses had economic substance, among the factors the [c]ommissioner will consider are: a. whether the related party had an identifiable place of business with supporting business records; b. whether the related party maintains books and related accounting records; c. whether the related party had a staff of employees or engaged contractors adequate in number and with sufficient expertise to conduct its business affairs; d. whether the taxpayer so controls and dominates the finances, policy and business activities of the related party that the related party has virtually no separate existence; e. whether the form employed for doing business is a sham; and f. whether the separate businesses had economic substance because a reasonable possibility of obtaining a profit existed, apart from achieving tax benefits.\u201d Id., Internal Procedure (IN) 94 (1) (V) (B) (2).
