The issue presented is whether the plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of our long arm statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">In April, 1994, the plaintiffs, Michael and Stephanie Knipple, filed a five count complaint against the defendants, Viking Communications, Ltd. (Viking), and James McClelland, a sales director for Viking.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both Viking, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>a foreign corporation, and McClelland, a nonresident individual, were constructively served with process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendants appeared and filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 142 and 143 for lack of personal jurisdiction, forum non conveniens and insufficient service of process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs then, pursuant to \u00a7 143, filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss accompanied by an affidavit by Michael Knipple. Subsequently, the defendants filed an affidavit by William Harris, a manager at Viking, in support of their motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although some of the facts pertaining to jurisdiction were disputed, neither party requested an evidentiary hearing. At short calendar, the trial court heard argument on the motion to dismiss, and on October 31, 1994, granted the motion on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to prove the applicability of our state long arm statutes. We reverse the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>court\u2019s judgment dismissing the action as to Viking, but affirm the judgment as to McClelland.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged the following facts. In January, 1993, the plaintiffs received in their mail at home in Waterbury, Connecticut, a package of postcards soliciting inquiries for various products and services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among the cards was one soliciting inquiries concerning vending machines, pay telephones and other business opportunities. The plaintiffs completed and returned that card. Within a few days, the plaintiffs began receiving postal and telephonic communications from representatives of Viking. The various representatives of Viking offered the plaintiffs an opportunity to purchase a \u201cturn-key\u201d business consisting of private pay telephones and promised that Viking would provide location and installation assistance. These communications were received either at the plaintiffs\u2019 home or at Michael Knipple\u2019s place of business in Danbury, Connecticut. In reliance on Viking\u2019s representations, the plaintiffs invested in Viking\u2019s private pay telephones by signing, on February 1,1993, at their home, a document entitled \u201cPurchase Agreement.\u201d The agreement was then sent to Viking\u2019s office in Illinois where it was countersigned by McClelland. Under the terms of the agreement, the plaintiffs consented to pay Viking $16,350 for the purchase of private pay telephones. The following year the plaintiffs brought suit alleging that \u201cViking [had] failed and refused to provide the promised services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\u201cBecause a lack of personal jurisdiction may be waived by the defendant, the rules of practice require the defendant to challenge that jurisdiction by a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Standard Tallow Corp. </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>48, 53-54, 459 A.2d 503 (1983). When a defendant files a motion to dismiss challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction, a two part inquiry is required. The trial court must first \u201cdecide whether the applicable state long-arm statute authorizes the assertion of jurisdiction over the [defendant]. If the statutory requirements [are] met, its second obligation [is] then to decide whether the exercise of jurisdiction over the [defendant] would violate constitutional principles of due process.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>198 Conn. 243, 246, 502 A.2d 905 (1986); see <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>Chemical Bank, </em>234 Conn. 281, 286, 661 A.2d 595 (1995); <em>Lombard Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>190 Conn. 245, 250, 460 A.2d 481 (1983). In this case, the trial court went no further than the first inquiry; it found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the requirements of Connecticut\u2019s long arm statutes \u2014 General Statutes \u00a7 33-411<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with respect to foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>corporations and General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with respect to nonresident individuals \u2014 had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">If a challenge to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction is raised by a defendant, either by a foreign corporation or by a nonresident individual, the plaintiff must bear the burden of proving the court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Standard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Tallow Corp. </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 54. Under our current rules of procedure, a motion to dismiss \u201cmay perform the role of either a motion to erase or a plea in abatement under our former practice.\u201d <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 672 n.4, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984). A motion to erase admitted \u201call facts which [were] well pleaded, invoke[d] the existing record and [was required to] be decided upon that alone.\u201d <em>Barde </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>207 Conn. 59, 62, 539 A.2d 1000 (1988); 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1970) \u00a7 103. The plea in abatement was the required pleading when an alleged jurisdictional defect could not be determined on the record. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 581, 587-88, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979); 1 E. Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 103. Under a plea in abatement, once issues of fact were joined, the trial court was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the disputed facts necessary to decide the jurisdictional issue. 1 E. Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 108 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In view of the dual roles of a motion to dismiss \u2014 that is, as a motion to erase and as a plea in abatement \u2014 this court has previously considered the undisputed factual allegations in the complaint as well as the undisputed factual allegations in the various affidavits when adjudicating the motion where no evidentiary hearing has been held.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Barde </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 61-62. Because an evidentiary hearing was not requested in this case by either party, we will accept, as the trial court should, all undisputed factual allegations for the purpose of determining whether the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tiffs have sustained their burden of proving that the court had personal jurisdiction over either or both of the defendants under the long arm statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">JURISDICTION OVER A FOREIGN CORPORATION</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court had several bases for finding that the long arm statutes were satisfied with respect to Viking.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the plaintiffs have proven that the court had jurisdiction over Viking under \u00a7 33-411 (c) (4), we do not address the other statutory jurisdictional provisions invoked by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 33-411 (c) (4), a foreign corporation is subject to suit in Connecticut if the cause of action in question arises \u201cout of tortious conduct [committed] in this state, whether arising out of repeated activity or single acts . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs alleged that the tortious conduct committed by Viking in Connecticut included intentional misrepresentations and fraudulent nondisclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The uncontroverted allegations in the complaint and the affidavits with respect to Viking\u2019s tortious conduct are as follows: After the plaintiffs indicated an interest in learning about Viking\u2019s business opportunities, they received numerous out-of-state communications from agents of Viking. According to these allegations, Viking not only offered to sell private pay telephones to the plaintiffs, but also promised to provide training, to assist in finding locations for installation, and to install the telephones. The promotional material sent by Viking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the plaintiffs, which was attached to their affidavit, supports the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. One promotional item, entitled \u201cViking Advantages,\u201d promised in regard to training: \u201cFull training and factory and back-up support to insure your total success at all levels of the industry.\u201d In regard to locations, the same item promised: \u201cHigh traffic locations, with long term contracts. All your locations will be with your approval.\u201d Additionally, a letter from Jan Kraft, an agent of Viking, states: \u201cYou will be hearing from our route coordinator to help you with your route development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Viking had failed to provide the training and location selection services promised and that none of the telephones had been installed. The plaintiffs also alleged that they had relied on Viking\u2019s representations about the services that Viking would provide and that these representations were false, and were known to have been false, when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In response, Viking, in the affidavit of Harris, merely stated: \u201cAs a matter of business <em>practice, </em>we do not provide location or installation services. However, if requested, we can provide a list of people in the industry who do provide such services.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, Viking never denied that its agents had made such fraudulent promises to the plaintiffs, but merely denied that it was its practice to provide the services allegedly promised.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">False representations entering Connecticut by wire or mail constitute tortious conduct in Connecticut under \u00a7 33-411 (c) (4). <em>Coan </em>v. <em>Bell Atlantic Systems Leasing International, Inc., </em>813 F. Sup. 929, 944-45 (D. Conn. 1990); <em>David </em>v. <em>Weitzman, </em>677 F. Sup. 95, 98 (D. Conn. 1987); <em>Teleco Oilfield Services, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>Skandia Ins. Co., </em>656 F. Sup. 753, 758 (D. Conn. 1987); <em>McFaddin </em>v. <em>National Executive Search, Inc., </em>354 F. Sup. 1166, 1171 (D. Conn. 1973). For example, in <em>Teleco Oilfield Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skandia Ins. Co., </em>supra, 756, the plaintiff brought an action alleging breach of an insurance contract and bad faith tortious acts arising from the failure to pay the plaintiffs claim by its insurers, which were several foreign corporations. The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut held, inter alia, that the defendant insurers\u2019 tortious conduct was deemed to have occurred in Connecticut, thereby providing the court with jurisdiction over the defendants under \u00a7 33-411 (c) (4), because \u201cthe alleged misrepresentations of coverage, both active and passive, would have been made by way of communications sent to and received by [the plaintiff] from the [out-of-state] defendants in Connecticut.\u201d Id., 758. Similarly, in the present case, based on the plaintiffs\u2019 undisputed allegations of misrepresentation by way of telephonic and postal communications sent to and received in Connecticut, Viking engaged in tortious conduct in this state, thereby satisfying \u00a7 33-411 (c) (4). We, therefore, hold that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 33-411 (c) (4) was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Consequently, the plaintiffs established, pursuant to \u00a7 33-411 (c) (4), that Connecticut\u2019s long arm statute was satisfied as to Viking. The case must, therefore, be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings to determine whether Viking had sufficient contacts with Connecticut so as to comport with due process and to resolve the other grounds for dismissal alleged in the defendants\u2019 motion, i.e., forum non conveniens and insufficient service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">JURISDICTION OVER A NONRESIDENT INDIVIDUAL</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The plaintiffs argue that, pursuant to \u00a7 52-59b (a) (3) (B), the trial court had jurisdiction over McClelland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>because he had committed \u201ca tortious act <em>outside the state </em>causing injury to person or property within the state . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Jurisdiction under subsection (a) (3) (B) has the additional requirement that the plaintiff prove that the individual defendant \u201cexpects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state <em>and </em>derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Even if we assume that McClelland is an agent vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of Viking,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the complaint and affidavits are devoid of any allegations from which it could be determined that McClelland derived substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce. Therefore, the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the court had personal jurisdiction over McClelland.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The judgment of dismissal with respect to Viking is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion; the judgment of dismissal with respect to McClelland is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-13\"> Against Viking, the plaintiffs alleged common law claims of breach of contract and fraud, in addition to violations of the Connecticut Business Opportunity Investment Act; General Statutes \u00a7 36b-60 et seq.; and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The plaintiffs also alleged that McClelland violated both of those acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-5\"> Although the record fails to indicate the state of its incorporation, Viking is neither incorporated in nor registered to do business in Connecticut. Rather, it has its principal place of business in Illinois. It is also undisputed that McClelland is a nonresident of Connecticut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 142 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny defendant wishing to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction, may do so even after having entered a general appearance, but must do so by filing a motion to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of an appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 143 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe motion to dismiss shall be used to assert ... (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) improper venue, (4) insufficiency of process, and (5) insufficiency of service of process. This motion shall always be filed with a supporting memorandum of law, and, where appropriate, with supporting affidavits as to facts not apparent on the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201cIf an adverse party objects to this motion he shall, at least five days before the motion is to be considered on the short calendar, file and serve in accordance with Sec. 120 a memorandum of law and, where appropriate, supporting affidavits as to facts not apparent on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Practice Book \u00a7 144 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny claim of lack of jurisdiction over the person or improper venue or insufficiency of process or insufficiency of service of process is waived if not raised by a motion to dismiss . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\"> We note that the defendants failed to file Harris\u2019 affidavit with their motion to dismiss as provided for in \u00a7 143. Rather, they submitted the affidavit more than one month later, after the plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum in opposition was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\"> In their affidavit, the defendants denied that they advertised by way of \u201ccard paks.\u201d Accordingly, we do not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding this matter in determining whether Connecticut\u2019s long arm statutes were satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b628-5\"> \u201cThe federal due process clause permits state courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident corporate [or individual] defendant that has certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">. . .A state court will have specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant whenever the defendant has purposefully directed [its] activities at residents of the forum . . . and the litigation [has] resulted] from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities ....

When jurisdiction is based on personal or abode service, the matters stated in the return, if true, confer jurisdiction. When jurisdiction is based on constructive service, jurisdiction cannot arise solely from the acts recited in the [officer\u2019s] return. . . . \u2019 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc.
