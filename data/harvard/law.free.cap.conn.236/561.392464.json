Patterson, has a constitutional right to a presentence investigation report (PSI) prior to being sentenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Court held that the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process because it had failed to order a PSI. <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>37 Conn. App. 801, 819-20, 658 A.2d 121 (1995). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that a criminal defendant does not have a federal constitutional right to a PSI and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">After an extended procedural history, this case is now before us for the second time. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 645 A.2d 535 (1994). The defendant was charged with possession of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> possession of marijuana with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and violation of probation, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>which he earlier had been sentenced based on a separate conviction also involving the sale of narcotics. After a jury trial, he was acquitted of the first charge and convicted of the second, and the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction and a judgment of revocation of probation. The defendant appealed from the judgments of conviction and revocation of probation to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgments. <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>31 Conn. App. 278, 624 A.2d 1146 (1993). Thereafter, the state petitioned for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court. We granted the petition limited to the issue of whether the judge in a criminal trial must be present in the courtroom during the entire jury voir dire. <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>227 Conn. 901, 630 A.2d 72 (1993). We reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court and remanded the case to that court for consideration of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims. <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 386-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">On remand, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had failed to follow procedural rules, including Practice Book \u00a7 910, in sentencing him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 803, 815. The Appellate Court agreed, and held that the trial court had violated the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to due process because it had failed to order a PSI. Id., 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Relying on the fact that a criminal defendant is entitled to due process during the sentencing stage, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>includes the right to effective assistance of counsel and the right not to be sentenced based on improper factors or erroneous information, and on the fact that a PSI is the principal method of furnishing information to the trial court during the sentencing stage, the Appellate Court concluded that a PSI is necessary to a meaningful right to counsel and, therefore, is required to secure the defendant\u2019s right to due process at sentencing. Id., 819-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The state petitioned for and was granted certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court. See footnote 2. While the petition was pending, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for permission to withdraw his appearance, because the defendant had fled the jurisdiction and his whereabouts were unknown. Subsequently, because of the substantial public interest at stake, we granted a motion filed by the Connecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers Association to appear as amicus curiae on behalf of the defendant and to file an amicus brief. We thereupon granted defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The following facts are undisputed. \u201cImmediately following the verdict, the trial court excused the jury and stated its intention to impose a sentence at that time. The defendant\u2019s counsel made an oral motion for a one week continuance \u2018for the defendant to get certain affairs in order\u2019 and in order \u2018to file motions.\u2019 Shortly after the court denied this motion, counsel reiterated his request asserting, \u2018I\u2019m going to ask again for a short continuance. If not a week, Your Honor, then a day or two so the defendant can get his life in order prior to being incarcerated.\u2019 \u201d Id., 817. Prior to imposing a sentence, however, the court asked defense counsel if he would like to be \u201cheard on [the] sentencing.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>response, in addition to his request for a short continuance, defense counsel requested leniency, noting that the defendant had several children for whom he cared, that there were no victims in this case, that no one was injured and that the quantity of narcotics involved in the conviction was small. Thereafter, the court sentenced the defendant to five years for the present conviction and eighteen months for the probation violation, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant has a constitutional right to a PSI under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that connection, the state argues that (1) the defendant\u2019s right to due process at sentencing does not include the right to a PSI, and (2) although a liberty interest may arise from state statutes and court rules, the defendant cannot prevail under this theory in light of the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>U.S. , 115 S. Ct. 2293, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1995), in which the court set forth the proper analysis for determining when such liberty interests arise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the alternative, the state claims that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>we were to hold that the defendant has a constitutional right to a PSI, he waived that right when defense counsel failed to object to the trial court\u2019s failure to order a PSI during the sentencing stage. Finally, the state claims that even if we were to hold that the defendant did not waive his right to a PSI, any error was harmless because the trial court, in determining the appropriate sentence, had before it virtually all of the information that would have been provided by a PSI. We agree with the state that the defendant does not have a constitutional right to a PSI and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\u201cThe fourteenth amendment provides, in part, \u2018nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . .\u2019 The interest at stake in the present proceeding is [the defendant\u2019s] liberty interest. There are two elements which must be established in order to find a due process violation. First, because not every liberty interest is protected, [the defendant] must establish that he has a liberty interest that comes within the ambit of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Hewitt </em>v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 466, 103 S. Ct. 864, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983); <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 223-24, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451, reh. denied, 429 U.S. 873, 97 S. Ct. 191, 50 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1976); <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 571, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972); <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 571, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979). If it is determined that a protected liberty is implicated, then the second element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that must be addressed is what procedural protections are \u2018due.\u2019 <em>Goss </em>v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 577, 95 S. Ct. 729, 42 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1975); <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 569-70; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972); see <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>189 Conn. 471, 477, 457 A.2d 290 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>190 Conn. 327, 336-37, 461 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 938, 104 S. Ct. 350, 78 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Due process analysis begins with the identification of the interests at stake. \u201cLiberty interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment may arise from two sources \u2014 the Due Process Clause itself and the laws of the States.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>224 Conn. 168, 182, 617 A.2d 889 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 919, 113 S. Ct. 2365, 124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993). The amicus claims that there are two liberty interests of which the defendant has been deprived without due process of law: (1) his liberty interest in the sentencing process; and (2) his liberty interest in a PSI that arises from Practice Book \u00a7 910. Our analysis, therefore, is bifurcated.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The state contends that the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s right to due process at sentencing includes the right to a PSI is not supported by the traditional due process balancing test. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 348-49, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). We agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>It is undisputed that the defendant possesses a liberty interest that is implicated during the sentencing process. In the present case, the Appellate Court based its decision on this interest and the due process rights emanating therefrom. \u201c[I]t is now clear that the sentencing process, as well as the trial itself, must satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause. Even though the defendant has no substantive right to a particular sentence within the range authorized by statute, the sentencing is a critical stage of the criminal proceeding at which he is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel. . . . The defendant has a legitimate interest in the character of the procedure which leads to the imposition of sentence even if he may have no right to object to a particular result of the sentencing process.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S. Ct. 1197, 51 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1977). \u201cAlthough a criminal defendant is entitled to due process of law at sentencing . . . the range of due process rights in sentencing procedures is not as extensive as that at trial. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246-47, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337, reh. denied, 337 U.S. 961, 69 S. Ct. 1529, 93 L. Ed. 1760 (1949); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>694 F.2d 200, 202-203 (9th Cir. 1982) [cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1118, 103 S. Ct. 3085, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1347 (1983)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>197 Conn. 67, 77, 495 A.2d 1054 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 818-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\u201c \u2018Generally, due process does not require that information considered by the trial judge prior to sentencing meet the same high procedural standard as evidence introduced at trial. Rather, judges may consider a wide variety of information. . . .\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robelo, </em>596 F.2d 868, 870 (9th Cir. 1979). Consistent with due process the trial court may consider responsible unsworn or out-of-court information relative to the circumstances of the crime and to the convicted person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>life and circumstance. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 584, 79 S. Ct. 421, 3 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1959). It is a fundamental sentencing principle that a sentencing judge may \u2018appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, and largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider or the source from which it may come.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446,92 S. Ct. 589,30 L. Ed. 2d 592 (1972). The trial court\u2019s discretion, however, is not completely unfettered. As a matter of due process, information may be considered as a basis for a sentence only if it has some minimal indicium of reliability. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baylin, </em>696 F.2d 1030, 1040 (3d Cir. 1982). As long as the sentencing judge has a reasonable, persuasive basis for relying on the information which he uses to fashion his ultimate sentence, an appellate court should not interfere with his discretion. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>684 F.2d 141, 154 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robelo, </em>supra <em>[870].\u201d State v. Huey, </em>199 Conn. 121, 127, 505 A.2d 1242 (1986). Although a \u201cdefendant is entitled to counsel at sentencing hearings and may not be sentenced on the basis of improper factors or erroneous information . . . the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions do not in all circumstances require a judge to hold hearings and give a convicted person an opportunity to participate in those hearings when determining the sentence to be imposed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">\u201cDue process analysis requires balancing the government\u2019s interest in existing procedures against the risk of erroneous deprivation of a private interest inherent in those procedures. <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 364, 542 A.2d 672 (1988). All that is necessary is that the procedures be tailored, in light of the decision to be made, to the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard ... to insure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that they are given a meaningful opportunity to present their case. Id., quoting <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>[supra, 424 U.S. 348-49]. Under this analysis, the court must consider three factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, [364,] quoting <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>supra, 335.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 661-62, 591 A.2d 101 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Applying this analysis to the present case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s right to due process at sentencing does not include the right to a PSI.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> First, the defendant possesses an obvious interest in receiving the shortest possible sentence. The court\u2019s provision of, or failure to provide, a PSI will affect this interest, although its effect will vary depending on whether the information in the PSI is favorable or unfavorable to the defendant. The amicus argues that the defendant also has an interest in fair and accurate sentencing, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>well as long-term collateral interests, which may be impacted by a PSI or the lack thereof. As the state correctly notes, however, if, as a result of a PSI, a court were likely to impose a sentence, which while fair and accurate nonetheless exceeds the sentence that it would otherwise impose, then it is clearly in the defendant\u2019s interest that the PSI not be generated. The effect that a PSI will have on the defendant\u2019s long-term interests depends on the particular circumstances and would tip the scale in favor of requiring a PSI only to the extent that it is favorable to the defendant. We conclude, therefore, that the first element of the due process balancing test is essentially neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The second element of the test involves consideration of the risks arising from the lack of a PSI and the probable value associated with providing a PSI. The primary risk associated with the lack of a PSI is the possibility that the sentence imposed will be based on unreliable and insufficient information. This risk is substantially minimized, however, by other constitutional safeguards. For example, a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing stage and a constitutional right not to be sentenced on the basis of improper factors or erroneous information. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thom</em>pson, supra, 197 Conn. 77-78. Presumably, effective defense counsel will present to the court all relevant mitigating material consistent with the defendant\u2019s best interests and will ensure that all information presented to the court by the state meets the standards of reliability and relevance applicable during sentencing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, in holding that there is a constitutional light to counsel at sentencing, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe necessity for the aid of counsel in mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>shaling the facts, introducing evidence of mitigating circumstances and in general aiding and assisting the defendant to present his case as to sentence is apparent.\u201d <em>Mempa </em>v. <em>Rhay, </em>389 U.S. 128, 135, 88 S. Ct. 254, 19 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1967). Similarly, the state, represented by the state\u2019s attorney, has an interest in presenting accurate aggravating material, which it can present to the court irrespective of the presence of a PSI. Thus, the presence of both counsel \u2014 for the defendant, and for the state \u2014 serves as an additional safeguard against the risk of a sentence imposed on the basis of unreliable and inaccurate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">We do not belittle the potential benefits of providing a PSI at sentencing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The \u201csole purpose [of a PSI] is to enable the court, within limits fixed by statute, to impose an appropriate penalty, fitting the offender as well as the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Gullette, </em>3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 153, 167, 209 A.2d 529 (1964). The primary value of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>PSI stems from the information contained, therein, not from the report itself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Most of this information can be brought to the trial court\u2019s attention by either party by means other than a PSI. In fact, in the present case, without the aid of a PSI, the trial court had knowledge of the circumstances of the offense because: (1) the trial had just been completed; (2) the court had access to a PSI from the prior year, which was generated in connection with a separate charge and contained information regarding the defendant\u2019s criminal record and social history; and (3) the court was presented with information by defense counsel regarding the defendant\u2019s present condition. Moreover, because the crime involved was the sale of narcotics, there was no identifiable victim to interview. All of this information was available to the trial court and could have been supplemented by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The amicus argues that a PSI is one of the few safeguards available to a defendant to decrease the risk of unfairness at sentencing arising out of the court\u2019s broad discretion and the informal procedural rules applicable during the sentencing stage. Courts, however, are afforded equally broad discretion in imposing a sentence when a PSI has been provided, the contents of which are governed by equally informal evidentiary rules. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>147 Conn. 125, 128, 157 A.2d 594 (1960). Thus, we are not persuaded that mandating the availability of a PSI as a constitutional prerequisite to a valid sentence will abate these concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Finally, we consider the third element of the balancing test, namely, the governmental interests affected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>It is undisputed that the government has an interest in fair and accurate sentencing, which, arguably, is served by ordering a PSI. See footnote 12. In the absence of a PSI, however, this interest can be adequately protected by both parties, whose own interests will provide an incentive to present all information that they consider relevant to a fair and accurate sentence. Conversely, the state would bear a substantial burden if required, as a matter of due process, to provide all convicted defendants with a PSI. The amicus argues that, as a practical matter, the increased burden on the government would be minimal because a PSI is routinely ordered unless waived by the defendant. Presently, however, a PSI is not required for all convicted criminals. See footnote 1. Thus, to require the government to provide a PSI for all defendants convicted of crimes for which the penalty may involve a loss of liberty would significantly increase its burden. We conclude, therefore, that the due process clause does not require that all criminal defendants be provided with a PSI at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">In addition to the liberty interest inherently at stake during sentencing, the amicus claims that the defendant has a special liberty interest in a PSI created by Practice Book \u00a7 910. Relying on <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>supra, 459 U.S. 472, the amicus argues that \u00a7 910, by virtue of its mandatory language, gives rise to a protected liberty interest in a PSI. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\"><em>In Hewitt v. Helms, </em>supra, 459 U.S. 471-72, the United States Supreme Court held that while there is not an inherent constitutionally protected liberty interest in remaining free from administrative segregation while incarcerated, a state can create such an interest through prison regulations, which explicitly require the satisfaction of certain substantive predicates prior to the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>of administrative segregation and, as a result, remove discretion from official decision making in that area. The United States Supreme Court, however, recently has clarified the federal constitutional approach to determining when a state created liberty interest arises, where one does not otherwise exist. See <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 115 S. Ct. 2300 n.5; see also <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Dupnik, </em>67 F.3d 216, 221 (9th Cir. 1995) (\u201c[United States] Supreme Court has since adopted a new approach to determining when prison regulations create a liberty interest\u201d). Our analysis, therefore, is controlled by <em>Sandin.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 115 S. Ct. 2295, the defendant had been incarcerated at a maximum security prison. During a strip search he became abusive to prison officials and, as a result, was charged with misconduct. Id., 2296. After a hearing before an adjustment committee, he was found guilty and sentenced to disciplinary segregation. Id. Subsequently the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>sought administrative review of the committee\u2019s decision and brought suit in the United States District Court, claiming that he had been deprived of his liberty interest in remaining free from administrative segregation without procedural due process because he was not allowed to present witnesses at the hearing. Id. The District Court granted the prison officials\u2019 motion for summary judgment and the defendant appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Sakai, </em>15 F.3d 1463 (9th Cir. 1993). The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court, concluding that a prison regulation requiring officials to find guilt when a charge of misconduct is supported by substantial evidence created a nondiscretionary duty that, by negative implication, also required that they not find guilt unless a charge is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 2296-97. Relying on <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974), and its progeny, the Court of Appeals held that this nondiscretionary duty created a liberty interest, of which the defendant could not be deprived without due process.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 2296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Upon review by the United States Supreme Court, however, that court held that the defendant\u2019s segregation was not the type of deprivation in which a state might conceivably create a liberty interest, and reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Id., 2301. The United States Supreme Court began its analysis by sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>marizing and criticizing the attenuated development of the <em>Hewitt </em>approach. \u201cShortly after <em>Meachum </em>[v. <em>Fano, </em>supra, 427 U.S. 226-27], the Court embarked on a different approach to defining state-created liberty interests. Because dictum in <em>Meachum </em>distinguished <em>Wolff </em>by focusing on whether state action was mandatory or discretionary, the Court in later cases laid ever greater emphasis on this somewhat mechanical dichotomy. <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Inmates of Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1979), foreshadowed the methodology that would come to full fruition in <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>[supra, 459 U.S. 460], . . . The Court made explicit in <em>Hewitt </em>what was implicit in <em>Greenholtz. . . . </em>Instead of looking to whether the State created an interest of real substance comparable to the good time credit scheme of <em>Wolff, </em>the Court asked whether the State had gone beyond issuing mere procedural guidelines and had used language of an unmistakably mandatory character such that the incursion on liberty would not occur absent specified substantive predicates. Id., [471-72]. Finding such mandatory directives in the regulations before it, the Court decided that the State had created a protected liberty interest. ... As this methodology took hold, no longer did inmates need to rely on a showing that they had suffered a grievous loss of liberty retained even after sentenced to terms of imprisonment. . . . For the Court had ceased to examine the nature of the interest with respect to interests allegedly created by the State. ... By shifting the focus of the liberty interest inquiry to one based on the language of a particular regulation, and not the nature of the deprivation, the Court encouraged prisoners to comb regulations in search of mandatory language on which to base entitlements to various state-conferred privileges.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 115 S. Ct. 2298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Following this summary, the court stated that \u201c[i]n light of the above discussion, we believe that the search for a negative implication from mandatoiy language in prisoner regulations has strayed from the real concerns undergirding the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. The time has come to return to the due process principles we believe were correctly established and applied in <em>Wolff </em>and <em>Meachum. </em>Following <em>Wolff, </em>we recognize that States may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause. See also <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>482 U.S. 369, 107 S. Ct. 2415, 96 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1987). But these interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force . . . nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d (Citations omitted.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 115 S. Ct. 2300. The test in <em>Hewitt, </em>which the court characterized as a determination of \u201cwhether the State [has] gone beyond issuing mere procedural guidelines and [has] used \u2018language of an unmistakably mandatory character\u2019 such that the incursion on liberty would not occur \u2018absent specified substantive predicates\u2019 id., 2298; failed to emphasize the nature of the incursion. Id. For this reason, the court modified the <em>Hewitt </em>test to require that the deprivation be of a significant and atypical nature. Id., 2300.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The amicus argues that Practice Book \u00a7 910 satisfies the modified <em>Hewitt </em>test because it removes the trial court\u2019s discretion about whether to order a PSI, and thereby limits official discretion in decision making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>affecting a fundamental liberty interest. We disagree. Although \u00a7 910 contains mandatory language requiring a court to order a PSI when a person is convicted of a noncapital felony and, therefore, removes the court\u2019s discretion with respect to ordering a PSI, it does not confine the comb\u2019s discretion with respect to the only liberty interest at stake, namely, the defendant\u2019s interest in receiving the shortest possible sentence. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 910 does not create a protected liberty interest in a PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Ordinarily, we would, following our conclusion that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, remand the case to the Appellate Court for a determination of the other claims originally raised by the defendant in that court. In this case, however, the defendant has fled the jurisdiction and has, therefore, disentitled himself to the benefit of appellate review of his conviction.

The amicus argues, however, in what is essentially an alternative ground for affirmance, that Practice Book \u00a7 910 creates a constitutionally protected liberty interest in a PSI, where one did not otherwise exist. Furthermore, the amicus contends that even if we were to conclude that the defendant has a liberty interest in a PSI, in the present case, he was deprived of that interest without due process of law.

Because the Appellate Court\u2019s decision was rooted in the defendant\u2019s right to counsel at sentencing, the due process rights emanating therefrom necessarily would have to extend to all criminal proceedings to which the right to counsel attaches, which include prosecutions for any crime, including a misdemeanor, for which the penalty may involve the loss of liberty.

On the contrary, numerous courts have held that the defendant does not have a constitutional right to a PSI. See, e.g., <em>Katz </em>v. <em>King, </em>627 F.2d 568, 576 (1st Cir. 1980) (failure to use PSI is not of constitutional dimensions); <em>Howard v.

We disagree. Although the court in <em>Sandin </em>addressed these concerns, it emphatically criticized and abandoned the <em>Hewitt </em>approach on which the amicus relies, and did not limit its modification of the <em>Hewitt </em>analysis to prison regulation cases, as suggested by the amicus. <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 115 S. Ct. 2300 n.5. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has applied the <em>Savdin-Hewitt </em>analysis only within the context of prisoner claims; cf. id., 2300 (interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint); <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>supra, 459 U.S. 472 (confinement to administrative segregation); <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Inmates of Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S.

We assume, without deciding, that the <em>Sandin-IIewitt </em>analysis will apply in the sentencing context and, therefore, that a statute or rule containing mandatory language, such as Practice Book \u00a7 910, may give rise to aprotected liberty interest, during the sentencing process that otherwise would not exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\"> A finding of guilt was punishable by disciplinary segregation. <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 115 S.

Although I concur in the result, on the facts of this case, I would not reach the important constitutional issue of whether a criminal defendant has a right to a presentence investigation report at sentencing.

Id. It is important, not only from the perspective of the defendant whose liberty is at stake, but also from the vantage point of the state, which represents the public\u2019s interest, that the sentencing judge have before him or her all the information regarding the defendant that is necessary to make an informed decision.

Not only was the sentencing court well informed as to the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s immediate offense because it had presided over the trial itself, but the court also had access to a comprehensive presentence report that was prepared one year earlier concerning the defendant\u2019s criminal record and social history. That information, which was relatively current, adequately substituted for the presentence investigation report that the court should have ordered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
