We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiff, the Gay and Lesbian Law Students Association at the University of Connecticut School of Law, an unincorporated student organization that has as its primary objective the promotion of the needs of gay and lesbian students at the law school, brought an action against the defendants, the board of trustees of the University of Connecticut, the president of the university, Harry J. Hartley, and the dean of the law school, Hugh C. MacGill. The plaintiff alleged that by allowing the Judge Advocate General Corps of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines to recruit at the law school, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the defendants had violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81a through 46a-81r (Gay Rights Law)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 10a-149a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and had breached their contract with the law school\u2019s students, based upon the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>school\u2019s internal nondiscrimination policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought an injunction barring the use of law school facilities and the career services office by any organization, including the military, that discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation and a declaratory judgment declaring that the defendants had violated both the Gay Rights Law and \u00a7 10a-149a.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff filed an application for a temporary injunction to prevent an anticipated recruiting visit by the Judge Advocate General Corps to the law school campus. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss claiming, inter alia, that the plaintiff was not aggrieved and that it lacked standing to pursue the action. The trial court denied that motion. The parties then filed a stipulation of facts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following an evidentiary hearing on the temporary injunction, at which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>stipulation was introduced into evidence, the trial court concluded that, although all employers who used the school\u2019s career services office were required to abide by the law school\u2019s nondiscrimination policy, which forbids, inter alia, discrimination in employment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>basis of sexual preference, the defendants, nevertheless, knowingly permitted and even assisted branches of the United States military to recruit and interview at the law school despite the military\u2019s open policy of discrimination against gay men and lesbians. Because \u00a7 10a-149a only requires the defendants to provide the same opportunities to the military that it affords other employers, the trial court concluded that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated the Gay Rights Law. Accordingly, the trial court issued a temporary injunction barring the defendants from permitting any organization, including the military, that discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation from using on-campus employment recruiting facilities or other employment services of the law school and its office of career services.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Following the issuance of a temporary injunction, the parties agreed that the hearing and record from the temporary injunction could be consolidated with the final hearing and record on a permanent injunction. As such, the only remaining issue for the court to consider prior to issuing a permanent injunction was whether the United States military continued to discriminate against gay men and lesbians. On the basis of its finding that, pursuant to the revised United States Department of Defense policy on gays in the military, the military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>continued to discriminate against gay men and lesbians, the trial court issued a permanent injunction identical to the earlier temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The defendants appealed this ruling to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). They claim on appeal that: (1) the trial court lacked jurisdiction over this case in the absence of notice under Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) the plaintiff did not have standing to bring this action; (3) the plaintiff was not aggrieved by the defendants\u2019 actions; and (4) \u00a7 10a-149a overrides the law school\u2019s obligations under the Gay Rights Law. The defendants do not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that the military continues to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The defendants argue that because the plaintiff failed to comply with \u00a7 390 (d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in that it failed to notify the military of the pending action, the trial court was without jurisdiction to enter an injunction. The defendants recognize that, on its face, \u00a7 390 (d) applies only to a claim for a declaratory judgment and that the trial court did not grant a declaratory judgment. They argue, nevertheless, in reliance on <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>232 Conn. 27, 35, 653 A.2d 168 (1995), that because the plaintiffs claims for injunctive and declaratory relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>depended upon the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 10a-149a, the claims were \u201cinexorably intertwined.\u201d Accordingly, the plaintiff should have notified the military of this action, and its failure to do so deprived the trial court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The plaintiff responds that \u00a7 390 (d) is inapplicable because it never pursued its claim for declaratory relief, and the trial court never considered or ruled on that claim. Rather, the trial court issued an injunction pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-99,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which statutorily authorizes a trial court to issue an injunction where General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81i or General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81j has been violated. Finally, the plaintiff contends that the affected branches of the military had actual notice of this case since 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We agree with the plaintiff that \u00a7 46a-99 is the controlling provision in this case. Furthermore, we conclude that \u00a7 46a-99 does not contain a notice requirement and that the procedural requirement of \u00a7 390 (d) should not be grafted onto this section. In enacting \u00a7 46a-99, the legislature has provided a mechanism to ensure that discrimination is eradicated. Had it intended there to be any particular additional procedural conditions, such as a notice requirement, the legislature could have included them. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-45a through 52-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Moreover, the defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 27, is misplaced. In that case, in concluding that \u00a7 390 (d) applied, this court explicitly recognized that the trial court had, in fact, considered and decided the declaratory relief claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201cNeither the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision nor the judgment file indicates that the declaratory judgment aspect of this case was not determined by the trial court.\u201d Id., 31. In the present case, the trial court never mentioned declaratory relief in any of its decisions, and, in its final judgment, the court specifically ordered a permanent injunction as its sole remedy. Consequently, <em>Mannweiler </em>does not dictate that the notice requirements of \u00a7 390 (d) control in this case. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs failure to comply with \u00a7 390 (d) did not adversely impact the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to issue a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In their second procedural claim, the defendants argue that the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had associational standing to bring this action was improper. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u201cThe fundamental aspect of standing ... [is that] it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before [the] court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated. <em>Flast </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 99, 88 S. Ct. 1942, 20 L. Ed. 2d 947 [1968]. <em>Hartford Kosher Caterers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gazda, </em>165 Conn. 478, 485, 338 A.2d 497 (1973). Standing is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court .... Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. See, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962); <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>165 Conn. 190, 192, 332 A.2d 78 (1973). <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 320-21, 439 A.2d 349 (1981). The requirements of justiciability and controversy are ordinarily held to have been met when a complainant makes a colorable claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. <em>[Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>supra, 321]. As long as there is some direct injury for which the plaintiff seeks redress, the injury that is alleged need not be great. Id.; see <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Desmond, </em>140 Conn. 426, 432, 101 A.2d 294 (1953). Where the nexus between the injury and the claim sought to be adjudicated is obvious and direct, a plaintiff has standing to maintain the claim. <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>supra, 322.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Health Care Facilities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worrell, </em>199 Conn. 609, 612-13, 508 A.2d 743 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">When deciding whether an association has standing to bring a claim, we have adopted the federal standard of associational standing as set forth in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, </em>432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S. Ct. 2434, 53 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1977). \u201c[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. Id.; see <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 40, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 48 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1976); <em>California Bankers Assn. </em>v. <em>Shultz, </em>416 U.S. 21, 94 S. Ct. 1494, 39 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1974); <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 739, 92 S. Ct. 1361, 31 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1972). Representational standing depends in substantial measure on the nature of the relief sought. If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually injured. <em>Warth </em>v. <em>Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 515, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>necticut Assn. of Health Care Facilities, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worrell, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 616; accord <em>Windham Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>234 Conn. 513, 527, 662 A. 2d 1281 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The plaintiff argues that it has sustained its burden of proof and has satisfied this test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendants challenge only the first prong of the test. They rely on <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992), wherein the United States Supreme Court set forth a three part test to determine individual standing. First, a plaintiff must demonstrate an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d that is, an invasion of a legally protected interest that is \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \u201cactual or imminent\u201d rather than \u201cconjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Id. Second, there must be a causal connection between the defendants\u2019 conduct and the alleged injury. The injury must be \u201cfairly . . . trace [able] to the challenged action of the defendants], and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Third, the alleged injury will \u201clikely,\u201d rather than \u201cspeculatively,\u201d be \u201credressed by a favorable decision.\u201d Id., 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The defendants argue that the plaintiff has not satisfied this test because of its failure to allege that any of its members had been denied an interview with the Judge Advocate General Corps or that any member had been denied a service of the law school\u2019s office of career services. The plaintiff responds that, assuming <em>Lujan </em>governs this court\u2019s standing analysis,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it meets the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>standing requirements recited in that case. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff had standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">This court has had many opportunities to determine what constitutes standing. \u201cStanding is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy. . . . <em>Unisys Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor, </em>220 Conn. 689, 693, 600 A.2d 1019 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Presidential Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>231 Conn. 500, 504, 652 A.2d 489 (1994). \u201cStanding requires no more than a colorable claim of injury; a plaintiff ordinarily establishes his standing by <em>allegations </em>of injury. Similarly, standing exists to attempt to vindicate \u2018arguably\u2019 protected interests. <em>Ducharme </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>161 Conn. 135, 139, 285 A.2d 318 (1971); see also <em>Assn. of Data Processing Service Organizations </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S. Ct. 827, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1970).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 321 n.6.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The infringement of the rights of the plaintiffs members under the Gay Rights Law was concrete and particularized as well as actual and imminent. The members had been denied equal placement opportunities because the career services office had allocated resources to the military, which would not, regardless of their abilities and talents, hire them. The director of the office of career services, Diane Pandera, admitted that the office allocates resources to military employers and spends time accommodating the military, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>arranging for and following up on on-campus interviews. That conduct has created a lack of equal access to the office of career services and has caused some of the plaintiffs members to reevaluate their approaches to the career services department. Moreover, by allowing the military to use the services of the placement office and to conduct on-campus interviews, the defendants sanctioned impermissible discrimination that caused the plaintiffs members to have feelings of shock, anger, humiliation, frustration and helplessness.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, the violation of the members\u2019 rights under the Gay Rights Law was continuing and, at the time of the temporary injunction hearing, was about to increase upon the arrival of military recruiters to conduct interviews. By permanently enjoining on-campus recruiting by the military, the trial court secured the members\u2019 rights under the Gay Rights Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">This case is a far cry from the attenuated claim in <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of </em>Wildlife, supra, 504 U.S. 555, upon which the defendants exclusively rely. Therein, the subject association claimed standing because two of its members who planned to travel abroad in the future would have their ability to view certain wildlife jeopardized as a result of a restrictive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 limiting its applicability to the United States and the high seas. Id., 559, 562-63. In contrast, the plaintiffs members in this case are not merely members of the general public who have failed to demonstrate how they have been harmed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>some unique way. Cf. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Horwitch, </em>215 Conn. 469, 473, 576 A.2d 1280 (1990) (because plaintiff is \u201csimply a member of the general public who has not demonstrated how she was harmed in a unique fashion,\u201d she is not aggrieved). Accordingly, because the plaintiffs members would have otherwise had standing to sue in their own right, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had standing to bring this action was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In the third issue on appeal, the defendants argue that because the plaintiff was not aggrieved by the law school\u2019s decision to allow the military to use the placement and career services facilities to recruit on campus, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because aggrievement is a predicate to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, it must be resolved in the plaintiffs favor in order for this court to proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u201cThe [fundamental] test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest shared by the community as a whole; second, the party claiming aggrievement must establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 502, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986) [superseded on other grounds by <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 518 A.2d 49 (1986)]; <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>1378 </em>v. <em>[Freedom of Information Commission, </em>191 Conn. 173, 176, 463 A.2d 613 (1983)]; <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 493, 400 A.2d 726 (1978).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Windham Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The defendants claim that although the plaintiff may indeed have intense feelings regarding the military recruiting on campus despite its discriminatory practices, \u201c \u2018[a] mere grievance to one\u2019s sense of propriety or sense of justice\u2019 \u201d does not equate with legal aggrievement. They claim that the plaintiff must have members who actually desire a military career and were denied an interview with a branch of the military service in order to be aggrieved. Additionally, they assert that the plaintiffs alleged injury is the result of the policies of the Department of Defense and not the defendants\u2019 conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The defendants\u2019 arguments ignore the facts that the trial court reasonably found. Specifically, the trial court found that the \u201cassistance in securing employment is one of the most important services that the law school provides\u201d and that by allowing an organization that discriminates against gay and lesbian students to use its facilities and services, the law school contributed to such students having \u201cfewer placement opportunities than heterosexual students.\u201d This lack of equal access to professional and educational benefits as a result of the defendants\u2019 conduct, as well as the stigma and humiliation created by the inequities, constituted injuries sufficient to satisfy the aggrievement threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The defendants\u2019 argument that, because the plaintiff has not demonstrated that one of its members was denied an interview with the military, there can be no aggrievement is misplaced. The relevant question is not whether one of the plaintiffs members wants to join the military; rather, the relevant question is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the members are receiving the same placement opportunities as heterosexual students. Furthermore, the defendants\u2019 suggestion that the plaintiffs complaint is really against the military and not the school mischaracterizes the problem. An action pursuant to \u00a7 46a-99 is directed at discrimination by state agencies, such as the University of Connecticut, and not federal departments.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Having disposed of the defendants\u2019 arguments, we conclude that the plaintiff has been aggrieved by the defendants\u2019 conduct. The legislature has provided an unequivocal prohibition on any state agency from becoming \u201ca party to any agreement, arrangement or plan which has the effect of sanctioning discrimination.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81i (b). In unambiguous language contained in that same subsection, the legislature has also made it clear that \u201c[n]o state facility may be used in the furtherance of any discrimination.\u201d By providing its facilities for on-campus interviews by a discriminatory employer, and by participating in the arrangement and scheduling of these interviews on behalf of such an employer, the law school, and not the military, has knowingly violated the specific provisions of the Gay Rights Law. The plaintiff is not asserting some generalized grievance shared by every citizen. The Gay Rights Law protects the plaintiffs members, citizens who are gay men or lesbians and who have been the subject of discrimination as a result of their sexual preferences. As members of the very class protected by the Gay Rights Law, who seek protection by the act from the very harms they allege to have experienced, the plaintiffs members have the greatest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>legal interest in the enforcement of the statutory prohibitions and are clearly distinguishable from the community at large. Furthermore, those members have been specially and injuriously affected by the decision of the law school to permit on-campus recruiting activities by the military because this decision has violated their rights to be protected from discrimination under the Gay Rights Law. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff has established that it was aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The last issue that we address involves interpreting \u00a7 10a-149a in order to determine whether this provision requires that the law school afford military recruiters access to the school.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After considering the language of the statute and its legislative history and purpose, the trial court concluded that because \u00a7 10a-149a requires that the law school treat military and nonmilitary recruiters alike and because the law school must ban nonmilitary recruiters who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, the law school must similarly ban all military recruiters. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The plaintiff argues on appeal that the language of the statute clearly provides that the law school is to \u201cprovide the <em>same </em>directory information and on-campus recruiting opportunities to representatives of the armed forces of the United States of America and state armed services as are offered to nonmilitary recruiters or commercial concerns.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 10a-149a. The plaintiff interprets this language to mean that military and nonmilitary recruiters are to be afforded equal, identical recruiting opportunities. Therefore, because the law school cannot permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>a civilian employer who discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation to recruit on campus, it cannot allow the military to recruit on campus. Furthermore, the plaintiff claims that the legislative history of this statute supports its position in that there was overwhelming sentiment among the senators and the representatives and those who testified at legislative committee hearings that \u00a7 10a-149a sought merely to provide equal access to military and nonmilitary recruiters and not preferential access to the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In contrast, the defendants, who similarly agree that the language is plain and unambiguous, focus on the firstphrase of \u00a7 10a-149a that provides \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary\u201d to conclude that the statute mandates that military recruiters be afforded the same recruiting opportunities as civilian recruiters, regardless of any contrary laws, such as anti-discrimination laws, and that any conflict between \u00a7 10a-149a and any other law \u201cmust be resolved in favor of requiring access by military recruiters.\u201d Therefore, according to the defendants, the law school must permit the military to recruit on campus, even though this would result in the school violating \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81i and 46a-81j.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, the defendants argue that because the language of the statute is clear, the trial court should not have considered the statute\u2019s legislative history, which, the defendants claim, is nonetheless inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In order to determine whether the law school must deny the military access to on-campus recruiting opportunities, we must construe \u00a7 10a-149a. \u201cIt is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>234 Conn. 35, 45, 660 A.2d 850 (1995); accord <em>LoPresto </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 424, 447, 662 A.2d 738 (1995). Our examination of the language, legislative history and purpose of \u00a7 10a-149a leads us to conclude that the plaintiff provides the more sound interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Solely on the basis of the statute\u2019s plain language, we agree with the plaintiff that the statute clearly requires that the law school must provide military employers with the \u201csame\u201d recruitment opportunities as civilian employers. This necessarily means that military and civilian employers must be treated equally, with the same benefits and under the same limitations. Accordingly, because the law school can permit only a civilian employer that does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation to recruit on campus, it must permit the military similarly to recruit only if it does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The defendants\u2019 interpretation would result in the military and civilian employers not receiving the same treatment because the military would be permitted to discriminate and would reap the benefits of recruiting. Therefore, the ability to recruit by the military would create additional privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Furthermore, we reject the defendants\u2019 construction of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause. At the outset, we note that we have long held that provisos and exceptions to statutes are to be strictly construed with doubts resolved in favor of the general rule rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>exception and that \u201cthose who claim the benefit of an exception under a statute have the burden of proving that they come within the limited class for whose benefit it was established.\u201d <em>Conservation Commission </em>v. <em>Price, </em>193 Conn. 414, 424, 479 A.2d 187 (1984); accord <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 549, 441 A.2d 30 (1981); see 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992) \u00a7\u00a7 47.08 and 47.11. The defendants have failed to prove that this proviso means that the military should be permitted to recruit on campus in spite of the fact that it discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation and the fact that such recruitment would violate \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81i and 46a-81j.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The defendants maintain that, at the time \u00a7 10a-149a was enacted in 1984, discrimination by state agencies on the basis of gender, disability and age was prohibited by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-71 and 46a-72. The military, however, openly discriminated on these bases, as it continues to do today. The defendants argue that because the military was then permitted to recruit on the law school\u2019s campus pursuant to \u00a7 10a-149a notwithstanding these other protecting statutes,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it should similarly be permitted to recruit now even though it violates the Gay Rights Law. We disagree. There is no indication in the language of the statute or in its legislative history that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause refers to these statutes. See footnote 20. Rather, strictly construing the plain language of \u00a7 10a-149a, we discern that \u201cany other provisions] of law to the contrary\u201d to which the statute refers are those that are contrary to the substance of this law, in specific, those statutes that would deny the military the same directory and recruiting opportunities as are provided to private employers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Antidiscrimination statutes do not explicitly prohibit such access to the military. It is only by applying these statutes to the military in light of its practices and policies that these statutes are arguably \u201cto the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Furthermore, the legislative histoiy of the exemption in the Gay Rights Law for the Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (ROTC); General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81q; confirms our conclusion that the legislature did not consider the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d proviso in \u00a7 10a-149a to refer to the anti-discrimination statutes in effect when \u00a7 10a-149a was passed, namely, \u00a7\u00a7 46a-71 and 46a-72. When, in 1991, the legislature added the ROTC exemption by enacting No. 91-58 of the 1991 Public Acts explicitly excusing the ROTC from complying with the Gay Rights Law, it expressed concern that without the exemption, all ROTC programs in the state would be eliminated. In other words, it considered that because the military discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, the ROTC would be in violation of the Gay Rights Law and that such violation would preclude the ROTC\u2019s presence on campus. See 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1991 Sess., pp. 2666-67. This specific exemption was essential to save the program. Id. The legislature, however, had not previously expressed and did not then express any concerns that the military, in general, or the ROTC, in specific, had been in violation of the other antidiscrimination statutes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because the legislature did not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ceive that the military had been in violation of these statutes, military and nonmilitary employers were not being treated differently. Therefore, because these statutes were not considered by the legislature to be provisions of law by which the military receives different treatment from nonmilitary employers, these statutes could not have been the \u201cprovision[s] of law to the contrary\u201d referred to in \u00a7 10a-149a. Accordingly, we reject the defendants\u2019 construction of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In further support of our conclusion that the legislature intended schools to bar <em>any </em>employer that violates the Gay Rights Law from recruiting on campus, we consider the tenet of statutory construction referred to as expressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is, which may be translated as \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 211 (1974). \u201c[Wjhere express exceptions are made, the legal presumption is that the legislature did not intend to save other cases from the operation of the statute.\u201d 73 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 316; see <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 254, 258, 608 A.2d 1174 (1992); <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 200, 585 A.2d 96 (1991). Thus, by exempting only the ROTC from the Gay Rights Law, the presumption is that the legislature did not intend to excuse the law school from complying with the Gay Rights Law by assisting the military in its recruitment activities. Had the legislature wanted to excuse state schools from complying with the Gay Rights Law, it could have included such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The legislative history and purpose of the statute confirms our conclusion that to allow the military to recruit would afford the military preferential treatment in violation of \u00a7 10a-149a. Number 83-576 of the 1983 Public Acts, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 10a-87, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>enacted in response to the University of Connecticut\u2019s board of trustees\u2019 decision to ban completely from the university all military recruiters. That public act provided an unconditional right of access to state schools for military recruiters.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, under \u00a7 10a-87, the law school was required to provide access to military recruiters under all circumstances. Interestingly, however, the legislative history indicates that such unconditional access was not the goal of that statute. Senator Thomas Scott stated that the underlying goal was to \u201cban [state universities] from banning military recruiters and military recruiters ought to in turn be treated like anybody from a corporation or anybody else who wishes to come to a campus and talk to students about job opportunities . . . .\u201d 26 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., p. 4530. Section 10a-87 was repealed by No. 84-87 of the 1984 Public Acts, codified at \u00a7 10a-149a. In contrast to Public Act 83-576, the current statute explicitly limits the access of military recruiters by requiring that military recruiters be provided with only the same access as nonmilitary recruiters and, therefore, more accurately reflects the legislative intent embodied in the legislative history of the 1983 and 1984 acts. The previous unconditional access was abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Furthermore, it is unequivocally clear from the Senate and House of Representatives floor debates and the legislative committee hearing testimony<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>purpose of this statute is to provide equal access to military and civilian recruiters. Preferential access and treatment to the military is plainly rejected. Representative Dorothy C. Goodwin described the bill as \u201ca nondiscrimination bill which says that recruiters for the armed services will be treated <em>on exactly the same basis with no exceptions </em>as any other job recruiter on any high school or college campus in the state . . . [and that the purpose of the bill is] to make sure that the armed forces of the United States are <em>not either handicapped or advantaged in any way </em>in the recruitment process.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1984 Sess., p. 964. Senator Steven C. Casey stated that the bill would require that the military be afforded \u201cthe same . . . on-campus recruiting opportunities\u201d that are provided to other recruiters. 27 S. Proc., Pt. 3,1984 Sess., p. 1131. Furthermore, Joseph Constantine, the coordinator of guidance and health for the Hartford public school system at the time of the enactment of \u00a7 10a-149a, stated that the purpose of the bill \u201cis simply to provide equity . . . equal access to the military . . . .\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Education, Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., p. 369. Significantly, Major Louis Wein of the United States Marine Corps Reserve stated that this bill would ensure \u201cthat military recruiters are given equal access, <em>not preferential access, </em>but equal access to schools. The same access that a school would provide to another business or an educational institution. . . . [He further stressed] that <em>this is not a preferential bill. </em>This is an equal access bill.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., pp. 404-405. Stanley Pac, then commissioner of environmental protection, speaking as a private citizen, indicated that \u201cthis bill would give the military recruiters the same rights that other recruiters have on campus . . . .\u201d Id., p. 411. Lastly, Major George Messier, then commanding officer of the Marine Corps recruiting station in Hartford, responded in the affirmative to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>question that \u201cthis [bill] would be only to insure equity, fairness?\u201d Id., p. 415. Because the defendants are asking us to grant the military preferential access, in that military recruiters would be allowed to use the law school\u2019s services and facilities in spite of the fact that .the military discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, while a civilian employer who discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation would be denied such access, we reject their argument.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We are further persuaded by the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 recent interpretation of New York Education Law \u00a7 2-a (McKinney 1988), enacted in 1984, which is similar to \u00a7 10a-149a. <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Grella, </em>83 N.Y.2d 537, 634 N.E.2d 171, 611 N.Y.S.2d 799 (1994). Section 2-a provides that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if a . . . board of education . . . permits access to . . . school property to persons who inform pupils of educational, occupational or career opportunities, such . . . board . . . shall provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>access to . . . such school property <em>on the same basis </em>for official representatives [of the military] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Lloyd, </em>the plaintiff argued that \u00a7 2-a invalidated the city of Rochester school board\u2019s resolution adopted in 1991, which, in effect, denied on-campus access to the military because of its discriminatory practices.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id., 542. The New York Court of Appeals disagreed because it concluded that \u00a7 2-a is clearly an \u201cequal access\u201d statute. Id., 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The court reasoned that \u00a7 2-a \u201cwas enacted to overcome the [wholesale] discriminatory exclusion of the military from schools for recruitment purposes.\u201d Id., 542. The statute does not, however, mandate unqualified or preferential military access; rather, it \u201cspecially protects military recruiters by granting them equal access.\u201d Id., 544. Consequently, the court rejected the plaintiffs construction, which \u201cwould grant the military unenacted and unintended universal access . . . which would give undue preference to military recruitment . . . .\u201d Id., 545. Therefore, the court concluded that because the board\u2019s resolution would forbid on-campus recruiting access to a nonmilitary employer who discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, to effectuate the statute and provide the military with access \u201con the same basis,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the military must similarly be banned.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Id., 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Any unresolved questions as to the interpretation of \u00a7 10a-149a are answered by an examination of the public policy involved in this case. Speaking in favor of the Gay Rights Law, Senator George Jepsen aptly described the need for such protective legislation. \u201cI speak in favor of this bill because it addresses discrimination on the basis of status, not specific acts, because such discrimination is widespread, even systematic in our society, because sexual orientation is not protected, unfortunately, by our Constitution, and as such, it is entirely appropriate to address this difficult and important subject in the Congress and in the Legislatures across our country. I believe that the mark of a civilized society is how well it addresses the needs of those least well-equipped to protect themselves and that . . . throughout our history each generation has had to stand up and be counted on whether they\u2019re going to protect those most poorly situated to protect themselves, whether it was with the waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries, whether it was to protect political activists in the wake of World War I or in the McCarthy era, whether it was to protect against religious discrimination . . . throughout our history, whether it was the Civil Rights struggle to protect blacks and Hispanics, culminating in the 1960s, whether it was the struggle for equality for women in the 1960s, 1970s and today and now we have the issue of sexual orientation. . . . [Cjountless gays . . . fear discrimination in their jobs, in their housing .... I know of overt acts of discrimination, whether it\u2019s slurs, ugly slurs painted on the sides of houses or on the cars of homosexuals, whether it was the testimony of individuals before the Judiciary Committee earlier this year, whether it was the letters and the write-ins from countless individuals who are gay and who have faced discrimination in their lives . . . .\u201d 34 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1991 Sess., pp. 983-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The Gay Rights Law was enacted in order to protect people from pervasive and invidious discrimination on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the basis of sexual orientation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We cannot interpret \u00a7 10a-149a to override this necessary protection without a strong showing by the defendants that that is what the legislature intended.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 10a-149a implicates strong public policy concerns regarding the protection of a class of people from discriminatory practices, we must strictly construe the entire statute in light of this public policy. See 3A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 74.11, p. 401 (\u201cinterpretation of statutes which impinge upon civil liberties is generally treated as an extraordinarily serious business, subject to special considerations\u201d). In doing so, we are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the statute and we conclude that the United States military is presently prohibited from recruiting on the law school\u2019s campus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>because of its current discrimination against gay men and lesbians.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In this opinion BERDON and NORCOTT, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-5\"> The following sections from No. 91-58 of the 1991 Public Acts, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation,\u201d codified at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81a through 46a-81r, are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81a provides: \u201cSexual orientation discrimination: Definitions.

I join the majority in its well reasoned opinion that concludes that the military, because of its current discriminatory practices against gay men and lesbians, cannot use the facilities of the University of Connecticut Law School (law school) for recruitment purposes. I write separately to express my concern regarding the dissenters\u2019 fundamental misunderstanding of General Statutes \u00a7 10a-149a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and their flawed analysis. That misunderstanding and flawed analysis is obviously driven by their failure to recognize and accept the fundamental change in Connecticut\u2019s public policy regarding gay men and lesbians. That public policy, adopted through legislation enacted in 1991, comprehensively prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. See General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81a et seq. (Gay Rights Law).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">I am troubled by the dissenters\u2019 interpretation of the \u201c [notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary\u201d clause of \u00a7 10a-149a. They assert that \u00a7 10a-149a \u201cprovides the military with a unique exemption from our antidiscrimination laws for the limited purpose of recruiting.\u201d If that be the case, they assign no meaning to the operative clause of \u00a7 10a-149a, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>provides that the law school \u201cshall . . . provide the <em>same </em>directory information and on-campus recruiting opportunities to representatives of the armed forces ... as are offered to nonmilitary recruiters or commercial concerns.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Moreover, neither dissenter adequately explains how the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause of \u00a7 10a-149a permits the military, which currently discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, to recruit on campus when nonmilitary employers, who similarly discriminate, are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">To fully understand our current law, we must appreciate the conduct that was and was not permitted earlier. In 1983, the legislature adopted No. 83-576 of the 1983 Public Acts (P.A. 83-576), which provided that the regional community colleges, the state technical colleges, the Connecticut state universities, and the University of Connecticut were to grant \u201caccess to any campus under [their] jurisdiction to any representative of the armed forces of the United States of America who seeks entrance onto such campus for the purpose of conducting job interviews.\u201d It is without dispute, based on the legislative history, that P.A. 83-576 was intended to treat the military \u201clike anybody [else]\u201d with respect to on-campus recruitment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, in 1983, when employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ers were permitted to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, P.A. 83-576 mandated that the military, despite its discriminatory practices, be allowed to recruit on state campuses. As the majority opinion notes, the following year the legislature revised its statutory language and adopted \u00a7 10a-149a, by enacting No. 84-87 of the 1984 Public Acts, to better reflect the legislative intention expressed in the 1983 and 1984 debates \u2014 that is, the military be given the <em>same </em>recruitment opportunities as nonmilitary employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">With the adoption of the Gay Rights Law in 1991, however, employers are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81c. Those employers that continue to discriminate are now prohibited from using state facilities, such as the law school\u2019s career services office, for any purpose. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81i (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the military, as long as it persists in discriminating against gay men and lesbians, will not be allowed to recruit on the law school\u2019s campus.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The dissenters find it difficult to understand why, if by the adoption of \u00a7 10a-149a in 1984 the legislature intended to change the law regarding military recruitment at the law school, there was not substantial legislative debate regarding such an impact. With a clear understanding of the various statutes and their respective dates of passage, it becomes evident that the dissenters\u2019 difficulty is without substance. As I indicated previously, \u00a7 10a-149a had no practical effect on the statutes governing the law school when it was adopted in 1984, because at that time employers were free to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore the military, with its discriminatory practices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>was permitted to use the law school\u2019s facilities. Consequently, there would have been no purpose in 1984 for such a vociferous debate. Rather, the debate that the dissenters seek occurred in 1991 when there was a practical change.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">It was in 1991 that the legislature changed the public policy of this state as it pertained to gay men and lesbians by adopting the Gay Rights Law. At that time, the legislature was fully cognizant of its actions, for the Gay Rights bill was hotly contested before the legislature. The vitriolic debate that the dissenters seek is indeed present.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The legislature was also well aware of the consequences of this legislation. That awareness is demonstrated by the fact that the legislature specifically exempted the Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Connecticut from the Gay Rights Law. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81q.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Religious orga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>nizations were also furnished with an exemption. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81p. The legislature, however, did not provide military recruiters with an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The dissenters argue that the legislature must have intended something by the adoption of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause of \u00a7 10a-149a and it did. Read in context,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause underscores the fact that the legislature wished to ensure that the military would have the <em>same </em>recruitment opportunities as those provided to nonmilitary recruiters. In other words, the legislature was simply attempting to level the playing field between nonmilitary employers and the military, not tilt the field in favor of the military.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">As the dissenters concede, this court has previously interpreted the phrase \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary\u201d in the context of the Freedom of Information Act, General Statutes \u00a7 1-7 et seq. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 654-55, 631 A.2d 252 (1993). In <em>Gifford, </em>the majority of this court, which included Justice Callahan, held this phrase to mean that a matter \u201cwithin this section that would otherwise be governed ... by any other provision of the General Statutes, is nonetheless governed, not by the other provisions, <em>but by this </em>provision.\u201d (Emphasis added). Id., 654. In other words, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause means that no matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>what any other law may otherwise provide, <em>the operative clause </em>of this provision controls.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Today, the majority correctly interprets the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause, as it is used in \u00a7 10a-149a, in an identical manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 10a-149a is wholly supported by <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Grella, </em>83 N.Y.2d 537, 634 N.E.2d 171, 611 N.Y.S.2d 799 (1994), which was decided recently by the New York Court of Appeals. In <em>Lloyd, </em>the New York Court of Appeals interpreted a statute that has the same \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause and in all other respects is virtually identical to \u00a7 10a-149a.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed the lower court <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and held that \u201c[t]he use of the phrase \u2018on the same basis\u2019 in Education Law \u00a7 2-a is synonymous with \u2018equal access\u2019, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>not unqualified access.\u201d Id., 545. The Court of Appeals reasoned that to endorse such an interpretation \u201cwould grant the military unenacted and unintended universal access .... That construction, which would give undue preference to military recruitment, finds no support in an equal access statute, designed as \u2018a narrow and legitimate jurisprudential\u2019 shield, not as an unlimited sword of entry.\u201d Id. Interestingly, the <em>Lloyd </em>court concluded that the military was barred from recruiting in schools in Rochester, New York, under the equal access statute, not because of a general statute that set forth the state\u2019s public policy of protecting gay men and lesbians from discrimination, but because of a school board resolution prohibiting any employer who discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation from recruiting in the schools. Id., 545-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Although the Court of Appeals in <em>Lloyd </em>found the language of the \u201cequal access\u201d statute to be plain and unambiguous, it also added that, as in this case, \u201cthe legislative history supports access only upon similar terms and conditions as are allowed to other prospective employers. It does not support something denominated broadly and unqualifiedly as \u2018guaranteed access.\u2019 \u201d Id., 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Finally, even if \u00a7 10a-149a and the Gay Rights Law are ambiguous, which I do not believe is the case, I would arrive at the same conclusion by way of established principles of statutory construction. The Gay Rights Law is clearly intended to reverse the years of discrimination experienced by gay men and lesbians. Remedial statutes such as the Gay Rights Law must \u201cbe liberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit [i.e., gay men and lesbians]\u201d; <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 615 n.4, 440 A.2d 810 (1981); and \u201cin furtherance of this principle, exceptions and exclusions are to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>of Education, </em>177 Conn. 68, 74, 411 A.2d 28 (1979). Accordingly, as long as the military discriminates against gay men and lesbians it will be barred from recruiting at the law school, as well as at any of the other state colleges and universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Gay men and lesbians have a right to be free from the discrimination and degrading homophobia that is prevalent in our society. The legislature has adopted this public policy, not only with respect to employment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but also in areas such as the use of state facilities,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> professional associations,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> public accommodations<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and housing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is also clear that the legislature, by adopting \u00a7 10a-149a in 1984, wanted to furnish the military with the same rights to recruitment as nonmilitary employers \u2014 no more or no less. Today, in 1996, the public policy of this state is unequivocal: Discrimination based upon sexual orientation is prohibited and those who persist in discriminating against gay men and lesbians will, among other sanctions, be barred from utilizing state facilities unless specifically exempted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10a-149a provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, each constituent unit of the state system of higher education and any private college or university which receives state funds shall, subject to the provisions of subdivision (11) of subsection (b) of section 1-19, provide the same directory information and on-campus recruiting opportunities to representatives of the armed forces of the United States of America and state armed services as are offered to nonmilitary recruiters or commercial concerns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\"> Contrary to the express language of the statute, the dissenters wish to favor the military, and allow the military to use state facilities for recruitment, while engaging in conduct that would prevent a private employer from using state facilities for recruitment purposes.

In the House of Representatives, eighty-one members voted in favor of the bill, sixty-five voted against it, and five did not vote, while in the Senate, twenty-one members voted in favor of the bill, fourteen voted against it, and one was absent. 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1991 Sess., p. 2782; 34 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1991 Sess., p. 1004. Reflective of this vote, the debate was divided and heated. Among the comments in support of the bill were the following: \u201c[BJecause such discrimination is widespread, even systematic in our society, because sexual orientation is not protected, unfortunately, by our Constitution, and as such, it is entirely appropriate to address this difficult and important subject in the Congress and in the Legislatures across our country.\u201d 34 S.

We have a bill that fulfills both that [moral] and that civic responsibility.\u201d Id., p. 1003, remarks of Senator Charles Allen III; \u201cIt\u2019s a simple bill that says that people cannot be denied certain equal rights based on their sexual orientation. I think when I say we\u2019re at a crossroads, I think we have an opportunity to either perpetuate a negative cycle or take steps forward on a positive cycle.\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1991 Sess., p. 2737, remarks of Representative Miles S. Rapoport; \u201cWhat this bill basically provides is that everybody is entitled to have human decency and respect, everybody is entitled to live in peace, free from harassment, free from violence and with the ability to work and live free of discrimination.\u201d Id., p. 2753, remarks of Representative Juan A. Figueroa</p>\n<p id=\"A2r\">Opposition to the bill was very vocal and diverse. Representative Peter J. Fusscas stated that \u201cthis is a negative bill . . . and I was just curious to know whether or not making it a crime was going to engender more mutual respect, understanding and tolerance and I don\u2019t really \u2014 I really don\u2019t think so.\u201d Id., p. 2767. Representative Reginald L. Jones stated that \u201c[o]n the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>hand, there are many of us who believe there is a moral issue that underlies this situation and that represents a watershed public policy decision.\u201d Id., p. 2754. Representative Alan Schlesingerfelt that \u201cthis legislation canbemisused and in some states has been misused and that\u2019s why I have to vote no.\u201d Id., p. 2747. Representative Arthur O\u2019Neill wondered if the bill would result in an increase in homosexuals moving to Connecticut and doubted that there was a need for such legislation, stating: \u201c [S] ome of my constituents have asked me regarding this legislation as to whether or not we would expect to see a large influx of homosexual or lesbian persons moving into Connecticut, looking for jobs, housing, or credit .... If Connecticut is practicing pervasive persecution of homosexuals and lesbians, I\u2019m unable to explain why they have not sought out the protections of the laws of Wisconsin or Massachusetts or those localities which afford them the type of protection that this legislation is designed to afford them.\u201d Id., pp. 2725-29. Representative John Wayne Fox also doubted the need for this legislation, stating: \u201cIf you come before this body and you want to claim that you\u2019re entitled to a special privilege, a special protection because you have been discriminated against, the least we can hope for, the least we can ask, as the public policy setting body of this state is that there be evidence of that fact and I submit to you that has not happened.\u201d Id., p. 2720. Representative Eugene A. Migliaro, Jr., expressed general homophobic fears, including antigay sentiments, stating: \u201cAccording to this bill, I cannot deny a homosexual from renting and I have to put my kids in jeopardy of something that I fear could be detrimental to them. Where are my rights? . . . Mr. Speaker, we\u2019ve been on the floor of this House for many years debating this issue. We\u2019ve seen it growing like a cancer. . . . Another thing that bothers me, Mr. Speaker, and Members of the House, I have to have a new dictionary now and I\u2019m not saying these things to be indifferent or to cause any hard feelings, but years ago you said I had a gay old time, it was fine. You can\u2019t say it anymore. Years ago we said that person looks like a fruitcake. You can\u2019t say it anymore. Years ago you said, hey, look at that [fairy].

Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., pp. 4529-30, remarks of Senator Thomas Scott (amendment addresses \u201cthe situation at [the law school] where the faculty . . . decided for various reasons that military recruiters should be banned from our University\u201d); id., p. 4533, remarks of Senator Steven Casey (\u201c[the law school] has prohibited certain military service recruiters from recruiting on campus due to their discrimination against homosexuals\u201d). The majority concedes that P.A. 83-576 \u201cprovided an unconditional right of access to state schools for military recruiters . . . under all circumstances.\u201d The majority concludes, however, that No. 84-87 of the 1984 Public Acts (P.A. 84-87), which succeeded P.A. 83-576, was intended by the legislature to terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the military\u2019s year old statutory right to unimpeded access to state university campuses and to treat the military exactly the same as any other employer. That conclusion is at odds with the legislative history of P.A. 83-576 and P.A. 84-87 and with well settled rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In 1984, the legislature repealed P.A. 83-576 and replaced it with P.A. 84-87, which is currently codified at General Statutes \u00a7 10a-149a. Section 10a-149a provides: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, </em>each constituent unit of the state system of higher education and any private college or university which receives state funds shall, subject to the provisions of subdivision (11) of subsection (b) of section 1-19,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provide the same directory information and on-campus recruiting opportunities to representatives of the armed forces of the United States of America and state armed services as are offered to nonmilitary recruiters or commercial concerns.\u201d (Emphasis added.) No mention was made in the floor debates concerning the bill that became P.A. 84-87 in either the House of Representatives or the Senate regarding any departure from the purpose of P.A. 83-576. Nor was any indication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>given that P.A. 84-87 was intended to circumscribe in any way the military\u2019s access to on-campus recruiting that had been guaranteed only one year earlier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The legislative history reveals, rather, that the legislative goal in both 1983 and 1984 was to <em>increase </em>and guarantee campus access to military recruiters. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Education, Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., pp. 403-407, remarks of Major Louis Wein; 26 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., pp. 4529-33, remarks of Senators Thomas Scott, Eugene Skowronski, Mary Martin and Michael Morano.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The state education committee\u2019s report regarding House Bill No. 5371,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which became P.A. 84-87, moreover, indicates that the 1984 bill was not intended, as the majority concludes, to alter existing law by conditioning the military\u2019s campus access upon its compliance with Connecticut antidiscrimination laws but, rather, was intended to support the military\u2019s recruitment efforts by not only permitting the military access to campuses but also by giving it access to directory information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>despite its noncompliance. Further, the bill expanded the list of those institutions that had been subject to P.A. 83-576 to include private institutions and public high schools.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no support in the legislative history for the majority\u2019s conclusion that P.A. 84-87 was intended to make inroads on the access to educational institutions for recruiting provided to the military by P.A. 83-576. In fact, the obvious intent of the legislature was to the contrary. Certainly there was no intention expressed to abandon the purpose for which P.A. 83-576 had been enacted a year earlier \u2014 i.e., to provide the military the opportunity to recruit on state campuses despite its discriminatory policies. 26 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., pp. 4529-33, remarks of Senators Thomas Scott, Eugene Skowronski, Mary Martin and Michael Morano. Until now, we have adhered to the principle of statutory construction that \u201c[a]n amendatory act is presumed not to change the existing law further than is expressly declared or necessarily implied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 201, 550 A.2d 309 (1988); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 63, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); see 1A J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992) \u00a7 22.30. The majority today inexplicably departs from the well settled corollary principle that \u201c[w]e will not infer that the legislature intended to enact a significant change in existing law without an unequivocally expressed manifestation of legislative intent.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>234 Conn. 735, 750, 663 A.2d 948 (1995); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>228 Conn 699, 719, 638 A.2d 589 (1994); <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 66, 566 A.2d 670 (1989). Here, not only was there no \u201cunequivocally expressed . . . legislative intent\u201d to curtail military recruiting by the enactment of P.A. 84-87, there is not even a hint of such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The majority nonetheless relies heavily on legislative history in concluding that \u00a7 10a-149a mandates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>military is to be treated in precisely the same manner as a private employer, which in this instance would mean, that if the military discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it would be denied campus access as would a private employer. The only reference in the Senate debate to the bill that became P.A. 84-87, however, came from Senator Steven Casey who remarked that it \u201cwould require all public high schools, state institutions of higher education and all private high schools and colleges which receive state funds to provide [United States] and state military recruiters with <em>the same directory information and on-campus recruiting opportunities that they offer other recruit</em>ers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 27 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1984 Sess., p. 1131. The majority reads Senator Casey\u2019s remark and similar language in debates on the floor of the House of Representatives as manifesting a clear legislative intent to reverse completely the preexisting legislative policy expressed by P.A. 83-576 to allow military recruitment on campus despite discriminatory hiring policies and to thereafter ban military recruiters from campuses if the military discriminated in its employment policies just as a private employer would be banned if it discriminated in its employment practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">If the majority is correct that remarks such as Senator Casey\u2019s and a similar remark by Representative Dorothy Goodwin in the House of Representatives make it \u201cunequivocally clear\u201d that the legislature intended to strip the military of its recently guaranteed access to campuses for recruiting purposes, it is difficult to explain strikingly similar remarks made only a year earlier when, it is conceded by the majority, the military was permitted campus access for recruiting purposes despite its discriminatory policies. For instance, in support of P.A. 83-576, Senator Scott commented that <em>\u201cmilitary recruiters ought to in turn be treated like anybody from a corporation or anybody else </em>who wishes to come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>to a campus and talk to students about job opportunities . . . (Emphasis added.) 26 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., p. 4530. Senator Skowronski added that the legislature \u201cought to send a message to the Law School that <em>the military ought not to be treated differently than any other group.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 4531.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In isolation, these comments could be read to indicate a legislative intent that the military be subject to the same laws and rules when recruiting on state campuses as a private employer. The fact that these comments were made in support of a bill that plainly prohibited schools from denying campus access to the military, however, indicates that the legislators who expressed themselves meant only that a school could not prevent the military from recruiting because of its discriminatory hiring policies and that the military should be treated the same as private employers despite its hiring policies. A prohibition of military recruiting on campus by the law school and the intent to nullify that prohibition was, after all, the motivating factor in the legislature\u2019s passage of P.A. 83-576. 26 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., pp. 4529-33. Bans on military recruiting similarly motivated the legislature to pass P.A. 84-87; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Education, Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., pp. 403-407; and the comments in the legislative history of P.A. 84-87 to the effect that the military ought not be treated differently than private employers must be read in light of P.A. 83-576. <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission, </em>222 Conn. 269, 277, 610 A.2d 584 (1992) (legislature is presumed to act with knowledge of existing law); <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 65, 566 A.2d 670 (1989) (same). An almost identical legislative history in successive years should not be distorted to mean one thing one year, i.e., 1983, and something entirely different the next year, i.e., 1984. Faced with this reality, the majority is left to argue only that \u201cthe legislative history [of P.A. 83-576] indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>that . . . unconditional access was not the goal of the statute.\u201d This argument is unsupported by a reading of the entire legislative history of P.A. 83-576 pertaining to the access of military recruiters to campuses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>over, the majority\u2019s argument suggests that those legislators who spoke in favor of the 1983 bill that resulted in P.A. 83-576 either had not read the bill or had not understood its meaning. Such speculation is unwarranted and is unsupported by the record. I am bewil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>dered by the majority\u2019s argument that P.A. 83-576 granted the military unconditional access to state campuses for recruitment purposes but that the legislative history of P.A. 83-576 does not support such a reading. In order to reconcile the similar legislative histories with their corresponding public acts, we should not, as does the majority, simply dismiss the legislative history of P.A. 83-576 as inconsistent with its plain language. Rather, I would interpret the public acts and their legislative histories to allow the military, despite its practice of discrimination against certain protected classes, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>nonetheless be provided the same opportunity to recruit on state campuses as a private employer. The majority\u2019s interpretation of the language of \u00a7 10a-149a requiring schools to provide the military with \u201c \u2018the same . . . on-campus recruiting opportunities,\u2019 \u201d to mean that school authorities must ban the military for noncompliance with antidiscrimination laws, not only ignores the circumstances surrounding the enactment of P.A. 84-87 and \u201c \u2018its relationship to existing legislation\u2019 see <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>234 Conn. 35, 45, 660 A.2d 850 (1995); but also ignores the prefatory phrase of the entire statute which provides that the provisions of \u00a7 10a-149a shall control \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u201cRep.

If, as the majority asserts, \u00a7 10a-149a requires the law school to ban the military from recruiting on the law school campus because of its hiring practices, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause is superfluous. Consequently, the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 10a-149a fails to adhere to the well settled principle of statutory construction that \u201c[tjhere is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment so that in construing it no part is treated as insignificant and unnecessary.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 407, 528 A.2d 805 (1987); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 66, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 422, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980). I do not suggest that the majority has ignored the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause. To the contrary, the majority seeks, at some length, to give it meaning. I believe, however, that these attempts are convoluted and unpersuasive and ignore the most obvious interpretation of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The majority cites three reasons why, despite its \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause, \u00a7 10a-149a does not permit the military to recruit on state campuses: (1) there is no indication in the language of \u00a7 10a-149a or in its legislative history that it applies to antidiscrimination statutes; (2) \u201cthe provisions of law to the contrary\u201d are only those statutes that are contrary on their face rather than contrary in practice; and (3) because there is an exception in the 1991 Gay Rights Law for Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (ROTC) programs and no such ROTC exception exists in any of the other antidiscrimination laws, \u201cthese statutes could not have been the \u2018provisions of law to the contrary\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 10a-149a\u201d in 1984. I will address each of the majority\u2019s theories seriatim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The majority first argues that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause does not apply to the antidiscrimination statutes because \u201c[t]here is no indication in the language of [ \u00a7 10a-149a] or in its legislative history that the \u2018notwithstanding\u2019 clause refers to these statutes.\u201d It is true that there is no specific reference to any particular statute either in the text of \u00a7 10a-149a or in its legislative history. As a result, according to the majority, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause does not apply to any statute because there is \u201cno indication\u201d that it applies to any particular statute. This cannot be the case since every phrase in a statute must be given some meaning and without application to other statutes the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause has none. See <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial </em>Hospital, supra, 204 Conn. 407. Furthermore, in the one case in which we have analyzed a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause that is in all relevant parts identical to that in \u00a7 10a-149a, we held that such a clause \u201cindicates that a [situation] falling within this section that would otherwise be governed by . . . any other provision of the General Statutes, is nonetheless governed, not by those other provisions, but by this provision.\u201d <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 654, 631 A.2d 252 (1993). We further held in <em>Gifford </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>clause \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary\u201d is indicative of a legislative intent to create a \u201cbroad\u201d rule as opposed to a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause that explicitly targets a particular statute at which it is aimed. Id., 655 n.15; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (c) (\u201c[notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision [1] of subsection [b] of this section\u201d). When no particular statute is referenced by a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause, it applies to all other statutes, rather than no other statutes, an application the majority\u2019s first argument would require.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The majority next seeks to give the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause some plausible meaning by stating that the \u201c \u2018any other provisions] of law to the contrary\u2019 to which the statute refers are those that are contrary to the substance of [\u00a7 10a-149a], in specific, those statutes that would deny the military the same directory and recruitment opportunities as are provided to private employers.\u201d In other words, the majority concludes that \u00a7 10a-149a applies only to any provision of law that would explicitly ban the military from campus when private employers would be permitted access. Because the anti-discrimination statutes only prohibit campus access by the military when they are \u201capplied],\u201d the majority therefore \u201cdiscern[s]\u201d thatthe \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause cannot apply to antidiscrimination statutes. The majority provides no support for this determination and I am at a loss as to its derivation. Neither previous decisions of this court, the text of the statute, nor the legislative history provide any support for the novel argument that the phrase \u201cany other provision of law to the contrary\u201d is somehow limited to those provisions that are facially contrary rather than those that are contrary when applied. Moreover, at the time P.A. 84-87 was enacted, there were no statutes that, on their face and without application, \u201cwould deny the military the same directory and recruiting opportunities as are provided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>private employers.\u201d Given this fact, the majority\u2019s argument appears to be that the addition of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause was an attempt by the legislature to guard against some unknown contrary provision of law. Not only would such a speculative and preemptive measure by the legislature be unprecedented, it would be entirely futile as \u201c[o]ne legislature cannot control the exercise of the powers of a succeeding legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Dempsey, </em>152 Conn. 431, 439, 207 A.2d 739 (1965). If a future legislature for some reason sought to deny the military the same recruiting opportunities as a private employer, it could freely do so by simply repealing \u00a7 10a-149a.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The last reason asserted by the majority as to why the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause does not apply to the anti-discrimination statutes is the most difficult to understand. The majority appears to argue that because the legislature in 1991 excluded ROTC programs from the Gay Rights Law but has never excluded ROTC programs from other antidiscrimination statutes, the legislature, in 1984 when P.A. 84-87 was enacted, must have considered the military to be in compliance with the statutes prohibiting discrimination. Therefore, according to the majority, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause enacted by the legislature in 1984 could not have applied to and does not apply to any antidiscrimination statutes because the legislature never considered the military to be in violation of those statutes. I do not believe that the majority can \u201cassume\u201d that because the 1991 legislature passed a late amendment to the Gay Rights Law that exempted ROTC programs from its coverage that it can be concluded, as the majority says, that the 1984 legislature considered the military\u2019s discriminatory policies to relate only to \u201cbona fide occupational qualifications\u201d that did not violate any antidiscrimination statutes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>1 can find no support for the proposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>any Connecticut legislature ever considered whether the military\u2019s recruiting decisions were limited to bona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>fide occupational qualifications or that an interpretation of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause in P.A. 84-87 can be based upon the action of the legislature in 1991 in exempting the ROTC from the Gay Rights Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I believe that the only logical interpretation of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause is that espoused by the defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This interpretation involves three steps: (1) the phrase \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary\u201d presupposes that there are laws that would prevent the military from recruiting on our state\u2019s campuses in the absence of \u00a7 10a-149a; (2) the only such laws that exist today or that existed in 1984 that have or had any effect on military hiring policies or practices are those prohibiting discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability and sexual orientation;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (3) therefore, the only interpretation of \u00a7 10a-149a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>that gives meaning to the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause is that it provides the military with a unique exemption from our antidiscrimination laws for the limited purpose of recruiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">When the legislature enacted P.A. 83-576 to ensure that the military would be permitted to recruit on state university campuses, the military discriminated in its hiring policies. In fact, the one senator who spoke to oppose specifically the substance of the provision allowing the military access to state campuses in 1983 stated that he opposed such access \u201cbecause the military is discriminating . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 26 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., p. 4533, remarks of Senator Wilber Smith. In 1983, the legislature acted, in response to a situation at the law school involving the military\u2019s hiring policy toward homosexuals, to \u201cban [our state universities] from banning military recruiters . . . .\u201d Id., p. 4530, remarks of Senator Thomas Scott. The legislature has taken no action since 1983 evincing a legislative intent to abandon its policy of allowing military recruiters on state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>campuses despite the military\u2019s discriminatory hiring policies. In the absence of such clear direction from the legislature, it is not our prerogative to declare a contrary public policy no matter what a majority of the court might like it to be. <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>235 Conn. 650, 659, 668 A.2d 1309 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s use in its discussion concerning the ROTC exception to the Gay Rights Law of the canon of statutory construction, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, which may be translated as \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). I do not dispute that when the legislature excluded the ROTC from the Gay Rights Law at the time of its enactment, the legislature did not also specifically exclude military recruitment. That, however, is not relevant to the determination of whether the preexisting provisions of \u00a7 10a-149a will prevail over the \u201ccontrary\u201d provisions of the Gay Rights Law because of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause of \u00a7 10a-149a. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius, by definition, is applicable only where mention of \u201cone thing\u201d in a statute implies exclusion of another. The exclusion of the ROTC from the Gay Rights Law, however, cannot be said to imply that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause of \u00a7 10a-149a has no application to the Gay Rights Law. Military recruitment of students for jobs after graduation has absolutely nothing to do with the existence of a ROTC unit on campus and allowing the establishment of such a unit on campus as an exception to the Gay Rights Law does not logically exclude a statute permitting military recruitment on campus. The fact that the legislature did not duplicate the protections afforded the military by \u00a7 10a-149a when it enacted the Gay Rights Law and exempted the ROTC from its operation does not logically lead to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>elusion that the legislature intended \u00a7 10a-149a to lose its vitality.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s argument that the expressed public policy of ehminating discrimination against homosexuals is absolute and overrides all other concerns. The majority correctly asserts that the motivating purpose of the Gay Rights Law is \u201cto protect people from pervasive and invidious discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\u201d The majority completely ignores, however, the competing public policy that motivated the legislature to enact P.A. 83-576 and \u00a7 10a-149a \u2014 that of allowing interested students to acquire information concerning military careers from military personnel on campus to the benefit of the students and the military. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Education, Pt. 2,1984 Sess., pp. 411-17; see also footnote 9 of this opinion. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s public policy argument founders on the ROTC exemption to the Gay Rights Law provided by General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81q. It is noteworthy that the ROTC exemption to the Gay Rights Law is emphasized in the majority\u2019s discussion of statutory construction, i.e., expressio unius est exclusio alterius, but is conspicuously absent from the majority\u2019s public policy argument. That is undoubtedly because it is a far greater incursion on the policy of preventing discrimination against homosexuals to permit the ROTC to establish a military unit on campus than it is to allow the legal arm of the military to conduct interviews at the law school one or two days a year. Yet the former has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>legislative sanction. Given the statutory ROTC exemption from the Gay Rights Law, it is difficult to see how the majority\u2019s public policy argument supports its position. The legislature\u2019s enactment of an exemption to the Gay Rights Law for the ROTC, an exemption that permits discrimination against gay men and lesbians that is similar in kind but greater in degree than that permitted by the recruitment provisions of \u00a7 10a-149a, undercuts any such argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In sum, I find no support for the majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7 10a-149a. I also cannot believe that the legislature could make a U-tum on a controversial subject from one year to the next apparently without a single legislator expressing an awareness of the change of direction. Further, it strains credulity (let alone the tenets of statutory construction) to believe that the legislature would enact the Gay Rights Law without being cognizant of the existence and import of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause of \u00a7 10a-149a. See <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, supra, 227 Conn. 654-55 and n.15 (\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause in statute means that that statute prevails over other statutes that would otherwise apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">If the legislature wishes to ban military recruiters from state campuses, that is its prerogative, not ours. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) Nothing in sections 1-15, l-18a, 1-19 to l-19b, inclusive, and 1-21 to l-21k, inclusive, shall be construed to require disclosure of ...

The 1991 legislative debate regarding discrimination against homosexuals does not change the fact that the 1984 legislature expressed no intent to eliminate the military\u2019s unconditional access to campuses for recruitment purposes, access that had been granted only the previous year. If a substantial change in the law had been intended from 1983 to 1984, the relevant debate would have occurred in 1984, not in 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> House Bill No. 5371, which eventually became \u00a7 10a-149a, was modeled after a 1983 New Hampshire bill provided to the chairpersons of the education committee by House Majority Leader John Groppo.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all public high schools and all institutions within the state university system and all private high schools, colleges and universities which receive state funds shall provide the same directory information and on-campus recruiting opportunities to representatives of state or United States armed services as they offer to nonmilitary recruiters or commercial concerns.\u201d N.H.

Those reasons, noted in the majority opinion, are purely products of the majority\u2019s vision of appropriate public policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\"> The concurrence claims that my concern over the majority\u2019s conclusion that a substantial policy change occurred in 1984 without being noticed by the legislature is \u201cwithout substance.\u201d The concurrence claims, with its self-proclaimed \u201cclear understanding of the various statutes and their respective dates of passage,\u201d that, in 1984, \u201c\u00a7 10a-149a had no practical effect on the statutes governing the law school . . . because at that time employers were free to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation . . . .\u201d This assertion suffers from both factual inaccuracy and a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding,\u201d to borrow a phrase from the concurrence, of my argument. The factual inaccuracy is that \u00a7 10a-149a did have a practical effect on the law school because it prohibited the law school from excluding the military based on its discriminatory practices as to homosexuals, among others, as it had done the previous year. See 26 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., p. 4530, remarks of Senator Thomas Scott (P.A. 83-576 enacted in response to law school\u2019s banning of military). The concurrence\u2019s \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d is that it focuses on the legality of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in 1984 and appears to assert that because it was legal to discriminate based on sexual orientation in 1984, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause was without effect in 1984.1 nowhere argue that the terms of P.A. 84-87 directly address discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Rather, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause in 1984 allowed the military to recruit on state campuses despite noncompliance with any antidiscrimination statutes that were operative in 1984 and it presently allows the military to recruit on state campuses despite noncompliance with any existing antidiscrimination statutes, including the Gay Rights Law. If the legislature in 1991 had intended something different, it would have been a simple matter to repeal or revise \u00a7 10a-149a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b521-5\"> The entire Senate debate on P.A. 83-576 pertaining to military access provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\"The Clerk: Yes, Mr. President.

Very briefly, the amendment which I am about to offer has not had a public hearing and has not been considered in that capacity. However, the issue which this amendment addresses is something that\u2019s relatively recent in the making and that is the situation at UConn Law School where the faculty acting in its capacity as really the overseers of outside activity decided for various reasons that military recruiters should be banned from our University. This is but the first step [i]f this is allowed to continue. If you go to Southern Connecticut State University, Eastern Connecticut State University, Central Connecticut, so on and so forth, I think we\u2019ve got to stop them dead in their tracks. I think their efforts on behalf of banning military recruiters was frankly shortsighted and uncalled for. Military recruiters, particularly in this day and age of the voluntary military, when our commitment to the military in terms of our people signing up is below what is necessary, should not be discouraged, and I think that we ought to ban them from banning military recruiters and military recruiters ought in turn to be treated like anybody from a corporation or anybody else who wishes to come to a campus and talk to students about job opportunities, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about here and I would urge a favorable vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">\u201cThe Chair: You move for adoption of this amendment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">\u201cSenator Scott: Yes, Sir, and I would ask for a roll call as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">\u201cThe Chair: Do you wish to remark further?

Proc., Pt. 13, 1983 Sess., pp. 4529-33.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-21\">The entire House debate on P.A. 83-576 pertaining to military access provides as follows:</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\"> If not for the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause as well as the previous year\u2019s grant of unconditional access for recruitment purposes, I would agree with the majority that the military should be treated exactly like any other employer. In order to provide meaning to the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause and to reconcile the legislative actions in 1983 and 1984 with their respective legislative histories, however, I would interpret the language in \u00a7 10a-149a granting the military \u201cthe same . . . on-campus recruiting opportunities,\u201d to mean that the military, given its well documented practices, should nonetheless be allowed to recruit on state campuses. This interpretation is the only one that provides meaning to the legislation and the legislative history in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> The concurrence makes no attempt to give the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause any meaning. The concurrence argues that, by enacting the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause, \u201cthe legislature was simply attempting to level the playing field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>between nonmilitary employers and the military Section 10a-149a would accomplish that objective without the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause. The concurrence, therefore, treats the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause as superfluous. Such a construction defies well settled principles of statutory construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b525-10\"> Before discussing the majority\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause, I find it necessary to challenge the majority\u2019s characterization of that clause as a \u201cproviso\u201d or an \u201cexception\u201d to the Gay Rights Law. The majority utilizes that characterization in order to place upon the defendants \u201c \u2018the burden of proving that they come within the limited class for whose benefit [the law] was established\u2019 \u201d and to claim that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause in this case should be \u201cstrictly construed with doubts resolved in favor of the general rule . . . .\u2019\u2019As the majority asserts, the Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps provision in the Gay Rights Law is an \u201cexception\u201d in that it is a provision that restricts its general applicability. See 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 47.11. The \u201cnotwithstanding\" clause, however, does not represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>a specific exception to the Gay Rights Law but rather a legislative pronouncement within \u00a7 10a-149a that any conflict between \u00a7 10a-149a and any other law will be resolved in favor of \u00a7 10a-149a. The \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause is more analogous to a general saving statute that \u201csave[s] rights and remedies except where a subsequent repealing act indicates that it was not the legislative intention that particular rights and remedies should be saved.\u201d Id., \u00a7 47.13. This is a situation where one statute provides for the resolution of conflicts between it and other statutes, not a situation where there is a specific exemption within a statute to that statute\u2019s general applicability. Moreover, in the only other case in which this court has interpreted a \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause in a statute, not only did we not \u201cstrictly construe\u201d that clause as the majority does in this case, but we interpreted it broadly. See <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 655 n.15, 631 A.2d 252 (1993). Therefore, I believe that the majority\u2019s application of the presumptions and burdens associated with exceptions and provisos is simply wrong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> The only discussion in the legislative record pertaining to the ROTC exception to the Gay Rights Law occurred in the House of Representatives. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>That discussion, in relevant part, occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cRep.

I\u2019m a little troubled, though, because when I raised this very issue in the Judiciary Committee I was told it\u2019s really no concern. It\u2019s kind of pre-empted by federal. I didn\u2019t think it made a lot of sense then and I thought that in fact the bill would have resulted in probably the elimination of every ROTC program in this state, pulling away the kid\u2019s scholarships and closing the programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">\u201cI\u2019ll support, this bill so that that won\u2019t occur .... I can\u2019t help but wonder what other things we\u2019re assured, however, are no real problem in the bill will turn out to be a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">\u201cRep.

[William L.] Wollenberg: (21st) Yes, thank you, Mr. Speaker, just shortly and to follow up on what Representative Ward said at the end of his discussion was I wonder too what we haven\u2019t foreseen in this bill as far as funds are concerned. Representative Tulisano jumps to the challenge, but that\u2019s one reason when you have a complex bill like this and people are looking at it and you\u2019re trying to discern what things may or may not be affected by it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-14\">\u201cThis one comes up. It strikes you immediately. There may be many, many others that have not stricken us that will come up and many people will suffer because of it. I think it needs a longer look than this. I think we proved the case by this one incident and we better be very, very cautious. Thank you.\u201d 81 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1991 Sess., pp. 2666-67.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">Unlike the majority, I am unable to discern from this limited discussion that the legislature considered the military to be in compliance with all other antidiscrimination legislation either in 1991 or at any other point in time. The only insight I glean from this discussion is that, in 1991, the Judiciary Committee, or at least some members thereof, believed that the Gay Rights Law would not apply to the military based on the federal preemption doctrine. See <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 302, 103 S. Ct. 2362, 76 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1983) (Congress enjoys plenary constitutional authority over military). The preemption argument is not raised by the defendants in this case and the court need not decide it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\"> The majority asserts that, according to the defendants, the law school must permit the military to recruit on campus, even though this would result in the school violating the Gay Rights Law. This characterization of the defendants\u2019 argument is circular and assumes the answer to the question at issue. Certainly, if the defendants were correct, as long as the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause exists, the school would not be violating the Gay Rights Law because military recruitment would not be subject to the Gay Rights Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\"> For instance, in 1984, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-72 made discrimination on account of gender, disability and age by state agencies that provide employment referrals illegal. If such laws were meant to apply to the military, the military, with its long history of discriminatory practices, would have had to comply with all Connecticut antidiscrimination laws before being able to recruit on state campuses in 1984. Clearly, that was not the intent of the legislature. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Education, Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., p. 411, remarks of Commissioner Stanley Pac (\u201cWhat they really are looking for here is the same ability to go on and talk to the school kids as other recruiters, and I think it\u2019s in the interest of educators, of the military to improve our military. I think it would help give us a strong military, a motivated military and an enlightened one. It would lift up the level of that same military.\u201d); id., p. 412, remarks of Lieutenant Robert Frank (\u201c[wjejust want to make the military opportunities available . . . asaviable career alternative and option\u201d); id., p. 417, remarks of Staff Sergeant Mark Gentile (\u201c[i]f we are denied access to campuses and access to directory information, it reduces our recruiters to going to McDonald\u2019s to try and talk to young people\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Section 46a-72 is parallel to those portions of the Gay Rights Law at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>here. It provides in relevant part: \u201cDiscrimination in job placement by state agencies prohibited, (a) All state agencies, including educational institutions, which provide employment referrals or placement services to public or private employers, shall accept job orders on a nondiscriminatory basis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201c(b) Any job request indicating an intention to exclude any person because of race, color, religious creed, sex, age, national origin, ancestry, mental retardation, learning disability or physical disability, including, but not limited to, blindness shall be rejected, unless it is shown by such public or private employers that such disability prevents performance of the work involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81j provides in relevant part: \u201cSexual orientation discrimination: Job recruitment and placement services provided by state agencies, (a) All state agencies, including educational institutions, which provide employment referrals or placement services to public or private employers, shall accept job orders on a nondiscriminatory basis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">\u201c(b) Any job request indicating an intention to exclude any person because of sexual orientation shall be rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\"> Senator Casey also spoke in opposition to the amendment requiring military access because of his belief that a public hearing should be held on the matter. 26 S.

That case is inapposite, however, because the meaning of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause in the statute at issue there was never discussed. Moreover, the <em>Lloyd </em>court did not face the obstacle that the majority does in the present case because the New York legislature had not granted the military unconditional access to state campuses the year before it enacted the statute at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-7\">PALMER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-s\">dissenting.

In particular, the majority misinter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>prets the introductory phrase \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary.\u201d The majority incorrectly asserts that that phrase is a statutory \u201cexception\u201d to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d set forth in \u00a7 10a-149a and, accordingly, that it must be \u201cstrictly construed with doubts resolved in favor of the general rule rather than the exception.\u201d The phrase \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary\u201d is not an exception to the rule enunciated in \u00a7 10a-149a at all; it is, rather, an unambiguous expression of legislative intent that the rule set forth in \u00a7 10a-149a <em>shall take precedence over any other provision of the law </em>that would otherwise bar the military from engaging in the same on-campus recruitment activities as civilian employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">By erroneously characterizing the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d phrase as a limitation on the rule created by \u00a7 10a-149a, the majority embarks on a path that leads it to an implausible construction of that language. Relying solely on this mischaracterization of the phrase as justification for adopting the most narrow possible statutory construction, the majority asserts, without elaboration, that the phrase \u201cany other provisions] of law to the contrary\u201d refers only to those statutes that would <em>expressly </em>deny the military the same directory and recruiting opportunities as are available to nonmilitary employers. As the majority acknowledges, however, there were no such statutes in existence when \u00a7 10a-149a was enacted in 1984 and there is not one in existence today;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thus, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, the legislature would have had <em>no reason whatsoever </em>to include the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d provision in \u00a7 10a-149a. Moreover, it strains credulity that the legislature would have used such sweeping prefatory language had it sought merely to supersede only those narrow statutory provisions relating directly and specifically to on-campus recruitment by the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>This court is not free to attain a result in derogation of the intent of the legislature.
