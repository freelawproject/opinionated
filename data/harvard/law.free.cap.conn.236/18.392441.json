J.</author>\n<p id=\"APs\">The sole issue in this certified appeal is whether General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which imposes enhanced penalties on a third time violator of the laws against the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, is triggered by the occurrence of a third <em>violation </em>within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>five years of a prior conviction, or by the occurrence of a third <em>conviction </em>within that five year period. The defendant, Charles J. Bums, was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drags in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (1) and with being a third time offender of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. The trial court denied his subsequent motion to dismiss the charge of being a third time offender. The defendant then entered a plea of nolo contendere to that charge, conditioned on his right to take an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a and Practice Book \u00a7 4003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>38 Conn. App. 8, 658 A.2d 163 (1995). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification, limited to the issue of whether a third conviction, as opposed to a third violation, must occur within the five year period set forth in \u00a7 14-227a (h) in order to apply the third time offender penalty in that provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">As the Appellate Court observed, \u201c[t]he facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. On July 20, 1993, the defendant was arrested and charged with reckless driving and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs. On March 1, 1994, the state filed an amended second part of the information, charging the defendant as a third time offender subject to the enhanced penalties of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u201cOn March 14,1994, a jury found the defendant guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs. The defendant moved to dismiss the amended second part of the information against him on March 23,1994. In support of this motion, the defendant alleged that his prior convictions occurred on October 13 and 28, 1988, and that both convictions, therefore, had occurred more than five years before his present conviction.\u201d Id., 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because it construed \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) to impose enhanced penalties whenever a third violation, rather than a third conviction, occurs within the five year period. Finding no ambiguity in the statutory language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the trial court reasoned that interpreting the five year period as running to the date of a third conviction would be inconsistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history and would lead to bizarre consequences that the legislature could not have intended. The Appellate Court concluded to the contrary on the basis of its determination that \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) \u201cexpressly and unambiguously . . . requires the five year period to run from conviction to conviction.\u201d Id., 12. We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to resolve this important issue of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The state claims that the language of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) unambiguously indicates that a third violation must occur within five years of a prior conviction. In the alternative, the state claims that, if we were to conclude that the statutory language is ambiguous, then the legislative history of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) supports its interpretation and an alternate construction of the statute would lead to bizarre results that the legislature could not have intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The defendant claims, to the contrary, that the language of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) unambiguously indicates that a third conviction must occur within the five year period. In the alternative, the defendant claims that if we were to conclude that \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) is ambiguous, then the rule of lenity would require us to interpret the statute in his favor. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) \u201cis guided by well established principles of statutory construction. Statutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 86-87, 662 A.2d 80 (1995); <em>Murchison v. Civil Service Commission, </em>234 Conn. 35, 45, 660 A.2d 850 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994). If \u201ca statute is capable of two constructions, one that is rational and effective in accomplishing the evident legislative object, and the other leading to \u2018bizarre results\u2019 destructive of that purpose, the former should prevail.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>206 Conn. 203, 210, 536 A.2d 583 (1988). Nonetheless, \u201cunless a contrary interpretation would frustrate an evident legislative intent, criminal statutes are governed by the fundamental principle that such statutes are strictly construed against the state.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 200, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, U.S. , 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>227 Conn. 518, 527, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>218 Conn. 273, 278, 588 A.2d 1376 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">After reviewing the language of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3), we conclude that the statute does not unambiguously dictate whether the five year period that is the predicate for an enhanced penalty runs from a prior conviction to a third violation or from a prior conviction to a third conviction. The relevant statutory language provides such an enhanced penalty \u201cfor conviction of a third violation within five years after a prior conviction for the same offense . . . .\u201d The problem arises out of the latent ambiguity in the phrase \u201cfor conviction of a third violation.\u201d If emphasis is placed on the word \u201cconviction,\u201d then the defendant\u2019s contention that the period runs from conviction to conviction appears plausible. If emphasis is placed on the word \u201cviolation,\u201d however, the state\u2019s contention appears plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>This latent ambiguity in the statute cannot readily be resolved by recourse to established rules of English grammar and statutory construction. These rules indicate that a modifier is presumed to modify the term immediately preceding it. See <em>LaProvidenza </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 23, 27, 420 A.2d 905 (1979); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 47.33. On the one hand, the modifying phrase \u201cwithin five years after a prior conviction\u201d appears to modify the term immediately preceding it, \u201cviolation.\u201d This analysis suggests that the relevant period runs from a prior conviction to a third violation. On the other hand, the phrase \u201cof a third violation\u201d modifies the term immediately preceding it, or \u201cconviction.\u201d The latter analysis suggests that a third conviction must occur within the relevant five year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Unable to derive guidance from the plain language of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3), we must look to other tools of statutory interpretation to inform our analysis of the proper construction of the statute. These tools include an inquiry into the legislative history of a statute and into the purpose the statute was designed to further. With respect to the statute before us, the legislative history is not illuminating,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but the legislature\u2019s purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>in undertaking its enactment requires the conclusion that the relevant period runs to a third <em>violation. </em>\u201cTo determine legislative intent, it is often useful to examine the title of a proposed bill . . . and the purpose the legislature intended to accomplish by its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">. . . Significantly, Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, which amended \u00a7 14-227a in 1985 to incorporate the language at issue in this case, was entitled \u2018An Act Increasing Imprisonment Penalties for Drunk Driving to Meet the Federal Standards.\u2019 . . . [T]his provision was part of a statutory package that enhanced mandatory minimum sentences for both first and multiple offenders and increased penalties for each successive offense. In enacting Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387 so as to amend \u00a7 14-227a, the legislature clearly intended to provide harsher penalties for offenders with a history of driving while under the influence\u201d of intoxicating liquor or drugs and to harmonize our law with federal standards.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 577-78, 556 A.2d 584 (1989);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> see 28 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1985 Sess., p. 3948, remarks of Senator Richard B. Johnston; 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1985 Sess., p. 7029, remarks of Representative Thomas J. Dudchik.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Because the legislature\u2019s overall goal in enacting \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) was unambiguous, we are persuaded that the phrase \u201cfor conviction of a third violation within five years after a prior conviction for the same offense . . .\u201d can reasonably be construed only as imposing enhanced penalties on those whose third violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) occurs within the five year period, regardless of when that conviction occurs. In enacting \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3), the legislature sought to deter dangerous conduct, not to influence the timing of a subsequent conviction arising from such conduct. An interpretation of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) that focuses on the time of conviction rather than the time of violation could have bizarre and ineffective consequences.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If eligibility for the enhanced penalty were to depend upon the timing of conviction, then two offenders who were arrested on the same day for their third offense and who previously on the same dates had been convicted twice before of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs could be subject to disparate penalties if one of the offenders were successful in strategically jockeying for a delay in his trial. Presumably, the legislature did not intend to invite such manipulation of the judicial docket. It is reasonable for us to construe the statute to avoid such an undesirable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Finally, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that our interpretation of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) is untenable because it would violate the rule of lenity. \u201cAlthough we recognize the fundamental principle that criminal statutes are to be construed strictly, it is equally fundamental that the rule of strict construction does not require an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>interpretation which frustrates an evident legislative intent. . . . Moreover, there is a presumption that the legislature intends to accomplish a reasonable and rational result rather than a difficult and possibly bizarre one.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 523-24, 525 A.2d 509 (1987); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 317-18, 630 A.2d 593 (1993); <em>State v. Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 719-20, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991). As we have already noted, the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 14-227a (h) (3) would have the irrational and unintended result of imposing enhanced penalties, for repeated operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, not by reference to the date of the defendant\u2019s third such misconduct, but by reference to the fortuitous date of his third conviction. We have not previously applied the principle of lenity in such circumstances, and we decline to do so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a provides in relevant part: \u201cOperation while under the influence of liquor or drug or while impaired by liquor, (a) Operation while under the influence.

The general comments of the legislators regarding Public Acts 1985, No. 85-387, which amended \u00a7 14-227a in 1985 to incorporate the language at issue in this appeal, were linguistically inconsistent. The legislators alternately described the amendment as imposing additional penalties when a third offense, third conviction or third violation occurs. Representative Thomas J. Dudchik described the legislation as \u201cincreas[ing] the mandatory jail sentence for a second and third <em>offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1985 Sess., p. 7029. Representative Richard D.
