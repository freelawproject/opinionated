We conclude that a wilful violation of \u00a7 19a-583 requires only a knowing disclosure of confidential human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related information.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, was a patient of <em>the </em>defendant Dionisio C. Flores, a surgeon, to whom, during the course of her treatment, she disclosed that she was infected with HIV. A surgical assistant employed by Flores, the named defendant Doris Marselle, after learning of the plaintiffs condition from her medical chart and from personal discussions with the plaintiff, consulted Flores regarding her intention to disclose the plaintiffs HIV status to Marselle\u2019s sons who were illegal drug users and who had friends in common with the plaintiff. Flores authorized Marselle to make the disclosures provided that she not identify the plaintiff by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">When the plaintiff learned that Marselle had told at least three other individuals in the community that she was HIV positive, the plaintiff, who had never authorized the disclosures, brought a multicount complaint against Flores and Marselle alleging that they each had: (1) violated the confidentiality provisions of \u00a7 19a-583 by intentionally disclosing her HIV status (first count); (2) violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA); General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> based upon a breach of confidentiality and Flores\u2019 false representations to her that her HIV status would be kept confiden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>tial (third and fourth counts); and (3) negligently inflicted emotional distress by disclosing her HIV status (sixth count). Additionally, the plaintiff alleged that Flores had been negligent in failing to instruct his employees regarding their obligation to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 19a-581 et seq. (second count), and that Marselle had intentionally inflicted emotional distress by wilfully disclosing the confidential medical information (fifth count).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Flores filed an \u201cobjection\u201d to the complaint,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> challenging the sufficiency of the plaintiffs claims against him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Treating the objection as a motion to strike, the trial court ordered all counts against Flores stricken and rendered judgment in his favor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for articulation, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a second motion for articulation, which the Appellate Court granted. Pursuant to that order, the trial court set forth its reasons for striking the complaint. As to the first count, the court stated that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action under \u00a7 19a-590 because the allegations set forth in the pertinent four paragraphs of the first count did not contain the word \u201cwilfully\u201d and there were no allegations of an intent to injure that would allow the court to conclude that Flores\u2019 action had been wilful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, because \u00a7 19a-590 autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>rizes an action only for wilful, as opposed to negligent, conduct and because the plaintiff had not alleged that Flores had intended to injure her when he authorized the disclosure, the trial court granted Flores\u2019 motion to strike the second and sixth counts. Finally, the court concluded that in the absence of an allegation of wilful conduct the plaintiff had failed to state a claim under CUTPA and, accordingly, it granted Flores\u2019 motion to strike the third and fourth counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">In her appeal to the Appellate Court, the plaintiff argued that the term \u201cwilful\u201d in \u00a7 19a-590 means \u201cintentionally\u201d as opposed to \u201caccidentally\u201d and that the trial court; improperly had defined the term to mean intending to injure. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>38 Conn. App. 360, 366, 660 A.2d 871 (1995). The Appellate Court disagreed, concluding that in order to establish a violation of \u00a7 19a-590, the plaintiff must allege that both the action and the resulting injury had been intended. Id., 367-68. In the Appellate Court\u2019s view, because the plaintiff had failed to do so, the trial court properly rendered judgment for Flores. Id., 370. Additionally, although it did not decide whether \u00a7 19a-581 et seq. is the exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>remedy for an unauthorized disclosure of confidential HIV-related information, the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment as to the remaining counts. Id., 370-71. Relying on the fact that the plaintiff had incorporated the first count into each of the other counts against Flores, the court reasoned that because the first count had failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, the counts into which the same allegations had been incorporated must similarly fail. Id., 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff petitioned this court for certification. We granted certification limited to the following questions: (1) \u201cDid the Appellate Court correctly conclude that the second amended complaint did not allege a wilful violation of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-583 (a)?\u201d; and (2) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly decide that the plaintiffs negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) counts had been properly stricken?\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. Marselle, 235 Conn. 915, 665 A.2d 606 (1995). Because we answer both certified questions in the negative, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">\u201cBecause our fundamental objective in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature; <em>Fleming </em>v. Garnett, 231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); we will not undertake an examination of [\u00a7 19a-590] with blinders on regarding what the legislature intended [it] to mean. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). Accordingly, our analysis of [\u00a7 19a-590] is not limited solely to the words of the statute. Instead, we must also look ... to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>supra, 409; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>supra, 92.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Derwin </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 411, 420, 661 A.2d 1025 (1995); accord <em>Covelli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>235 Conn. 539, 555, 668 A.2d 699 (1995) <em>(Katz, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">A thorough examination using all these factors is especially important in the present case because, although \u201cour initial guide [to interpreting a statute] is the language of the statute itself\u2019; <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>235 Conn. 650, 656, 668 A.2d 1309 (1995); the particular term in issue is a word of many meanings. \u201cWilful\u201d has been defined many ways, and the applicable definition often turns on the specific facts of the case and the context in which it is used.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 101, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1945). Consequently, in construing its meaning, we are guided by the language of \u00a7 19a-590, both alone and in the context of the AIDS statute, as well as the underlying legislative purpose of the harm at which it is directed. We pay particular' attention to \u201cthe societal [problem] which the legislature sought to address ... in determining the true meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161-62, 496 A.2d 186 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>The AIDS statute was designed and intended to combat the AIDS epidemic, beginning with protecting confidentiality. The legislation imposes certain requirements on the testing and treatment of persons who may be HIV positive or who have AIDS. These requirements relate principally to the areas of informed consent for HIV testing and confidential treatment of HIV-related information, and are aimed at helping health care providers to identify those people with the disease, to treat them and to educate them in an attempt to put an end to the epidemic in our state, which, at the time this legislation was under consideration, had the ninth highest number of AIDS cases per capita in the nation and the highest percentage of AIDS cases in children. 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 31, 1989 Sess., pp. 10,776-77. As one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, Representative Benjamin N. DeZinno, Jr., explained,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the bill was intended to \u201cprotect the confidentiality of data related to AIDS, requires informed consent for tests for the AIDS virus, and allows for notification of partners of those that are so infected.\u201d Id., p. 10,775. He explained that in order to \u201cwipe out or hope to wipe [out] this horrible epidemic disease in our lifetime . . . [w]e have to start with protecting the confidentiality . . . [b]ecause people will not step forward for testing and treatment of AIDS unless they know that a positive result will not become public information. I think that\u2019s very important. Now unfortunately, there is widespread discrimination against the AIDS victim, and many people would rather [forgo] treatment, than risk being stigmatized.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., p. 10,776.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Beth Weinstein, chief of the AIDS section for the then department of health services, now the department of public health and addiction services (department), along with James Hadler, a physician and the chief of the epidemiology section of the department, testified that the department had proposed \u201cthis critical legislation . . . [to] provide us with the tools to continue fighting the AIDS epidemic in Connecticut. If passed, it will protect the confidentiality of AIDS information and will require informed consent for the test for the virus which causes AIDS. . . . The AIDS epidemic has magnified many problems in the existing health care system. Among the most glaring is the lack of protection [in] current Connecticut statutes for informed consent and disclosure of information. Although this problem goes beyond AIDS, we feel it is most important to solve it for AIDS because of the sensitivities regarding the disease.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Health, Pt. 3, 1989 Sess., p. 766. Weinstein explained how this legislation was necessary to encourage confidential testing and to allow medical providers to provide proper follow-up treatment. \u201cIn most of the sites that the department funds for counseling and testing for the AIDS virus, anonymous testing is done, largely because we don\u2019t have confidentiality protection. However, anonymous testing has limitations. Counselors have no ability to follow-up with clients to provide support for behavior change, additional counseling, public health services, social services or medical assistance. Voluntary testing in which the identity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>person tested [is] known will only be widely accepted if there is specific protection in the statutes.\u201d Id., p. 767. Weinstein concluded her testimony by emphasizing that confidentiality is essential \u201cto protect people from the discrimination that often comes with the knowledge that a person has AIDS or HIV infection\u201d and to help eliminate the stigma that often accompanies AIDS. Id., pp. 768-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">In order to accomplish the aforementioned goals, disclosure of confidential HIV-related information is prohibited except in very limited and discrete circumstances. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-583 (a) (1) through (12).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even health care providers or persons who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>engage in occupational therapy who have had significant exposure to HIV infection are not entitled to this information unless they satisfy the rigid criteria listed in \u00a7 19a-583 (a) (7). See footnote 11. Similarly, employees of mental health hospitals operated by the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>ment of mental health and correctional facilities operated by the department of correction are not entitled to this information even when the patient or inmate poses a significant risk of transmission unless the infection control committee of the hospital or the medical director and chief administrator of the correctional facility first determine that such disclosure is likely to prevent or reduce the risk of transmission and that no reasonable alternatives exist that will achieve the same goal and preserve the confidentiality of the information. See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-583 (a) (8) and (9).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">A person who does not fall within these exceptions may petition the court for disclosure; however, a court order may be issued only when the moving party demonstrates a clear and imminent danger to the health of another or the public health and further demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>a compelling need for the test results that cannot be accommodated by other means. In assessing compelling need, the court must weigh, among other things, the need for disclosure against the privacy interest of the test subject and the public interest that may be disserved by disclosure that deters future testing or that may lead to discrimination. See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-583 (a) (10).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, even when disclosure is authorized, the AIDS statute strictly limits the terms of that disclosure. See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-585.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>short, the drafters of this legislation \u201ccrafted the bill very carefully to give protection while also enabling those who care for people with AIDS and HIV infection to have access to information needed for the patient\u2019s care.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Health, Pt. 3, 1989 Sess., p. 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Keeping this legislative history in mind, coupled with the elaborate statutory safeguards imposed against disclosure of HIV-related information, it is difficult to presume a definition of wilful that would make permissible the unauthorized disclosure of a person\u2019s HIV-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>information except in the extreme situation where the person disclosing the information actually intends to injure the protected individual. We have noted that as part of its attempt to foster an increase in medical treatment for people with AIDS and HIV infection, the legislature created the AIDS statute to correct the problems, such as the lack of confidentiality, that have stood in the way of this goal. A definition of wilful that would require a plaintiff to prove that confidentiality was breached with the intent to cause injury would do nothing to advance the laudable goals of the legislation\u2019s sponsors. Indeed, were we to apply the definition of wilful proposed by Flores and adopted by the Appellate Court, a patient who is HIV positive, knowing that he or she could obtain redress for a violation of the confidentiality provisions in only the most egregious circumstances, would have no confidence that his or her status or test results would be zealously protected. This lack of confidence, in turn, would create a disincentive for that person to submit to testing. Additionally, because General Statutes \u00a7 19a-582 (b) (4) requires that pretest counseling include \u201can explanation of the confidentiality protections afforded confidential HIV-related information, including the circumstances under which and classes of persons to whom disclosure of such information may be required, authorized or permitted by law,\u201d the lack of protection resulting from a definition of wilful that requires an evil intent would be more likely to eviscerate the purpose of the statute and consequently undermine the public health strategy against AIDS that prompted the legislation. It is not our practice to construe a statute in a way to thwart its purpose or lead to absurd results; <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>201 Conn. 115, 121, 513 A.2d 139, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 964, 107 S. Ct. 466, 93 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986); or in a way \u201cthat fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve.\u201d <em>Fairfield </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number><em>Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>220 Conn. 643, 651, 600 A.2d 1 (1991). Consequently, we cannot endorse a definition of wilful that would allow virtually any disclosure of confidential HIV-related information.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Moreover, to limit the definition of wilful to the case of a medical provider who intended to cause the patient injury, as Flores argues, would be to provide a cure for which there is no disease. No one speaking on behalf of the legislation identified a problem with medical providers seeking to sabotage the ability of their AIDS patients to obtain good medical care. Nor has Flores argued that such a problem exists. Because we do not presume that the legislature enacted legislation that was devoid of purpose; <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 542, 494 A.2d 555 (1985); we will not interpret wilful as Flores has proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Rather, we interpret wilful to mean a knowing disclosure of confidential HIV-related information. Contrary to the Appellate Court\u2019s assertion, this interpretation does not render the term superfluous. Had the term wilful not been used, persons would be hable for inadvertent disclosures or nonvolitional acts. By establishing liability only for wilful violations, the legislature indicated that inadvertent violations would not be actionable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Confirmation of our decision can be found by returning to the language of \u00a7 19a-590 itself, which the plaintiff suggests we compare with \u00a7 19a-591b, which was included in the 1991 amendments to the AIDS statute and which provides that manufacturers of an AIDS vaccine shall be liable to research subjects for civil damages for any injury that was caused by \u201cgross negligence or reckless, wilful or wanton misconduct.\u201d As used in this context, wilful is similar to the concept of intentional injury adopted by the Appellate Court in this case. Section 19a-590 is, however, devoid of any suggestion of recklessness, wantonness, misconduct or other improper motive. The plaintiff argues, therefore, that it is more logical to construe wilful to apply simply to a knowing violation of the statute\u2019s nondisclosure requirements. We agree. As we have stated many times, \u201c[w]here a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject . . . is significant to show that a different intention existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">. . . That tenet of statutory construction is well grounded because [t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Ralph M., </em>211 Conn. 289, 306-307, 559 A.2d 179 (1989); see also <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 416, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988) (\u201c \u2018[t]he use of different words [or the absence of repeatedly used words in the context of] the same [subject matter] must indicate a difference in legislative intention\u2019 \u201d). Had the legislature intended more than a knowing violation of the statute\u2019s nondisclosure requirements, it would have used the language of \u00a7 19a-591b.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Finally, Flores argues that even if wilful means knowing, the allegations do not state a cause of action under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>\u00a7 19a-590 against him. We disagree. The complaint alleges that Flores \u201caffirmatively authorized\u201d the disclosure with the sole proviso that Marselle not disclose the plaintiffs actual name. That disclosure clearly falls within the definition of \u201cconfidential HIV-related information\u201d set forth in \u00a7 19a-581 (8). See footnote 2. Moreover, Marselle was the \u201cemployee and agent\u201d at all times relevant to the complaint. Flores\u2019 assertion that the plaintiff must specifically allege her reliance on the doctrine of respondeat superior ignores what we have often stated is our \u201cresponsibility to construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 567-68, 569 A.2d 518 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Flores concedes that the trial court\u2019s decision striking the remaining four counts against him can be affirmed only if we define a wilful disclosure of HIV-related information as requiring an intent to engage in the prohibited conduct and an intent to produce the resulting injury. Because we have defined a wilful violation of \u00a7 19a-590 as solely a knowing violation, however, we reverse the judgment of the trial court as to all counts against Flores.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19a-590 provides: \u201cLiability for violations.

Herek &amp; X Capitanio, \u201cPublic Reactions to AIDS in the United States: A Second Decade of Stigma,\u201d 83 Am. J. Pub. Health 574, 575 (1993). More than one in five Americans (20.4 percent) would avoid an office job if they had to work with a man with AIDS, and nearly one half (47.1 percent) would avoid a neighborhood grocery store if the owner had AIDS. Id. Feelings of hostility translate into acts of discrimination against people infected with HIV. In lawsuits across the country, people have alleged discrimination based on HIV status in housing, employment and access to public accommodations, as well as in education and health care. See L. Gostin, Jr., \u201cA National Review of Court and Human Rights Commission Decisions, Part II: Discrimination,\" 263 J. Am. Med. Assn. 2086 (1990) (listing nearly 150 lawsuits and other complaints stemming from such alleged discrimination).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\"> Our interpretation of wilful is consistent with the construction of similar language contained in other statutes whose wilful violation has been held to involve nothing more than the knowing commission of the acts they proscribe, without regard to recklessness, intent to injure or other improper motive. It is noteworthy that some of these statutes, like the AIDS statute, were designed to promote the public health and safety. See, e.g., <em>A. Schonbek &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>646 F.2d 799, 800 (2d Cir. 1981) (wilful violation of rules promulgated under Occupational Safety and Health Act requires intentional disregard of, or plain indifference to, legal requirement); <em>Duffy </em>v. <em>Poulos Bros.
