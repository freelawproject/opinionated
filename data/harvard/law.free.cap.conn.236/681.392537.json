On or about April 11, 1991, the defendant Susan E. Hyde filed a complaint with the named defendant, the commission on human rights and opportunities (commission), alleging various discriminatory acts by the plaintiff, Angelsea Productions, Inc., which had employed Hyde from September, 1990, until her resignation on January 29, 1991. On March 3, 1993, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the commission\u2019s investigation had not been timely concluded in accordance with the nine month deadline imposed on the commission by \u00a7 46a-83 (b). <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 17, 1993, the commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>despite its two year delay in investigating the complaint issued a reasonable cause finding in favor of Hyde. Thereafter, on June 15, 1993, the commission denied the plaintiffs motion to dismiss. Subsequently, on November 29,1993, because of the commission\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>46a-84 (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that it hold a hearing within ninety days of the issuance of the reasonable cause finding, the plaintiff filed another motion to dismiss and a petition for an expedited declaratory ruling asking the commission to declare that the time limitations of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) are mandatory and that failure to follow them strips the commission of jurisdiction over the complaint. On January 4, 1994, the plaintiffs motion to dismiss was denied by the commission\u2019s presiding hearing officer. On March 22, 1994, the ruling on the motion to dismiss was upheld by the agency commissioners, who, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (e) (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> issued a declaratory ruling in which they concluded that the time limitations of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) are directory and not mandatory. Pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176 (h)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 4-183,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiff appealed from that declaratory ruling to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">To expedite resolution of the administrative appeal, on April 4,1995, the parties submitted a stipulated reservation of questions to the Superior Court for consideration by and the advice of the Appellate Court. The questions upon which advice is sought are as follows: (1) \u201cIs the time limit for investigating a complaint set forth in [General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46a-83 (b)] mandatory?\u201d (2) \u201cIf the [commission] fails to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>reasonable cause determination within nine months from the date of filing a complaint, as set forth in [General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46a-83 (b)], must the [commission] dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction?\u201d (3) \u201cIs the time limit for holding a public hearing set forth in [General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46a-84 (b)] mandatory?\u201d and (4) \u201cIf the [commission] fails to hold a public hearing within [ninety] days after a finding of reasonable cause, as set forth in [General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46a-84 (b)], must the [commission] dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court reserved the questions for consideration by the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-235 and Practice Book \u00a7 4147.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We transferred the case from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">To determine whether the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling properly decided that \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 and 46a-84 are directory, we begin with an examination of the statutes. \u201cOrdinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. <em>Police Department </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>[225 Conn. 297, 300, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993)]; <em>Crocetto </em>v. <em>Lynn Development Corporation, </em>223 Conn. 376, 381, 612 A.2d 1212 (1992). [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 262, 579 A.2d 505 (1990). This case, however, presents apure question of law, and therefore invokes a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. Id., 263; <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 718, 546 A.2d 830 (1988). Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny, as in this case, the agency\u2019s determination is not entitled to special deference. <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra [263]; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>210 Conn. 349, 357, 554 A.2d 1089 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees' Review Board, </em>226 Conn. 670, 678-79, 628 A.2d 957 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Therefore, we approach the task relying on familiar principles of statutory construction in order to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>Police Dept. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 303 n.7. \u201cIt is fundamental that statutory construction requires us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation. . . . <em>Petco Insulation Co. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 315, 321, 649 A.2d 790 (1994). In order to determine the meaning of a statute, we must consider the statute as a whole when reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation. <em>Broadley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>229 Conn. 1, 6, 639 A.2d 502 (1994); <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 763, 529 A.2d 194 (1987).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>234 Conn. 35, 45, 660 A. 2d 850 (1995). The task of determining whether a particular provision is mandatory or directory involves the same criteria, namely, the statute\u2019s language, the legislative history and the statutory context. <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>175 Conn. 127, 129-31, 394 A.2d 731 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Looking first to the words of the statutes, it appears that their language requires the commission to complete its investigation within nine months and hold a hearing within ninety days. Section 46a-83 (b) provides that \u201c[t]he investigator <em>shall </em>make a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause in writing and <em>shall </em>list the factual findings on which it is based <em>not later than nine months </em>from the date of filing of the complaint . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46a-84 (b) provides that the \u201chearing <em>shall </em>be held <em>not later than ninety days </em>after a finding of reasonable cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Definitive words, such as \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall,\u201d ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 410, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>see Statewide Grievance Committee v. Roz</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>bicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 240, 558 A.2d 986 (1989); <em>LoSacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 507, 555 A.2d 986 (1989); <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717, 513 A.2d 43 (1986); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>174 Conn. 229, 233, 384 A.2d 384 (1978). We have noted, however, that the use of the word \u201cshall,\u201d though significant, does not <em>invariably </em>establish a mandatory duty. <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 152, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989); see, e.g., <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>196 Conn. 270, 278, 492 A.2d 180 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\u201cThe test we have adopted for determining whether such a statutory requirement is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to matter material or immaterial \u2014 to matters of convenience or of substance. . . . If it is a matter of convenience, the statutory provision is directory; if it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Oller </em>v. <em>Oller-Chiang, </em>230 Conn. 828, 838-39, 646 A.2d 822 (1994). Stated another way, language is deemed to be mandatory if the mode of action is of the essence of the purpose to be accomplished by the statute; <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 710, 579 A.2d 1 (1990); but will be considered directory if the failure to comply with the requirement does not compromise the purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 569 A. 2d 518 (1990), this court applied these principles in interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>ting a statute addressing the civil rights of persons who are mentally ill. The court noted that the statute, which was part of the patients\u2019 bill of rights, illustrated \u201cthe breadth of the legislative concern for the fair treatment of mental patients.\u201d Id., 556. The court therefore held that a statutory provision stating that no person treated in a mental health facility \u201c \u2018shall be deprived of any . . . civil rights\u2019 \u201d was substantive in nature, and that the word \u201cshall\u201d was mandatory. Id., 557 and n.11. The plaintiff in the case before us likewise argues that both \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) relate to matters of substance. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 235, 278 A.2d 771 (1971), this court stated that the \u201cpurpose of [General Statutes \u00a7 31-127, the predecessor to today\u2019s discriminatory complaint procedure provisions] is to guard against subjecting a respondent to a hearing upon every complaint which might be made to the commission, however unfounded. To guard against such an eventuality, the statute requires the commission, once a complaint has been filed, to investigate it, and it is only after such preliminary investigation has established that there is reasonable cause for action and after arbitration methods have failed that a hearing is authorized.\u201d In <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>196 Conn. 208, 217-18, 491 A.2d 1096 (1985), this court concluded that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-82 through 46a-96 afforded the claimant \u201cmeaningful relief under the federal and state statutes that govern his claim of age discrimination\u201d and that his failure to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him deprived the trial couit of jurisdiction to hear his complaint. Although the investigation, the elimination of the discriminatory practice, the subsequent hearing, if necessary, and the granting of relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>where appropriate, are clearly essential, the speed with which these matters are carried out is necessarily a part of the essence of the statutory scheme. Because there can be no further action by either party until there has first been a finding of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause, a claimant is impotent until there is an investigation, and where there is merit to the allegation, failure to investigate in a timely fashion by the commission allows the discriminatory practice to continue without the administrative oversight and enforcement provisions envisioned by the statutory scheme. Similarly, without timely progress, the respondent is equally hamstrung. Even if the claim is frivolous, the respondent nevertheless remains frustrated pending a determination by the commission because its conduct is constrained to avoid a claim of retaliation. The entire discriminatory practice complaint procedure, as amended by No. 89-332 of the 1989 Public Acts (P.A. 89-332), is replete with deadlines essential to further progress in the administrative arena. See, e.g., P.A. 89-332, \u00a7 4 (a) (answer to complaint to be filed within fifteen days of receipt of complaint); P.A. 89-332, \u00a7 4 (c) (complainant\u2019s request for reconsideration to be filed not later than fifteen days after finding of no reasonable cause; commission to act on request within ninety days); and P.A. 89-332, \u00a7 5 (a) (investigator has forty-five days from finding of reasonable cause within which to eliminate discriminatory practice). The policy behind these deadlines of speedy resolution of the claims and elimination of the offending conduct can be implemented only through strict enforcement of the time limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We note that this court has previously concluded that the phrases \u201cshall certify the complaint,\u201d \u201cshall refer . . . to an investigator to investigate\u201d and \u201cshall attempt to eliminate by conference, conciliation and persuasion\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 and 46a-84 denote man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>datoiy obligations. See <em>Sullivan v. Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 215-16. In <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 160 Conn. 234-35, the court examined General Statutes (Rev. to 1958) \u00a7 31-127,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the predecessor to today\u2019s discriminatory complaint procedure in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-82 through 46a-96, and concluded that where it found reasonable cause, the commission was <em>required </em>to investigate complaints and to try to eliminate the discrimination through the conference, conciliation and persuasion process. Similarly, in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 216, the court stated that the use of the term \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 46a-84 required the commission to \u201ccertify the complaint, hold a hearing and order appropriate relief.\u201d Because the legislature is presumed to be aware of the judicial construction placed on its enactments; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>228 Conn. 393, 401, 636 A.2d 804 (1994); its failure to correct or undermine what we stated in those cases is evidence that the legislature has validated our interpretation. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 439, 525 A.2d 91 (1987). By using the word \u201cshall\u201d to impose deadlines when it revised \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) in 1989 following our interpretation of the same word in other portions of those provisions, the legislature has signalled its approval of our construction of the term \u201cshall\u201d to denote mandatory obligations. 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992 Rev.) \u00a7 45.10; see <em>Scheyd </em>v. <em>Bezrucik, </em>205 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>495, 506, 535 A.2d 793 (1987) (because legislature is presumed to be aware of interpretation that courts have placed on existing legislation, failure of legislature to amend statute to change our interpretation presumes that it acquiesced in our interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Additionally, we recognize the \u201cfamiliar principle of statutory construction that where the same words are used in a statute two or more times they will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each instance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 343, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992). <em>In Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 216, prior to the passage of the 1989 amendment that added the time deadlines in issue in this case, this court concluded that the word \u201cshall,\u201d used in various parts of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 and 46a-84, imposed mandatory obligations. We see no reason to interpret that term differently when it is used elsewhere in the same statute. Indeed, it is counterintuitive to suggest that the legislature would have intended, without comment, to give the word \u201cshall\u201d two distinctly different meanings within the same statute. See <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>supra, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Moreover, we note the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in other subsections of the same statute; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 46a-83 (a) (commission may conduct fact-finding conferences); as well as in other statutes within the discriminatory complaint procedure. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-101 and 46a-102. The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in conjunction with the word \u201cmay\u201d confirms that the legislature \u201cacted with complete awareness of their different meanings\u201d; <em>Hartford Principals\u2019 &amp; Supervisors\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Shedd, </em>202 Conn. 492, 506, 522 A.2d 264 (1987); and that it intended the terms to have different meanings. <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 613, 440 A.2d 810 (1981) (use of different terms within same sentence of statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u201cplainly\u201d implies different meanings intended), aff'd, 192 Conn. 252, 470 A.2d 1216 (1984); see also <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 416, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">One final reliable guide in determining whether a statutory provision is directory or mandatory is whether the failure of the state to comply with its provisions results in either a penalty or a requirement that the state seek an extension of time. <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission, </em>222 Conn. 269, 273-74, 610 A.2d 584 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 238, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975). Pursuant to \u00a7 46a-83 (b), if the investigator fails to make a finding regarding reasonable cause within the prescribed nine month time period, \u201cthe executive director or his designee may grant a single extension of the investigation of three months.\u201d If the investigator merely had to attempt to comply with the nine month deadline, there would be no purpose in providing for an extension. We have often recognized that the legislature is not presumed to enact meaningless legislation. <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 61, 523 A.2d 477 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Our conclusion that both time deadlines are mandatory is buttressed by the legislative history of P.A. 89-332, the act that added the time deadlines in issue. In reporting the bill out of committee, Representative Eric D. Coleman identified a number of changes included in the amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He remarked that these amendments were \u201cdesigned to address some problems that have come to light with the [commission]. It is hoped that some of the changes that are recommended would serve as significant reforms, particularly with respect to the processing of individual complaints of discrimination.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 23, 1989 Sess., pp. 8166-67. Significantly, Representative Coleman addressed the deadline in \u00a7 46a-83 (b), explaining that \u201c[t]he hearing subsequent to the finding of reasonable cause and conciliation efforts which fail would be required to be held <em>not later than ninety days </em>from the finding of reasonable cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 8169.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Similarly, then Senator Richard Blumenthal, reporting the joint bill out of the conference committee, stated that the bill \u201chas the objective of accomphshing the recommendations of the task force appointed by Governor O\u2019Neill to investigate the performance [of the commission], . . . The bill, which represents a compromise among many of the groups and individuals involved in this very important area, makes some major changes in the current law . . . and very essentially places time frames on each of the developments that must occur before a complaint is finally resolved. It provides that the respondent <em>must </em>answer a complaint within [fifteen] days of when he is served, provides that an investigation <em>must </em>commence right away, that a finding and conclusion <em>must </em>be reached within nine months . . . and that within [ninety] days of a finding of reasonable cause, there <em>must </em>be either a hearing held, or the conciliation process <em>must </em>have reached a settlement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 32 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1989 Sess., pp. 4150-52. For complaint resolution in the administrative setting to be effective, the legislature understood that resolution of these matters had to be expeditious. It recognized that justice delayed is justice denied. Id., pp. 4150-51. Accordingly, Senator Blumenthal concluded with the \u201c[hope] that [this bill] will move Connecticut forward in terms of providing a more expeditious, fair, timely resolution of civil rights complaints . . . .\u201d Id., pp. 4152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Our conclusion is reinforced by the legislative history of prior amendments made in 1991. Once again, speak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ing on behalf of the proposals, Representative Coleman stated that \u201c[t]he [commission] is in the nature of an administrative agency and the purpose of the administrative agency is to expeditiously resolve some complaints in more of an informal nature than the court system would allow. If complaints which are filed with [the commission] are going to linger and not be resolved expeditiously I think it\u2019s only fair to the parties that they have the full access of the court system.\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 23, 1991 Sess., pp. 8917-18. Consequently, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 46a-101 requiring the executive director of the commission to issue a release allowing the complainant to bring a civil action when the complaint is still pending with the commission after the expiration of 210 days from the date of its filing. It is noteworthy that the original version of the amendment had provided that the commission \u201cmay\u201d dismiss an action following the commencement of a civil action in the Superior Court when a release has been granted. In order to respond to concerns that a discretionary dismissal could lead to jurisdiction in two forums, the statute was amended to provide that the commission \u201cshall\u201d dismiss the case to make dismissal mandatory in order to foreclose the possibility of jurisdiction existing in two places. 34 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 8926. On the basis of this legislative history, and of the statute\u2019s language and its context, we conclude that the legislature considered the word \u201cshall\u201d to be mandatory in the context of the discriminatory practice and complaint procedure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Finally, the commission\u2019s argument that due process requires that it maintain the ability to process the complaint based upon <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 102 S. Ct. 1148, 71 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1982), is equally unconvincing. \u201c[T]he due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions require that one subject to significant deprivation of liberty or property must be accorded adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. . . . We note, however, that [d]ue process, unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances. . . . [D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>222 Conn. 233, 242, 610 A.2d 574 (1992). The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Logan, </em>first determined that the right to use the adjudicatory procedures of a state antidiscrimination agency is a property interest protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>supra, 428-30. Accordingly, the court held that <em>some form of hearing </em>under the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Act was required to allow a civil rights complainant to redress instances of discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tion and to be afforded damages flowing from such wrongs. Id., 433-34. The court further acknowledged that this substantial interest could not be denied on the basis of agency action over which the complaining party had no control. Id., 436. Consequently, the court held that a ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court interpreting as mandatory a state statute requiring the Illinois fair employment practices commission to schedule a fact-finding conference within 120 days of the filing of a complaint violated the complainant\u2019s right to due process. Id., 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The plaintiff in the case before us responds that because Hyde, the complainant, can bring a civil action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-101 et seq., which affords greater relief than \u00a7 46a-86 (a), the due process rights of both the complainant and the respondent are protected. We agree with the plaintiff. In <em>Logan, </em>the court specifically noted that the Equal Opportunities for the Handicapped Act, which otherwise would have provided the claimant with the right to bring a civil action, had been repealed. Id., 435-36 n.9. Furthermore, even for claims accruing under that act prior to the repeal date, the court remarked that it was \u201cnot clear . . . that such an action is available to [the claimant] .... We . . . hesitate to remit [the claimant] to so speculative a remedy.\u201d Id. In contrast, there is no claim in the present case that the civil action available to Hyde is constitutionally inadequate. On the contrary, as the plaintiff points out, Hyde is entitled to greater damages following a civil action than she could otherwise recover under General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (a) for a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60. <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995) (damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees not authorized under \u00a7 46a-86 [a] for discriminatory employment practices). Therefore, Hyde will receive an adequate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>meaningful opportunity to present her case as is required by due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Therefore, under well established principles of statutory construction, we conclude that the legislature\u2019s intent can best be implemented by a determination that the time limits set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) are mandatory. Consequently, they must be strictly complied with. <em>Okee Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>225 Conn. 367, 373, 623 A.2d 483 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The commission\u2019s second contention, that its failure to comply with these time limits does not divest it of jurisdiction, depends <em>exclusively </em>on its argument that those limitations are directory and not mandatory. Consequently, the second and fourth reserved questions regarding whether the failure to follow the procedure prescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) leaves the commission incompetent to entertain the complaint are likewise resolved in the plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The answer to all four reserved questions is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"AbS\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> We note that, although the 1991 revisions of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 and 46a-84 were in effect when the injury occurred; see <em>Six </em>v. <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co., </em>235 Conn. 790, 792 n.1, 669 A.2d 1214 (1996) (\u201c \u2018we look to 1he statute in effect at the date of injury to determine the rights and obligations between the parties\u2019 \u201d); because the parties\u2019 reservation of issues refers to the 1993 revisions and because the provisions are substantively identical, we will use the 1993 revisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 46a-83 and 46a-84 in our discussion. Furthermore, although No. 94-238 of the 1994 Public Acts recodified \u00a7 46a-83 (b) as \u00a7 46a-83 (d), because the parties\u2019 reservation of issues references this section as it existed in 1993, we refer to \u00a7 46a-83 (b) throughout this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46a-83 provides in relevant part: \u201cComplaint: Investigation; conciliation; disclosure; subpoena; default order, (a) Within ten days after the filing of any discriminatory practice complaint, or an amendment adding an additional respondent, the commission shall cause the complaint to be served upon the respondent together with a notice (1) identifying the alleged discriminatory practice, and (2) advising of the procedural rights and obligations of a respondent under this chapter.
