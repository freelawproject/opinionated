The plaintiff brought this action seeking damages for his allegedly wrongful suspension by the board. Following a six week trial, the jury found for the plaintiff on all counts and awarded him $550,000. Upon the motion of the defendants, the trial court set aside the jmy verdict and rendered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The plaintiff was hired as a police officer by the borough of Naugatuck (borough) in 1965. After several promotions within the department, the plaintiff, on March 5,1985, was appointed an administrative captain. Shortly thereafter, however, on July 1,1985, the plaintiff took an extended medical leave of absence from the department due to a claimed stress disorder and did not return to work until March 17, 1987.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Subsequent to the plaintiffs promotion to administrative captain and while he was on leave from the department, the board initiated an investigation into allegations that the plaintiff had violated certain departmental rules and regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In November, 1986, Kevin McSherry, the attorney retained by the borough to conduct the investigation, presented the board with a list of allegations against the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board, however, took no formal action on the allegations at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Shortly before the plaintiffs return to active duty on March 17, 1987,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> McSherry presented the board with a second set of allegations against the plaintiff, and on March 18,1987, the board met to determine what action, if any, to take with respect to those allegations. At that meeting, which was attended by the plaintiff and his attorney, the board voted to file formal charges against the plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board also voted to suspend the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tiff, with pay, pending a resolution of the charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On May 31, 1988, the board presented the plaintiff with a revised list of charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Prior to the commencement of a formal hearing on those charges, however, the board informed the plaintiff that it would proceed on only four of the allegations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, on March 7,1989,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> hearings on the remaining charges were commenced.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearings, in August, 1989, the board dismissed all four charges and reinstated the plaintiff to active duty as administrative captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Prior to the commencement of the hearings, the plaintiff, on June 16,1988, initiated this action, claiming that the filing of the charges and his suspension by the board were the result of a politically motivated vendetta against him by the borough\u2019s mayor, Terry Buckmiller, who was also a member of the board.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the first count of his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he had been suspended without just cause in violation of the collective bargaining agreement between the borough and the plaintiffs union, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 385.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the second count of the complaint, he alleged that the board had committed a \u201cwilful, wanton, capricious and illegal\u201d breach of the collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> by entertaining charges against him that were predicated upon an unsworn citizen\u2019s complaint<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> contrary to article XXII, \u00a7 22.05, of the agreement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the remaining three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>counts,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> all brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the plaintiff alleged that the board had: (1) suspended him without just cause in violation of his right to procedural due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution; (2) violated his right to substantive due process under the federal and state constitutions by proceeding against him in a \u201cwilful, arbitrary and capricious\u201d manner; and (3) improperly singled him out for administrative action in violation of his right to the equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 20, of the state constitution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought permanent reinstatement to active duty as administrative captain, compensatory and punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The jury found in favor of the plaintiff on all counts, awarding him compensatory and punitive damages in the amount of $430,000 against the board, $90,000 against Buckmiller, and $6000 each against Prior, DeCarlo, Sharon, Mason and Jancis. At the conclusion of the trial, however, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict with respect to each count. As to the plaintiffs two common law claims, the trial court concluded that it lacked subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>jurisdiction over those counts because the plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the collective bargaining agreement. The trial court also set aside the verdict with respect to the plaintiffs three claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, concluding that, as to his due process claims, the plaintiff had failed to establish that the defendants\u2019 actions had deprived him of a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest and, as to his equal protection claim, the plaintiff had not proved that the board had treated him differently from others similarly situated.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict with respect to each of the five counts. Because we agree with the trial court that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief on any of his claims as a matter of law, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The plaintiff maintains that the trial court improperly set aside the verdict with respect to the breach of contract and tortious breach of contract counts of his complaint.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Specifically, he argues that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over those claims because he had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him under the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In support of this argument, the plaintiff asserts that he should be excused for failing to exhaust his administrative remedies both because it would have been futile for him to do so and because those remedies were inadequate in light of the relief he sought. We agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs failure to exhaust his administrative remedies deprived the court of jurisdiction over his common law claims.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Article XXI of the collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> establishes a three-step grievance procedure for employees who have been subjected to disciplinary action, including discharge or suspension. Under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>procedure, an employee who wishes to challenge the imposition of any disciplinary measure must first file a grievance with the chief of police, who is required to render a written decision within seven days of receipt of the grievance. If dissatisfied with the decision of the police chief, the employee may then seek relief from the board, which must consider the matter at its next regularly scheduled meeting and render its decision no later than seven days thereafter.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Finally, if the employee does not agree with the board\u2019s decision, the employee\u2019s union is authorized to submit the grievance to the state board of mediation and arbitration, whose decision is final and binding on the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u201cIt is well settled under both federal and state law that, before resort to the courts is allowed, an employee must at least attempt to exhaust exclusive grievance and arbitration procedures, such as those contained in the collective bargaining agreement between the defendant and the plaintiffs\u2019 union. . . . Failure to exhaust the grievance procedures deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Labbe </em>v. <em>Pension Commission, </em>229 Conn. 801, 811, 643 A.2d 1268 (1994). \u201cThe purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to encourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the use of grievance procedures, rather than the courts, for settling disputes. A contrary rule which would permit an individual employee to completely sidestep available grievance procedures in favor of a lawsuit has little to commend it. . . . [I]t would deprive employer and union of the ability to establish a uniform and exclusive method for orderly settlement of employee grievances. If a grievance procedure cannot be made exclusive, it loses much of its desirability as a method of settlement. A rule creating such a situation would inevitably exert a disruptive influence upon both the negotiation and administration of collective [bargaining] agreements.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 811-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Despite the important public policy considerations underlying the exhaustion requirement, we have \u201c \u2018grudgingly carved several exceptions\u2019 from the exhaustion doctrine.\u201d <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 241, 502 A.2d 410 (1985). We have recognized such exceptions, however, \u201conly infrequently and only for narrowly defined purposes.\u201d <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>199 Conn. 70, 79, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986); see <em>also Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>227 Conn. 545, 561, 630 A.2d 1304 (1993). One of the limited exceptions to the exhaustion rule arises when recourse to the administrative remedy would be demonstrably futile or inadequate. <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 419, 429, 655 A.2d 1121 (1995); <em>Labbe </em>v. <em>Pension Commission, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The plaintiff contends that his claim falls within this exception and, therefore, that he should be excused for failing to exhaust the remedies available to him under the collective bargaining agreement for two reasons. He contends, first, that it would have been futile for him to have sought reinstatement to active duty through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the contractual grievance mechanism because of the board\u2019s animus toward him. Second, he maintains that the administrative remedy available to him would have been inadequate because neither the police chief, the mayor, the board nor the state board of mediation and arbitration was authorized to grant him the relief that he sought for the defendants\u2019 allegedly tortious breach of contract, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The plaintiffs first contention requires little discussion. As we have previously stated, \u201c \u2018[i]t is futile to seek [an administrative] remedy only when such action could not result in a favorable decision and invariably would result in further judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>234 Conn. 498, 507, 661 A.2d 1018 (1995); <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 429. In this case, the board, after conducting a hearing on the charges, found <em>in favor of the plaintiff </em>and reinstated him to active duty.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, had the plaintiff challenged his suspension under the first step of the grievance procedure, the chief of police might well have reinstated him to active duty immediately.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It can hardly be argued, therefore, that recourse to the grievance mechanism would necessarily have been futile.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>With respect to the plaintiffs second argument, we may assume that he is correct in asserting that the grievance provisions of the collective bargaining agreement do not allow for an award of punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees or costs, relief to which the plaintiff might have been entitled upon proof of \u201cwilful, wanton, capricious and illegal\u201d conduct by the defendants.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that the plaintiffs administrative remedies were inadequate. Had the plaintiff availed himself of his grievance rights under the collective bargaining agreement, he would have received \u201cimmediate consideration and review of the very issue of wrongful [suspension] that the plaintiff raises in this action.\u201d <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 84. Indeed, the charges underlying the plaintiffs claim of tortious breach of contract were withdrawn by the board prior to the commencement of the hearings before it. See footnotes 8 and 9. In such circumstances, the administrative remedies available to him cannot fairly be described as deficient. \u201cIt is not the plaintiffs preference for a particular remedy that determines whether the remedy ... is adequate; see, e.g., <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>[173 Conn. 352, 357, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977)]; and an administrative remedy, in order to be \u2018adequate,\u2019 need not comport with the plaintiffs\u2019 opinion of what a perfect remedy would be.\u201d <em>Connecticut Mobile Home Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Jensen\u2019s, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 586, 590, 424 A.2d 285 (1979); see also <em>Savoy </em>Laundry, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Conn. App. 636, 630 A.2d 159, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 931, 632 A.2d 704 (1993) (administrative remedies available to plaintiff under statute not inadequate, despite fact that complaint sought relief, including punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees, not available under statutory scheme, where essence of plaintiffs claim involved matter within authority vested in administrative agency). Moreover, once the plaintiff had exhausted his administrative remedies, he could then have sought redress in court.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">A contrary conclusion would allow an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement to circumvent the contract\u2019s grievance mechanism simply by seeking relief outside the scope of that agreement. Such a result would undermine the state\u2019s policy favoring recourse to contract grievance procedures as a means of dispute resolution; see <em>School Administrators Assn. </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>200 Conn. 376, 381, 511 A.2d 1012 (1986); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>195 Conn. 266, 270, 487 A.2d 553 (1985); and would defeat the express intent of the parties to the collective bargaining agreement that the grievance mechanism be utilized to settle such claims and disputes as expeditiously as possible.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, as the Appellate Court has recently stated in rejecting a claim indistinguishable from that raised by the plaintiff in this case, \u201c[t] he plaintiff may not choose [his] administrative remedy through the framing of [his] own complaint. If that were possible, the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine would be thwarted.\u201d <em>Savoy Laundry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 642. We conclude, therefore, that because the grievance mechanism of the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>lective bargaining agreement provided the plaintiff with a full, fair and immediate opportunity to challenge the defendants\u2019 actions, his claim of an inadequate administrative remedy must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The plaintiff also contends that the trial court improperly set aside the verdict with respect to his procedural due process claim. Specifically, he asserts that the evidence adduced at trial supported a finding that the defendants\u2019 actions unfairly deprived him of constitutionally protected property or liberty interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u201cUnder <em>Board of Regents </em>v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972), and <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 33 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1972), aplaintiff claiming due process protection under the Fourteenth Amendment must possess a \u2018property\u2019 or \u2018liberty\u2019 interest that is somehow jeopardized by governmental action, necessitating a pre- or post-deprivation hearing as a safeguard.\u201d <em>Dobosz </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>892 F.2d 1135, 1140 (2d Cir. 1989). However, \u201c[t]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions.\u201d <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 350, 96 S. Ct. 2074, 48 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1976). \u201cAn interest protected or cognizable under the due process clause must have a basis in existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 437-38, 650 A.2d 557 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Thus, \u201c[property interests are more than abstract needs, desires or unilateral expectations of benefits or privileges. Rather, a person must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to a benefit or privilege to have a property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>interest in that benefit. . . . Property interests are not created by the Constitution, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harkless </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>232 Conn. 599, 618, 657 A.2d 562 (1995). Similarly, \u201cunder <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, [710-12] 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976), government acts defaming an individual implicate a liberty interest only where the individual suffers a related alteration of his legal status or deprivation of a right recognized under state law.\u201d <em>Dobosz </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>supra, 892 F.2d 1140. Accordingly, \u201cdamage to reputation alone is insufficient to establish a claim for harm to a liberty interest .... [A] cognizable claim will lie [only] if a plaintiff can show loss of reputation plus some serious additional harm, such as loss of employment, as a result of defamatory remarks by a government official.\u201d <em>Komlosi </em>v. <em>New York Office of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities, </em>64 F.3d 810, 817 (2d Cir. 1995). With these principles in mind, we turn to the plaintiffs constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Because, under state law, a police officer in the borough of Naugatuck may not be removed from office except for cause,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the plaintiff had a constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment with the department. See <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 430, 102 S. Ct. 1148, 71 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1982) (\u201c[t]he hallmark of property ... is an individual entitlement grounded in state law, which cannot be removed except \u2018for cause\u2019 \u201d); <em>Clisham </em>v. <em>Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>of Police Commissioners, </em>223 Conn. 354, 360-61, 613 A.2d 254 (1992) (Naugatuck police chief who could not be terminated without just cause had protected property interest in employment). At all times during his suspension, however, the plaintiff remained in the employ of the department, and he received full pay and benefits. The plaintiff points to no state law entitlement preventing his suspension with pay, nor has he identified any authority, in this jurisdiction or elsewhere, to support the contention that a public employer who suspends an employee with pay may nevertheless violate due process protections. On the contrary, courts have consistently concluded that a suspension with pay does not implicate an employee\u2019s constitutionally protected property interest.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Swick </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>11 F.3d 85, 87 (7th Cir. 1993); <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Watonga, </em>942 F.2d 737, 746 n.4 (10th Cir. 1991); <em>Royster </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>774 F.2d 618, 621 (4th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1121, 106 S. Ct. 1638, 90 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1986); <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Lauer, </em>888 F. Sup. 616, 619-20 (D.N.J. 1995); <em>Gardetto </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>854 F. Sup. 1520, 1534 (D. Wyo. 1994); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>McConologue, </em>820 F. Sup. 70, 72-73 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); <em>Weg </em>v. <em>Macchiarola, </em>729 F. Sup. 328, 337 (S.D.N.Y. 1990); <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Sicaras, </em>706 F. Sup. 169, 172-73 (D. Conn. 1989); <em>Carlsbad Board of Education </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>118 N.M. 470, 477, 882 P.2d 511 (1994). We agree with these decisions and conclude that the plaintiffs property interest in his continued employment was properly safeguarded by virtue of the fact that he was fully compensated during his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Although the plaintiff concedes that he received full pay during the entirety of his suspension, he claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that his property rights were nevertheless implicated because he was deprived of certain other employment opportunities and benefits during that period. In particular, he contends that he lost the opportunity to seek a promotion to deputy chief and to receive private duty wages and the personal use of a police vehicle. The plaintiff, however, has failed to establish a legitimate claim of entitlement to any of these benefits or opportunities; neither the hope for professional advancement<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> nor a unilateral anticipation of possible job-related perquisites gives rise to a constitutionally protected property interest. See <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Sicaras, </em>supra, 706 F. Sup. 172. Because the constitutional guarantees of due process apply only when the state \u201cseeks to remove or significantly alter [an individual\u2019s] protected status\u201d; <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 424 U.S. 711; the plaintiff cannot prevail on this claim of a constitutional deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Furthermore, even if the plaintiffs suspension with pay did carry constitutional ramifications, we are satisfied that the postsuspension hearing was adequate to safeguard his rights. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court [has] set forth three factors to consider when analyzing whether an individual is constitutionally entitled to a particular judicial or administrative procedure: \u2018First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>procedural requirement would entail.\u2019 <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976).\u201d <em>Scinto </em>v. <em>Stamm, </em>224 Conn. 524, 535, 620 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 861, 114 S. Ct. 176, 126 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1993). In this case, the interest of the plaintiff affected by the suspension was his desire to remain on the job. Though not without significance, the plaintiffs preference to remain on active duty can hardly be characterized as overriding in light of the borough\u2019s strong interest in the efficient administration of the police department, the need for public confidence in its police force and the hearing rights afforded the plaintiff after his suspension. Thus, while an employee with an enforceable expectation of continued public employment must be given the opportunity for a hearing prior to <em>termination </em>of that employment; <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L.

On the contrary, not only did he retain his position, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>with full pay, during the entire period of his suspension, he was eventually reinstated to active duty as administrative captain \u2014 a position from which he may not be removed without just cause.

We agree with the trial court that the evidence was not sufficient to establish an equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u201cThe concept of equal protection [under the state and federal constitutions] has been traditionally viewed as requiring the uniform treatment of persons standing in the same relation to the governmental action questioned or challenged. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 423, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); see also <em>Broadley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>229 Conn. 1, 8, 639 A.2d 502 (1994). When, as here, a claimed equal protection violation arises from the alleged selective application of a facially neutral state regulation, it must be shown that \u201c(1) the person, compared with others similarly situated, was selectively treated, and (2) the selective treatment was motivated by an intention to discriminate on the basis of impermissible considerations, such as race or religion, to punish or inhibit the exercise of constitutional rights, or by a malicious or bad faith intent to injure the person. <em>Wayte </em>v. <em>United States, </em>470 U.S. 598, 608-609, 105 S.

In support of this contention, the plaintiff adduced evidence at trial that Long was never subjected to any disciplinary action by the board even though he, like the plaintiff and other members of the department, had been mentioned in the report of a state grand juror investigating allegations of official misconduct in the borough.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The plaintiff points to no other evidence tending to prove that Long was deserving of administrative action by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The plaintiffs proof fell far short of satisfying the requirement that he, <em>\u201ccompared with others similarly situated,\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added) <em>FSK Drug Corp. </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>supra, 960 F.2d 10; was selectively treated. No evidence whatsoever was introduced at trial to demonstrate that Long had committed any improprieties warranting review or discipline by the board, or that any formal accusations of wrongdoing had ever been made against him. In the absence of any such evidence, the jury could not reasonably have concluded that Long and the plaintiff were equally deserving of administrative action. Consequently, no equal protection barrier existed prohibiting the board from treating the two men differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Furthermore, the plaintiff failed to establish that any other similarly situated member of the department had received more favorable or more lenient treatment by the defendants than he had received.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In fact, the undisputed evidence revealed exactly the opposite: immediately prior to its hearings on the allegations against the plaintiff, the board, also acting on the basis of charges stemming from an investigation by a borough attorney and after a lengthy series of hearings, voted to <em>dismiss </em>the chief of police, Dennis Clisham.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The sanction imposed by the board against Clisham, which was much more serious than its actions against the plaintiff, belies the plaintiffs claim of disparate treatment. Thus, the evidence at trial, far from establishing that the plaintiff had been subjected to unequal treatment, convincingly demonstrated that he had not been singled out for harsh treatment by the defendants. Because the verdict with respect to the plaintiffs equal protection claim was palpably against the evidence, the trial court also properly set aside that portion of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In this opinion PETERS, C.

In support of this claim, the plaintiff argues that the board, in addressing the charges filed against him, also necessarily resolved the issue of his suspension, the same question that it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>considered at a second step grievance hearing. The fact is, however, that the plaintiff never invoked the contractual grievance mechanism and its expedited timetable for the resolution of disputes between employer and employee. Moreover, the plaintiff failed to seek relief from the chief of police as mandated under the first step of the grievance procedure. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs contention that he did, in effect, exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> The collective bargaining agreement does not, by its terms, provide a basis for any such relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> We intimate no view, however, as to whether the plaintiff had standing to bring suit under the collective bargaining agreement.

The plaintiff, however, does not persuasively contend that, these allegations support his equal protection claim. First, the allegations were never proven. Second, in each case, the alleged actions of the two department employees were purportedly undertaken at the direction of the plaintiff, their supervisor. Finally, neither the detective nor the police mechanic held a supervisory position similar to that of the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> In December, 1987, Clisham was notified by the board that he was being charged with eleven violations of the rules and regulations of the Naugatuck police department. Hearings on those charges were conducted by the board from December 15, 1987, until February 14, 1989, at which time the board dismissed Clisham as police chief. Clisham appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, claiming that certain members of the board had prejudged his case, and the trial court dismissed his appeal. On appeal to this court, we reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that Clisham was entitled to a new hearing before an impartial panel. <em>Clisham </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 354.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b468-7\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVm\">dissenting. It is obvious, as demonstrated by its award of $550,000 for compensatory and punitive damages, that the jury in this action was outraged with the political vendetta carried out by the defendant board of police commissioners (board) against the plaintiff, police officer Thomas Hunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">I agree that, generally, an employee who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement must, except as provided by statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> first challenge an employment action through the grievance procedure provided in the agreement. But, as noted by the majority, this court has \u201c <em>\u2018grudgingly </em>carved several exceptions\u2019 from the exhaustion doctrine.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 241, 502 A.2d 410 (1985). \u201c \u2018Among the exceptions is where recourse to the administrative remedy would be futile or inadequate . . . .\u2019 An administrative remedy is futile or inadequate if the agency [or grievance procedure] is without the authority to grant the requested relief.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 628, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In this case, with respect to the two contract counts of the complaint, the plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract and tortious interference with his contractual rights. Predicated on his suspension as a police officer and the groundless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>allegations of misconduct made by the members of the board, the plaintiff had a reasonable basis for pursuing those causes of action and, as the majority concedes, the administrative process could not have provided the plaintiff with punitive damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the administrative process was incapable of providing adequate relief, merely pursuing the contractual grievance procedure would have been an ineffectual act. Therefore, although the plaintiff simultaneously pursued his administrative remedies,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was exempt from the requirement mandating the exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to invoking the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Notwithstanding its concessions, the majority believes that \u201c[a] contrary conclusion would allow an employee covered by a collective bar-gaining agreement to circumvent the contract\u2019s grievance mechanism simply by seeking relief outside the scope of that agreement.\u201d I disagree. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 142 and 143, an action brought in the Superior Court, when the administrative remedy is adequate, can be summarily dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, an employee who brings vexatious litigation \u2014 that is, a suit initiated without probable cause \u2014 may be subject to liability. <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>176 Conn. 353, 356, 407 A.2d 982 (1978). Therefore, the continued recognition and application of the \u201cinadequate remedy\u201d exception will not improperly flood the Superior Court with collective bargaining agreement disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>In this case, the plaintiff alleged a contractual violation and tortious breach of contract. The plaintiff claimed, and the jury believed, that he was the target of a political vendetta and that the board did not have reasonable cause to prohibit him from returning to work, nor did it have reasonable cause to suspend him. In September, 1986, after being absent from work because of a stress disorder, the plaintiff was not allowed to return to work because of alleged charges against him for violating departmental rules and regulations. The plaintiff was eventually presented, though never formally charged, with these allegations in November, 1986.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notwithstanding these charges, in February, 1987, the board voted to allow the plaintiff to return to work. The chairperson of the board, however, failed to take action with respect to this vote. Consequently, on March 2, 1987, the plaintiff was compelled to initiate a writ of mandamus to compel the chairperson to act. Finally, on March 17, 1987, the plaintiff was allowed to return to work. On March 18,1987, the board voted to charge the plaintiff formally with several counts of misconduct and to suspend him with pay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Approximately one year later, a substitute set of charges was brought against the plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ultimately, in August, 1989, the plaintiff was exonerated of all administrative charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">For these reasons, it was proper for the plaintiff to seek punitive damages. Because punitive damages were not available to the plaintiff under the collective bargaining agreement, the majority\u2019s reliance on the traditional exhaustion requirement is misplaced and the plaintiff was not required to exhaust the agreement\u2019s grievance procedure before instituting his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the plaintiffs claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, regarding his liberty interest in his reputation. In my opinion, the plaintiff has properly alleged a due process violation because a jury could reasonably find that his reputation was tarnished due to the actions taken by the board against him. As a result of the board\u2019s actions, 106 newspaper articles were written about the plaintiff and the allegations of misconduct brought against him. Without a doubt, a jury could have reasonably concluded, and did in fact conclude, that these articles damaged his reputation in the community and affected his legal status.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">I am aware that the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701-10, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976), narrowed the holding of <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 437, 91 S. Ct. 507, 27 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1971), with respect to the protection of reputation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court in <em>Paul </em>held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>to succeed under a \u00a7 1983 action for damages for injury to reputation, there must be, in addition to defamation, some \u201cright or status previously recognized by state law [that] was distinctly <em>altered </em>or extinguished.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 711; see <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 574-76, 95 S. Ct. 729, 42 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1975) (suspension from school based upon charges of misconduct could trigger procedural guarantees of fourteenth amendment). In this case, not only did the board subject the plaintiff to numerous allegations of misconduct, of which he was ultimately exonerated, but for three years he was suspended from his position as assistant chief of police, a position from which he could not be removed except for just cause. Although the plaintiff received his salary during the period of suspension, he was nevertheless deprived of his official position, thereby satisfying the stricter standards of <em>Paul.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Notwithstanding the satisfaction of the <em>Paul </em>standards, Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent in that case appropriately addresses the majority\u2019s analysis of the plaintiffs injury: \u201cI have always thought that one of this Court\u2019s most important roles is to provide a formidable bulwark against governmental violation of the constitutional safeguards securing in our free society the legitimate expectations of every person to innate human dignity and sense of worth. It is a regrettable abdication of that role and a saddening denigration of our majestic Bill of Rights when the Court tolerates arbitrary and capricious official conduct branding an individual as a criminal without compliance with constitutional procedures designed to ensure the fair and impartial ascertainment of criminal culpability. Today\u2019s decision must surely be a short-lived aberration.\u201d <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 424 U.S. 734-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-51bb provides in relevant part: \u201cNo employee shall be denied the right to pursue, in a court of competent jurisdiction, a cause of action arising under the state or federal constitution or under a state statute solely because the employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d See <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 475, 481, 628 A.2d 946 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\"> Moreover, the majority acknowledges that the plaintiff could have pursued additional relief after the administrative process was completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> On March 18,1987, Ihe plaintiff was formally charged with several allegations of misconduct.
