In this certified appeal, the only issue is whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court did not commit reversible error in its jury instructions on the scope of the statutory duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The plaintiffs, Maria Gajewski, Jan Gajewski and Janusz Gajewski, filed a multicount complaint against a number of defendants, including Utica Radiator Corporation (Utica), to recover for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. The jury returned a verdict resolving all claims in favor of the defendants. The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict and rendered judgment for the defendants. On appeal, the Appellate Court first concluded that the judgment should be affirmed in accordance with the general verdict rule. <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>32 Conn. App. 373, 375, 629 A.2d 465 (1993). After reversal by this court; <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>229 Conn. 829, 643 A.2d 1276 (1994); the Appellate Court considered the underlying merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, and again affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Gajewski </em>v. <em>Pavelo, </em>36 Conn. App. 601, 652 A.2d 509 (1994). We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification with respect to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s instructions on the statutory duty to warn established by \u00a7 52-572q.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>As the Appellate Court noted, the jury reasonably could have found that the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs were caused by poisonous gases resulting from a buildup of soot in a chimney flue in their home. This buildup of soot prevented their furnace from venting properly. The furnace had recently been equipped with a new gas fired boiler manufactured by Utica. The gas boiler was installed by a licensed plumber who, as part of the installation process, cleaned the chimney sufficiently to render the furnace operational. At that time, the plumber warned the plaintiffs of the necessity of having the chimney cleaned thoroughly. Utica itself, however, did not warn the plaintiffs directly of this necessity. Id., 606. In instructing the jury with respect to Utica\u2019s liability in these circumstances, the trial court informed the jury that, if it found that Utica had a duty to warn the plaintiffs, it could consider the plumber\u2019s professional knowledge and skills in its assessment of whether Utica had effectively discharged its duty. Id., 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The plaintiffs maintain that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions with respect to Utica\u2019s duty to warn them were: (1) improper as a matter of law under \u00a7 52-572q, and (2) internally inconsistent and inherently confusing. They argue that the Appellate Court misunderstood or overlooked their claims and therefore improperly upheld the judgment against them. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">After examining the record on appeal, and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed. The issue on which we granted certification was properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive opinion of the Appellate Court. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained.
