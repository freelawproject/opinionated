He first claims that: (1) the trial court improperly concluded that he had failed to make a sufficient preliminary showing, under the relevant state law standard, to warrant its in camera inspection of certain confidential records of two state\u2019s witnesses; (2) alternatively, the trial court improperly prevented him from making the requisite preliminary showing; and (3) the trial court improperly failed to secure for the record certain of the privileged records to which he sought access. He next claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his murder conviction because: (1) there was insufficient evidence of his intent to kill the victim; and (2) the evidence failed to establish that he, and not the state\u2019s two key witnesses, killed the victim. Finally, he claims that the trial court improperly: (1) admitted certain testimony; (2) admitted certain physical evidence; and (3) limited his cross-examination of a state\u2019s witness. We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The court reasonably could have found the following facts. During the evening of July 17,1991, David Rusinko <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>was killed while \u201cpartying\u201d at an isolated cabin in New Hartford with the defendant, Brian Bingham and Cara Ignacak. At that time, Rusinko and the defendant were both in their mid thirties and had been friends for many years. Bingham, then sixteen years old, had been a frequent drinking companion of the defendant for several months. Bingham and the defendant often visited the property of an abandoned summer camp that abutted the defendant\u2019s home, which consisted of 175 acres of wooded property and a number of structures, including a garage-like structure known as the \u201clower camp,\u201d and a three room cabin with a porch known as the \u201cupper camp.\u201d Bingham was also acquainted with Rusinko, who was a neighbor, and they occasionally socialized together. Ignacak, then eighteen or nineteen years old, had been Bingham\u2019s girlfriend of three and one-half weeks. She had known Bingham from high school for approximately two years before they started dating, had met the defendant several times during the few weeks she and Bingham had been dating, and had met Rusinko for the first time on the day that he was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">During the afternoon of July 17,1991, Bingham sought out Rusinko in New Hartford to ask him to buy liquor and to meet him later that evening, which Rusinko agreed to do. At approximately 6 p.m., Bingham and Ignacak went to the defendant\u2019s home and the three went to the lower camp. While there, the defendant told them that he was angry at Rusinko for his role both in the defendant\u2019s most recent conviction for drunk driving<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in a problem with a drug deal, and that he wanted to kill Rusinko.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The defendant and Bingham left the lower camp at 7:30 p.m. on Bingham\u2019s motorcycle to buy liquor and to meet Rusinko and invite him to spend the evening with them. They met Rusinko on the road and he agreed to join them and continued on to the lower camp on his bicycle. The defendant and Bingham returned a few minutes later with beer and vodka, and the four remained there for a short time drinking and talking. According to Bingham, the defendant, while at the lower camp, asked him to step in and help if Rusinko started to get the best of him in a fight, and Bingham agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">At approximately 8 p.m., the group moved to the cabin at the upper camp. Shortly after their arrival, while Rusinko was inside the cabin, the defendant joined Bingham and Ignacak on the porch and again told them that he intended to harm Rusinko. Shortly thereafter, the defendant began yelling at and shoving Rusinko, but stopped when Ignacak suffered a seizure of some sort. After Ignacak had recovered, the altercation between the defendant and Rusinko resumed, and Bingham stepped in and knocked Rusinko to the floor. The defendant and Bingham then proceeded to beat Rusinko into unconsciousness, first by punching and kicking him, and then by hitting him with pieces of metal pipe that had been lying about the cabin. The defendant next attempted to break Rusinko\u2019s neck and, when that failed, slashed his throat. When it appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>that Rusinko was dead, the defendant and Bingham rolled his body into the fire in the cabin\u2019s fireplace, along with the steel pipes used to beat him, glass beer bottles and the defendant\u2019s sneakers. At approximately 11:30 p.m., when Rusinko\u2019s body was \u201cstarting to bubble,\u201d Bingham and Ignacak left the cabin to bring Ignacak home. The defendant spent the night at the cabin.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The defendant and Bingham returned to the cabin one or two days later to dispose of Rusinko\u2019s remains and to conceal other evidence of the murder. They smashed Rusinko\u2019s bones in the fireplace, collected them into a plastic bag, and disposed of them in an outhouse at the camp. Police investigating the murder recovered a small amount of human skeletal remains from the outhouse, which were identified as Rusinko\u2019s. The defendant and Bingham also threw off the porch the steel pipes that had been burned in the fireplace, attempted to cover blood stains around the cabin with fresh paint, burned the porch railings and the plastic bag and, sometime later, disassembled and buried Rusinko\u2019s bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">At trial, the defendant testified in his own defense. He claimed that during the day and evening of the murder he had consumed a great deal of alcohol and Valium and, as a result, had experienced a blackout that evening at the upper camp, which left him unable to remember Rusinko\u2019s murder. He admitted to concealing the evidence of the murder with Bingham. His theories of defense were: (1) that Bingham and Ignacak had killed Rusinko without his participation;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) that, due to his consumption of alcohol and Valium preceding the murder, he had been unable to form the requisite specific intent to murder Rusinko. The trial court convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the defendant of all counts except conspiracy to commit murder, and denied his motions for acquittal <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and for a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additional facts will be discussed as they become relevant in the context of the defendant\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved for disclosure and an in camera examination of any psychiatric records of Ignacak and Bingham for the purpose of discovering material therein relevant to their abilities accurately to perceive, recall and relate events. To this end, he subpoenaed certain of their psychiatric and school records.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After the state completed its direct examination of each witness, the defendant renewed his motion and made an offer of proof in order to obtain an in camera inspection by the court of the records. The trial court concluded that the defendant had failed to provide a sufficient foundation to warrant further inquiry into the records of either witness and, therefore, denied his request for an in camera inspection. The trial court marked for identification and sealed for appellate review some, but not all, of the records sought by the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) the trial court improperly concluded that he had failed to make a sufficient preliminary showing to justify its in camera review of Ignacak\u2019s and Bingham\u2019s records; (2) alternatively, the trial court improperly prevented him from making a sufficient showing under the proper standard; and (3) the trial court improperly failed to mark for identification and to seal for appellate review certain of Bingham\u2019s records. We are persuaded only by the defendant\u2019s third contention and conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to preserve the records properly was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that his offers of proof were insufficient, under Connecticut law, to warrant its in camera inspection of Ignacak\u2019s and Bingham\u2019s psychiatric and special education records. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">It is well settled in this state that before a criminal defendant may obtain an in camera inspection of a witness\u2019 confidential records<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for purposes of impeach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ment, he or she must first demonstrate that \u201cthere is reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the information is likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation such that the witness\u2019 direct testimony should be stricken.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 179, 471 A.2d 949 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 59, 644 A.2d 887 (1994) (department of children and youth services records); <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 477, 625 A.2d 791 (1993) (records of treatment for substance abuse); <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 58, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990) (psychiatric and substance abuse treatment records); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 578, 560 A.2d 426 (1989) (school records); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>201 Conn. 211, 225, 514 A.2d 724 (1986), on appeal after remand, 208 Conn. 683, 546 A.2d 268 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1016, 109 S. Ct. 1131, 103 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1989) (psychiatric records); <em>In re Robert H., </em>199 Conn. 693, 708, 705 A.2d 475 (1986) (rape counseling records). Where, as here, the witness\u2019 records are sought for the purpose of obtaining evidence of a mental condition bearing on the witness\u2019 testimonial capacity, we require the defendant, who is afforded an opportunity to voir dire persons with knowledge of the contents of the records sought, to adduce a factual basis from which the trial court may conclude that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the records will reveal that \u201c \u2018at any pertinent time\u2019 [the witness\u2019 mental problem] affected his testimonial capacity \u2018to a sufficient degree to warrant further inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>supra, 59;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>also <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 226 (suggesting evidence of counseling for parent-child conflict would be inadequate to satisfy requirement for \u201c \u2018threshold showing that at any pertinent time [the complainant] had a mental problem which affected [his] testimonial capacity in any respect\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 180 (trial court properly denied in camera inspection because defendant failed to make threshold showing \u201cthat at any pertinent time [the victim] had a mental problem which affected her testimonial capacity in any respect, let alone to a sufficient degree to warrant further inquiry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The defendant called two witnesses in connection with his attempt to obtain an in camera inspection of Ignacak\u2019s records, Ignacak and S. Patricia Keener, the special education administrator at Ignacak\u2019s high school. Ignacak testified that she had been enrolled in a special education program during her senior year of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>high school because of her difficulty in learning academic subjects as rapidly as other students. In this context, she admitted to having trouble \u201crecalling things,\u201d but expressly denied that this difficulty interfered generally with her ability to recall or relate the events of her life. As to her history of psychiatric treatment, she testified that she had been treated at the psychiatric department of Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in 1987 or 1988, and had met with Kathy Wurkus, the school psychologist or social worker,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201con and off\u2019 for some time thereafter. Ignacak indicated that her treatment at Charlotte Hungerford had lasted for approximately three weeks on an inpatient basis, followed by treatment for a few months as an outpatient, and that her diagnosis from the hospital was that she suffered from a \u201c[mjild case of depression,\u201d for which she did not receive medication once she was released from the hospital. She stated that her ongoing consultation with Wurkus was due to problems she had experienced in getting along with other people, namely that \u201c [everybody just thought [she] was a prime target to beat up on.\u201d Ignacak also testified on cross-examination that she did not feel that her ability to recall events of her life was impaired, that she understood the obligation to be truthful and that she had never been told she was delusional, suffering from hallucinations or otherwise unaware of what was going on around her.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Keener confirmed that Ignacak had been enrolled in the department\u2019s academic classes, but stated that \u201cshe didn\u2019t really have any memory problems, or associative problems, or organizational problems. She had trouble sustaining a commitment to school, and she had trouble with the school rules. And she had interpersonal diffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>culties.\u201d Keener also indicated that someone at the school had referred Ignacak to Wurkus for emotional support and had suggested that Ignacak participate in two on-site programs offered by Charlotte Hungerford Hospital and New Britain General Hospital, in conjunction with their respective psychiatric departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The defendant argues that Ignacak\u2019s admitted memory and interpersonal problems, which he claims may have reflected an \u201cirrationality\u201d or \u201cirrational animosity\u201d toward others, combined with her concession on direct examination that there were inconsistencies in the several statements she gave to police,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> provided a sufficient factual basis to warrant an in camera review of her special education and psychiatric records.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In evaluating the sufficiency of the defendant\u2019s offer of proof, what is at issue is the existence of a mental problem that may bear on the witness\u2019 testimonial capacity, not the witness\u2019 general character or intelli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>gence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here, the defendant failed to demonstrate a connection, other than purely speculative, between the facts he relies on and Ignacak\u2019s ability to perceive, recall and relate the events surrounding Rusinko\u2019s murder. First, neither Ignacak\u2019s nor Keener\u2019s testimony suggested the presence at any pertinent time of significant cognitive deficiencies; Keener\u2019s testimony expressly contradicted such a conclusion and indicated that Ignacak\u2019s special academic needs were due to problems motivational and, relatedly, behavioral in nature. Next, the defendant argues that Ignacak\u2019s \u201cinterpersonal problems\u201d may have reflected \u201cirrationality\u201d on her part. We are not prepared to assume, however, that \u201cirrationality,\u201d affecting one\u2019s ability to perceive, recall and relate events, is an ordinary incident of \u201cinterpersonal problems,\u201d particularly as Ignacak characterized hers, and the defendant fails to offer any reliable basis upon which to make that association or to contradict Ignacak\u2019s own assessment of the nature of these problems. The defendant also fails to demonstrate that the condition for which Ignacak was treated in the Charlotte Hungerford Hospital psychiatric program three to four years before the murder was related in any way to her testimonial reliability. As the state points out, the defendant did not offer any evidence as to whether depression could affect Ignacak\u2019s ability to perceive, recall and relate events, and did not offer any evidence to contradict Ignacak\u2019s testimony regarding the extent of her mental health problems. Lastly, the defendant fails to offer any explanation as to how Ignacak\u2019s admission that she had initially lied to police regarding the events of Rusinko\u2019s murder, although relevant to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>credibility for truthfulness, could reasonably be taken as evidence of a mental problem affecting her <em>ability </em>to relate those events truthfully. We conclude, therefore, that, on this record, the defendant failed to establish a sufficient foundation from which the trial court must necessarily have concluded that there was a reasonable ground to believe that the records would yield evidence useful to Ignacak\u2019s impeachment concerning lack of capacity to remember and relate events, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied his request for an in camera inspection of her records.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">With regard to Bingham\u2019s records, the defendant called as witnesses Ian Bingham, Bingham\u2019s father, and Keener. Ian Bingham testified that his son had been living with him for approximately two years before the murder, during which time Bingham had run away to New York. He had been told that Bingham had used drugs involving needles while in New York and had observed track marks on his arms when he returned. Subsequently, he observed signs of Bingham\u2019s drinking, but had no knowledge of his taking any other drugs. After Bingham returned from New York, he entered a psychiatric treatment program at Mount Sinai Hospital. His father further testified that he was not sure what the purpose of the program had been, but believed that it had included treatment for substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Keener testified that Bingham was involved in his high school\u2019s special education program from the fall of 1989, after his treatment in the Mount Sinai Hospital program, to some time in 1991, when he dropped out of school. She stated that Bingham was considered by the school to be a \u201csocially] and emotional[ly] maladjusted and emotionally disturbed youngster,\u201d and that his emotional problems manifested themselves in his disregard of school rules, and his \u201cterrible time dealing with authority figures,\u201d including rudeness, disrespect and extensive disruption of the classroom. She stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>however, that he did not have problems with comprehension, that his responses to questions were appropriate, and that he did not have problems relating information.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The defendant argues that Bingham\u2019s emotional problems, substance abuse and having received psychiatric treatment provided a sufficient basis to warrant an in camera inspection of his special education and psychiatric records for evidence of a mental condition bearing on his testimonial capacity. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The defendant established only that Bingham was a youth with emotional and attitudinal problems that made the school experience difficult for him and for school officials who dealt with him, but did not, according to Keener, impair his testimonial abilities. With regard to his history of substance abuse and mental health treatment, the defendant established only that Bingham had been involved with drugs and had been treated in some type of substance abuse and psychiatric program approximately two years before the murder, and that he had continued to drink alcohol up until the time of the murder. However, \u201cwe have never held that a history of alcohol or drug abuse or treatment automatically makes a witness fair game for disclosure of psychiatric records to a criminal defendant\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 479; and the defendant fails to demonstrate how these facts might have affected Bingham\u2019s testimonial capacity in this case. We conclude, therefore, that, on this record, the defendant failed to establish a sufficient foundation from which the trial court must necessarily have concluded that there was a reasonable ground to believe that Bingham\u2019s records would yield evidence useful to his impeachment concerning lack of capacity to remember and relate events, and the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request for an in camera inspection of Bingham\u2019s special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>education and psychiatric records was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The defendant next claims, alternatively, that the trial court improperly precluded him from making the threshold showing required to warrant an in camera review of Ignacak\u2019s records in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights of confrontation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Specifically, he claims that the trial court improperly prevented him from: (1) inquiring of Ignacak and Keener about the nature of Ignacak\u2019s \u201cinterpersonal difficulties\u201d; (2) eliciting from Keener what diagnosis or reasons prompted the school to refer Ignacak to the New Britain General Hospital psychiatric program;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (3) refreshing Keener\u2019s recollection with Ignacak\u2019s special education records. The defendant did not raise an objection to these rulings on this ground either at trial or in his motions for acquittal or for a new trial and, therefore, must seek to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>that none of the trial court\u2019s rulings constituted constitutional error and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s claims in this regard fail under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s rulings prohibiting his inquiries into Ignacak\u2019s \u201cinterpersonal difficulties\u201d were improper and precluded him from making the requisite showing with regard to her psychiatric and special education records. We disagree. During his offer of proof, the defendant asked both Ignacak and Keener to \u201cexplain\u201d the nature of Ignacak\u2019s difficulties getting along with other people. The state objected on relevancy grounds and the trial court sustained these objections. The defendant argues that Ignacak\u2019s difficulty in getting along with other people was relevant because it could have been related to her problem recalling things and because it could have reflected an \u201cirrational inability to get along with others.\u201d The state argues that the trial court\u2019s rulings were proper because the inquiries, as framed by the defendant, were not tied to Ignacak\u2019s testimonial abilities and, thus, were not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Although, as the defendant observes, \u201cwe have urged trial courts to permit the defendant a certain latitude in his attempt to make [the prehminary showing required to obtain an in camera inspection of confidential records]\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 60; he does not dispute that, in the context of his offer of proof to make that showing, our rules of evidence remain operative. The trial court retained the discretion to curtail inquiry that was not probative of Ignacak\u2019s ability accurately to perceive, recall and relate the events of Rusinko\u2019s murder. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>232 Conn. 740, 746-47, 657 A.2d 611 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>supra, 60. While we are mindful that the defendant\u2019s task to lay a foundation as to the likely relevance of records to which he is not privy is not an easy one, we are also mindful of the witness\u2019 legitimate interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>in maintaining, to the extent possible, the privacy of her confidential records. The decision whether the defendant\u2019s questions were appropriately tailored to discover relevant information was within the discretion of the trial court. See 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) c. 2, \u00a7 7, p. 23 (overbreadth and indefiniteness of inquiry are matters of relevancy).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Our assessment of the trial court\u2019s decision to restrict the defendant\u2019s access to the witness\u2019 confidential records must, however, take into account the recognized principle that such a restriction \u201cimplicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to impeach and discredit state witnesses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 61; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 225; <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 457, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). The trial court\u2019s discretionary rulings, therefore, \u201ceven if . . . technically in accord with accepted rules of evidence\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 521, 400 A.2d 276 (1978); may impermissibly infringe upon the defendant\u2019s opportunity to establish the requisite showing. Thus, in reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim, we must also determine whether the trial court\u2019s rulings denied him a fair opportunity to elicit testimony \u201cabout how the records he sought might shed light on a relationship between [Ignacak\u2019s mental problems] and her capacity to testify truthfully.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 479; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>supra, 61 (trial court impermissibly infringed defendant\u2019s ability to make threshold showing); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>198 Conn. 220, 224, 502 A.2d 400 (1985) (trial court\u2019s traditional discretion over scope of cross-examination comes into play only after defendant accorded \u201csome irreducible minimum of cross-examination into matters affecting the reliability and credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses\u201d). We conclude that they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The record reveals that the defendant\u2019s inquiries into the nature of Ignacak\u2019s interpersonal problems were all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>general in nature and did not provide the trial court with a basis from which it could find that the records, to the extent they pertained to such problems, would relate to Ignacak\u2019s capacity accurately to perceive, recall and relate events. As such, the inquiries were not appropriately tailored to elicit information relevant to the issue for which the offer was made, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in curtailing them. Further, the challenged rulings did not impermissibly restrict the defendant\u2019s opportunity to elicit, by appropriate inquiry, \u201ctestimony about how the records he sought might shed light on a relationship between [Ignacak\u2019s interpersonal problems] and her capacity to testify truthfully.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 479. We have observed that \u201ca defendant\u2019s right [of cross-examination] is not infringed if the defendant fails to pursue a line of inquiry open to him. . . . The test is whether the opportunity to cross-examine existed, not whether full use of such opportunity was made.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 522. Similarly, in the present case, that the defendant was unable to explore fully Ignacak\u2019s interpersonal difficulties does not necessarily mean that the trial court\u2019s rulings impaired his constitutionally protected opportunity to make the requisite preliminary showing. The transcript does not indicate, and the defendant does not suggest, that the trial court would have rejected a properly focused inquiry into Ignacak\u2019s interpersonal problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court improperly denied him permission to refresh Keener\u2019s memory as to certain details of Ignacak\u2019s history of psychiatric treatment, and thereby prevented him from carrying his threshold burden. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">During the defendant\u2019s examination of Keener, he posed several questions that she was unable to answer because she had not reviewed Ignacak\u2019s special education file before coming to court. After a number of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>instances, the defendant attempted to provide Keener with Ignacak\u2019s special education records, which Keener had brought in response to the defendant\u2019s subpoena, from which to refresh her recollection. The state objected to the defendant\u2019s doing so, on the ground that the defendant could not be permitted to go through the records himself. The trial court refused the defendant permission to refresh Keener\u2019s memory, reasoning that because the special education records were privileged and the defendant\u2019s access to them was itself at issue, neither he nor Keener could be permitted access to them in order to provide testimony regarding their contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The defendant argues that because Keener had custody of Ignacak\u2019s special education records and presumably could have reviewed them prior to giving testimony, and clearly needed to review them to answer some of his questions about Ignacak, the trial court abused its discretion by denying him permission to refresh Keener\u2019s recollection once she had taken the stand, and thereby impermissibly infringed his ability to make the requisite showing. The state argues that the trial court properly denied the defendant permission to refresh Keener\u2019s memory because the defendant failed to ask Keener what specifically in the records might have pertained to Ignacak\u2019s testimonial capacity and because the defendant failed to show affirmatively that Keener was authorized to access the records. We agree with the state that, on this record, the trial court\u2019s ruling did not constitute an abuse of its discretion and did not impermissibly infringe the defendant\u2019s opportunity to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u201cWhether the recollection of a witness needs to be refreshed and whether it can be or has been refreshed by any means is in each case a question for the trial court, and its conclusion is unreviewable unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>154 Conn. 314, 322, 228 A.2d 141 (1966). The procedure for refreshing the recollection of a witness who has taken the stand ordinarily entails \u201ccounselfs] . . . hand[ing] her a memorandum to inspect for the purpose of \u2018refreshing her recollection,\u2019 with the result that when she speaks from memory thus revived, her testimony is what she says, not the writing.\u201d 1 C. McCormick, supra, c. 2, \u00a7 9, p. 29. A safeguard to this procedure \u201cis the rule which entitles the adverse party, when the witness seeks to resort to the memorandum, to inspect the memorandum so that she may object to its use if ground appears, and to have the memorandum available for her reference in cross-examina[tion] .... With the memorandum before her, the cross-examiner has a good opportunity to test the credibility of the witness\u2019s claim that her memory has been revived, and to search out any discrepancies between the writing and the testimony.\u201d Id., p. 32; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>165 Conn. 577, 593, 345 A.2d 532 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 960, 94 S. Ct. 1977, 40 L. Ed. 2d (1974) (adverse party has right to examine document used by witness to refresh memory while testifying).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">It is beyond serious debate that the trial court properly prevented the defendant from refreshing Keener\u2019s memory in the ordinary manner; to allow him to do so would have entailed his inspection of the records at issue in order to retrieve the specific documents that would jog Keener\u2019s memory, and would have required disclosure of any such documents to the prosecution. To permit this would have defeated entirely the protective procedure we have adopted to accommodate the witness\u2019 privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The question whether an alternative procedure by which Keener alone could have reviewed the records should have been permitted requires additional discussion. Although ideally a witness called to provide testimony regarding confidential records should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>thoroughly familiar with their contents, this will not always be the case. If such a witness is unable to respond to relevant inquiry, the trial court should determine, in its discretion, whether an alternative procedure, such as permitting the witness access to a particular document while testifying, without disclosure to either defense counsel or the prosecution, or permitting the witness to leave the stand to familiarize herself with the records and return to the stand at a later time, is warranted, permissible and feasible.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In determining whether such an alternative procedure is warranted, the trial court should consider, among other relevant factors, the nature of the information sought to be provided by refreshing the witness\u2019 recollection and whether the witness whose memory the defendant seeks to refresh is the only person who feasibly could provide the information sought. On this record, because the defendant did not clearly articulate a request for an alternative procedure, did not establish Keener\u2019s authority to review the records, did not seek to recall Ignacak or to call counselors who might have been able to answer the inquiries Keener was unable to satisfy, and does not claim that he was prevented from doing so, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of permission to refresh Keener\u2019s memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Further, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling did not impermissibly restrict the defendant\u2019s opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>to make the required showing. As we noted previously, a criminal defendant\u2019s opportunity to gain access to a witness\u2019 confidential records is not unconstitutionally impaired whenever the defendant does not successfully pursue a relevant line of inquiry. Here, although the trial court\u2019s ruling might have prevented the defendant from gaining access by one method to the information he sought, it did not cut off all reasonably available avenues to that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim in this regard is that the trial court\u2019s failure to mark for identification and seal for appellate review Bingham\u2019s records from Mount Sinai Hospital was improper and prejudicial to him because those records are not now available for this court\u2019s review. Although the defendant did not object to the procedure adopted by the court, he seeks review of this claim under <em>State </em>v. Golding, supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We agree with the defendant that the trial court\u2019s failure to retain the records as a sealed exhibit was improper, but conclude that its action was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, that his claim fails under the fourth prong of <em>Golding. </em>See footnote 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The trial transcript indicates that the defendant initially sought to have Bingham\u2019s records from Mount Sinai Hospital marked for identification and sealed for appellate review. A representative of the hospital, however, appeared in court and moved to quash the subpoena issued for those records. The trial court reasoned that because it had already determined that it would not review those records in camera, the records could be returned to the hospital. The defendant agreed to permit the hospital to retain the records, requesting only that the court mark for identification the subpoena issued for the records in order to show that the records existed and had been produced in court. The state also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>agreed to this procedure.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial court marked only the subpoena and returned the records to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">A trial court has the absolute duty to mark for identification and seal for possible appellate review any such records offered, whether or not an in camera inspection is undertaken, even in the absence of an objection to its failure to do so from the parties. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 580; <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>201 Conn. 244, 253, 513 A.2d 1202 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 34, 425 A.2d 560 (1979); <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>McTiernan, </em>151 Conn. 469, 470, 199 A.2d 332 (1964). The trial court\u2019s decision to mark for identification only the subpoena was, therefore, improper. In this case, however, because we have concluded that the defendant did not make the threshold showing required to obtain an in camera review of the Mount Sinai Hospital records, and that we need not review the records ourselves, the trial court\u2019s failure to preserve properly his records was harmless and could not have affected the outcome of his trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence to prove: (1) that he had the specific intent required to support his murder conviction; and (2) that he, not Ignacak and Bingham, had actually killed the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. \u201c[W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>tive force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v.

In its consideration of the testimony of an expert witness, the trial court might weigh, as it sees fit, the expert\u2019s expertise, his opportunity to observe the defendant and to form an opinion, and his thoroughness. It might consider also the reasonableness of his judgments about the underlying facts and of the conclusions which he drew from them.

In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we will give \u201cdeference not to the hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant, but to the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawable therefrom that support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the [trier\u2019s] determination of guilt. On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u201cThe specific intent to kill is an essential element of the crime of murder. To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim.

Intoxication is only relevant to the extent that it is so debilitating as to prevent the defendant from forming the intent to kill. \u201cIt is for the [fact finder] to decide, after weighing all the evidence adduced at trial, whether a criminal defendant\u2019s intoxication rendered him incapable of forming the intent required to commit the crime with which he is charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In support of his claim, the defendant relies primarily on his own testimony and that of his expert witness, Peter M. Zeman, a psychiatrist at the Institute of Living. The defendant testified that during the day of the murder, he had consumed fifteen or sixteen beers and four ten milligram doses of Valium between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., when Bingham and Ignacak arrived. He testified that this had been his daily routine at the time, and presented evidence to show that he was suffering from a severe alcohol and substance abuse condition at the time of the murder and had been for many years before. He claimed that after Bingham and Ignacak arrived, he had consumed two or three \u201cpretty strong\u201d drinks made by Ignacak from vodka and a mixer at the lower camp, and two \u201cbig stiff drinks\u201d at the upper camp; he also claimed to have ingested two additional ten milligram doses of Valium after 6 p.m. Finally, he claimed that, as a result of his drinking and Valium ingestion on the day of the murder, he suffered a blackout during the evening, and could not remember anything from the time when Rusinko joined him on the porch after Ignacak\u2019s seizure and Bingham knocked Rusinko to the ground, to when he woke to find Rusinko\u2019s body already in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Zeman testified that a blackout state involves a \u201cmajor disturbance of mental function as a result of alcohol, or a combination of alcohol and other drugs such as Valium,\u201d and that a blackout state ordinarily occurs only when a person reaches a blood alcohol level of .25 and is ordinarily accompanied by a loss of memory. Zeman interviewed the defendant three times, for a total of six hours, after the murder. It was Zeman\u2019s opinion, based primarily on the defendant\u2019s history of alcohol and prescription drug abuse, his account of how much alcohol and Valium he had consumed on the night of the murder and his account of the scope of his memory of the events of that night, that the defendant had experienced a blackout during Rusinko\u2019s murder. On cross-examination, however, Zeman acknowledged that the validity of his opinion depended at least in part upon the facts supplied by the defendant as to the extent of his alcohol and Valium consumption that day and his lack of memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The state presented substantial evidence to contradict the defendant\u2019s claim that he had experienced a blackout during Rusinko\u2019s murder and, therefore, that he had been incapable of forming the requisite intent to kill. First, the testimony of Bingham and Ignacak provided both direct and circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to kill Rusinko. According to Bingham and Ignacak, whose testimony the trial court found credible, before the murder the defendant said that he was angry with Rusinko for his role in the loss of the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and for his role in the defendant\u2019s problems with a \u201cdrug deal connection.\u201d He said several times that Rusinko \u201chad to pay,\u201d and talked of killing him. In response to Ignacak\u2019s suggestion that he shoot Rusinko instead of killing him, the defendant said that that would be too good for Rusinko, that \u201che wanted to fuck [Rusinko] up,\u201d and, specifically, that he \u201cwantfed] to beat David Rusinko to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>With regard to the murder, Bingham and Ignacak testified that as the defendant had delivered blows to Rusinko with his hands and feet, he had assigned reasons for them, such as \u201c[t]his is for the DWI, this is for the cocaine, this is for the loss of my license.\u201d Bingham then retrieved an aluminum pipe and struck Rusinko with it. After the aluminum pipe bent, Bingham, at the defendant\u2019s request, retrieved a steel pipe with which he, and then the defendant, \u201c[f]orcefully,\u201d holding the pipe \u201csometimes . . . like a baseball bat, sometimes . . . with both hands up and over the head and coming down,\u201d struck Rusinko.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">At some point during the beating, Bingham asked the defendant whether he had done enough damage. The defendant replied \u201c[n]o, that\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m going to fuckin\u2019 kill him\u201d and stated that if he were to stop at that point, Rusinko might go to the police. He then resumed striking Rusinko in the head with a steel pipe \u201cwith what appeared to be all his might.\u201d A short time later, the defendant paused to have Bingham break Rusinko\u2019s neck. Dissatisfied with Bingham\u2019s efforts, he attempted to do so himself by jumping on Rusinko\u2019s neck as his head lay propped on the porch railings. Finally, because Rusinko appeared still to be breathing, the defendant asked Bingham for his knife, and when Bingham refused, the defendant used his own knife and then a piece of glass to cut Rusinko\u2019s throat, saying \u201c[d]ie . . . why don\u2019t you just die.\u201d Ignacak indicated, however, that Rusinko was still alive, so the defendant again struck Rusinko\u2019s head with a piece of pipe, at which point it was \u201call blood.\u201d Finally, the defendant rolled the victim\u2019s body into the fireplace and, using boards pulled off the interior cabin walls, proceeded to incinerate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s state of sobriety on the night of the murder, Bingham and Ignacak testified that when they had arrived at the defendant\u2019s home on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the evening of the murder, they had noticed that he had been drinking, but that, according to Ignacak, he had \u201cseemed fine.\u201d Ignacak stated that although she had not paid attention to what the defendant drank that evening, he had appeared intoxicated when the attack on Rusinko began, but had seemed to \u201csober up\u201d shortly thereafter. She testified further that the defendant had seemed to have been in control of his actions and had had no difficulty in his coordination, either in walking up the hill to the upper campsite or wielding a pipe to beat Rusinko. Bingham also testified that during the extended assault on Rusinko, the defendant had not appeared intoxicated; he spoke normally and had administered blows to Rusinko in a coordinated way, not missing Rusinko once with the pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The state also presented an expert witness, Donald R. Grayson, a psychiatrist. Grayson testified that he believed it was unlikely that the defendant blacked out during the murder, given his ability to perform certain activities during the day and evening and the precision of his memory as to his activities during the day and just prior to Rusinko\u2019s murder. Grayson also testified that he felt that the defendant\u2019s having related somewhat different accounts of the scope of his memory of the night in question created a doubt about the defendant\u2019s credibility on the subject of his memory loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The trial court, in its memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal, expressly rejected as not credible the defendant\u2019s testimony that he could not remember any events between Rusinko\u2019s being knocked to the ground and his being burned in the fire, in light of his ability to give \u201cconsiderable evidence . . . of his physical activities on July 17,1991, including mowing lawns, working on a small carburetor, riding a motorcycle as well as his detailed claims of alcohol consumption,\u201d and the fact that \u201c[i]n all other areas his recollection appeared intentionally vague or non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>existent.\u201d The court accepted the testimony of Bingham and Ignacak, testifying \u201cagainst their penal interest,\u201d as to the defendant\u2019s participation in Rusinko\u2019s death and the burning of his body, and concluded that the defendant was \u201cnot so intoxicated by alcohol and/or drugs at the time of the murder that he was incapable of forming a rational intent or of controlling his will. <em>State </em>v. <em>Utz, </em>201 Conn. 190, 209 [513 A.2d 1191] (1986).\u201d We conclude that the cumulative effect of all the evidence adduced at trial and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom amply support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was able to and did form the specific intent to kill Rusinko.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the defendant committed Rusinko\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He argues that the evidence adduced at trial was consistent with the conclusion that Bingham and Ignacak murdered Rusinko, and because the state did not sufficiently refute this hypothesis, that a reasonable fact finder could not have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Our law on this issue is clear. \u201cThat the [finder of fact] might have drawn other possible inferences from these facts is not sufficient to undermine its verdict, since proof of guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond a possible doubt. . . . [I]n viewing the evidence which could yield contrary infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>enees, the [finder of fact] is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence. The rule is that the [fact finder\u2019s] function is to draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>219 Conn. 596, 604, 594 A.2d 459 (1991). If there is conflicting evidence, therefore, the fact finder is free to determine which version of the event in question it finds most credible. \u201c[W]e must defer to the [fact finder\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 278, 623 A.2d 42 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In this case, the fact finder, in its memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal, expressly and reasonably rejected the defendant\u2019s \u201cblackout\u201d theory and credited the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses, which clearly supported the underlying conviction for murder. We conclude that, upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant was guilty of minder beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The defendant\u2019s last challenge is to three evidentiary rulings made by the trial court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Specifically, he claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>that the trial court improperly: (1) admitted, as impeachment evidence, testimony as to what his behavior was like on a prior occasion at a known blood alcohol level; (2) admitted into evidence several pieces of pipe, which rulings he claims impaired his right to a fair trial; and (3) prevented him on cross-examination from asking Ignacak whether she told two young men after Rusinko\u2019s murder that Bingham had \u201cdone something awful,\u201d in violation of his right of confrontation under the federal and state constitutions. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly admitted testimony from former Granby police officer Douglas Schlichting regarding the defendant\u2019s behavior at a certain known level of intoxication. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. During the defendant\u2019s case, Zeman testified that a blackout state generally occurs at a blood alcohol level of .25 and above, but may occur at lower levels. He also indicated that Valium may produce the same condition, and that combining alcohol and Valium could produce a synergistic effect. He testified that while a person is experiencing a blackout, that person may appear fairly normal to others, particularly when he or she is a heavy drinker and therefore has greater than average tolerance to the effects of alcohol. He indicated that such a person, when experiencing a blackout, may be able to perform the types of tasks that do not require fine coordination or require motor skills that are so frequently practiced that they are automatic, but that his or her \u201chigher levels\u201d of functioning, such as \u201chigher levels of judgment, thinking [and] planning are impaired.\u201d It was Zeman\u2019s opinion, based on the defendant\u2019s history of heavy drinking and prescription drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>abuse, his account of how much alcohol and Valium he consumed during the day and evening of the murder, and his account of the scope of his memory loss regarding the events of the evening, that the defendant had experienced a blackout during Rusinko\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The state presented in rebuttal testimony by Schlichting as to the defendant\u2019s condition when he was arrested for drunk driving three months before Rusinko\u2019s murder. The defendant\u2019s objection to this testimony on relevancy grounds was overruled. Schlichting testified that he had stopped the defendant at approximately 2:30 a.m. on March 3, 1991, because the defendant had been operating his vehicle erratically. Schlichting had noticed that when the defendant exited his vehicle, he held onto the door to support himself and, while walking to the rear of the vehicle, he staggered and braced himself on the vehicle. Schlichting administered a number of field sobriety tests at the scene, including a \u201chorizontal gaze nystagmus test,\u201d a \u201cwalk and turn test\u201d and a \u201cone leg stand test.\u201d From the defendant\u2019s performance on each test, Schlichting considered it \u201cquite obvious\u201d that the defendant was intoxicated. Schlichting also testified that he had administered two breathalyzer tests to the defendant, the first at approximately 3:20 a.m., and the second some time later. The first test showed the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level to be .205, and the second showed it to be .203. Schlichting stated that when these tests were administered, the defendant was still in largely the same condition as when he had stopped him. He also testified on cross-examination that dining booking, the defendant had stated that he was not drug-dependent but that he was taking Valium and Doriden.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The defendant argues that Schlichting\u2019s testimony was irrelevant because it was not known when it was presented whether the defendant\u2019s condition when Schlichting arrested him had been affected by his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>sumption of prescription drugs or what his blood alcohol level had been on the night of the murder. The state argues that the evidence was relevant to rebut Zeman\u2019s testimony as to whether the defendant would likely exhibit signs of intoxication when his blood alcohol level was high.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">It is well established that \u201c[t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 298, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989). \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . [E]vidence need not exclude all other possibilities [to be relevant]; it is sufficient if it tends to support the conclusion [for which it is offered], even to a slight degree. . . . [T]he fact that evidence is susceptible of different explanations or would support various inferences does not affect its admissibility, although it obviously bears upon its weight. So long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant, it is admissible.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 406-407, 631 A.2d 238 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Schlichting\u2019s testimony that the defendant exhibited obvious signs of impairment at a blood alcohol level of approximately .205 could reasonably support an inference that it was less likely that he was a person who would not exhibit signs of substantial motor impairment at the level at which a blackout would normally occur and at lower levels before he reached the level required for blackout. In fact, Grayson made just these comparisons in his testimony. Grayson testified that the information provided by Schlichting as to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>condition provided a \u201crelatively valid base line as to what type of motor impairment would be expected at a certain blood level.\u201d Grayson calculated that the defendant had had a blood alcohol level of approximately .21 when Schlichting had arrested him, and also calculated that, based on the amount of alcohol the defendant claimed at trial to have consumed throughout the day and evening of Rusinko\u2019s murder, the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level on July 17, 1991, at the time that the group left the lower camp to move to the upper camp had been approximately .21. He concluded, in light of Schlichting\u2019s testimony, that he would expect the defendant to have exhibited motor control difficulty at a .25 blood alcohol level that would affect his balance, his ability to swing a steel pipe and to speak clearly, and that he would expect the defendant to have experienced gross motor control difficulties at .21 and above on the night of the murder. This evidence, combined with Ignacak\u2019s and Bingham\u2019s testimony, which the court expressly found credible, that the defendant\u2019s motor skills did not appear to be significantly impaired prior to or during the murder, could render the defendant\u2019s testimony as to his state of intoxication on the night of the murder less credible. That the defendant may have ingested more or different prescription drugs on the night he was arrested than on the night of Rusinko\u2019s murder, on which issue he was free to offer evidence, went to the weight to be accorded Schlichting\u2019s testimony, rather than to its admissibility. The trial court did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence several pieces of charred steel pipe and apiece of aluminum pipe. The defendant argues that these items were not adequately identified as those used in the commission of Rusinko\u2019s murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>and, therefore, that this evidence lacked proper foundation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">At trial, the state sought to introduce several pieces of metal pipe through the testimony of state police Sergeant John Buturla. The defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of the pipes was overruled. Buturla testified that the pieces of pipe, one aluminum and several steel, had been found by police, in his presence, on the ground \u201cright off of the porch\u201d of the cabin at the upper camp approximately three weeks after the murder, and that each was in the same condition at trial as it was when it had been found. He acknowledged that there had been other pieces of pipe in the area of the cabin when the police retrieved those sought to be introduced, but stated that the aluminum pipe sought to be admitted had been the only such pipe in that area that was bent and dented.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The defendant argues that because the pipes introduced into evidence had not been conclusively identified, when the state sought to introduce them, either as being the pipes used in Rusinko\u2019s murder or as being similar to those pipes, there was insufficient foundation laid for their admission. We disagree with the defendant that, in order to admit the pipes into evidence, the state was required to first provide such a conclusive identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">With regard to identity, \u201c[a]ll that is required before a weapon may be introduced into evidence is a sufficient foundation demonstrating circumstances justifying an inference of the likelihood that the weapon was used in the course of the crime charged. . . . The [state] is not compelled to establish that the particular weapon to be introduced was the actual weapon used in the commission of the crime.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fromal, </em>392 Pa.

With regard to the condition of the item, \u201cthe trial court should consider the nature of the article, the circumstances surrounding the preservation and custody of it, and the possibility of intermeddlers tampering with it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.

Ed. 2d 772 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">When the pipes were offered into evidence, Bingham had already testified that one aluminum pipe and a number of steel pipes were used by him and the defendant to beat Rusinko. He had testified that the aluminum pipe was fairly long, that it bent while he was striking Rusinko with it and that, after it bent, he threw it off the porch of the cabin. He had also testified that the steel pipes used to beat Rusinko were each approximately two feet long with one flared end, that one of them was knocked off the porch and the remaining pieces were placed in the fire with Rusinko\u2019s body, and that, when he and the defendant returned to the cabin after the murder, he threw the burned steel pipes off the porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In light of Bingham\u2019s testimony as to the characteristics, the condition and the manner of his disposal of the pipes used to beat Rusinko, and Buturla\u2019s testimony that the pipes offered into evidence, which were similar in appearance to those described by Bingham, were found on the ground near the porch of the cabin and were in substantially the same condition at trial as when they were retrieved by the police, we conclude that there was a sufficient foundation to support an inference that they had been used to beat Rusinko and had thereafter been thrown off the porch by Bingham. Accordingly, the pipes were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the trial court violated his federal and state constitutional rights of confrontation when it prohibited him from asking Ignacak on cross-examination whether, shortly after the murder, she had told two men that Bingham \u201chad done something awful.\u201d He concedes that his constitutional claim was not made at trial and seeks review under <em>State </em>v. Golding, supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, and the plain error doctrine. We conclude that the defendant presents simply an evidentiary claim, and that the trial court\u2019s ruling did not constitute an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">During cross-examination, Ignacak testified that she had known Charles and John Northrop from high school, that she had dated John, and that she had visited an arcade with both of them on one occasion some time after the murder. The defendant asked Ignacak whether she recalled having told them on that occasion that \u201cBrian [Bingham] had done something awful.\u201d The state objected on hearsay grounds and the defendant argued that the statement was offered to contradict Ignacak\u2019s testimony implicating the defendant in Rusinko\u2019s murder. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>objection. On appeal, the defendant claims that this line of inquiry was relevant to his defense that Ignacak and Bingham, and not he, had killed Rusinko because it \u201cmight well have produced a particularly telling prior inconsistent statement,\u201d and that, \u201c[b]ecause [it] probably would have affected the outcome [of his trial], a new trial is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In reviewing this claim, we note, as an initial matter, that the defendant provides virtually no analysis of the confrontation issue he invokes for the first time on appeal. As such, we decline to review it under the <em>Golding </em>doctrine, and treat it, as the defendant does, as simply an evidentiary challenge. See id., 240 (\u201cThe defendant. . . bears the responsibility of demonstrating that his claim is indeed a violation of a fundamental constitutional right. Patently nonconstitutional claims that are unpreserved at trial do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear a constitutional label.\u201d). \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The only basis on which the defendant offered Ignacak\u2019s alleged prior statement that \u201cBrian [Bingham] had done something awful,\u201d was as an inconsistent statement. \u201cAs an evidentiary matter, evidence of a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement is admissible to attack the witness\u2019 credibility. ... A statement is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement, however, only when the trial court is persuaded that, taking the testimony of the witness as a whole, the statements are in fact inconsistent. . . . Such a determination as to inconsistency lies within the discretionary authority of the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 302. As the trial court pointed out, Bingham\u2019s participation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>in Rusinko\u2019s murder as described by Ignacak was \u201csomething awful,\u201d and the statement, therefore, was not inconsistent with Ignacak\u2019s prior testimony as to Bingham\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s participation in the murder. The defendant failed to offer any additional basis from which to conclude that the statement, or others related to it in the conversation between Ignacak and Charles and John Northrop, would contradict her testimony that the defendant and Bingham had committed the murder. As such, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding it. Because we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling, the defendant\u2019s plain error argument also fails. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87-88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985) (plain error review \u201creserved for the truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In this opinion PETERS, C.

He did not specifically seek a ruling as to the New Britain General Hospital records, which had not been submitted, and the trial court\u2019s statement of its ruling gives no indication that it was intended to include a determination as to those missing records.

If Keener was authorized to examine the records, and thus could have reviewed them prior to taking the witness stand, her reviewing the records later rather than earlier would not have infringed upon Ignacak\u2019s privilege. Only the defendant\u2019s attempt, through his examination of Keener, to elicit from her information contained in the records implicated Ignacak\u2019s privilege, and the trial court possessed the discretion to control the scope of the defendant\u2019s inquiry on a question-by-question basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\"> It does not appear that the hospital\u2019s motion to quash was acted upon by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> The defendant asserts this claim in a slightly different manner. He claims that the fact finder could not reasonably have concluded that Bingham and Ignacak had not murdered the victim and thereafter had attempted to implicate the defendant and, therefore, could not have found him guilty beyond areasonable doubt.

A criminal defendant has the right to an in camera inspection of a witness\u2019 confidential records, for the purpose of gathering information to impeach the witness, if there is <em>\u201cany reasonable basis\u201d </em>for believing that the records have information \u201cthat might affect his testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v.

I am pleased that the court makes this standard clear and overrules <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 59, 561 A.2d 422, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880,107 L.

Because of our concern for the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses, \u201cwe have not insisted upon a determination that the confidential communications of the victim were inconsistent with his testimony at trial before an in camera review may be conducted by the court ... of the record of those prior statements.\u201d Id., 227. Rather, if the defendant demonstrates, outside the presence of the jury, that \u201cthere is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness,\u201d the trial court should conduct an in camera inspection. <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>221 Conn. 447, 457, 604 A.2d 1294 (1992), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 58. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Hull, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 404-405, 533 A.2d 866 (1987), made it clear that the standard must be \u201cany reasonable basis\u201d because a more onerous threshold would violate the confrontation clauses of our federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The court in <em>Hufford </em>explained that \u201c [w]here, as here, the records sought are privileged, the witness\u2019 right to privacy must be weighed against the criminal defendant\u2019s right to bring to the jury\u2019s attention facts affecting the witness\u2019 credibility. . . . The linchpin of the determination of the defendant\u2019s access to the records is whether they sufficiently disclose material especially probative of the ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth ... so as to justify breach of their confidentiality and disclosing them to the defendant in order to protect his right of confrontation. As in the case of admissibility of such records, access to records bearing on the mental unsoundness of a witness (i.e., relating to a trait importing in itself a defective power of observation, recollection or communication), at or around the time of trial or of the occurrence about which he is to testify . . . should be granted to the defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 402-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">I believe that the defendant in this case made this threshold showing thereby requiring the trial court to review Cara Ignacak\u2019s and Brian Bingham\u2019s confidential records in camera. The object of the defendant\u2019s inquiry is not only to challenge the witnesses\u2019 testimonial capacity, but <em>also </em>to gather any information that would impeach the witnesses\u2019 credibility. Id., 400. As participants in the crime, both Ignacak and Bingham were essential witnesses for the prosecution. This is especially so since there were no other witnesses and the defendant testified that for most of the evening he blacked out and is not able to recall what occurred. Therefore, conviction of the defendant hinged on whether the jury credited Ignacak\u2019s and Bingham\u2019s testimony. Consequently, it was vital for the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>have a full opportunity to impeach Ignacak\u2019s and Bingham\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">On direct examination, both Ignacak and Bingham conceded that, during the police investigation, they had concealed information and had lied. Additionally, testimony was presented that both had social and psychiatric problems that required treatment. At a minimum, Ignacak\u2019s and Bingham\u2019s mental soundness must be questioned as they either assisted in or watched the fatal beating and incineration of another human being without any expression of horror or disgust. More specifically, there was testimony that Ignacak received psychiatric therapy on an inpatient and outpatient basis because of her difficulty in recalling events, as well as her interpersonal difficulties. Similarly, Bingham was hospitalized for emotional and substance abuse problems. With this evidence, the defendant met his threshold burden of demonstrating that there was a reasonable basis for believing that impeaching information was contained in Ignacak\u2019s and Bingham\u2019s confidential records.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Indeed, the facts of <em>Hufford </em>underscore that the defendant in this case met that threshold showing. In <em>Hufford, </em>we held that on voir dire, the defendant made the requisite showing merely by presenting the hospital records that contained nursing notes in which the witness was described as being \u201cdiagnosed as having a social problem and histrionic personality disorder.\u201d Id., 404-405. On the basis of those nursing notes alone, we held that \u201cthe defendant [had] made the requisite showing that there were reasonable grounds to believe that there were psychiatric records or information pertaining to the complainant\u2019s mental condition bearing on her testimonial capacity and reliability as a witness.\u201d Id., 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The majority seems to lose sight that this threshold showing is preliminary. It is not determinative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>whether the records are available for use by the defendant\u2019s counsel in his or her cross-examination of a witness. Rather, the showing merely allows an in camera inspection to determine whether any admissible impeaching evidence is contained in the records. \u201c \u2018If no admissible impeaching evidence is discovered, the entire record of the proceeding [should] be sealed for possible appellate review.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Under the majority\u2019s analysis, the defendant is twice placed in a \u201ccatch-22\u201d situation. First, the precise reason the defendant wanted to have the witnesses\u2019 records reviewed in camera was to determine whether they contained any material that would be admissible to impeach the credibility of Ignacak and Bingham. If the defendant had knowledge of the contents of the records, then an in camera review would not be necessary. Nevertheless, the majority somehow expects the defendant, who is ignorant of the contents of the records, to produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there is \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that records contain admissible impeachable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Second, the majority, which agrees in theory that there need only be a mere \u201creasonable basis showing,\u201d in practice extends that standard beyond all contemplation and refuses to review the trial court\u2019s unreasonable evidentiary restrictions that prevented the defendant from making a fuller threshold showing during voir dire.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority\u2019s belief, these restrictions constituted constitutional error, because they directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>implicated the state constitution\u2019s confrontation clause. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>172 Conn. 298, 302, 374 A.2d 239 (1977) (\u201c[w]hen a conviction depends entirely upon the testimony of certain witnesses, as it did in the present case, information affecting their credibility is material in the constitutional sense since if they are not believed a reasonable doubt of guilt would be created\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Accordingly, I would remand this case to the trial court with direction to conduct an in camera inspection of the records of both Ignacak and Bingham.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In my view, under our state constitution, such an in camera inspection must be done through the eyes of the advocates \u2014 that is, with both defense counsel and the state\u2019s attorney. To preserve and respect the witness\u2019 privacy interest, counsel should be placed \u201cunder strict order from the trial court . . . not [to] disclose any material, other than that permitted by the trial court. . . <em>.\"State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>227 Conn. 751, 779, 631 A.2d 309 (1993) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). Indeed, Justice Abe Fortas, writing for the majority, advanced a cogent argument, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>context of reviewing secret grand jury proceedings, of why that review must be made through the eye of the advocate. \u201cTrial judges ought not to be burdened with the task or the responsibility of examining sometimes voluminous [records] in order to ascertain inconsistencies with trial testimony. In any event, it will be extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under the pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the grand jury testimony that would be useful in impeaching a witness. . . . Nor is it realistic to assume that the trial court\u2019s judgment as to the utility of material for impeachment or other legitimate <em>purposes, </em>however conscientiously made, would exhaust the possibilities. In our adversary system, it is enough forjudges to judge. The determination of what may be useful to the defense can properly and effectively be made only by an advocate.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>384 U.S. 855, 874-75, 86 S.

Ed. 2d 973 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">If such an in camera inspection produces information that could have been the basis for properly impeaching either or both witnesses, the defendant\u2019s conviction must be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 402, this court stated: \u201cWe rest this holding not only on the requirements of the federal constitution, but also on independent and adequate state constitutional grounds.

Patricia Keener, the director of special education at Ignacak\u2019s and Bingham\u2019s high school, how Ignacak\u2019s difficulty getting along with people manifested itself; and (3) the defendant was precluded from asking Keener if there was a diagnosis that led her to refer Ignacak for psychiatric treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\"> I am aware of the procedure established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 179-80, 471 A.2d 949 (1984), which requires, after the defendant has shown \u201cthat there is reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the [confidential] information is likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation .... Upon such a showing the court may then afford the state an opportunity to secure the consent of the witness for the court to conduct an in camera inspection of the claimed information .... If the defendant does make such [a] showing and such consent is not forthcoming then the court may be obliged to strike the testimony of the witness.\u201d The <em>Esposito </em>court laudably attempts to accommodate both the privacy rights of the witness and the confrontational rights of the accused. Sometimes, however, in the interest of justice, this accommodation cannot be made. With respect to confidential records, those privileges must give way to the state\u2019s overriding interest in obtaining just convictions and the accused\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. Accordingly, I would abandon the requirement that the state be required to obtain the witness\u2019 consent for the in camera review of the witness\u2019 records. The trial court\u2019s order mandating the attorneys not to disclose any of the confidential information is a sufficient safeguard to protect the privacy right of the witness, while taking into account the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
