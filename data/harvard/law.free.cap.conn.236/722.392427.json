Starr, acquired a polluted 44.3 acre parcel of land by inheritance, thereby making her an innocent landowner pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452d.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. On February 23, 1976, the plaintiffs husband, S. Leger Starr (decedent), died leaving a will that named the plaintiff the executrix of his estate. The will created two trusts, a marital trust and a residuary trust. The decedent\u2019s will gave the plaintiff the discretion to distribute into one of the two trusts what remained of the estate after the payment of funeral expenses and expenses related to the administration of the estate. The will also gave the plaintiff the authority to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>assets directly instead of placing them in the marital trust and to transfer property without court approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">When the decedent died, he was the controlling shareholder of three corporations, Don, Inc., L and S Realty, Inc., and Mountview, Inc. He owned approximately ninety-eight shares of stock in each of these corporations while the plaintiff and her sister each owned one share.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These corporations were the title owners of the parcel of land (property) presently at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon his death, the decedent\u2019s ninety-eight shares became part of his estate. On January 31, 1978, at the advice of her attorneys, the plaintiff, acting as executrix, merged the three corporations into a preexisting corporation, Dale, Inc., which consequently became the owner of the land. Four years later, the plaintiff dissolved Dale, Inc., causing the corporation\u2019s assets to be distributed to the shareholders, which included the decedent\u2019s estate. Thereafter, on January 30,1987, by virtue of a fiduciary deed, the plaintiff transferred the property to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Within a few years, the named defendant, the commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner), began to investigate various complaints of odors emanating from the property. Because the commissioner determined that the plaintiff was maintaining a condition that was reasonably expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-432,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the commissioner issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>an order to the plaintiff on July 9, 1990, requiring that she \u201celiminate soil, surface and groundwater pollution.\u201d Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-436,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff requested a hearing to review this order. On June 28, 1991, Lewis J. Miller, a hearingofficer at the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>of environmental protection, issued a final decision upholding the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, <em>Maloney, </em>J.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which concluded that because the plaintiff had not created the condition that caused the pollution, had not owned the property when it was polluted, and had not acquiesced to its pollution, the commissioner had improperly determined that the plaintiffs passive ownership of the property constituted \u201cmaintaining\u201d a condition that reasonably could be expected to create a source of pollution within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-432. The trial court further concluded that, because of the commissioner\u2019s failure to comply with the Connecticut Water Pollution Control Act; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-416 et seq.; which provides that the commissioner must first attempt to seek reimbursement from those who actually caused the pollution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>only if the commissioner is unsuccessful in securing payment from the polluter can reimbursement be sought from a passive landowner in the form of a lien on the polluted property for the amount of the cleanup costs,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the commissioner improperly had found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>plaintiff responsible for the cleanup of the property. The commissioner appealed from the judgment of the trial court to this court, and we reversed. See <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 358, 627 A.2d 1296 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In that case, we concluded that the trial court had failed to give due deference to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cmaintaining\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-432. We reasoned that because \u201cmaintaining\u201d is an ambiguous term that can be interpreted to apply to a passive landowner as well as to one who actively created the pollution, and because \u201cit is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 372; the trial court should have deferred to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation. Id., 376. The commissioner\u2019s inteipretation was also supported by the legislative history of the act. Id., 381-90. Additionally, we concluded that neither the language of the act nor its legislative history suggested that the commissioner was required first to attempt to recover from the party responsible for the pollution before the commissioner could impose a lien on the property itself. Rather, we concluded that the intent of the legislature was to provide the commissioner with alternative courses of action and the discretion to choose among them. Id., 390-95. Consequently, we reversed the judgment of the trial court and upheld the commissioner\u2019s order. Id., 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">While <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 358, was pending before this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>court, the legislature enacted No. 93-375 of the 1993 Public Acts (P.A. 93-375), entitled \u201cAn Act Establishing an Innocent Landowner Defense in Pollution Cases,\u201d codified at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-452d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 22a-452e.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tion pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-181a (b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> requesting reconsideration of the commissioner\u2019s final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>decision. That motion was granted and, after a hearing, the commissioner concluded that because the plaintiff had not established that she was an \u201cinnocent landowner\u201d within the meaning of the P.A. 93-375, she was therefore fully hable for the cleanup costs. The commissioner reasoned that the plaintiff had not acquired the property by \u201cinheritance or bequest\u201d under \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (iii) because, when the decedent died, he did not own the property in question. Rather, the property was owned by three corporations of which the decedent was a majority shareholder. The plaintiff had acquired the property as a result of the dissolution of Dale, Inc., and the distribution of its assets to its shareholders. Consequently, in the commissioner\u2019s view, \u201cthe site was not [the decedent\u2019s] to give\u201d and he could not have devised the property to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Furthermore, the commissioner reasoned that the plaintiff had acquired the property by her own volition in that she willingly had transferred ownership of the property from the estate to herself. According to the commissioner, \u201c[w]hen the legislature enacted P.A. 93-375 limiting the liability of those who acquire polluted land by inheritance or bequest, it surely intended to limit the liability not of those who acquire such land by their own volition, but rather of those upon whom the financial burden of polluted land is involuntarily thrust. Ownership of the polluted land involved here was not thrust by the decedent upon [the plaintiff]; she had the power to dispose of the site entirely as she chose, and she chose to dispose of it by taking title herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Additionally, the commissioner rejected the plaintiffs argument that she did not know, and had no reason to know, of the pollution because she had failed to \u201c[inquire], consistent with good commercial or customary practices, into the previous uses of the property.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (i). The commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>sioner reasoned that had the plaintiff conducted a reasonable investigation of the property, she would have discovered the pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the Superior Court, <em>Hodgson, J., </em>which concluded, inter aha,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that although the plaintiff had acquired the property partially by inheritance, because she also had acquired it partially by the liquidation of Dale, Inc., she was not an innocent landowner. Additionally, the trial court determined that because the commissioner had disbelieved the plaintiffs witnesses regarding whether the plaintiff had \u201cinquire[d], consistent with good commercial or customary practices, into the previous uses of the property,\u201d but had failed to present any contrary evidence, the commissioner had improperly relied on evidence not in the record to reach his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In deciding that the plaintiff had not \u201cinherited\u201d the property pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (iii), the trial court first determined that it was presented with a question of law, namely, whether the plaintiff had inherited the property. The court explained that because \u201c[t]he interpretation of laws concerning inheritance and corporate shares cannot be said to be within the special expertise of the agency headed by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection . . . [the commissioner\u2019s] determination with regard to such issues is not entitled to deference . . . .\u201d Instead, the court independently construed P.A. 93-375 \u201c \u2018to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>228 Conn. 498, 507, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994); <em>Vaillancourt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 390, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The court then characterized the legal issue before it as \u201cwhether the inheritance must be a direct one of land held by the decedent in his own name to an heir, or whether a person who inherits shares that are later converted into real estate has likewise acquired the interest by inheritance.\u201d The trial court concluded that the legislature did not intend the word \u201cinheritance\u201d in \u00a7 22a-452d to have the narrow legal definition of intestate distribution of property and that \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (iii) does not require that the decedent own the land at the time of his death.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court further concluded that \u201cthe plaintiffs ownership of the land was at least in part the result of her entitlement pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 33-380<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to receive a pro rata share of the corporation\u2019s assets corresponding to her pro rata share of the issued stock, and that she [had] acquired this interest by operation of law in her capacity as a shareholder and not by inheritance.\u201d Because the plaintiff owned only one share of stock in the dissolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>corporation, however, she necessarily had inherited part of the property through the decedent\u2019s estate, which owned ninety-eight shares. See footnote 1. Having concluded that the plaintiff had acquired the property partially by inheritance and that neither the language of \u00a7 22a-452d nor its legislative history indicates that the innocent landowner defense applies to one who acquires land partially by inheritance and partially by other means, the trial court proceeded to evaluate whether the plaintiff was an innocent landowner under \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (i) because she had \u201cno reason to know\u201d of the pollution and had \u201cinquire [d], consistent with good commercial or customary practices, into the previous uses of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">At the administrative hearing, the plaintiff had presented the only evidence of what constituted \u201cgood commercial or customary practices,\u201d which she claims to have performed in making her inquiries. The commissioner determined \u201cthat the plaintiffs witnesses were not credible, that [the commissioner] did not believe their statements to the effect that a cursory investigation was the prevalent practice in and before 1987, and that the plaintiff therefore did not prove her entitlement to immunity by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d The trial court inferred, therefore, that the commissioner had found that the customary practice was other than what had been described by the plaintiffs witnesses. Because the commissioner, however, had not presented any evidence to confirm what the appropriate customary practice was, which the plaintiff could then have attempted to rebut, the trial court concluded that the commissioner had relied on evidence not in the record and, consequently, that \u201cthe [c]ommissioner\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had not proven that she was an innocent landowner pursuant to [\u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (i)] was made upon unlawful procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>court remanded the case for further proceedings on the issue of whether the plaintiffs inquiry into the previous uses of the property was \u201cconsistent with good commercial or customary practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The commissioner appealed and the plaintiff cross appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal and cross appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). On appeal, the commissioner argues primarily that the trial court incorrectly decided that the commissioner\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had failed to prove that she had inquired into the previous uses of the property consistent with good commercial and customary practices was based on unlawful procedure. In her cross appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court incorrectly concluded that she did not acquire the property completely by inheritance and, therefore, incorrectly remanded the case for further proceedings instead of remanding the case with direction that she be afforded the status of innocent landowner. Because we agree with the plaintiff and conclude that she had acquired the property by inheritance as contemplated by \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (iii), and because our resolution in favor of the plaintiff on her cross appeal is dispositive of the case, we need not address the issues raised by the commissioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">In deciding whether the plaintiff is an innocent landowner, we must interpret the statute. \u201cOrdinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to cariy out the statute\u2019s purposes. <em>Police Department </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number><em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>[225 Conn. 297, 300, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993)]; <em>Crocetto </em>v. <em>Lynn Development Corporation, </em>223 Conn. 376, 381, 612 A.2d 1212 (1992). [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 262, 579 A.2d 505 (1990). This case, however, presents a pure question of law, and therefore invokes a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. Id., 263; <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 718, 546 A.2d 830 (1988). Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny, as in this case, the agency is not entitled to special deference. <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra [263]; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>210 Conn. 349, 357, 554 A.2d 1089 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>226 Conn. 670, 678-79, 628 A.2d 957 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The plaintiff argues in her cross appeal that she is an innocent landowner pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (iii) because she inherited the property in question.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> She further argues that the trial court mistakenly concluded that she only partially inherited the property because part of her interest in the property was the result of the dissolution of Dale, Inc. The commissioner, in contrast, maintains that the plaintiff did not inherit the property, but, rather, that she had acquired it by dissolving Dale, Inc., and distributing the corporate assets to its shareholders. We conclude that although the plaintiff did not take title to the property exclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>by inheritance, because her ownership interest in the coiporation was a de minimis formal requirement, she falls within the class of people intended to be protected by the innocent landowner defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">\u201cIt is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation. ... In order to determine the meaning of a statute, we must consider the statute as a whole when reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Civil Service </em>Commission, 234 Conn. 35, 45, 660 A.2d 850 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The words of the statute plainly state that one who acquires an interest in real estate after the date of a spill or discharge is not liable for that spill or discharge if the person acquires the interest by \u201cinheritance\u201d or \u201cbequest.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We note first, and the parties no longer dispute, that, in enacting this statute, the legislature did not intend to impose strict legal definitions on the operative words \u201cinheritance\u201d and \u201cbequest.\u201d First, because the legal definition of \u201cbequest\u201d is \u201c[a] gift (transfer) by will of personal property\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); and the statute refers to the acquisition of land, it would be nonsensical to apply the legal definition of \u201cbequest.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Second, if the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>\u201cbequest\u201d were so limited, and the legal definition of \u201cinheritance\u201d were used,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the statute would apply to acquisitions of land only if the decedent died intestate. There is no reason to believe that the legislature intended such a limited and technical application of the statute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, we view \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (iii) as affording the innocent landowner defense to one who acquires land either through the will of a decedent or by the laws of intestate succession. Therefore, the fact that the plaintiff acquired the property through the decedent\u2019s will does not deprive her of the innocent landowner defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The legislative history of the statute unequivocally makes clear that it was intended to protect people who have the ownership of polluted property involuntarily thrust upon them, such as those who inherit property. One of the goals of the statute is \u201cto find a balance between, on the one hand, protecting taxpayers from the responsibility of cleaning up private land and, on the other hand, protecting owners who do not cause or contribute to pollution on their land.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Environment, Pt. 2,1993 Sess., p. 613. As Senator John A. Kissel stated, \u201cthe case that pulls at our heartstrings is the individual that gains land by inheritance . . . .\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1993 Sess., p. 4806. Representative Richard D. Tulisano stated that \u201cthe bill before us deals with setting up a system in which individuals who otherwise had no control over certain pollution . . . will no longer be hable for cleaning it up.\u201d 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 32, 1993 Sess., p. 11,440. Representative Tulisano further explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>\u201c[i]t only applies to those people who fit the definition of an innocent landowner. And it is a person who either inherited it, without any knowledge or a trustee who takes in something like that and they are not going to [be] personally liable.\u201d 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 34, 1993 Sess., pp. 12,275-76. \u201cThe innocent landowner is by definition innocent, a stranger to the pollution, as it were. Not one who caused the condition although he or she now owns land . . . that is subject to pollution . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., p. 12,297, remarks of Representative Dale W. Radcliffe. Representative Richard O. Belden agreed with Representative Tulisano that if the land is inherited, \u201cthe person who inherited it is free and clear even though the previous owner may have in fact, been a party to [the] pollution . . . .\u201d Id., p. 12,279.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Additionally, the legislative history indicates that even if the person inheriting the land had some knowledge that the land was polluted, that individual would still be entitled to the innocent landowner defense. Representative Angelo M. Fusco had asked: \u201c [I]f the person knew that the land that they inherited had some contamination, really doesn\u2019t understand the extent or the environmental issue, but they inherited it and . . . weren\u2019t involved in the contamination, this [statute] would give them some protection?\u201d Id., p. 12,287. Representative Tulisano responded to that question by stating \u201c[t]hat is what it is designed to protect.\u201d Id., p. 12,288.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">During the Senate debates, Senator Kissel asked whether it is \u201ccorrect to interpret that this bill, without an inquiry as to whether they knew or reasonably knew of the existence of contamination, that if they acquire the land through inheritance, they are immediately placed in the class of innocent landowner despite any knowledge or reasonableness of their lack of knowledge that may exist . . . .\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1993 Sess., p. 4804. Senator George C. Jepsen responded that \u201c[i]f they\u2019re already liable for acts they may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>committed, they would have remained liable. You cannot cleanse them of that, but apart from that exception, that would be correct.\u201d Id. Senator Kissel further inquired: \u201cWhy are we absolving people who acquire the land through inheritance? Why are we not asking whether they knew or had a reasonable belief of lack of knowledge? Why are they being targeted as a class to be immediately made innocent landowners . . . ?\u201d Id. Senator Jepsen replied: \u201cNumber one, it conforms with the federal law,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and number two, if you think it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>through, that would be quite a treat to inherit a piece of polluted land from Uncle Bill and find that the \u2014 let\u2019s say it was worth a million bucks and there was a $2 million liability for cleanup and what you would in fact inherit, as what Senator Kissel has suggested, is that you would inherit not only the million dollars of land, but the $2 million in cleanup costs. I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s correct. That\u2019s a nice present from Uncle Bill.\u201d Id., p. 4805.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The commissioner\u2019s argument that the plaintiff did not acquire the property completely by inheritance depends upon the fact that the plaintiff owned one share of Dale, Inc., and, upon its dissolution, received a 1 percent interest in the property. During oral argument, the commissioner agreed that had the decedent owned 100 percent of the shares of stock of the corporations that owned the property at the time of his death, and, consequently, had his estate owned 100 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of the shares of Dale, Inc., then the plaintiffs acquisition of the property through the estate of the decedent after the dissolution of Dale, Inc., would have conferred upon her the status of an innocent landowner because she would have obtained the property entirely through the decedent\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We cannot draw a different conclusion on the basis of the technicality that the plaintiff was a 1 percent shareholder because the underlying reality of the transaction is that she acquired the property through the decedent\u2019s estate. Although the legislative history of \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (iii) does not expressly address the present situation, we discern from that history that the legislature\u2019s intent in creating the innocent landowner defense was to protect people who have polluted land involuntarily thrust upon them. The plaintiff is one such person. But for the decedent\u2019s death and the distribution of his assets according to the terms of his will, the plaintiff would not have acquired the property. Her 1 percent ownership in the corporations was a mere formality, undoubtedly necessitated by the legal requirement that corporations formed in the 1950s have at least three shareholders.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See General Statutes (Rev. to 1958) \u00a7\u00a7 33-12 through 33-144; <em>Bator </em>v. <em>United Sausage Co., </em>138 Conn. 18, 21-22, 81 A.2d 442 (1951); S. Cross, Connecticut Corporation Law and Practice (1994) \u00a7 2.4, pp. 30-31 n.45. Although the decedent had given one share of stock to the plaintiff and one to her sister as statutorily required, it is undisputed that he maintained complete control over the corporations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>refrain from exalting form over substance, we look to the essence of the transaction. Upon the decedent\u2019s death, the ownership of Don, Inc., Mountview, Inc., and L and S Realty, Inc., fell into his estate. Those corporations were subsequently merged into Dale, Inc., which, consequently, owned the property. Thereafter, the plaintiff transferred ownership of the property to the estate by dissolving Dale, Inc., and then distributed an asset \u2014 the property \u2014 from the estate to herself, as she was permitted to do under the terms of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The commissioner additionally argues that the plaintiff did not have the ownership of the property involuntarily thrust upon her because she could have either left the property in the estate or renounced the gift. Because she voluntarily transferred the property to herself, the commissioner contends that the plaintiff is not an innocent landowner. We disagree. We cannot fault the plaintiff for doing what the will gave her the authority to do, namely, to distribute assets of the estate to herself. The statute does not place any conditions on the plaintiffs decision to take what she is entitled to under the will. Additionally, according to the legislative history, one of the purposes of the legislature in enacting this statute was to protect those who inherit property, even if they knew that the property was polluted, as long as they had no role in causing the pollution. See 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 34,1993Sess.,pp. 12,287-88, remarks of Representatives Angelo M. Fusco and Richard D. Tulisano; 36 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1993 Sess., pp. 4804-4805, remarks of Senators JohnA. Kissel and George Jepsen. There is no indication that the legislature intended that someone who inherits property must first examine the property and his or her options under a will before deciding whether to take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>property.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, because the plaintiff \u201cacquire [d] the interest in real estate by inheritance or bequest\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452d (1) (B) (iii), she is an innocent landowner and is not personally liable for the cost of cleaning up the polluted land.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\"> The commissioner claims that the distribution of ownership of shares is unclear because the inventory in the Probate Court indicated that the decedent owned between forty-nine and fifty-nine shares of stock in each of these corporations.
