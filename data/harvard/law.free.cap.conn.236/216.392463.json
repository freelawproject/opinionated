J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYA\">The principal issue in this certified appeal is whether, in all circumstances, article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibits the seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of nonthreatening contraband that a police officer feels during a lawful patdown search for weapons. The state charged the defendant, Terrence Trine, with possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court, <em>Parker, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the narcotics that had been seized from him. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a and Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant then entered a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tional plea of nolo contendere to the charge against him. The trial court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>accepted the plea and rendered judgment thereon. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of conviction on the ground that the seizure of the narcotics violated the defendant\u2019s rights under article first, \u00a7 7. <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>37 Conn. App. 561, 657 A.2d 675 (1995). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court recounts the relevant facts adduced at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. \u201cOn March 26,1993, Officers James Cash and Steven Sinagra of the statewide narcotics task force, a police squad consisting of officers of the Connecticut state and local police, applied for a search warrant authorizing the search of the person and residence of Marybeth Montesi. Partially on the basis of information given to them by two confidential informants, the officers stated that they had reason to believe that Montesi was involved in the sale of cocaine from her home in East Lyme. The warrant was issued the same day and entitled the officers to search Montesi\u2019s person and residence for various items common to trafficking in narcotics, including weapons and handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u201cThat afternoon, the team assigned to execute the search warrant met for a preraid briefing. Sergeant Lawrence Pagan, a member of the Connecticut state police with fifteen years experience as a state police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>and three years experience as the sergeant in charge of the eastern division of the statewide narcotics task force, led the team. Pagan was familiar with the contents of the affidavits used in connection with the application for the search warrant and was aware that those affidavits indicated a probability of weapons being found at the scene of the search. He was also aware that the warrant application sought an order of nondisclosure of the warrant and affidavits, alleging that there existed a risk that Montesi or an associate might seek reprisals against the confidential informants that had been the source of the information on which the application was predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u201cAt approximately 3 p.m., the task force arrived at Montesi\u2019s home. Because of the home\u2019s location, the task force was unable to conduct surveillance of the area without discovery. As a consequence, the officers were unable to ascertain who or how many persons might be present on the premises when the warrant was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u201cThe officers gained entrance to the premises by use of a battering ram and entered with their weapons drawn. Pagan was the second officer to enter the premises, and he observed that three persons were present-two men and one woman. Pagan immediately directed his attention to the man closest to him, later identified as the defendant. Pagan ordered the defendant to lie down on the floor on his stomach with his hands behind his head. The defendant complied with the officer\u2019s direction. Pagan holstered his weapon and handcuffed the defendant with his arms behind his back. He then patted down the defendant for the purpose of discovering whether the defendant was carrying a weapon. The search revealed that the defendant was not armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u201cIn the course of conducting his patdown of the defendant, Pagan felt a hard object in the area of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>right front pocket of the defendant\u2019s blue jeans and simultaneously heard a sound made by plastic. Pagan immediately concluded that the object that he felt was rock cocaine on the basis of his knowledge that rock cocaine was hard and often kept in small plastic bags, like the object that he felt in the defendant\u2019s pocket. Pagan reached into the defendant\u2019s pocket, seized the object and arrested him for a narcotics violation. It was later discovered that the bag recovered from the defendant\u2019s pocket contained approximately one ounce of rock cocaine.\u201d Id., 562-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The defendant moved to suppress the cocaine that had been seized from him on the ground that it had been discovered during an unconstitutional search. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in light of its determination that Pagan had violated no constitutional prohibitions either in his initial protective patdown search for weapons or in his subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In upholding the validity of the seizure of the cocaine, the trial court first concluded that Pagan had been justified in conducting a patdown search of the defendant for weapons because he had possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant might have been armed and dangerous. The trial court further concluded that Pagan\u2019s immediate belief that he had felt rock cocaine while conducting a lawful patdown search, coupled with the earlier determination by a neutral magistrate of probable cause to believe that narcotics would be found on the premises, gave Pagan probable cause to believe that the defendant illegally possessed narcotics. In light of this latter conclusion, the trial court determined that Pagan had a legal basis for seizing the cocaine from the defendant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In his appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant challenged the validity of the seizure. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>claimed that the trial court improperly had concluded that: (1) Pagan could legally conduct an initial patdown search of the defendant because he had possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant might have been armed and dangerous; and (2) despite his determination that the defendant was unarmed, Pagan could legally search the defendant\u2019s pocket and seize the cocaine found therein. Although the Appellate Court upheld the validity of the initial patdown search, it concluded, under article first, \u00a7 7, that Pagan lacked constitutional authority to search the defendant any further once he had determined that the object he had felt in the defendant\u2019s pocket during the lawful patdown search was not a weapon. Id., 573. The Appellate Court therefore reversed the judgment convicting the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The state and the defendant have both challenged the decision of the Appellate Court. The defendant renews his claim that the initial patdown search violated his state and federal constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state reiterates its claim, which the trial court accepted and the Appellate Court rejected, that the search of the defendant\u2019s pocket and the seizure of the cocaine from that pocket did not violate the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights because this search and seizure occurred during the course of a lawful arrest. We agree with the state that, in the circumstances of this case, neither the initial patdown search of the defendant nor the subsequent search of his pocket and seizure of the cocaine violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">We begin our analysis by considering the defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of the patdown search that preceded and ultimately led to the search of the defendant\u2019s pocket and the seizure of the cocaine. In agreement with the trial court, the Appellate Court concluded that the patdown search was valid because Pagan had possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant might have been armed and dangerous. Id. Both courts also concluded that Pagan had not exceeded the legitimate scope of a patdown search for weapons. See id. We are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s contentions to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and under article first, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution, a police officer may briefly detain an individual for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the individual has committed or is about to commit a crime. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 654, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990). If, during the course of a lawful investigatory detention, the officer reasonably believes that the detained individual might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>be armed and dangerous, the officer may undertake a patdown search of the individual to discover weapons. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 24; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>221 Conn. 643, 661, 607 A.2d 355 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>157 Conn. 114, 118-19, 249 A.2d 245 (1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 927, 89 S. Ct. 1783, 23 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Because a patdown search is intended to secure the safety of the investigating officer, it is strictly limited to a search for weapons. The officer cannot \u201cconduct a general exploratory search for whatever evidence of criminal activity [the officer] might find.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 30; <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 378, 113 S. Ct. 2130, 124 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1993); <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 63-65, 88 S. Ct. 1889, 20 L. Ed. 2d 917 (1968). Furthermore, a patdown search for weapons that is justified at its inception becomes constitutionally infirm if the search thereafter becomes more intrusive than necessary to protect the safety of the investigating officer. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 378; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>214 Conn. 57, 71-72, 570 A.2d 193 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>204 Conn. 187, 197, 527 A.2d 1168, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 927, 108 S. Ct. 293, 98 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Any inquiry into the permissible justification for, and boundaries of, a particular investigatory detention and patdown search is necessarily factbound. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 29; <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 71-72; <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>202 Conn. 385, 401, 521 A.2d 555 (1987). \u201cReasonable and articulable suspicion is an objective standard that focuses not on the actual state of mind of the police officer, but on whether a reasonable person, having the information available to and known by the police, would have had that level of suspicion. . . . The police officer\u2019s decision . . . must be based on more than a hunch or speculation. ... In justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>231 Conn. 43, 65, 646 A.2d 835 (1994), cert. denied, U.S. , 115 S. Ct. 1404, 131 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">On appeal, we apply a familiar standard of review to a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 645; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 660. The conclusions drawn by the trial court will be upheld unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 645; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>220 Conn. 38,44, 595 A.2d 1349 (1991). Because a trial court\u2019s determination of the validity of a patdown search implicates a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, however, we engage in a careful examination of the record to ensure that the court\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 68-69, 634 A.2d 879 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>214 Conn. 146, 154, 570 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 819, 111 S. Ct. 65, 112 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Northrop, </em>213 Conn. 405, 414, 568 A.2d 439 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In the circumstances of this case, we agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court properly determined that the patdown search was constitutional. Pagan and his fellow police officers entered Montesi\u2019s residence to search for cocaine and other narcotics pursuant to a valid search warrant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he execution of a warrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that might give rise to sudden violence . . . .\u201d <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 702, 101 S. Ct. 2587, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1981). Pagan knew that the magistrate who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>issued the search warrant had found probable cause to believe that weapons as well as narcotics were located on the premises. This specific finding by the magistrate bolstered Pagan\u2019s general awareness that narcotics traffickers are often armed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 426 n.5, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993) (recognizing correlation between drug dealing and firearms). Pagan also knew that the warrant application had requested nondisclosure of its contents because of concerns that Montesi or her associates might retaliate against the confidential informants who had assisted the police. These facts, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, amply support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Pagan had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant might have been armed and dangerous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The record also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Pagan never exceeded the strictly circumscribed scope of a lawful patdown search for weapons. The trial court found credible Pagan\u2019s testimony that he had searched the defendant solely to discover weapons. Pagan testified that he had limited his search to an open, flat-handed patdown of the exterior of the defendant\u2019s clothing. When Pagan felt an object in the defendant\u2019s pocket during the course of the patdown search, he did not manipulate the object to discern its identity. Having immediately determined that the object was not a weapon, he continued to conduct the patdown search. It was only after having ascertained that the defendant was unarmed that Pagan, believing that the object that he had felt during the patdown search was packaged rock cocaine, searched the defendant\u2019s pocket and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>seized the cocaine. The trial court was not required to believe the contrary testimony of the defendant and Montesi to the effect that Pagan initially had conducted a full search of the defendant\u2019s person rather than a patdown search for weapons. \u201cThe determination of a witness\u2019 credibility is the special function of the trial court. This court cannot sift and weigh evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 49; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>212 Conn. 223, 242, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S. Ct. 1144, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 240, 456 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Our review of the record shows that, in light of the facts found by the trial court, the Appellate Court properly concluded that the patdown search for weapons was constitutionally valid. Pagan did not act upon whim, speculation or pretext when he conducted the patdown search. Rather, Pagan acted upon his reasonable suspicion, sufficiently articulated in his testimony as credited by the trial court, and objectively supported by the circumstances surrounding his encounter with the defendant, that the defendant might have been armed and dangerous. Further, the patdown search did not exceed constitutionally permissible bounds, because Pagan limited the search to a flat-handed patdown for weapons, and did not manipulate the object that he discerned or otherwise extend the scope of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">We next turn to an analysis of the constitutional validity of the subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s pocket and the seizure of the cocaine from that pocket. The Appellate Court construed article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution to prohibit the warrantless seizure of contraband, other than weapons, that a police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>detects during a lawful patdown search. <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 564-65. We disagree with the Appellate Court that, regardless of the circumstances, our constitution bars the seizure of lawfully detected nonthreatening contraband. In this case, we conclude that there was no constitutional infirmity in Pagan\u2019s discovery of the cocaine in the defendant\u2019s pocket or in Pagan\u2019s subsequent seizure of the contraband, incident to the defendant\u2019s arrest. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The constitutional validity of the seizure of nonthreatening contraband discovered during the course of a lawful patdown search for weapons is an open question only under our state constitution. As a matter of federal constitutional law, <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 373, establishes the principle that the fourth amendment to the United States constitution permits a police officer, even though acting without a warrant, to seize nonthreatening contraband that the officer has detected through the sense of touch during a lawful patdown search. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that, for purposes of constitutional analysis, detection by plain feel is not inherently distinguishable from detection by plain view. Id., 374-76. The United States Supreme Court reasoned that nonthreatening contraband detected through a police officer\u2019s sense of touch during a patdown search validly may be seized: \u201cIf a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the same practical considerations that inhere in the plain-view context.\u201d Id., 375-76.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Consistent with the overall limitations of the fourth amendment, however, a police officer may not lawfully seize an object felt during a patdown search if the officer discerns the identity of the object by exceeding the valid scope of the patdown search. In <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 378, the search was determined to have been constitutionally impermissible because the investigating police officer had not limited his search to a lawful patdown search. Rather, the officer had engaged in \u201c \u2018squeezing, sliding and otherwise manipulating the contents of the defendant\u2019s pocket\u2019 \u2014 a pocket which the officer already knew contained no weapon.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Applying the reasoning of <em>Dickerson </em>to the facts of this case, we are persuaded that the defendant has not established a violation of his federal constitutional rights, because Pagan\u2019s patdown search of the defendant did not exceed the permissible scope of a search for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We, of course, are not bound by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in interpreting the contours of article first, \u00a7 7. \u201c[W]e may find greater protection of individual rights under our state constitution than that provided by the federal constitution.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 379, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 183. In several instances, we have concluded that the protections afforded to the citizens of this state by article first, \u00a7 7, extend beyond those provided by the fourth amendment, as that provision has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 379, 386-87; <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 651-52; <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 690, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>216 Conn. 150, 151, 160-61, 579 A.2d 58 (1990); <em>State </em>v. Dukes, 209 Conn. 98, 120, 122-23, 547 A.2d 10 (1988).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The Appellate Court held that article first, \u00a7 7, unlike its federal counterpart, categorically prohibits a police officer from seizing, without a warrant, nonthreatening contraband that is felt during a lawful patdown search. We disagree. The fundamental premise of <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 376-77, is that a police officer\u2019s tactile perceptions, formed during a lawful pat-down search, in appropriate circumstances may provide the officer with probable cause to believe that an object felt during the search is nonthreatening contraband. We are persuaded that this premise equally applies to searches and seizures analyzed under article first, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Our prior cases interpreting article first, \u00a7 7, support the conclusion that our constitution places no categorical constraints, as a matter of law, on the types of legally obtained information that may suffice to establish probable cause to search or to seize. In the determination of whether probable cause exists for warrantless searches and seizures, trial courts are authorized by article first, \u00a7 7, to consider <em>all </em>of the legally obtained facts available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>to a police officer, and <em>all </em>of the reasonable inferences that might be drawn therefrom in light of the officer\u2019s training and experience. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 123-25; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 222-23, 496 A.2d 498 (1985), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). Although not expressly relying upon article first, \u00a7 7, we have consistently held that such legally relevant information includes inferences drawn from an investigating officer\u2019s use of his or her sense of smell or hearing. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>205 Conn. 201, 213, 530 A.2d 603 (1987) (odor may establish probable cause to arrest); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 709-10, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>153 Conn. 147, 152-53, 215 A.2d 108 (1965) (noise may establish probable cause to arrest). A police officer\u2019s use of information lawfully obtained through the sense of touch to establish probable cause is entirely consistent with these precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Without questioning this generally accepted jurisprudence, the Appellate Court advanced two alternate justifications for a categorical rule barring the warrantless seizure of nonthreatening contraband detected by a police officer through the sense of touch during a lawful patdown search. The Appellate Court reasoned that \u201cthe sense of touch is far more unreliable and touching far more intrusive into the right of personal privacy expected by our citizens . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 572. Neither justification persuades us.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Whether the sense of touch is a reliable investigative tool depends upon the circumstances in which it is used. The Appellate Court cited no basis for a contrary conclusion, and we are not prepared to assume that the sense of touch is inherently less reliable than other senses that a police officer may rely upon as means of identifying an object. Contraband may well possess tactile characteristics that, to a trained and experienced police officer, are as discernible and distinctive as a familiar sight, odor, taste or sound. \u201cActions and things observed by an experienced law enforcement officer might have more significance to him in determining whether the law is being violated at a given time and place than they would have to a layman . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 123; see <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742-43, 103 S. Ct. 1535, 75 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1983) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The constitutional acceptance of patdown searches for weapons belies the contention that the sense of touch is inherently less reliable than the other senses. The very premise underlying patdown searches, which we have expressly approved under our state constitution; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 157 Conn. 118-19; \u201cis that officers will be able to detect the presence of weapons through the sense of touch.\u201d <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 376. Just as a trained and experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>police officer may use the sense of touch during a lawful patdown search to detect one of the myriad of weapons that an individual might conceal on his or her person; see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 29 (scope of patdown search confined to intrusion reasonably designed to discover \u201cguns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer\u201d); so the officer may use that same sense of touch to discern the presence of nonthreatening contraband that possesses distinctive tactile characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">For similar reasons, searches dependent upon the sense of touch are not inherently more invasive of an individual\u2019s privacy interests than are other constitutionally permissible invasions of the individual\u2019s bodily integrity. The personal intrusiveness of a lawfully circumscribed patdown search is not exacerbated by the discovery of nonthreatening contraband rather than weapons. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 378. Furthermore, once the narrow limits of a lawful pat-down search have been reached, any further intrusion into personal privacy is permissible only if based upon an independent justification, either upon a warrant supported by probable cause or upon a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. See id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">We are persuaded that existing restrictions on the use of information obtained during a lawful patdown search adequately protect individual privacy interests. The incriminating nature of a nonthreatening object felt during a patdown search must be immediately apparent; the police officer who conducts the search cannot manipulate the object to discern its identity. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 376-77. In addition, the officer\u2019s belief that the object is contraband must be objectively reasonable in light of all of the circumstances known at the time of the search. The conclusion drawn by the officer that an object is contraband is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>subject to judicial review of the reasonableness of that conclusion and of the officer\u2019s compliance with established constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We hold, therefore, that article first, \u00a7 7, does not categorically bar a police officer from seizing, without a warrant, nonthreatening contraband that the officer feels during a lawful patdown search. In so holding, we do not create a new exception to the warrant requirement. A valid warrantless search or seizure will continue to require the showing of circumstances that satisfy an existing exception to the warrant requirement. We merely conclude that information obtained through the sense of touch during a lawful patdown search may be used to establish such probable cause as is necessary to trigger an exception to the warrant requirement. The reliability and immediacy of information obtained through any of the senses ultimately, and necessarily, depend on the circumstances of each individual case rather than on per se legal categorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Having concluded that article first, \u00a7 7, does not categorically bar the seizure of nonthreatening contraband detected through the sense of touch during a lawful patdown search, we must next determine whether, in the circumstances of this case, the search of the defendant\u2019s pocket<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the seizure of the cocaine from that pocket were constitutionally valid. The Appellate Court did not reach this issue. In light of the validity of the patdown search; see part I; the state urges us to hold that the trial court properly concluded that Pagan had probable cause to believe that the object in the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ant\u2019s pocket was cocaine and, therefore, that Pagan had probable cause to arrest the defendant. The state further argues that, having had such probable cause, Pagan also had the authority to search the defendant\u2019s pocket and seize the cocaine incident to the defendant\u2019s lawful arrest. We agree with the state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The police ordinarily may not conduct a search and make a seizure unless a neutral and detached magistrate first issues a warrant based on probable cause. \u201c[A] search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is per se unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 609, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 209.

Because a trial court\u2019s determination of the existence of probable cause implicates a constitutional claim, we must \u201creview the record carefully to ensure that its determination was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 68-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The trial court concluded that Pagan had probable cause to believe that the defendant possessed narcotics before he reached into the defendant\u2019s pocket and seized the cocaine. The trial court based this conclusion on Pagan\u2019s immediate belief that he felt rock cocaine in the defendant\u2019s pocket while conducting a lawful patdown search for weapons, and on the defendant\u2019s presence at a private residence that a magistrate had found probable cause to believe was the site of cocaine trafficking. We agree with the trial court that, in light of these factual predicates, Pagan validly seized the cocaine from the defendant\u2019s pocket because, at that time, Pagan had probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of narcotics. As a result, Pagan properly seized the cocaine during a search incident to a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The trial court expressly found that \u201cPagan immediately concluded that what he felt was contraband drugs\u201d and that the object in the defendant\u2019s pocket \u201ccould be felt and recognized as contraband by an experienced narcotics officer by an open, flat-handed pat [of] the jeans pocket.\u201d These findings are not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The trial court found credible Pagan\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that, upon feeling the object in the defendant\u2019s pocket, he immediately believed it to be rock cocaine.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Pagan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>belief did not arise in a factual vacuum. Rather, he relied on his fifteen years of experience as a police officer, and his most recent experience, during the past three years, in drug enforcement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That experience informed him how narcotics are stored and taught him how, during a patdown search, to recognize the feel of packaged narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s personal observations buttressed its factual findings. The trial court had before it the cocaine that Pagan had seized from the defendant and a plastic bag similar to the one in which Pagan had found the cocaine. The trial court also observed the defendant wearing the same jeans that he had worn when Pagan had searched him. We conclude that the trial court properly found, both on the basis of its assessment of the physical evidence and Pagan\u2019s testimony, that Pagan had immediately and reasonably believed that the object he had felt in the defendant\u2019s pocket was rock cocaine.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Substantial evidence therefore supports the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that probable cause existed before Pagan searched the defendant\u2019s pocket and seized the cocaine. As we have already determined, Pagan immediately and reasonably believed that the object in the defendant\u2019s pocket was rock cocaine. Furthermore, Pagan detained and patted down the defendant at a private residence that, according to the probable cause finding by a neutral magistrate, was the site of cocaine trafficking. \u201cWhen a magistrate has determined that a residence is the probable site of drug trafficking, the occupants of that residence are very likely to be involved in drug trafficking . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>172 Wis. 2d 86, 98, 492 N.W.2d 311 (1992), cert. denied, 509 U.S. 914, 113 S.

Therefore, once a police officer has determined that an individual does not possess a weapon, the search is over and there is no authority for further intrusion. <em>Ybarra </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 92-94, 100 S.

A police officer needs only a \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion\u201d that an individual is engaged in criminal activity in order to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>231 Conn. 43, 65, 646 A.2d 835 (1994), cert. denied, U.S. 115 S. Ct. 1404, 131 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1995). Simply because a <em>Terry </em>stop is permitted, however, does not necessarily mean that there is a justification for a patdown. Before an individual may be patted down, which is far more intrusive of a person\u2019s privacy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the officer must also have a reasonable belief that the individual is armed and dangerous. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 373. For the purposes of this dissent, I assume that both of these requirements have been met.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Extending the <em>Terry </em>patdown under the state constitution to allow a police officer\u2019s \u201cplain touch\u201d to form the basis for probable cause to conduct a full blown search and seizure is easily subject to abuse. The impact of this extension will fall the hardest on the poor, underprivileged and minority members of our society who are economically compelled to live in neighborhoods that are infested with crime and drugs. It is in this setting that police are more apt to claim a fear of weapons in order to engage in a <em>Terry </em>patdown when their true motivation is to search for contraband. \u201cThe \u2018plain touch\u2019 doctrine will encourage officers to investigate any lump or bulge in a person\u2019s clothing or pockets that arouses their curiosity during the course of a patdown search. If the item turns out to be contraband, then its seizure can be retrospectively justified. If it turns out to be something else, then there is no case and the matter ends there. In the interim, a citizen is subject to an unwarranted intrusion into his personal privacy far beyond the intrusion contemplated by the weapons patdown search.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>165 Ill. 2d 211, 650 N.E.2d 1014, 1025 (1995) (Heiple, J., dissenting); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 370 (similarly, because no evidence flowed from <em>Terry </em>stop, court had no cause to determine whether stop was constitutional, thereby ignoring possible invasion into individual\u2019s privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Both the United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Dickerson </em>and the majority\u2019s analysis in this case hinge on a flawed premise: contraband may possess distinctive \u201ctactile characteristics.\u201d It does not take much experience, either on the part of a police officer or a judge, to be able to determine accurately the existence of a gun, knife, billy club or other weapon by the sense of touch. This is because weapons possess distinctive physical characteristics that lend themselves to being identified by touch.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contraband, such as drugs, however, does not possess such distinguishing tactile characteristics. Contraband takes the form of the container in which it is kept. Unless an individual is clairvoyant, the contents of a package cannot be determined from merely touching the container.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">For example, in a similar case recently before the Court of Appeals of Michigan, a police officer, while conducting a <em>Terry </em>patdown, \u201cfelt a pill bottle in [the] defendant\u2019s groin. He claimed that he recognized this as a method by which cocaine was transported. However, in order to make the determination that this particular pill bottle contained cocaine, he had to remove it from [the] defendant\u2019s person and visually inspect it.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>205 Mich. App. 623, 631, 518 N.W.2d 518 (1994). The court held that the contraband should have been suppressed at trial because \u201cit [is] impossible to conclude that the incriminating nature of a pill bottle is immediately apparent. . . . Merely from feeling the contours of a pill bottle, the officer was able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to conclude that [the] defendant carried a pill bottle, not that he carried contraband.\u201d Id., 631-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Similarly, in this case, Sergeant Lawrence Pagan of the Connecticut state police concluded that the defendant was not armed<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but felt \u201ca hard object\u201d and heard \u201ca sound made by plastic.\u201d From this information alone, the trial court concluded that the object\u2019s \u201cincriminating character [was] \u2018immediately apparent.\u2019 <em>\u201dHorton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 136, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>207 Conn. 323, 335, 541 A.2d 1209 (1988). Such a conclusion is speculative and defies logic. Dozens of items, such as a Tootsie Roll, a Snickers bar or cough drops, possess the two characteristics described by Pagan. Indeed, one commentator analogized the \u201cplain feel\u201d exception to a fourth amendment rendition of \u201cthe princess and the pea.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, the officer\u2019s patdown could not have given him probable cause to arrest the defendant and engage in a search of his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>supra, 508 U.S. 366, depended heavily on an analogy between plain view and plain touch. Such an analogy is flawed. \u201cThe plain view doctrine, it must be emphasized, establishes an exception to the requirement of a warrant not to <em>search </em>for an item, but to <em>seize </em>it. Because [an] item is already in the open where it may be seen, the owner can have no expectation of privacy in its concealment and, thus, its viewing cannot be a search under [either the federal or state constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>tion] .... The theory underlying the justification for the plain view exception cannot logically be extended to concealed items which are discoverable only through touch. . . . Unlike the item in plain view in which the owner has no privacy expectation, the owner of an item concealed by clothing or other covering retains a legitimate expectation that the item\u2019s existence and characteristics will remain private. . . . For, even if the intrusion inherent in the initial act of touching is entirely authorized, the discovery and seizure of the items will entail a further intrusion.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>81 N.Y.2d 106, 110-11, 612 N.E.2d 298, 595 N.Y.S.2d 940 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u201cIndeed, the very concept of \u2018plain touch\u2019 is a contradiction in terms: the idea of plainness cannot logically be associated with information concerning a concealed item which is available only through the sensory perceptions of someone who touches it. . . . While in most instances seeing an object will instantly reveal its identity and nature, touching is inherently less reliable and cannot conclusively establish an object\u2019s identity or criminal nature . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 112. Moreover, unlike \u201cplain touch,\u201d the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine does not provide law enforcement officers with an incentive to subject an individual to a <em>Terry </em>patdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Furthermore, the very issue before us today was addressed twenty-five years ago by the Connecticut Circuit Court. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous 1971-20, </em>6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 583, 587-88, 280 A.2d 816 (1971), Judge David Jacobs wrote: \u201cWhere, as in the case at bar, the officer does not feel an object which seems to be a weapon, but feels a package which he believes might be evidence of some crime, such as the possession of narcotics, the question arises whether he must terminate his search or whether he may reach into the person\u2019s pocket and bare whatever it holds. \u2018The sole justification of the search in the present situation is the protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>police officer and others nearby, and it must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\u2019 <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>[392 U.S. 1, 29, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968)]. In other words, an extended search, exceeding the purpose of the frisk, would be constitutionally unreasonable, and any evidence thereby obtained must be excluded. \u2018Such a search violates the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment, which protects the sanctity of the person against unreasonable intrusions on the part of all government agents.\u2019 <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>[supra, 392 U.S. 65].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">I agree with both Judge Jacobs and the Appellate Court. \u201c[T]he sense of touch is far more unreliable and touching [is] far more intrusive into the right of personal privacy expected by our citizens and [consequently] the concept of [plain touch] fails to comport with the mandate of article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>37 Conn.

Ed. 2d 334 (1993), Justice Scaiia noted that the constitutional basis for a <em>Terry </em>patdown cannot be found in the common law: \u201cI am not entirely sure that the physical search \u2014 the \u2018frisk\u2019 \u2014 that produced the evidence at issue here complied with that constitutional standard. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">\u201cThere is good evidence, I think, that the \u2018stop\u2019 portion of the <em>Terry </em>\u2018stop- and-frisk\u2019 holding accords with the common law \u2014 that it had long been considered reasonable to detain suspicious persons for the purpose of demanding that they give an account of themselves. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201cI am unaware, however, of any precedent for a physical search of a person thus temporarily detained for questioning. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201cI frankly doubt, moreover, whether the fiercely proud men who adopted our Fourth Amendment would have allowed themselves to be subjected, on mere <em>suspicion </em>of being armed and dangerous, to such indignity . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> In describing the invasiveness and the indignity of a <em>Terry </em>patdown, Justice Scalia, in his concurring opinion in <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 381-82,113 S. Ct. 2130, 124 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1993), quoted from a standard police manual recommending that the following procedure be used: \u201c \u2018Check the subject\u2019s neck and collar. A check should be made under the subject\u2019s arm. Next a check should be made of the upper back. The lower back should also be checked.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">\u201c \u2018A check should be made of the upper part of the man\u2019s chest and the lower region around the stomach. The belt, a favorite concealment spot, should be checked. The <em>inside thigh and crotch area </em>also should be searched. The legs should be checked for possible weapons. The last items to be checked are the shoes and cuffs of the subject.\u2019 J. Moynahan, Police Searching Procedures 7 (1963) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\"> See footnotes 2 and 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> In this case, the defendant, who was on the premises when the search warrant was executed, was unknown to the police. Other than the fact that he was present, there is nothing in the record that would have justified the police to be suspicious of him. Indeed, when the police entered, they demanded that the defendant put his hands on his head and lie face down on 1he floor. He immediately complied. The defendant was then handcuffed by the police. Subsequently, while lying face down with his hands handcuffed behind his back, the defendant was subjected to a <em>Terry </em>patdown. It is well established that \u201c[a]n individual may [not] be frisked based upon nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>more than an unfortunate choice of associates.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>762 F.2d 495, 499 (6th Cir. 1985). All the <em>Terry </em>requirements must be satisfied \u201ceven though [a] person happens to be on premises where an authorized narcotics search is taking place.\u201d <em>Ybarra </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 444 U.S. 94; see <em>State v. Coons, </em>627 A.2d 1064 (N.H. 1993) (as a threshold matter, police officer must reasonably believe person to be frisked is armed and dangerous). In order to justify the patdown of the defendant, the majority depends solely on the application for the search warrant, which indicated, in boilerplate language, that there may be weapons at the location to be searched. The application alleged that \u201cbased on [the general training and experience of the police officers] . . . [f]irearms that are to be seized are commonly possessed and used by the drug dealer for the intimidation of <em>his </em>customers to collect payment for their drug debts and protection from theft of <em>his </em>drugs and monies by competitors.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The boilerplate nature of this assertion is apparent given the fact that the person to be searched under the warrant was a woman, not a man. Under the circumstances of this case, therefore, it is not evident whether a reasonably prudent person could be warranted in believing that the officers were in danger. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> There may be certain weapons that do not possess such distinctive tactile characteristics, but we indulge in this belief nonetheless because of the possible danger to the police officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> If, of course, during the patdown, a gun is found, this may very well furnish a police officer with probable cause to arrest. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 53-206 (permit required to carry dangerous weapons). This, of course, would trigger the right to a full search incident to a lawful arrest. <em>State </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>223 Conn. 283, 292, 612 A.2d 1189 (1992). For all practical purposes, the \u201cplain touch\u201d doctrine that the majority embraces arises only in a situation, such as this case, where no weapon is found on the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\"> Note, \u201cThe \u2018Plain Feel\u2019 Exception \u2014 A Fourth Amendment Rendition of the Princess and the Pea: <em>State </em>v. <em>Dickerson,\" </em>62 U.
