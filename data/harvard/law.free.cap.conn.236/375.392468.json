A jury found for the plaintiff on his complaint and on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdicts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant subsequently moved to set aside the verdicts and to render judgment notwithstanding the verdicts on the ground that the plaintiff was precluded from recovering on the policy because he had not commenced this action within one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>year from the date of the fire loss he had suffered, as required by a policy provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. In its memorandum of decision, the court incorporated its earlier ruling denying a motion by the defendant for summary judgment. In that ruling, the court had denied summary judgment for the defendant because it had determined that whether the defendant was equitably estopped from denying payment of the plaintiffs claim was a question of fact. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The defendant claims that because it did not expressly waive the statutorily mandated<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requirement in the policy that the plaintiff initiate suit on the policy within one year from the date of his fire loss and because it was not estopped from enforcing the provisions of the policy, it was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We agree that the defendant was not estopped, and reverse the judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Certain facts are undisputed. The plaintiff was the owner of a three family house located at 539 Blue Hills Avenue in Hartford. The plaintiff resided in the first floor apartment, and rented the second and third floor apartments to tenants. On May 11, 1987, a fire substantially damaged the house. The plaintiff immediately notified the defendant, which provided fire insurance coverage on the premises pursuant to a homeowner\u2019s policy. The following day, a representative of the defendant conducted a brief investigation on the premises and gave the plaintiff a check for $10,000 as an advance payment for the fire damage. Shortly thereafter, however, the defendant learned that the plaintiff was suspected of having been involved in causing the fire and issued a stop payment order on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On May 15,1987, at the defendant\u2019s request, the plaintiff voluntarily signed a nonwaiver agreement. The agreement provided that the defendant\u2019s investigation into the cause of the fire did not operate as a waiver of either party\u2019s rights under the policy or as a waiver of any of the terms and conditions of the policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>after, on June 16, 1987, as required by the policy, the plaintiff filed a proof of loss claim with the defendant, requesting that the defendant provide coverage for the fire damage to his house and its contents, and for the interruption of rental income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff was arrested and charged with arson in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-112<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in connection with the fire. The plaintiff pleaded nolo contendere to the charge and was found guilty in June, 1989.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">While the arson charge was pending against the plaintiff, the defendant requested by mail that, pursuant to the terms of the policy, the plaintiff submit to an examination under oath regarding his claim. The letter sent to the plaintiff also informed him that \u201c[t]he noticing of your examination under oath in no way shall be construed to be a waiver by [the defendant] of its lights or defenses under the policy of insurance referred to above.\u201d Because of the pending criminal prosecution, the plaintiff, on the advice of counsel in his criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>case, did not appear for the scheduled examination. Counsel handling the plaintiffs fire insurance claim then contacted counsel for the defendant by telephone and informed him that the plaintiff would not give sworn testimony until the resolution of his pending criminal prosecution. In response, on January 18, 1988, the defendant\u2019s counsel wrote a letter to the plaintiffs counsel requesting that he be notified when the plaintiff would be available to be examined under oath. The plaintiff notified the defendant in September, 1989, and, again, in October, 1989, that he was available to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Thereafter, on November 16,1989, the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was denying his claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subsequently, on January 25,1990, almost two years and eight months after the fire, the plaintiff brought this action, alleging that the defendant had breached the insurance policy by improperly denying coverage and claiming that he was entitled to compensatory and punitive damages. The defendant pleaded as a special defense that the plaintiffs action was precluded by the one year statutory limitation on suit provision in the policy. The defendant also counterclaimed, seeking reimbursement for the sums it had paid to the plaintiffs mortgagee,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and for attorney\u2019s fees and other costs it had expended investigating the plaintiffs claim. In response, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant should be estopped from raising the defense of the time limit on suit in the policy because, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the plaintiff had reasonably believed that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>waived its right to rely on that provision. The jury agreed with the plaintiff, and returned a verdict in his favor on both his claim for damages and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. Following the jury\u2019s verdicts, the defendant moved to set aside the verdicts and for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the plaintiffs contention that the defendant had impliedly waived, or should be estopped from asserting, the statutory limitation on suit contained in the policy. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination that the defendant was estopped from asserting the time limitation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We reverse in part.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Our review of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to set aside a verdict and to direct a verdict in favor of the movant is well established. \u201cIn considering a motion to set aside the verdict, the court must determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, reasonably supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>194 Conn. 35, 41, 478 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>A.2d 596 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Childs </em>v. Bainer, 235 Conn. 107, 112, 663 A.2d 398 (1995). In reviewing the action of the trial court in denying a motion to set aside the verdict, \u201c[i]t is the function of this court to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion . . . .\u201d <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 139, 540 A.2d 666 (1988). \u201cThe verdict will be set aside and judgment directed only if we find that the jury could not reasonably and legally have reached [its] conclusion. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 83, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994). \u201cIf, on the evidence, the jury could reasonably have decided as [it] did, [the reviewing court] will not find error in the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the verdict .... However, it is the court\u2019s duty to set aside the verdict when it finds that it does manifest injustice, and is . . . palpably against the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Childs </em>v. <em>Bainer, </em>supra, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The defendant claims that, because the plaintiff did not commence suit within one year of the date of loss as required by the policy and by \u00a7 38a-307 and because there was no express waiver of the time limitation as required by the statutory provision in the policy, the plaintiffs claim must fail as a matter of law. The policy provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o permission affecting this insurance shall exist, or waiver of any provision be valid, unless granted herein or expressed in writing added hereto.\u201d The defendant argues that the plaintiffs noncompliance with this provision alone is dispositive and prevents the plaintiff from recovering.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>native, the defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that the defendant, by its actions, was equitably estopped from relying on the statutory time limit for commencing suit on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The plaintiff does not claim that the defendant expressly waived any of the terms of the policy. He contends, instead, that the doctrine of equitable estoppel precludes the defendant from asserting the policy provision limiting the time to commence suit as a defense to this action. The plaintiff argues that the evidence adduced at trial supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s actions induced him to believe that the statutory policy provision containing the one year limit on commencing suit would not be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">We agree with the plaintiff that, despite the lack of evidence of an express waiver of the terms of the policy, he could pursue this action under the theory of equitable estoppel. We conclude, however, that the dearth of evidence of misleading conduct on the part of the defendant defeats the plaintiffs recovery based on estoppel, and that the trial court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Estoppel has its roots in equity and stems from \u201cthe voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed . . . as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse. 3 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th Ed. 1941) \u00a7 804, p. 189; 28 Am. Jur. 2d, Estoppel and Waiver \u00a7 76; accord <em>Spear-Newman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Modern Floors Corporation, </em>149 Conn. 88, 91, 175 A.2d 565 (1961); <em>Tradesmens National Bank of New Haven </em>v. <em>Minor, </em>122 Conn. 419, 424, 190 A. 270 (1937); <em>MacKay </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>118 Conn. 538, 548, 173 A. 783 (1934).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Emerick, </em>28 Conn. App. 794, 802-803, 613 A.2d 1351, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 915, 617 A.2d 171 (1992). \u201cThe modem estoppel in pais is of equitable origin, though of equal application in courts of law. It is much more than a rule of evidence. It establishes rights; it determines remedies. An equitable estoppel does not so much shut out the truth as let in the truth, and the whole truth. Its office is ... to show what equity and good conscience require, under the particular circumstances of the case .... <em>Lebowitz </em>v. <em>McPike, </em>157 Conn. 235, 243, 253 A.2d 1 [1968].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 564, 316 A.2d 394 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">It would be unjust to foreclose an insured\u2019s ability to assert an estoppel theory because the insured has not obtained a written waiver when other actions of the insurance carrier lead the insured reasonably to believe that the statutory limitation on suit provision or any other provision of an insurance policy will not be enforced. See, e.g., <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Fire Ins. Co., </em>171 W. Va. 337, 341, 298 S.E.2d 874 (1982) (recognizing one year statutory suit limitation provision contained in fire insurance policy will be extended if insurance company by negotiations or other actions induces insured to delay filing suit). \u201cThis court [does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>not intend] to advance the cause of the unscrupulous\u201d; <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 240, 618 A.2d 501 (1992); and, therefore, we decline to adopt the defendant\u2019s argument that the legislatively mandated non-waiver provision precludes an insured from asserting equitable estoppel whenever the insured fails to obtain a written waiver, no matter what the insurer does or does not do that might mislead the insured. Accordingly, we conclude that \u201cthe principle that no one shall be permitted to found any claim upon his own inequity or take advantage of his own wrong\u201d; <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 163 Conn, 565; trumps the defendant\u2019s position that the nonwaiver provision of \u00a7 38a-307 precludes the plaintiffs estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We turn now to the issue of whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the doctrine of equitable estoppel precluded the defendant from enforcing the statutory one year limitation on suit provision in the policy. We conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. \u201cWe [have] recognized that estoppel always requires proof of two essential elements: the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. <em>Bozzi </em>v. <em>Bozzi, </em>177 Conn. 232, 242, 413 A.2d 834 (1979); <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 344, 353, 365 A.2d 1093 (1976); <em>Pet Care Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>150 Conn. 42, 53-54, 184 A.2d 797 (1962). <em>Zoning Commissioner. Lescynski, </em>[188 Conn. 724, 731, 453 A.2d 1144 (1982)]. . . . \u2018Moreover, it is the burden of the person claiming the estoppel to show that he exercised due diligence to ascertain the truth and that he not only lacked knowledge of the true state of things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>but had no convenient means of acquiring that knowledge.\u2019 . . . <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>supra, 353.\u201d <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 221, 246-47, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Viewing the evidence produced at trial in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we conclude that the evidence fails to indicate any misleading conduct by the defendant on which the plaintiff could have reasonably relied to support his belief that the statutory suit limitation provision would not be enforced. See <em>Lunn </em>v. <em>Tokeneke Assn., Inc., </em>227 Conn. 601, 607, 630 A.2d 1335 (1993) (equitable estoppel requires misleading conduct by one party resulting in prejudice to other). In fact, the plaintiffs signing of the nonwaiver agreement, although not dispositive of the issue, suggests the opposite result. The nonwaiver agreement made the plaintiff aware that the defendant intended to hold him to the terms of the policy while investigating the merits of his claim. In addition, the defendant\u2019s stop payment order on the initial check it issued to the plaintiff should have put him on notice that the defendant had serious questions concerning its obligation to provide coverage. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s letter, requesting that the plaintiff submit to an examination under oath, contained non-waiver language and reiterated the defendant\u2019s intention to enforce the terms and conditions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The plaintiff relies principally on the absence of language indicating nonwaiver in the defendant\u2019s January 18,1988 letter asking him to advise the defendant when he would be willing and able to be deposed. We cannot read the mere absence of nonwaiver language in that letter as conduct of the defendant that would induce the plaintiff or any reasonable claimant to believe that the limitation period in the policy had been waived. We believe it would be palpably unfair to allow the plaintiff to use the defendant\u2019s acquiescence in his request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>postpone his examination under oath to invoke successfully the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the defendant when there is no language in that letter even hinting at a waiver of any provision of the policy. Indeed, the plaintiffs claim that the absence of any nonwaiver language begets an estoppel or an implied waiver contradicts the long-standing principle that \u201c \u2018silence will not operate as [an] estoppel absent a duty to speak.\u2019 \u201d <em>John T. Brady &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>220 Conn. 432, 444, 599 A.2d 370 (1991). In light of the defendant\u2019s prior communications to the plaintiff in which it had repeatedly manifested its intention not to waive any of the provisions of the policy, the plaintiff should have been fully cognizant of the defendant\u2019s intention to enforce the policy terms. Moreover, under the circumstances, due diligence at least required that the plaintiff make an inquiry of the defendant before assuming that the defendant did not intend to enforce the terms of its policy. <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 234 Conn. 246-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The plaintiff also contends that the defendant should be estopped from enforcing the time limit in the policy because it did not inquire whether the plaintiff possessed a copy of the policy, and did not offer to send him one or to indicate more explicitly to him that it intended to rely on the statutorily mandated provision in question. We disagree. The defendant was under no duty to ask whether the plaintiff had a copy of the policy, to submit a copy of the policy to the plaintiff or to inform him further of its intentions to rely on the limitation provision as a defense to coverage. See <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>217 Conn. 340, 350, 586 A.2d 567 (1991) (no duty on behalf of insurance company to inform other party of its intention to rely on one year statute of limitation clause in policy). In sum, \u201c \u2018[t]he record is persuasive that this is a case not of the defendants\u2019 lulling the plaintiff into a sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>of false security but of the latter\u2019s sleeping on his rights.\u2019 \u201d Id.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support the plaintiffs recovery on an estoppel theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant on the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-12\"> The plaintiff is a male.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-13\"> The jury awarded the plaintiff $127,875, subject to a setoff of $20,520.

The defendant, however, has not appealed from this decision of the trial court. We, therefore, are not called upon to review any issues related to the disposition of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 38a-307 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe standard form of lire insurance policy of the state of Connecticut . . . shall be as follows . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201cWaiver provisions.

The trial court ruled that the doctrine of estoppel permitted the plaintiff to pursue his action despite the language of \u00a7 38a-307. Although we typically do not review the denial of a motion for summary judgment once a final judgment has been rendered; <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 541 n.7, 590 A.2d 531 (1991); we will review it in this case to the extent that the trial court specifically incorporated this ruling into its decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> The defendant also claims that the trial court erred by improperly: (1) precluding its attorney from explaining the reason for the absence of the nonwaiver language in the January 18,1988 letter to the plaintiff; (2) limiting the cross-examination of the plaintiff regarding his arson conviction; and (3) instructing the jury that an adverse inference could be drawn from its failure to call a witness.

In <em>Moore, </em>the court concluded that the express waiver requirement for the statutory suit limitation provision contained in a fire insurance policy supersedes the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>rule recognizing oral waiver and waiver by conduct. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Moore, </em>however, is misplaced. The question of equitable estoppel was not an issue before the court in that case. In fact, the court expressly stated that \u201c[o]ur holding in this case does not preclude the possibility that, in an appropriate case, an insurer may be estopped from asserting the limitations clause as a defense.\u201d Id., 243 n.7. We believe this is an appropriate case and, therefore, conclude that we must determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that estoppel precluded the defendant\u2019s reliance on the limitation clause as a defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b410-12\"> The plaintiff also claims that the defendant\u2019s remitting payment to the plaintiffs mortgagee provides additional support for his estoppel argument. We find this assertion unpersuasive because the defendant was obligated to pay the plaintiffs mortgagee, pursuant to the terms of the policy, whenever damage to the property had occurred. That obligatory conduct by the defendant does not serve to bolster the plaintiffs claim of estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
