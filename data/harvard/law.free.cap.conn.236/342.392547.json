On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant argued that the trial court had improperly refused to charge the jury on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>36 Conn. App. 448, 454, 651 A.2d 754 (1994). The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id. We granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">During the trial, defense counsel filed a written request to charge the jury on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance. At the close of the case, the court denied the defendant\u2019s request for two reasons: (1) the defendant on cross-examination had testified that he had not been upset by the events on which he partially relied for the defense; and (2) the defendant had produced insufficient evidence to raise the issue of extreme emotional disturbance. During a colloquy with counsel, out of the presence of the jury, the court stated: \u201cI cannot see extreme emotional disturbance in this case. I don\u2019t see any evidence of it. You are asking in effect for the jury to find the opposite of what the defendant says occurred to support a claim by the defendant that he has offered evidence to support extreme emotional disturbance . . . .\u201d The court further stated: \u201cI assumed from the outset that extreme emotional disturbance would be in this case but I didn\u2019t expect to hear the defendant on the stand denying every question that was asked about him leading to his mental state at various times.\u201d The trial court did instruct the jury on self-defense and on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first degree,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> manslaughter in the second degree and criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The Appellate Court did not reach the issue of whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant an instruction on extreme emotional disturbance because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>it held that if, \u201cas in the present case, the defendant specifically disavows having the requisite mental state for the instruction that he seeks, Cassino<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Zayas<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> preclude the defendant from obtaining the contradicting instruction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 36 Conn. App. 453-54. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Section 53a-54a (a), in defining the crime of murder, excepts, as an affirmative defense, a homicide committed by a defendant who acts \u201cunder the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be . . . .\u201d Under such circumstances, if a defendant intentionally causes the death of an individual, but does so under extreme emotional disturbance, the trier of fact may convict the defendant of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 731, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request for an instruction on extreme emotional disturbance raises two issues: (1) whether the defendant\u2019s trial testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>precluded such an instruction because it directly contradicted the defense;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, if not, (2) whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant the requested instruction. We review each of these issues in turn together with their related facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The following testimony was presented to the jury. The defendant and Pouncey had been romantically involved and had planned to marry. Pouncey, however, terminated their engagement, after which she commenced a relationship with Donald Moody. The defendant testified that on May 19, 1991, he had forcefully entered Pouncey\u2019s apartment while she was away in order to recover his personal belongings. While the defendant was in the rear bedroom gathering his possessions, Pouncey returned home with her child. The defendant further testified that after speaking on the telephone, Pouncey had confronted him in the bedroom with a can of Mace in one hand and two knives in the other. According to the defendant, Pouncey had instigated a struggle by spraying Mace in his eyes. In the course of the struggle, the defendant stabbed Pouncey. The defendant then fled the apartment and later surrendered himself at the New Haven police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">On direct examination, the defendant testified, with respect to his state of mind, that he had been \u201csomewhat\u201d upset by the fact that Pouncey had begun dating Moody.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On cross-examination, however, when asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>if he was \u201cupset because [he] felt that [Moody] was moving in on [his] gal,\u201d the defendant responded: \u201cNot really.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, the court refused to instruct the jury on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u201c \u2018A fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 273, 576 A.2d 139 (1990), quoting <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967). The question before us today is whether a defendant forgoes the right to have a jury instructed on a requested defense if the defendant denies having the state of mind required to establish the requested defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">It is for the jury to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 234, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995). \u201cThe jury is free to juxtapose conflicting versions of events and to determine which is more credible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 278, 623 A.2d 42 (1993). \u201c[T]he [jury] can disbelieve any or all of the evidence . . . and can construe [the] evidence in a manner different from the parties\u2019 assertions. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 381, 590 A.2d 408 (1991). Therefore, because the jury was free to disbelieve the defendant\u2019s testimony, his asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tions therein did not preclude a jury instruction on extreme emotional disturbance. Rather, as the state correctly conceded at oral argument,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a jury may be instructed on a requested defense theory, even if the defendant has testified to facts that contradict the requested charge, if there is sufficient evidence to warrant the instruction. See <em>State </em>v. Harris, 189 Conn. 268, 273, 455 A.2d 342 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassino, </em>188 Conn. 237, 449 A.2d 154 (1982), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>3 Conn. App. 289, 489 A.2d 380, cert. denied, 195 Conn. 803, 491 A.2d 1104 (1985), was misplaced. Neither of those cases stands for the proposition that a defendant forfeits a defense theory if he or she testifies to a contradictory fact or conclusion. Our decision in <em>Cassino </em>\u201cwas based upon the conclusion that the defendant had failed to introduce sufficient evidence to warrant a self-defense instruction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 274 n.4. Similarly, in <em>Zayas, </em>the defendant requested that the jury be charged on self-defense, but there was insufficient evidence tending to establish that defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>supra, 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Instructing on a defense for which the defendant has given contradictoiy testimony is particularly appropriate in cases, such as the present one, in which the requested defense involves the defendant\u2019s mental state. The applicability of such a defense theory should not be judged solely upon the defendant\u2019s personal description of his or her own mental status. In fact, we have previously held that \u201ca court may, under certain circumstances, impose a mental status defense [such as extreme emotional disturbance] on an unwilling defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manfredi, </em>213 Conn. 500, 516, 569 A.2d 506, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 818, 111 S. Ct. 62, 112 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1990); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Conn. 729 (jury instructed on extreme emotional disturbance defense over objection of defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This analysis is consistent with the rule that a defendant is permitted to present inconsistent defenses to a jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 273. In <em>Harris, </em>the defendant asserted two inconsistent defenses: (1) an alibi defense; and (2) an affirmative defense that the gun used in the alleged crimes was a toy. Id., 271-72. The state argued that \u201ccontrived defenses would result [i]f a defendant could deny participation in a robbery, offer evidence of someone else\u2019s involvement using a toy gun, and still avail himself of the affirmative defense under [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 272. We rejected the state\u2019s argument and held that \u201cinconsistent defenses may be interposed in a criminal case. . . . [The fact t]hat a defense is inteiposed which is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s alibi theory does not preclude an instruction as to that defense. . . . [T]he fact that one defense is on the theory that [the] accused did not commit the offense, as where he relies on alibi, does not deprive him of the right to avail himself of other defenses. ... To compel a defendant to admit guilt in order to invoke a defense effectively relieves the prosecution of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and frustrates the assertion of the defense itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>and undermines its policy.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 108 S. Ct. 883, 99 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1988), the United States Supreme Court addressed an issue similar to the one raised in this case. In <em>Mathews, </em>the defendant requested a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of entrapment, despite the fact that he had denied commission of the crime. The court held \u201cthat even if the defendant denies one or more elements of the crime [or defense], he is entitled to an [instruction on his requested affirmative defense] whenever there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find [the defense].\u201d Id., 62. Noting that a defendant may put forward inconsistent defenses, the court stated that \u201c[w]e do not think that allowing inconsistency necessarily sanctions perjury. . . . Inconsistent testimony by the defendant seriously impairs and potentially destroys his [or her] credibility. While we hold that a defendant may both deny [certain] acts . . . and at the same time claim [a defense inconsistent with his or her testimony], the high risks to him [or her] make it unlikely as a strategic matter that he [or she] will choose to do so.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Similarly, we hold that no rule of law prevents a jury from being charged, when requested, on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance simply because the defendant has testified that he or she was not upset.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is for the trier of fact to determine the weight to be accorded evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 234. Therefore, the question of whether a requested charge on extreme emotional disturbance was warranted in this case must be answered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>determining whether there was sufficient evidence to merit an instruction on the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, unknown to the common law, is authorized by \u00a7 53a-54a. Proof of this defense by a preponderance of the evidence;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12; entitles the defendant to a conviction of manslaughter in the first degree, instead of a conviction of murder. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55. \u201cSection 53a-54a describes the two elements of [the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance]: (1) the defendant committed the offense under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance; and (2) there was a reasonable explanation or excuse for the defendant\u2019s extreme emotional disturbance.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>216 Conn. 139, 148, 578 A.2d 1066 (1990). In an effort to \u201c[interpret] the meaning of the phrase extreme emotional disturbance . . . [this court has] enumerated understandable guidelines for instructing a jury in determining the presence or absence of that mental condition\u201d;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; but they are neither conclusive nor exclusive. \u201c[A]n extreme emotional disturbance is one where self-control and reason are overborne by intense feelings such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>agitation or other similar emotions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 9, 411 A.2d 3 (1979). \u201c[A] homicide influenced by an extreme emotional disturbance [however] is not one which is necessarily committed in the \u2018hot blood\u2019 state but rather can be one brought about by a significant mental trauma that caused the defendant to brood for a long period of time and then react violently, seemingly without provocation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 733-34. \u201cIn the final analysis, the ultimate determination of the presence or absence of extreme emotional disturbance is one of fact for the trier . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 122, 622 A.2d 519 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">If there is sufficient evidence of a legal defense, the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a requested jury charge on that defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 618-19, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 597, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>178 Conn. 704, 707-708, 425 A.2d 108 (1979). It is well established in Connecticut that a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on any general defense \u201cfor which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>supra, 597; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>supra, 278. This standard is appropriate when a defendant raises a general defense and the state has the burden of disproving that defense beyond a reasonable doubt. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (a).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The \u201cany evidence\u201d standard has been improperly applied, however, to affirmative defenses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 275, 576 A.2d 139 (1990) (license as affirmative defense to criminal trespass); see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>34 Conn. App. 317, 324, 641 A.2d 443 (1994) (affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In those cases, the fact that it is the defendant who shoulders the burden of proving an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence was not taken into consideration. To the extent that those cases have held that \u201cany evidence\u201d is sufficient for a defendant to be entitled to a requested instruction regarding an affirmative defense, they are overruled. Because the defendant bears the burden of proof of an affirmative defense; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we now hold that a defendant is entitled to a requested instruction on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance only if there is sufficient evidence for a rational juror to find that all the elements of the defense are established by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In the present case, despite the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding his state of mind, there was sufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>dence to require the trial court to instruct the jury on the requested defense of extreme emotional disturbance. \u201cThe state of mind of one accused of a crime is often the most significant and, at the same time, the most elusive element of the crime charged. This is especially true where a person has caused the death of another person.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>228 Conn. 147, 155, 635 A.2d 777 (1993). The evidence required to establish a defense based on extreme emotional disturbance often is circumstantial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 732; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 404, 429 A.2d 919 (1980) (\u201c[bjecause it is practically impossible to know what someone is thinking or intending at any given moment, absent an outright declaration of intent, a person\u2019s state of mind is usually proved by circumstantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The following evidence pertaining to the defendant\u2019s emotional disturbance was introduced at trial. In 1990, the defendant and Pouncey had an intimate relationship and planned to marry. During that year, the defendant and Pouncey shared an apartment in New Haven until the defendant relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, in June. In September, 1990, the defendant returned to Connecticut and resumed his cohabitation with Pouncey until February, 1991. In April, 1991, the defendant gave Pouncey an engagement ring, which she initially accepted, but soon thereafter returned. The defendant continued to contact Pouncey in the hope that their relationship could be salvaged. After her engagement to the defendant had terminated, Pouncey commenced a relationship with Moody. On April 16, 1991, Pouncey alleged that she was being harassed by the defendant and obtained a restraining order against the defendant. Despite the restraining order, the defendant continued to contact Pouncey.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">During the afternoon of May 19, 1991, the day of the murder, the defendant called a friend, Earl Carthens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>threatening that he \u201cwas going to get even with [Pouncey]\u201d and \u201cmake her pay for what she did to [him].\u201d Later that day, the defendant met with Pouncey in the hall outside her apartment and spoke with her for approximately twenty minutes. Upon leaving, the defendant spotted Moody approaching Pouncey\u2019s apartment building and rushed to a pay phone to inform Pouncey that \u201cher friend was on his way.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the defendant called again. This time Pouncey handed the receiver to Moody. In his conversation with Moody, the defendant sounded upset and threatened to kill both Moody and Pouncey.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> After the defendant\u2019s telephone call, Pouncey called the police to report the defendant\u2019s harassment and thereafter went out for the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">While Pouncey was away from her apartment, the defendant forcibly entered the apartment in order to retrieve his personal belongings. Pouncey returned home with her child while the defendant was in the rear bedroom gathering his possessions. A struggle ensued and, as a result, Pouncey was fatally stabbed. Arkady Katsnelson, an associate medical examiner, testified that in addition to being stabbed in her chest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>back and buttocks, Pouncey had several defensive wounds on her hands.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant then fled the apartment and went to Carthens\u2019 home. Carthens testified that the defendant had looked \u201ctired,\u201d \u201cdrained\u201d and \u201cexhausted.\u201d Accompanied by Carthens and the pastor of his church, the defendant went to the New Haven police station to surrender himself. Carthens further testified that the defendant had not spoken on the way to the station and had looked as if \u201che was out of it.\u201d Lieutenant David G. Burleigh, the police officer who had taken the defendant\u2019s oral and written statements, testified that the defendant \u201cwas very emotional. He was crying and repeating over and over, \u2018just lock me up, just lock me up.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">From this evidence, the jury could have reasonably concluded that \u201cthe defendant committed [Pouncey\u2019s murder] under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). Therefore, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to warrant an instruction, and that the trial court was required to charge the jury on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance as the defendant had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to that court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">In this opinion PETERS, C.

I agree with and join the majority opinion because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>it accurately states our current law and appropriately applies that law to the facts of this case. I write separately, however, to point out an anomaly that is embodied in our law, which is consistent with the criminal law generally, regarding the ability of a defendant to present inconsistent defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">I agree that our law has traditionally permitted the presentation of inconsistent defenses in a criminal case. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>189 Conn. 268, 273, 455 A.2d 342 (1983). This is consistent with the general rule throughout the states; see 22 C.J.S., Criminal Law \u00a7 54 (1989); and the federal system. See <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 63, 108 S. Ct. 883, 99 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1988). Thus, we have decided that, if the defendant seeks to have inconsistent theories of defense that the evidence supports presented to the jury, he is entitled thereto. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 273.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Although in <em>Harris </em>we implicitly decided the issue in this case, we have never explicitly discussed that issue, namely, whether the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on a theory of defense that his own testimony squarely contradicts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where there is other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>evidence in the case that does, nonetheless, support that theory of defense. Put another way, is a defendant entitled to a jury instruction on a theory of defense that would require the jury wholly to reject his testimony in order to acquit him on the theory of defense that he seeks to have presented to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Answering this question in the affirmative injects an element of anomaly into our criminal law. It would require the court, for example, to give a jury instruction on both alibi and self-defense as theories of defense, in an assault case in which the defendant had testified that he was in Chicago at the time of the crime, and yet witnesses testifying that he was involved in the physical altercation indicated that he was defending himself. Thus, in order for the jury to acquit the defendant on the self-defense theory, it would have to disbelieve his own testimony that he was in Chicago. One cannot deny that there is something irrational about such an application of the principle permitting the presentation of inconsistent defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Nonetheless, I agree that this is the way in which this case should be decided. I am unable to find any court that has departed from the traditional rule, simply because the defendant\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with one of his theories of defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The law appears to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>nearly universal in this respect. I do not see a sufficient reason for our law to be out of step with this generally accepted rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Significantly, as the majority aptly notes, the United States Supreme Court, as a matter of federal criminal law, has recently and specifically held that the traditional rule applies, even when the defendant\u2019s own testimony contradicts one of his theories of defense. See <em>Mathews v. United States, </em>supra, 485 U.S. 62 (defendant who testified that he had not committed crime entitled to jury instruction on inconsistent theory of entrapment into commission of crime). Moreover, the majority of the United States Supreme Court took this position notwithstanding a dissent specifically arguing that it invites perjury, turns a criminal trial into sport rather than a search for truth, and results in increased jury confusion. Id., 70-73. (White, J., dissenting). Thus, although this decision was based on federal criminal law, and not the constitution and, therefore, we are not bound by it in deciding what our law should be, it is nonetheless persuasive. Finally, I am persuaded also by the concurring comment in <em>Mathews </em>that, when a defendant takes truly inconsistent positions, it will be \u201cself-penalizing\u201d; id., 68 (Scalia, J., concurring); because it will invite prosecutorial argument pointing out the inconsistency, and will encourage jury skepticism about his entire defense.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 268-69, the defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree. He sought a lesser included offense instruction on the basis of his testimony. He testified that he had been merely a witness to, rather than a participant in, the armed robberies at issue, and that the weapon used by the actual robber was merely a toy. Id., 270-71. Thus, in order for the jury to consider his claimed inconsistent theories of defense \u2014 namely, an alibi defense, in that he was only a witness to the crimes, and an affirmative defense, in that the weapon was not one from which a shot could be discharged \u2014 and thereby convict him of the lesser included offense of robbery in the second degree, the jury would have been required to reject his testimony that he was only a witness to the crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\"> The record is clear that the defendant\u2019s testimony was squarely inconsistent with the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The record indicates that the defendant consistently testified not only that he had no intent to Mil the victim, but that he never even intended to stab her. The defendant testified that the penetration of the victim\u2019s body by two knives was wholly accidental, occurring in the course of what he described as a defensive struggle with her. In brief, he testified repeatedly that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the victim entered the room where he was retrieving his things, she had Mace in one hand and two knives, a large one and a small one, in the other hand. She immediately sprayed his face with Mace, rendering him almost sightless. He then struggled with her, trying to keep her from stabbing him with the knives. When she dropped the large knife, he grabbed her arms and twisted the remaining knife-wielding arm behind her back, and in the course of that struggle the knife unintentionally entered her back. According to his testimony, she then reached down and picked up the large knife, and a similar struggle ensued, in the course of which, again, that knife unintentionally entered her chest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b380-10\"> Some jurisdictions recognize at least two exceptions to the general rule allowing inconsistent defenses. Specifically, in homicide cases, some jurisdictions will not allow instruction on both accident and self-defense. See, e.g., <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>State, </em>512 So. 2d 134, 137 (Ala. Crim. App. 1987); <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>v. <em>Shelton, </em>140 Ill. App. 3d 886, 890, 489 N.E.2d 879 (1986); see also annot., 16 A.L.R.4th 983 (1982). Other jurisdictions have rejected the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Mathews </em>and continue to refuse a jury instruction on the entrapment defense when the defendant denies commission of the crime. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Soule, </em>168 Ariz. 134, 137, 811 P.2d 1071 (1991); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>136 Ill. 2d 496, 501-503, 557 N.E.2d 894 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b381-7\">NORCOTT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AM5\">concurring. I agree with part II of the majority opinion and concur in the result reached in part I of the majority opinion. With regard to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>issue, I am in agreement with the dissent of Justice Callahan that, to the extent that <em>State </em>v. Harris, 189 Conn. 268, 455 A.2d 342 (1983), must be read to require the trial court to give an instruction on an alternative inconsistent defense regardless of what the defendant has stated in relation to that defense in his testimony, essentially on the ground that the jury could find the defense established if it disbelieves the defendant\u2019s own testimony relevant to that defense, <em>Harris </em>goes too far. I find it hard to accept that the right to present a defense includes the right to present to the jury a defense that the defendant\u2019s own testimony directly and conclusively contradicts. I am convinced, however, that this is not such a case, both because the assessment of one\u2019s emotional state involves a combination of complex factors and judgments and, therefore, testimony regarding one\u2019s prior emotional state should be assessed more flexibly, and because, as the majority states, the defendant\u2019s testimony as to his emotional state when the attack on the victim occurred was somewhat equivocal. Further, I believe that in the present case, the evidence adduced in support of the affirmative defense sought, although hardly overwhelming, was sufficient, despite the defendant\u2019s testimony, to support a finding by a jury that the defense was established by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b382-6\">CALLAHAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_D\">dissenting. I cannot believe that the legislature in enacting General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, establishing extreme emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense, intended that a defendant would be entitled to a jury instruction on that defense when he explicitly disavowed the necessary state of mind. If, as the majority believes, there is case law that mandates a jury instruction under such circumstances, we should take the opportunity provided by this case to change it. Otherwise, the legislative mandate placing the burden of proof of extreme emotional disturbance upon the defendant is nullified. Certainly a defendant who testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>fies, as did this defendant, that he was only \u201csomewhat\u201d upset, \u201c[n]ot really\u201d upset and not bothered by the termination of his relationship with the victim has not begun to prove extreme emotional disturbance by a preponderance of the evidence. The \u201cterm \u2018extreme\u2019 refers to the greatest degree of intensity away from the norm for that individual.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 10, 411 A.2d 3 (1979). Moreover, I cannot see how other evidence could override the defendant\u2019s expression of his own subjective state of mind, which is the only issue germane to a defense of extreme emotional disturbance. This is not an insanity defense where a deranged defendant may himself deny being insane but produce expert testimony that would require the inclusion of an insanity instruction in the trial court\u2019s charge. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13. If an express disavowal of extreme emotional disturbance does not foreclose an instruction on extreme emotional disturbance, then such an instruction should be given at the end of virtually every murder trial because such crimes rarely take place in an emotional vacuum. I do not think, however, that universal application of the defense was intended by the legislature. In sum, I would conclude that when a defendant disavows the state of mind necessary to constitute extreme emotional disturbance, he is not entitled to an instruction as to that mitigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Moreover, although there was evidence adduced at trial of circumstances that possibly could have caused a theoretical defendant to be extremely emotionally disturbed and even evidence that this defendant was upset at various times, there was no testimony that at the time that he killed the victim the defendant was extremely emotionally disturbed. The only testimony elicited as to that time frame was, in fact, to the contrary. I believe that the majority confuses evidence of conditions that could have caused the defendant to be extremely emotionally disturbed with evidence that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>was, in fact, extremely emotionally disturbed when he killed the victim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only testimony as to the defendant\u2019s state of mind when he killed the victim was supplied by the defendant. His testimony was that at that time he was not extremely emotionally disturbed, that he was acting in self-defense and that while so acting he inadvertently killed the victim without any intention to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s emotional involvement with the victim and his perception that she was \u201cdoing him wrong\u201d does not equate with extreme emotional disturbance when the defendant himself disclaims such a reaction. I would conclude that because the evidence at trial would not have permitted a jury reasonably to find that the defendant had proven extreme emotional disturbance by a preponderance of the evidence, a jury instruction on that defense was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-10\"> By so doing, the majority essentially establishes a per se rule that anyone who lolls a former girlfriend or boyfriend is entitled to a jury instruction on extreme emotional disturbance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-11\"> The intent to cause death is itself a prerequisite to the defense of extreme emotional disturbance.
