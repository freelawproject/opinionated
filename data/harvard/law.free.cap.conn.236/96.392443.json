(ESPN), discriminated against him on the basis of his physical disability \u2014 a hearing impairment \u2014 in violation of Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 46a-60.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The commission\u2019s investigating officer found reasonable cause to believe that ESPN had discriminated against the plaintiff and certified the complaint for a public hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 and 46a-84. The hearing officer appointed by the commission found that ESPN was not hable for a discriminatory employment practice. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision. On appeal, the AppeUate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision and the hearing officer\u2019s analysis. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>35 Conn. App. 474, 646 A.2d 893 (1994). We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court, though on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The hearing officer found the following facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aware of the fact that the plaintiffs hearing was impaired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>and that he was required to wear a hearing aid, ESPN employed the plaintiff on January 3, 1980, as a remote operator-truck driver. The position required the plaintiff to operate a truck containing sophisticated broadcasting equipment to various broadcast locations and to assist in assembling the equipment for the telecast. Federal regulations required that the plaintiff meet minimum physical requirements, including a minimal level of hearing, before being allowed to drive. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41 et seq.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because ESPN accepted a medical certificate from Robert Marshall, the plaintiffs physician, dated October 31, 1979, stating that the plaintiff had the requisite level of hearing, the plaintiff was not required to undergo a medical examination when he was initially employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Within four months of the date of his employment, the plaintiff was involved in a series of incidents that raised concerns regarding his ability to perform safely the duties of his position. First, a few days after being employed, the plaintiff nearly caused an accident when he fell asleep at the wheel while returning from a sporting event in Rhode Island. Next, an ESPN vehicle was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>almost rendered inoperative when the plaintiff failed to notice that the safety valve to the compressor governor, which regulates the brakes, was venting pressurized air. On another occasion, while operating an ESPN vehicle, the plaintiff hit an overhang at a Connecticut gas station. Similarly, while backing up a truck at a location in Louisiana, the plaintiff failed to heed shouted warnings from his coworkers and struck the overhang of a building, thereby causing damage to the vehicle.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201c(e) Service of process pursuant to this section shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction of any such action upon the court to which the process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>is returnable. The court may proceed to determine the issues in the action and render final judgment but the court may, in its discretion, require further order of notice to the operator or owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>In addition, the plaintiff was involved in two separate unrelated incidents in which he improperly activated a television camera. The first incident caused minor damage to the equipment, while the second incident completely \u201csmoked\u201d the camera. After the second incident, Joseph Commare, ESPN\u2019s director of engineering, suspended the plaintiff for two weeks without pay, effective April 5, 1980. Commare then asked Rick McDowell, ESPN\u2019s safety manager, to evaluate the plaintiffs competence as a truck driver. McDowell concluded that the plaintiffs driving history demonstrated that he could not safely operate a truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">On April 21,1980, after he had been removed from the remote operator position, ESPN directed the plaintiff to undergo a medical examination by Bainbridge Hanley, a physician, to ascertain whether the plaintiff met the physical standards set forth in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41 et seq.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As part of the examination, the plaintiffs hearing was evaluated by means of a forced whisper test, which was administered by Hanley\u2019s wife. The plaintiff failed the forced whisper test, and, as a consequence, Hanley refused to certify that the plaintiff was qualified to be a truck driver.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Subsequently, on April 29, 1980, the plaintiff was transferred at his existing salary to the position of studio technician III. That same day, Barry Black, ESPN\u2019s director of human resources, sent an intraoffice memo to Commare stating that \u201cthis transfer is necessary due to the fact that [the plaintiffs] hearing impairment has prevented him from satisfactorily passing ... [a] physical examination required for him to continue in his present capacity of Mobile Unit Driver.\u201d The plaintiff, however, testified that he was simply told by Commare that he was being removed from his position as a truck driver because of his hearing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">With respect to the plaintiffs transfer from the position of remote operator-truck driver to that of studio technician, the hearing officer found that on \u201cApril 29, 1980, Mr. Commare advised [the plaintiff] that he was being transferred out of the remote area because of his hearing disability.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The hearing officer then concluded that the April 29, 1980 memo from Black to Commare, \u201cwithout more, showed that ESPN deliberately used [the plaintiffs] hearing impairment as the basis of its decision to transfer [the plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">After his transfer, the plaintiff periodically applied for other positions within ESPN, including a remote operator-truck driver position that was posted in November, 1982. ESPN offered various reasons why the plaintiff was never hired to fill any of those positions. Counsel for ESPN noted in correspondence with the commission\u2019s investigator that, with respect to \u201cthe remote operator positions [sought by the plaintiff in 1982], it was already ESPN\u2019s belief that because of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>hearing impairment, [the plaintiff] was disqualified for them under [department of transportation] regulations . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Ultimately, on June 4, 1983, the plaintiff resigned. On May 23, 1983, prior to his resignation, the plaintiff filed a complaint with the commission alleging that ESPN had violated his rights under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1). The plaintiff claimed that, because of his hearing impairment, ESPN had removed him from the remote operator-truck driver position, had deprived him of promotional and other employment opportunities, and had constructively discharged him from his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Connecticut statutorily prohibits discrimination in employment based upon race, color, religious creed, age, sex, marital status, national origin, ancestry, present or past history of mental disorder, mental retardation, and learning disability or physical disability. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1). Additionally, state law protects individuals from employment discrimination based upon their sexual orientation. See General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81c. Nevertheless, express discrimination is legally permissible if the employer proves that the factor in question is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary for the normal operation of the employer\u2019s particular business.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1); see <em>Automobile Workers </em>v. <em>Johnson Controls, Inc., </em>499 U.S. 187, 111 S. Ct. 1196, 113 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>2d 158 (1991) (whether gender is a BFOQ); <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>469 U.S. 111, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1985) (age is a BFOQ for airline captains). Clearly, a minimal level of hearing is a BFOQ for the position of remote operator-truck driver. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41 et seq. The hearing officer, however, made no finding as to whether the plaintiff met or did not meet that prerequisite.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Although this case is based solely on Connecticut law, we review federal precedent concerning employment discrimination for guidance in enforcing our own anti-discrimination statutes. See <em>Miko </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>220 Conn. 192, 202, 596 A.2d 396 (1991). Under federal law, there are four general theories of employment discrimination: disparate treatment,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> adverse or disparate impact, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> perpetuation into the present of the effects of past discrimination,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and failure to make a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>accommodation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> ABA Section of Labor and Employment Law, Employment Discrimination Law (2d Ed. 1983) p. 1. To date, in Connecticut, we have recognized the disparate treatment and adverse impact theories of employment discrimination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">This appeal requires consideration of only the \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d type of case. Used in this general sense, \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d simply refers to those cases where certain individuals are treated differently than others.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 335-36, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977). The principal inquiry of a disparate treatment case is whether the plaintiff was subjected to different treatment because of his or her protected status.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Under the analysis of the disparate treatment theory of liability, there are two general methods to allocate the burdens of proof: (1) the mixed-motive/Price <em>Waterhouse </em>model;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>228, 246, 109 S. Ct 1775, 104 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1989); and (2) the <em>pretext/McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>model. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 252-56, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Mixed-Motive/Price <em>Waterhouse </em>Model</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">A \u201cmixed-motive\u201d case exists when an employment decision is motivated by both legitimate and illegitimate reasons. See <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 228 (plurality opinion). In such instances, aplaintiff must demonstrate that the employer\u2019s decision was motivated by one or more prohibited statutory factors. Whether through direct evidence or circumstantial evidence,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a plaintiff must \u201csubmit enough evidence that, if believed, could reasonably allow a [fact finder] to conclude that the adverse employment consequences resulted \u2018because of an impermissible factor.\u201d <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>958 F.2d 1176, 1187 (2d Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u201cThe critical inquiry [in a mixed-motive case] is whether [a] discriminatory motive was a factor in the [employment] decision \u2018at the moment it was made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miko </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 205, quoting <em>Price Waterhouse </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 241. Under this model, the plaintiffs prima facie case requires that the plaintiff prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is within aprotected class and that an impermissible factor played a \u201cmotivating\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d role in the employment decision. <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 258; <em>Mt. Healthy City Board of Education </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977); <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>supra, 958 F.2d 1181 (\u201c[s]hould the plaintiff wish to prove his case as a \u2018mixed-motives\u2019 case, he must focus his proof directly at the question of discrimination and prove that an illegitimate factor had a \u2018motivating\u2019 or \u2018substantial\u2019 role in the employment decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Once the plaintiff has established his prima facie case, the burden of production and persuasion shifts to the defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken [the impermissible factor] into account.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 490 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>U.S. 258; <em>Mt. Healthy City Board of Educations. Doyle, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 274; see <em>In re McCort, </em>161 Vt. 481, 490-91, 650 A.2d 504 (1994) (adopting under its own antidiscrimination statute the burden shifting form of analysis for mixed-motive cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\"><em>Pretext/McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>Model</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Often, a plaintiff cannot prove directly the reasons that motivated an employment decision. Nevertheless, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination through inference by presenting \u201cfacts [that are] sufficient to remove the most likely bona fide reasons for an employment action . . . .\u201d <em>Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>supra, 958 F.2d 1180. From a showing that an employment decision was not made for legitimate reasons, a fact finder may infer that the decision was made for illegitimate reasons. It is in these instances that the <em>McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>model of analysis must be employed. ABA Section of Labor and Employment Law, Employment Discrimination Law, 1987-1989 Supplement (2d Ed. 1991) p. 2; see <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>supra, 450 U.S. 248; <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 411 U.S. 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The plaintiffs burden of establishing a prima facie case is not onerous under this model. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>supra, 450 U.S. 253. The plaintiff need prove only four elements by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that he or she belongs to a protected class; (2) that he or she applied and was qualified for the position in question; (3) that despite his or her qualifications, the individual was rejected; and (4) that after the individual was rejected, the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>remained open.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id., 252-53; <em>Miko </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 203. Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination, a presumption of discrimination is created.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>model, the burden of persuasion remains with the plaintiff. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>supra, 450 U.S. 253; <em>Miko </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 204. Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, however, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of discrimination by articulating (not proving) some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff s rejection. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>supra, 254; <em>Miko </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 204. Because the plaintiffs initial prima facie case does not require proof of discriminatory intent, the <em>McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>model does not shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant. Therefore, \u201c[t]he defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. . . . It is sufficient if the defendant\u2019s evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>supra, 254-55; see <em>Miko </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 204. Once the defendant offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff then has an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reason is pretextual. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>supra, 255-56; <em>Miko </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The <em>McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>analysis keeps the doors of the courts open for persons who are unable initially to establish a discriminatory motive. If a plaintiff, however, establishes a <em>Price Waterhouse </em>prima facie case, thereby proving that an impermissible reason motivated a defendant\u2019s employment decision, then the <em>McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>model does not apply, and the plaintiff should receive the benefit of the defendant bearing the burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Hearing Officer Applied Incorrect Analytical Model</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The facts found by the hearing officer indicate that, because of the plaintiffs driving history, ESPN may have had a legitimate reason for transferring the plaintiff from, and subsequently refusing to transfer him to, the position of remote operator-truck driver. Nevertheless, the hearing officer also specifically found that \u201c[o]n April 29, 1980, Mr. Commare advised [the plaintiff] that he was being transferred out of the remote area <em>because of </em>his hearing disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This latter finding, standing alone, is direct evidence of an impermissible motive for transferring the plaintiff.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Direct evidence of discriminatory intent \u201cmay include evidence of actions or remarks of the employer that reflect a discriminatory attitude ... or [c]omments [that] demonstrate a discriminatory animus in the decisional process. ...\u201d <em>Beshears </em>v. <em>Asbill, 930 </em>F.2d 1348, 1354 (8th Cir. 1991). Despite this evidence, the hearing officer did not shift the burden to ESPN under the mixed-motive analysis to prove that it would have made the same employment decision even if it did not take the plaintiffs physical disability into consideration. Rather, the hearing officer employed the <em>McDonnell Douglas</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>Burdine </em>analysis and found that ESPN had <em>articulated </em>a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, namely, the plaintiffs failure to drive safely.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The hearing officer specifically concluded that ESPN \u201cneed not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons.\u201d Additionally, the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that ESPN\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual. This analysis was incorrect. Because we conclude that the plaintiff had produced evidence that ESPN was motivated, at least in part, by his disability in deciding to transfer him, we hold that the hearing officer should have used the mixed-motive model of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">ESPN argues that regardless of the model used, the plaintiff could not have prevailed. In essence, ESPN claims that even if direct evidence was presented requiring it to have shouldered the burden of persuasion discussed previously, the hearing officer\u2019s failure to do so was harmless and as such the hearing officer\u2019s decision should be affirmed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Harmless error analysis is available in the administrative context. The Uniform Administrative Procedure Act provides that if an individual\u2019s substantial rights have been prejudiced, the case should be remanded unless but one conclusion is required by law. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) and (k); see also <em>Adriani </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>220 Conn. 307, 329 n.21, 596 A.2d 426 (1991), on appeal after remand, 228 Conn. 545, 636 A.2d 1360 (1994); <em>Denby </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>6 Conn. App. 47, 58-59, 502 A.2d 954 (1986); <em>Plastic Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>5 Conn. App. 219, 230, 497 A.2d 1005 (1985). We held in <em>Adriani </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 329 n.21, that if the evidence supports only one conclusion as a matter of law, then, despite the hearing officer\u2019s error, the result should be affirmed. In this case, if the hearing officer\u2019s error in applying the incorrect analytical model is to be held harmless, we must be able to state with legal certainty that the hearing officer, if she had applied the correct analysis, would have determined that, notwithstanding his physical disability, ESPN would have transferred the plaintiff from, and refused to reinstate him to, the position of remote operator-truck driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">ESPN argues that there are two possible, nondiscriminatoiy legitimate reasons it might have had for transferring the plaintiff: (1) his unsafe driving history, and (2) Hanley\u2019s refusal to certify the plaintiff\u2019s hearing. Because we find the former reason to be adequate to hold the hearing officer\u2019s error harmless, we need not reach the latter reason, which would preclude the need for any employment discrimination analysis.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The facts surrounding the plaintiffs driving history were fully considered by the hearing officer. Among the hearing officer\u2019s factual conclusions were that (1) \u201cMr. McDowell [of ESPN] investigated [the plaintiffs] driving history and concluded that [the plaintiff] could not safely operate a truck,\u201d (2) \u201cMr. McDowell\u2019s conclusion was not based on [the plaintiffs] hearing impairment and would have been the same for any driver with the same driving history,\u201d and (3) \u201c[b]ased on Mr. McDowell\u2019s investigation and recommendation and for public safety reasons, Mr. Commare removed [the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>tiff] from the remote operator position.\u201d These factual findings, which the hearing officer reached irrespective of any particular mode of legal analysis employed, necessarily require the conclusion that ESPN transferred and refused to reinstate the plaintiff as a remote operator on the basis of his unsafe driving history, which was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.

There is no substantive difference between the two terminologies. Specifically, in a mixed-motive case, the plaintiff has the burden of persuading the fact finder that the defendant\u2019s employment decision was motivated at least in part by an impermissible factor, while the defendant bears the burden of persuading the fact finder that the same decision would have been reached absent the impermissible factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\"> The 1991 amendment to the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 modified the holding of <em>Price Waterhouse. </em>Under the amendment, in mixed-motive cases, an unlawful employment practice is proven when the plaintiff demonstrates that an impermissible factor was a motivating factor for an employment decision, even though other factors also motivated the decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (m). An employer may limit the plaintiffs remedy to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and/or attorney\u2019s fees if it can demonstrate that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (g) (B). Thus, the 1991 amendment provides at least a limited remedy once the plaintiff proves that an impermissible factor played a motivating role in the employment decision. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, Steel Corp., </em>supra, 958 F.2d 1181. Our use of <em>Price Waterhouse </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>today remains unaffected by the 1991 amendment because our legislature has not revised the remedies available under the Connecticut statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> This standard is not rigid; the prima facie elements should be modified appropriately depending on the respective factual scenario. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>supra, 450 U.S. 253 n.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\"> The Appellate Court, incorrectly concluded that the plaintiff had failed to present any direct evidence of discrimination. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 35 Conn.
