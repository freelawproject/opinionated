After a jury trial, the defendant, Kendrick Wilkes, was convicted of three counts of sale of narcotics and one count of possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of conspiracy to violate the dependency producing drug law in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 21a-278 (b). The trial court rendered judgment on the jury verdict and the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed his conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>37 Conn. App. 456, 656 A.2d 1061 (1995). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, limited to the question of whether the defendant was harmed by the improper invocation of a witness\u2019 fifth amendment privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the relevant facts. \u201cOn the evening of February 6, 1992, Detectives Carl Bergquist and Ada Kuret were conducting a narcotics surveillance in the area of Seaview Avenue and Huron Street in Bridgeport. On three occasions, a different individual approached Jeffrey Braziel, who was standing in front of a house on Huron Street. Braziel escorted each individual to an area behind the house and exchanged vials of crack cocaine for cash. During these exchanges, the defendant was standing at the comer of Seaview Avenue and Huron Street. Conversations and hand gestures between the defendant and Braziel led the detectives to conclude that the defendant was directing people to where Braziel was positioned. At about 9:30 p.m., Braziel approached the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and handed him some cash. When police vehicles appeared on the scene, the defendant ran into a house. He later came out and fled down the street. The police apprehended the defendant and found $249 in his possession. Braziel, who was also arrested, was found to be carrying $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201cAt trial, Braziel testified against the defendant. He admitted that he had previously sold drugs for the defendant and that he had met him on February 6,1992, for that purpose. On that day, the defendant gave Braziel a package containing sixty vials of crack to be sold for $5 each. Upon selling all the vials, Braziel kept $50 and gave $250 to the defendant. Although no one approached the defendant directly, if a potential buyer did not know where to go, the defendant would signal Braziel.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u201cAt the time of his testimony, Braziel had pleaded guilty to five drug related charges and was awaiting sentencing. He previously had been convicted of several felonies and was willing to come forward and testify against the defendant when he found out that he could benefit from it. During the cross-examination of Braziel, the following colloquy occurred:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">\u201c \u2018[Defense Counsel:] For how many years have you been selling drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">\u201c \u2018A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">\u201c \u2018Q. Long time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">\u201c \u2018A. Well, around \u201988 or \u201989. Something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">\u201c \u2018Q. And when you were selling drugs back in \u201988 or \u201989, where were you selling them? Same location?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">\u201c \u2018A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u201c \u2018Attorney Palombo: I\u2019m going to object again on his behalf.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He hasn\u2019t been offered any type of immunity and I don\u2019t know if he has a \u2014 to take the privilege as far as any acts he may have committed which he may testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">\u201c \u2018Attorney Goldberg: I\u2019d be happy to talk to him. I would object to answering those, also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201c \u2018The Court: You are objecting, claiming the privilege?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201c \u2018Attorney Goldberg: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">\u201c \u2018The Court: Sustained.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">\u201cLater in the cross-examination, while the defense was questioning Braziel about the circumstances surrounding his initial contact with the defendant, the following transpired:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">\u201c \u2018Q. Had this person brought you to some other locations for the same purpose [to sell drugs]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-12\">\u201c \u2018Attorney Goldberg: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-13\">\u201c \u2018The Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-14\">\u201c \u2018Defense Counsel: May I have an exception, please, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-15\">\u201c\u2018The Court: The objections that come from Miss Goldberg are obviously a claim that he is exercising his fifth amendment right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-16\">\u201c \u2018Defense Counsel: Yes, Your Honor.\u2019 \u201d Id., 458-60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">The Appellate Court held that the trial court improperly had failed to conduct, outside the presence of the jury, a hearing to determine whether Braziel personally had intended to invoke his privilege against self-incrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>nation under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, if so, whether the claim of privilege was valid. Id., 461. The Appellate Court then determined that \u201c[t]he crucial evidence necessary to obtain the defendant\u2019s convictions was supplied by Braziel, who was the state\u2019s key witness.\u201d Id., 462. The Appellate Court further determined that the two questions to which the fifth amendment privilege had been invoked on Braziel\u2019s behalf were relevant to his reliability and credibility. Id., 462-63. The Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[b]ecause we cannot say that the improper invocation of Braziel\u2019s privilege in the presence of the jury did not undermine the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial, we must remand the case for a new trial.\u201d Id., 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">On appeal to this court, the state does not challenge the holding of the Appellate Court that the trial court improperly failed to conduct a hearing on the two occasions at which the fifth amendment privilege had been invoked on Braziel\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state claims, however, that the judgment of the trial court should nonetheless be affirmed because any violation attendant to the improper invocation of the privilege was nonconstitutional in nature and any error resulting from the nonconstitutional violation was harmless. The defendant argues, to the contrary, that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the error that flowed from the improper invocation of the privilege was not harmless, principally because the improper invocation violated his constitutional right to confrontation. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">To assess whether the improper invocation of the fifth amendment privilege on Braziel\u2019s behalf was harmless, we must first determine whether the violation attendant to the improper invocation was constitutional in nature. The defendant claims that the improper invocation of the privilege violated his right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because the invocation precluded him from pursuing a relevant area of inquiry regarding Braziel\u2019s reliability and credibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">It is axiomatic that a defendant is entitled to confront and to cross-examine fairly and fully the witnesses against him. U.S. Const., amends. VI and XIV; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 294-95, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>182 Conn. 511, 517, 438 A.2d 726 (1980). It is equally axiomatic that the right to confrontation is not absolute. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 295; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>235 Conn. 595, 604, 669 A.2d 562 (1995). \u201cThe primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 moti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>vation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. ... In order to comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the confrontation clause, the trial court must allow a defendant to expose to the jury facts from which the jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 331, 618 A.2d 32 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We are persuaded that the invocation of the fifth amendment privilege on Braziel\u2019s behalf, although improper, did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under the sixth amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The privilege was asserted in response to only two questions asked by defense counsel during a lengthy and comprehensive cross-examination. Neither invocation of the privilege infringed upon the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">We need address only briefly the first question in response to which the privilege was invoked, namely, whether Braziel had sold narcotics on Huron Street prior to his arrest on February 6,1992. Braziel answered this question. His answer was not stricken from the record, and the trial court never instructed the jury to disregard the answer. Accordingly, because Braziel\u2019s response to this question remained part of the record, the improper invocation of the privilege on this occasion did not deny the defendant his right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The invocation of the privilege in response to the second question, namely, whether the unnamed individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ual who drove Braziel to Huron Street previously had driven him to other locations to sell narcotics, stands on a somewhat different footing. Although Braziel did not answer the question, his failure to do so did not, in our view, deny the defendant his right to confrontation. The record persuasively demonstrates that the trial court granted the defendant wide latitude on cross-examination of Braziel, both with respect to his recollection of the events of February 6, 1992, and with respect to his credibility and motivation for testifying against the defendant. Notably, the defendant elicited that Braziel had regularly used cocaine, had ingested cocaine while he had sold cocaine on February 6, 1992, and had sold narcotics since 1988 or 1989.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, Braziel repeatedly admitted that he had decided to testify against the defendant in exchange for the opportunity to argue for a lesser sentence for charges to which he earlier had pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the defendant had a sufficient opportunity to impeach Braziel\u2019s reliability and credibility. See <em>State </em>v. Burak, 201 Conn. 517, 527, 518 A.2d 639 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>177 Conn. 370, 375, 418 A.2d 55 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Moreover, the invocation of the fifth amendment privilege on the second occasion did not, as the defendant contends, deny him the opportunity to pursue any particular line of inquiry with Braziel. A blanket privilege was not invoked on Braziel\u2019s behalf. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cecarelli, </em>32 Conn. App. 811, 817-21, 631 A.2d 862 (1993). Rather, the privilege was invoked effectively only once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>during the entire cross-examination of Braziel. The area of inquiry to which the single precluded question related, namely, Braziel\u2019s relationship with the unnamed individual who drove him to Huron Street, was adequately explored through other questions. Defense counsel asked numerous questions that elicited testimony from Braziel, both before and subsequent to the precluded question, regarding his relationship with the unnamed individual.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Neither the state nor Braziel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>counsel objected to these questions. Accordingly, the successful invocation of the privilege did not foreclose the defendant from an area of inquiry during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In light of this record, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights were not violated by the improper invocation, on two separate occasions, of the fifth amendment privilege on Braziel\u2019s behalf. The defendant was allowed sufficient cross-examination and impeachment of Braziel to satisfy his constitutional right to confrontation. In the absence of a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the improper invocation of the privilege constituted evidentiary rather than constitutional error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>220 Conn. 652, 661, 600 A.2d 1343 (1991); <em>State v. Person, </em>215 Conn. 653, 659-60, 577 A.2d 1036 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1048, 111 S. Ct. 756,112 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">As an evidentiary error, the improper invocation of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>on Braziel\u2019s behalf does not automatically require reversal of the judgment against the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 661; <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 660; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burak, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 527. \u201cWhen a trial error in a criminal case does not involve a constitutional violation the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate the harmfulness of the court\u2019s error. . . . The defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 47, 540 A.2d 42 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>supra, 661; <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 660. We are persuaded that the defendant has failed to meet his burden of establishing harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">First, the inference that the jury would most likely have drawn from the invocation of the fifth amendment privilege on Braziel\u2019s behalf, namely, that Braziel had engaged in additional illicit acts, would have adversely affected Braziel\u2019s credibility and inured to the defendant\u2019s benefit rather than to his detriment. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 662-63; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 683-84, 523 A.2d 451 (1987). Second, in light of the ample impeachment evidence against Braziel that was admitted during direct examination and cross-examination, Braziel\u2019s failure to answer the single question precluded by the invocation of the privilege impaired neither the defendant\u2019s ability to attack nor the jury\u2019s assessment of his credibility. Moreover, without condoning the prosecutor\u2019s inappropriate and unwarranted intervention on behalf of Braziel, we cannot conclude that his single invocation of Braziel\u2019s fifth amendment privilege constituted such a deliberate and flagrant attempt to capitalize on the privilege as to constitute harmful error. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>supra, 663-64 (prosecutor\u2019s conscious and repeated use of defense witness\u2019 invocation of fifth amendment privilege harmful because prosecutor\u2019s conduct enticed jury to draw improper and prejudicial inference against defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Finally, the preclusion of an answer to a single question, because of the improper invocation of the privilege on Braziel\u2019s behalf, cannot reasonably be regarded as having been central to the state\u2019s case. The state produced strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Braziel testified that both he and the defendant had been engaged in the sale of narcotics on Huron Street on February 6, 1992. Detectives Bergquist and Kuret, who had conducted surveillance at Huron Street on that date and had observed both the defendant and Braziel, corroborated Braziel\u2019s version of events and connected the defendant to the crimes with which he had been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In light of the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the improper invocation of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination on Braziel\u2019s behalf was harmless. The defendant has entirely failed to establish, as is his burden, that the improper invocation may have affected the verdict against him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 250, 645 A.2d 999 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 665. The Appellate Court, therefore, improperly ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 provides in relevant part: \u201cPenalty for illegal manufacture, distribution, sale, prescription or administration by non-drug-dependent person. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u201c(b) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.
