This case presents the question whether it was proper to enter default against him based upon his sporadic failures to comply with orders that required him to submit to evaluations and obtain services. We conclude that it was not. For the reasons that follow, we further find that the flaws in the procedures here resulted in a failure to provide M.G. with the \u201cfundamentally fair procedures\u201d required before his parental rights could be terminated. <em>See N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. T.J.B., </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>425, 433, 769 A.2d 1071 (App.Div.2001). We therefore reverse the termination order and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">A.R.G. is the daughter of M.G. and his wife, F.C.-G.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When A.R.G. was born on December 24, 2009, she tested positive for marijuana. On December 28, 2009, the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS or the Division) executed an emergency removal of A.R.G. pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.29 and 9:6-8.30. At that time, and at M.G.\u2019s request, DYFS agreed to evaluate his aunt, L.P., as a placement option.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">On December 30, 2009, DYFS filed a verified complaint alleging child abuse and neglect against both F.C.-G. and M.G. pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 to -8.73, and asking the court to grant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Division continuing care and custody of A.R.G.; to find that she was abused or neglected; and to grant other relief as provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:40-12 and <em>Rule </em>5:12-1 to -7.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">From the time the initial Title 9 complaint was filed until his parental rights were terminated, M.G. regularly attended the scheduled hearings and was represented at each by counsel. His history of compliance with court-ordered evaluations and services can, however, be fairly characterized as checkered, and is summarized here to provide context.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">M.G. was referred to a substance abuse evaluation on February 1, and completed that assessment on March 16,2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">On March 24, 2010, the court concluded that the Division had failed to prove abuse or neglect by M.G. or F.C.-G. Nonetheless, the court ordered that the matter proceed under Title 30 and scheduled a hearing for April 14, 2010. The court also ordered both parents \u201cto comply with the substance abuse evaluations and psychological evaluations as set by the Division.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Approximately one week later, on April 1, 2010, M.G. underwent a psychological evaluation by Alan S. Gordon, Ed.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">As of April 14, DYFS had not provided M.G. with either the report of his substance abuse evaluation or psychological evalua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>tion. Nonetheless, the court ordered him to submit to weekly urine testing at DYFS\u2019s request and also required him to receive substance abuse treatment, marital counseling and parenting skills training. M.G. was ordered to submit to a urine screen \u201cimmediately\u201d following the court hearing. Although DYFS contended M.G. did not appear for this screen, his attorney later reported that the results were negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Following the specific obligations imposed upon the defendants, a paragraph in the April 14 order included this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">Failure to appear at a court hearing, unless excused by the Court, or failure to comply with the provisions of this order <em>may result in entry of a default, termination of parental rights,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or such other relief and proceedings as the Court deems just.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">On May 4, 2010, the Division filed an amended verified complaint, seeking a finding of abuse or neglect. The order dated May 5, 2010<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> repeats the court\u2019s earlier determination that the Division had not sustained its burden of proof under Title 9 and that the matter should proceed under Title 30. The order entered default against M.G. \u201cfor non-compliance with the Court ordered drug screen and services as set by the Division.\u201d The court also ordered M.G. to produce proof of the following: his attendance at a substance abuse program and mental health counseling; his official class schedule; financial support for the child; home utility bills in his name; lease or mortgage in his name; and documentation of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">On May 13, 2010, M.G. completed an initial intake at the Family Growth Program of Catholic Charities (Family Growth Program) for anger management and domestic violence counseling. He participated in three additional counseling sessions thereafter, the last of which was cut short by the counselor when M.G. stated he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>was only attending counseling to regain custody of his daughter and had no other issues to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Dr. Gordon\u2019s report of his psychological evaluation of M.G., dated April 23, 2010, made suggestions regarding services M.G. should receive but did not state further psychological evaluation was required. Nonetheless, an order dated May 17, 2010 directed M.G. to participate in a psychological evaluation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the order required M.G. to submit to a substance abuse evaluation and weekly urine screenings, and also to attend counseling. On May 18, services provided to M.G. by the Preferred Children\u2019s Services Child Protection Substance Abuse Initiative were terminated as a result of his non-compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">On May 25, 2010, the parties were again ordered to provide a copy of their lease at the next hearing scheduled for June 1. As reflected in the May 25 order, M.G. provided evidence of job searches and school grades. M.G. was also ordered to engage in a substance abuse treatment program and to provide proof of ten job searches. He failed to enroll in a substance abuse program by the June 1 hearing, and was ordered to do so again. The court also found his proof of job searches on June 1 to be deficient and ordered that he provide proof of thirty job searches by the hearing date one week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">On June 8, 2010, M.G. still had not engaged in a substance abuse program as ordered but he did produce proof of seventy job searches for the court. The order of that date reflects the court\u2019s consideration of a lease document, job searches and M.G.\u2019s school schedule. The court again ordered that he participate in a substance abuse program and directed the Division to submit another referral for such treatment. On July 2, 2010, M.G. completed his court-ordered substance abuse intake and also submitted to a drug screen, which was negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>On July 4, 2010, M.G. was arrested on a charge of simple assault and contempt of a domestic violence restraining order. He remained incarcerated until November 5, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Although in custody, M.G. appeared at the next hearing on July 27, 2010. Without any consideration as to what services were available to M.G. while incarcerated, the court ordered him to submit to another psychological evaluation, a substance abuse reevaluation, weekly urine screenings and parenting skills training. M.G. was also ordered \u201cto contact the Division for services upon his release from jail.\u201d The matter was scheduled for a compliance review on October 26, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Defendant was still incarcerated at the October 26 review hearing. Yet, he appeared and the court again ordered weekly urine screening, counseling and parenting skills training, and that he contact the Division for services upon his release. The order stated, \u201cDefault is entered against [M.G.] for non-compliance with services.\u201d At the hearing, the court provided its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMA\">[A]t this point, Mr. [G. is] not following through on the services that were ordered for him because he\u2019s incarcerated. I find that that was a voluntary act on his part and that he\u2019s in default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The court advised the parties they could file a formal motion to vacate the defaults, but stated that such motion had to be supported by a showing of a meritorious defense. The court stated further that the next hearing would be a permanency hearing and requested the Division to file an order to show cause or complaint if it intended to propose a termination of parental rights so that the permanency hearing scheduled for December 21, 2010, could serve as a return date.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The Division filed a guardianship complaint on December 10, 2010, seeking the termination of parental rights of both F.C.-G. and M.G., and asked the court to approve a plan of termination followed by adoption at the permanency hearing. M.G. was served with the guardianship complaint at the December 21 hearing and instructed to complete a new form to apply for the services of the Public Defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Without taking any testimony or evidence, the court announced at the December 21 hearing that the Division\u2019s plan was \u201creasonablet,]\u201d that the case appeared \u201cto be worse off\u2019 than when it started; that reunification of the child with the parents \u201cis not possible[;]\u201d and that the Division made \u201ca great effort \u2014 to try to reunify [A.R.G.] with her parents[.]\u201d The court also stated it was \u201cwell settled in the law\u201d that the default entered against M.G. in the abuse and neglect proceeding continued into the guardianship proceeding. The court advised the parties again that they could move to vacate the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The net effect of this ruling was that at the very inception of the guardianship complaint \u2014 before he had an opportunity to plead, defend or comply with any court orders issued in that proceeding, M.G. was stripped of his right to present evidence, including any expert evaluations, in opposition to the Division\u2019s proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The court scheduled a case management conference for January 25, 2011, and a proof hearing for February 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">At the ease management conference, the deputy attorney general advised that DYFS had scheduled psychological and bonding evaluations for M.G. on February 9, 2011, and a substance abuse evaluation for him on February 10, 2011, as well as evaluations for F.C.-G. and the foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The parties disagreed as to whether M.G. had to complete an anger management program at Family Growth Program before he could participate in individual and group counseling at that program. M.G.\u2019s attorney objected to this requirement because M.G. had completed an anger management program while incarcerated and presented a certificate of completion to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">M.G. testified that the program he participated in entailed approximately one to one-and-one-half hours once or twice a week and taught him \u201chow to control [himself], [his] anger, and walk away from situations. Be a better person.\u201d The deputy attorney general could provide no objective criteria for why the completion of the program in jail was insufficient to comply with any prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>court order. Instead, she relied upon the Family Growth Program representative\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cthey decline to accept any certificate from a county jail\u201d and asked \u201cthat their anger management program be completed by [M.G.] as a prerequisite to his entering their individual and group therapy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the deputy attorney general was asked by the court, \u201cWhat\u2019s Family Growth Program about,\u201d she answered that she had no information available. Despite the lack of any evidence to compare the two programs, the court found the Division\u2019s request \u201creasonablet,]\u201d and ordered M.G. to \u201cabide by the referral to Family Growth for anger management, and then the follow-up individual and group therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The court also noted deficiencies in M.G.\u2019s compliance, i.e., that the letter confirming his employment was not \u201cverifiable\u201d and should have been produced within thirty days of the prior hearing and that he had not provided an address for where he was living. The court made a general reference to the fact that M.G. \u201cwas found to be a parent in need of services and he hasn\u2019t complied with those services.\u201d The court then stated, \u201cFor all of those reasons, I find that Mr. [G.], if he wasn\u2019t in default already, he\u2019d be in default today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">At the March 4, 2011 case management conference, the deputy attorney general reported that M.G. participated in the psychological and bonding evaluations as scheduled. He also attended the substance abuse evaluation interview and agreed to undergo a urine screen but failed to appear for that.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">After two adjournments caused by the Division\u2019s failures to file its affidavit of proof as required by the court, the proof hearing was conducted on April 1, 2011. The Division stated its intention to produce one witness and rely upon its affidavit of proof and attachments, which included the expert reports regarding the psychological and bonding evaluations. At the outset, M.G.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>attorney objected to the proof hearing proceeding forward, noting the lack of an opportunity \u201cto cross[-]examine the witnesses that are presenting in the form of reports, the psychological and bonding and foster bonding evaluations.\u201d Citing the time requirements for the filing of a guardianship application and final hearing set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15(d) and 30:4C-15.2, the court overruled the objection and stated the case was \u201cappropriate to proceed today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The only witness called by the Division was Erin Kelly, a Family Service Specialist II employed by DYFS. She provided the following testimony as a prelude to her testimony regarding the contents of the DYFS file:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">Q. ... Are you the keeper of the file in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">Q. And as the keeper of the file have you familiarized yourself with the entire record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">Q. And is Dr. Gordon a consultant to the Division of Youth and Family Services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">Q. And are these service providers listed within the affidavit of proof service providers used by the Division of Youth and Family Services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-15\">Q. And does the Division of Youth and Family Services also consult with those service providers in order to determine what services are best for a family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-17\">Q. And did the service providers set forth in the affidavit of proof do that in this case as to [F.C.-G.l and [M.G.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-19\">Q. And did they do so in regard to [A.R.G.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-20\">A. Not the service providers, but Dr. Gordon, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-21\">The reports of Dr. Gordon and Jamie Gordon-Karp, Psy.D., regarding their psychological evaluations and Dr. Gordon-Karp\u2019s bonding evaluation were included in the attachments to the affidavit of proof that was received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Kelly testified that A.R.G. does not have any special needs, that she is \u201ca very healthy little girl and she\u2019s developmentally on target.\u201d She is placed with two foster parents who desire to adopt her. Kelly also testified that the Division consulted with Dr. Gordon-Karp, who recommended that A.R.G. be adopted by her foster parents. Although M.G. presented the name of his sister, K.N.G., to DYFS for possible placement of A.R.G. at least as early as the date he was served with the guardianship complaint, Kelly admitted that the Division had not performed any evaluation of her prior to ruling her out. She testified that, because the child had been in foster placement for one year, she and her supervisor decided it would be against her best interests to delay the proceeding any further.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The balance of the Division\u2019s proofs were the affidavit of proof and attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Counsel for M.G. was permitted to cross-examine Kelly. At the close of the hearing, he renewed his objection to the admission of the evaluations from Dr. Gordon-Karp and Dr. Gordon into evidence without him having the opportunity to cross-examine them. The court overruled the objections, issued a written statement of reasons for its decision that the Division had provided clear and convincing evidence to satisfy the four prongs of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1, and entered an order terminating M.G.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In its decision, the court did not provide any legal analysis for the entry of default against the parties. The court stated that the parties were in default \u201cfor sustained failure to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>services.\u201d The only failure of M.G. identified, however, was that he continued to be homeless as of each of the hearing dates on January 25, March 4 and March 25, 2011. The court stated as to each of these dates, \u201cIf the parents had not been in default at that time, the court would have held them in default on that date.\u201d Although the Division had repeatedly failed to file its affidavit of proof as required, no sanctions were imposed for its failure to comply with court orders. Instead, the court viewed these delays as giving the parties opportunities to show their compliance with orders and \u201cfile motions to vacate the default where they would be entitled to provide evidence of a meritorious defense!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In his appeal from the order terminating his parental rights, M. G. argues that the \u201csummary proceedings\u201d violated his constitutional rights and that the elements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1 were not proven by clear and convincing evidence. Because we agree that the procedure here was fatally flawed, requiring a new trial, we do not address the ultimate merits of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">As a preliminary matter, we note that M.G. did not object to the court\u2019s declaration of default in the Title 9 proceeding or to the court\u2019s declaration that this default would apply in the Title 30 proceeding. Further, he never filed a motion to vacate default.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u201cThe jurisdiction of appellate courts rightly is bounded by the proofs and objections critically explored on the record before the trial court by the parties themselves.\u201d <em>State v. Robinson, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>1, 19, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009). Because our consideration of the issues raised on appeal requires review of matters not objected to at trial, our review is governed by <em>Rule </em>2:10-2, which states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-11\">Any error or omission shall be disregarded by the appellate court unless it is of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result, but the appellate court may, in the interests of justice, notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial or appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">A parent\u2019s right to enjoy a relationship with his or her child is constitutionally protected. <em>In re Adoption of Children by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>L.A.S., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>127, 132, 631 A.2d 928 (1993); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>645, 651 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1208, 1212, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 558 (1972). Therefore, the State \u201cmust provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures\u201d before a parent\u2019s rights are terminated. <em>T.J.B., supra, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 433, 769 A.2d 1071 (quoting <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. </em>A.W., 103 <em>N.J. </em>591, 612, 512 A.2d 438 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The procedural deficiencies here denied M.G. the right to present a defense or to effectively test the proofs against him through cross-examination of the experts whose opinions were essential components of the State\u2019s evidence. The interests of justice therefore compel our review of the issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We first consider the trial court\u2019s entry of default against M.G. The trial court relied upon M.G.\u2019s failure to comply with a court order and cited our decision in <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. P.W.R., </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 983 A.2d 598 (App.Div.2009), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>17, 11 A.3d 844 (2011), as authority for the proposition that default was properly entered. However, neither <em>Rule </em>4:43-1, which governs the entry of default,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> nor our decision provide authority for the entry of default here.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\"><em>Rule </em>4:43-1 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">If a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought <em>has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rales or court order, </em>or if the answer has been stricken with prejudice, the clerk shall enter a default on the docket as to such party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">The basis for the entry of default under this rule is the litigant\u2019s failure to participate in the litigation-by failing \u201cto plead or otherwise defend[.]\u201d Failures to file responsive pleadings or to appear when required to litigate the matter are straightforward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>examples of when default is properly entered. The more difficult issue is whether the failure to comply with a court order may warrant the entry of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The plain meaning of the rule\u2019s language does not authorize the entry of default merely upon a failure to comply with <em>any </em>court order. A nexus between the violation of rules and orders and an underlying failure to comply with the responsibilities of a litigant is central to the entry of a default based upon the failure to comply with an order. This is reflected in the threshold showing required to support a motion to vacate default judgment, that \u201cthe failure to answer or otherwise appear and defend was excusable under the circumstances[.]\u201d Pressler and Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 4.1 on <em>R. </em>4:50-1 (2012). Thus, the rule\u2019s reference to a failure to \u201cdefend as provided by these rules or court order\u201d is fairly read to authorize default only when the rule or order in question concerns the party\u2019s obligation to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Our decision in <em>P.W.R. </em>does not support a contrary view. In that case, we reviewed the entry of a default against a defendant who did not attend the factfinding hearing in an abuse and neglect ease under Title 9. <em>P.W.R., supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503, 983 A.2d 598. However, her attorney was present and represented her in the hearing. <em>Ibid. </em>We observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">Because a party represented by counsel may defend at trial without being physically present, default may not be entered when a party is not present at a trial absent evidence that the party has not otherwise defended as required by rule or court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 506, 983 A.2d 598.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">In considering whether default could be permitted based upon a failure to comply with an order, we explained that an entry of default could be permitted when a party fails \u201cto adequately fulfill conditions imposed by a court order <em>in discovery or in preparation for trial[.J\u2019 Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). Therefore, we did not stray from the principle that a default based upon a litigant\u2019s failure to comply with an order must be rooted in a \u201cfailure to defend.\u201d We concluded that, because the order in question did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>not mandate defendant\u2019s presence at the factfinding hearing and her attorney was there to defend her, the entry of default was improper.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The conditions in orders that M.G. allegedly failed to adequately fulfill were not \u201cimposed by a court order in discovery or in preparation for trial\u201d but rather, were conditions imposed for the purpose of providing services in the best interests of A.R.G. In the end, the sole act of non-compliance the court cited as justification for the entry of default was M.G.\u2019s continued homelessness. This fact may have relevance to the determination whether his parental rights should be terminated in the guardianship action. But he was represented by counsel throughout and, as noted, his homelessness did not stop him from regularly attending scheduled hearings. In short, his homelessness did not result in a failure to defend. Therefore, neither <em>Rule </em>4:43-1 nor <em>P.W.R. </em>support the conclusion that M.G.\u2019s failure to comply with the conditions of the orders cited provided a basis for entering default and depriving him of the right to a trial on whether his fundamental right to parent should be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We conclude our consideration of this issue by noting that trial courts have the means available under other rules to respond to a litigant\u2019s willfully contumacious failure to comply with an order, <em>Rules </em>1:1-1 and -2, and to impose sanctions for the failure to comply with an order for discovery, <em>Rule </em>4:23-2. Although courts have discretion \u201cto craft orders appropriate to the facts before them[,]\u201d the sanctions imposed for such non-compliance must be \u201cjust and reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Il Grande v.

See <em>State v. Matulewicz, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>27, 30, 499 A.2d 1363 (1985); <em>Konop v. Rosen, </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 403, 41 A.3d 773 (App.Div.2012). The trial court failed to make such specific findings here and, we are satisfied, could not have done so on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The experts here were consultants retained by the Division to perform evaluations to be used to support its case that M.G.\u2019s parental rights should be terminated. Thus, litigation was not merely contemplated, it was already initiated and the reports were prepared in aid of that litigation. The subject matter of the reports-psychological evaluations and a bonding evaluation-entailed the exercise of subjective judgment rather than a straightforward, simple diagnosis based upon objective criteria or one upon which reasonable professionals could not differ. <em>See In re Guardianship of K.H.O., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>337, 346-47, 736 A.2d 1246 (1999) (recognizing \u201cthe complexity and subjectivity involved in evaluating parental fitness\u201d); <em>State v. Martorelli </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 454, 346 A.2d 618 (App.Div.1975) (citing <em>McCormick, Evidence </em>(2 ed.1972), \u00a7 313 at 732), <em>certif. denied, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>445, 354 A.2d 642 (1976); <em>compare Liptak v. Rite Aid, Inc., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 221-22, 673 A.2d 309 (App.Div.1996) (holding that \u201c[t]he diagnosis of alcoholism, a complex medical condition,\u201d in a medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>record was inadmissible), <em>with Blanks v. Murphy, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 164, 632 A.2d 1264 (App.Div.1993) (finding hearsay evidence in a medical report was admissible because it constituted a \u201cstraightforward observation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">These circumstances militated against a finding that the expert opinion contained in the expert report was sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted without the expert appearing and being subject to cross-examination. It was, therefore, an abuse of discretion to admit the reports into evidence over defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In summary, it was plain error to enter default against M.G. based upon a failure to comply with the orders identified by the court when he had not failed to defend in either the Title 9 or Title 30 proceeding. Although we do not excuse defendant for failing to file a motion to vacate default, the trial court\u2019s repeated statement that the default could only be vacated if defendant showed he had a meritorious defense compounded this error by requiring defendant \u2014 who had never failed to defend \u2014 to prove he had a meritorious defense before he would be permitted to present a defense at a trial. Finally, it was an abuse of discretion to permit the Division to rely upon the written reports of psychological and bonding experts without producing them for cross-examination over the objection of defendant. These flaws combined to deprive M.G. of the fundamentally fair procedures to which he was entitled before an order terminating his parental rights could be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Reversed and remanded.
