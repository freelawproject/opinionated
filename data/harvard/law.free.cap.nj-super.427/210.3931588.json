Appellant, a developmentally disabled adult who resides at the Hunterdon Developmental Center, contends that this regulation is inconsistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3, which authorizes a developmentally disabled resident of a state institution to consent to the release of a confidential document that mentions the resident. We reject this challenge and uphold the validity of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-3.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The appeal was precipitated by an incident that occurred at an annual Christmas party held on December 1, 2007 at the cottage in the Hunterdon Developmental Center where appellant resides. When appellant\u2019s parents and guardians, Daniel and Rosamund Caliendo, arrived at the cottage, they observed appellant unattended, facing the wall, with his wheelchair tilted up in a position that prevented him from using his feet to move it, crying for someone to help him. The Caliendos immediately released the wheelchair from this position. They then asked the staff in attendance why their son had been placed in such a helpless position, but did not receive a satisfactory response.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Subsequently, the Caliendos submitted a written inquiry to Hunterdon Developmental Center concerning the incident involving their son. A member of the Hunterdon staff with the title \u201cQuality Assurance Specialist\u201d conducted an investigation of the incident, which included interviews of the members of the staff on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>duty in the cottage when it occurred. The results of the Quality Assurance Specialist\u2019s investigation were set forth in a fifteen-page report, dated December 11, 2007, which contained findings of fact, a series of conclusions regarding the incident, and recommendations for remedial actions to prevent a similar occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">After receiving this report, the Chief Executive Officer at Hunterdon sent the Caliendos a letter, dated December 13, 2007, which summarized the results of its investigation. The letter stated that whatever member of the staff put their son\u2019s wheelchair in a tilted-back position \u201cdid so out of the disregard for the client\u2019s right to unrestricted mobility!,]\u201d but that the investigation did not reveal the identity of that person. The letter also stated that \u201c[additional training will be conducted to assure that [appellant\u2019s] rights ... are protected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Caliendos advised officials of the Department of Human Services that they were not satisfied with this response and claimed that they were entitled, as appellant\u2019s guardians, to see the entire December 11, 2007 investigation report. However, the Department refused to release the report to the Caliendos on the ground that it was confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Appellant subsequently filed a multi-count complaint in the Law Division against the Commissioner of the Department of Human Services, the Chief Executive Officer at Hunterdon and various other officials. One count of the complaint challenged the validity of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-3.2(b). Every other count has now been resolved by a settlement agreement and dismissal based on that agreement. The Law Division transferred the count challenging <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-3.2(b) to this court in accordance with <em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">During the course of the proceedings before the Law Division, the trial court ordered the disclosure to the Caliendos of a redacted version of the December 11, 2007 investigation report. In addition, the Division provided an unredacted version of the report to Disability Rights New Jersey, the agency appointed to represent the interests of developmentally disabled persons in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>accordance with 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 15043, which also represents appellant in this appeal, but that agency was prohibited from disclosing the unredaeted copy to appellant and his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The regulation at issue in this appeal provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">The following Division and provider records are not public and can only be released upon judicial order. These Division and provider records include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">1. Investigations of unusual incidents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">2. Initial Unusual Incident Reports and Unusual Incident Follow up Reports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">3. Any and all documents and materials related to a pending investigation of an unusual incident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">5. Intra- and inter-agency communications and procedures that are considered by the Division to be Advisory, Consultative and Deliberative</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">Material; Risk Management documents; and self-critical analyses____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:41\u20143.2(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">Appellant argues that this regulation is inconsistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3(a), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-14\">All certificates, applications, records, and reports made pursuant to the provisions of Title 30 ... and directly or indirectly identifying any individual presently or formerly receiving services in a non-correctional institution under Title 30 ... shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed by any person, except insofar as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-15\">a. the individual identified or his legal guardian, if any, or, if he is a minor, his parent or legal guardian, shall consent----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">Appellant argues that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3(a) gives him, as \u201ca[n] individual ... receiving services in a non-correctional institution,\u201d an unfettered right of access to any \u201creport\u201d of the Division \u201cdirectly or indirectly identifying\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">However, it is plain on the face of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3 that it does not give patients in state institutions any right of access to government reports. Rather, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3 protects the privacy rights of patients by providing that any report identifying them \u201cshall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed\u201d unless the patient or his legal guardian \u201cshall consent.\u201d This right to prevent disclosure to a third party of a government report identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>tying the patient does not confer any right upon the patient to obtain access to that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The Legislature has addressed the subject of access to government records, whether by the public at large or individuals having a more specific interest in the records, by enactment of other statutory provisions, including in particular the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 to -13. OPRA states that \u201cgovernment records shall be readily accessible for inspection,\u201d but also recognizes the need to prevent access to certain governmental records \u201cfor the protection of the public interest[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1. OPRA expressly exempts \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency advisory, consultative, or deliberative material\u201d from the definition of \u201cgovernment record.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">This exemption from disclosure under OPRA is commonly referred to as the \u201cdeliberative process privilege.\u201d <em>Educ. Law Ctr. v. N.J. Dept. of Educ., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>274, 284, 966 A.2d 1054 (2009). Under this exemption, \u201ca record, which contains or involves factual components, is subject to the deliberative process privilege when it was used in the decision-making process and its disclosure would reveal the nature of the deliberations that occurred during that process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299, 966 A.2d 1054. Thus, to determine whether the exemption applies, \u201c[a] court must assess such fact-based documents against the backdrop of an agency\u2019s deliberative efforts in order to determine a document\u2019s nexus to that process, and its capacity to expose the agency\u2019s deliberative thought-processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299-300, 966 A.2d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">It is also noteworthy that in <em>McClain v. College Hospital, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>346, 359, 492 A.2d 991 (1985), which involved in part the interpretation of the Right-to-Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 to -4 (repealed by <em>L. </em>2001, c. 404), which was the predecessor to OPRA, the Court expressly recognized the high degree of confidentiality that must be given to the results of internal investigations into health care services such as the investigation the Division conducted regarding the incident involving appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">... [Disclosure of the materials involved in an internal investigation into healthcare service invokes serious and important questions of public policy deserving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>careful consideration by the courts. An applicant seeking the opinions, conclusions, sources of information and investigative techniques of the agency should demonstrate a need more compelling than the agency\u2019s recognized interest in confidentiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In addition to the right of access to government records provided by OPRA, there also continues to be a common law right of access to government records, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-8, under which a person with a specific private interest in a government record may have a right of access in a wider range of circumstances than under OPRA <em>See Education Law Center, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 302-03, 966 A.2d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellant may well have had a right of access to some portion of the investigatory report regarding the December 1, 2007 incident under either OPRA or the common law right of access. Indeed, the Law Division judge to whom the case was assigned ultimately ordered the disclosure to the Caliendos of a redacted version of the report, which order could have been based upon OPRA or the common law right of access.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3 does not give appellant an unfettered right of access to the report that circumvents the restrictions upon access to government records imposed under OPRA and the common law right of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Appellant relies upon <em>Bonnie S. v. Altman, </em>683 <em>F.Supp. </em>100 (D.N.J.1988), in support of his argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3(b) <em>gives </em>residents of state institutions a right of access to records that identify them. The primary issue considered in that opinion was whether persons committed to a mental institution must obtain the consent of their appointed guardians to challenge their commitments. <em>See id. </em>at 101-02. The court held that such consent was not required. <em>Id. </em>at 102. The court also considered whether parts of the committees\u2019 medical records they sought to obtain in order to support their challenges to their commitments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>could be withheld from disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03. The court held that the committees were entitled to such disclosure under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3(b) upon a showing that they had the capacity to give knowing and informed consent to production of their medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>Bonnie S. </em>involved only committees\u2019 rights of access to their own medical records and not, as in this case, an agency investigatory report in which their names are mentioned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any event, insofar as the court in <em>Bonnie S. </em>construed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3(b) to establish a right of access to the documents listed in that section, as distinguished from a right to prevent their disclosure to third parties, we conclude, for the reasons previously discussed, that this construction was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In support of his challenge to the validity of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-3.2(b), appellant also relies upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-57(f), which requires guardians such as the Caliendos to \u201cestablish the ward\u2019s places of abode[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12\u201457(f)(1), \u201cprovide for the [ward\u2019s] care, comfort and maintenance,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-57(f)(3), and take various other actions in the ward\u2019s best interests. However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-57(f) does not deal with the subject of access to government records. We recognize that the important responsibilities N.J.<em>S.A. </em>3B:12-57(i) confers upon a guardian are one factor a court may consider in determining whether a document should be shielded from disclosure under OPRA based on the deliberative process privilege, <em>see Educ. Law Ctr., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 287, 966 <em>A</em>.2d 1054 (noting that \u201c[b]eeause the [deliberative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>process] privilege is a qualified one, a litigant can still obtain the requested materials upon a showing that the need for the materials overrides the government\u2019s interest in confidentiality\u201d) or the common law right of access, <em>see id. </em>at 303, 966 A.2d 1054 (noting that under the common law right, \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s interest in disclosure of the relevant documents must outweigh the State\u2019s interest in non-disclosure\u201d). Nevertheless, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-57(f) provides no support for appellant\u2019s argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3 confers an unfettered right upon a resident of a state institution to obtain access to any document that mentions the resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s challenge to the validity of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-3.2(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"> The trial court did not issue any opinion indicating the rationale for this order. The court also may have ordered the disclosure of the redacted report as part of ordinary discovery relevant to appellant\u2019s other claims in his Law Division action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> We note that the regulations under which the Division operates distinguish between \"client records\u201d and \"Division records.\u201d \"Client records\" are defined as the \"organized compilation of documents ... that relate to the provision of services to an individual.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-1.3. \"Division records\u201d are defined as the \u201corganized compilation of documents ... that relate to the operation of a Division component.\" <em>Ibid. </em>These regulations give guardians an unfettered right of access to \"client records,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-5.1(a), which was the type of record involved in <em>Bonnie S. </em>However, under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-3.2(b), a guardian must obtain a court order to be entitled to access to a \"Division record\u201d such as the investigatory report of the incident involving appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-13\"> Although we reject appellant's argument that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41\u20143.2(b) is inconsistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24.3, we note that a request under OPRA for production of a document that falls under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41\u20143.2(b) would be subject to the procedures set forth in OPRA, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5 to -7, which may be more expeditious than the procedures set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:41-3.2(b). We encourage the Department to review its procedures regarding the kind of request for document production that resulted in the filing of this action to facilitate access by deveiopmentally disabled residents of state institutions and their guardians to documents, or the parts of documents, to which there is no legitimate objection to disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
