A judgment of conviction entered on May 23, 2011, recited that registrant, pursuant to a plea agreement, had pled guilty to a third-degree violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, another section of the child endangerment statute; and that he was sentenced to 364 days in the Bergen County jail with no probation but subject to \u201cMegan\u2019s Law and PSL [parole supervision for life].\u201d The judgment noted that an \u201cAvenel report dated 1/25/11 [evaluated registrant\u2019s] conduct [a]s repetitive but not compulsive[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In respect of the Megan\u2019s Law feature of the matter, a notice of proposed tier hearing was served on registrant and a hearing was held on January 25, 2012, resulting in the order giving rise to this appeal. In addition to the oral arguments of counsel, several documents were before the court for consideration. Among them, the State\u2019s RRAS form reflected a total score of 72, placing registrant at the high end of the second evaluation tier, \u201cmoderate range,\u201d on the \u201crisk to re-offend\u201d scale. <em>See generally In re Registrant </em>C.A, 146 <em>N.J. </em>71, 679 A.2d 1153 (1996). The court also had a treatment progress report from Dennis Radabaugh, LCSW, who was administering \u201csex offender specific treatment\u201d to registrant; a psychological report from Dr. Philip H. Witt, prepared at the request of registrant\u2019s attorney; and an evaluation report from Dr. Mark Frank of the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (Avenel).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">As the proceeding opened, the judge noted that he had already heard the State\u2019s arguments on a similar application in \u201cthe last case[,]\u201d which the prosecutor described as \u201cvirtually identical with respect to the legal arguments.\u201d The judge then invited registrant\u2019s attorney to offer his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Following registrant\u2019s arguments that the ERAS \u201cwas not created for this type of case,\u201d and that a situation involving the viewing of photographs in which there had been no contact with the victims, \u201cis actually outside of the heartland of the [RRAS,]\u201d <em>see generally In re Registrant G.B., </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>62, 79-85, 685 A.2d 1252 (1996), the court referred to \u201cthe <em>B.C. </em>case,\u201d decided by the Law Division in an unpublished opinion and affirmed by this court, also in an unpublished opinion, both in 2010. The courts on both levels in that case had held that Megan\u2019s Law standards applied to child pornography, and they rejected the argument that mere possession and viewing of child pornography were, categorically, \u201coutside the heartland\u201d of Megan\u2019s Law requirements. The judge in this matter disposed of registrant\u2019s argument to that effect by stating that, although \u201c[tjhis needs to be addressed by the Appellate Division again,\u201d he agreed with the reasoning and dispositions in <em>B.C.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Turning to the actual tiering question, the judge, the prosecutor and defense counsel engaged in a three-way colloquy regarding RRAS items 4, 5, and 6. As respects the last of these three criteria, \u201cduration of offensive behavior\u201d, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">[Tlhere is nothing which expressly states the length of time that the individual registrant was viewing or downloading child pornography, though, I think based on the volume, ... the prosecutor on this case conveyed to me that this was the largest seizure of child pornography. There\u2019s numerous references of being vast, extreme, gigantic quantity of child pornography. Unless this individual is going to proffer that he is sitting on his computer downloading hundreds of files on a daily basis, there were literally tens of thousands of megabytes worth of pictures and videos seized on his computer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">I think there is a reasonable inference, by clear and convincing evidence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the volume is most certainly likely over two years[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Counsel for registrant responded that there was no clear and convincing evidence before the court on the question of duration. \u201c[A]nd just by volume, doesn\u2019t do anything because those programs ____ [y]ou could sweep up that amount in one or two sessions____with the size of those programs.\u201d The prosecutor replied: \u201cI just think there is a reasonable inference there.\u201d The court ruled that the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence standard did not permit resolution of the issue by inference alone. \u201c[T]he possibility exists it wouldn\u2019t go over two years. So, I\u2019m going to score him at moderate risk for that category!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The judge noted that the total RRAS score in the \u201coffense history\u201d subset would be 24 instead of the 36 assigned by the State. He reiterated that the total score on the \u201cseriousness of offense\u201d subset would be the 30 points assigned by the State because \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes a difference\u201d that there was no showing that the photographs depicted acts of penetration \u201cof actual people versus ... simulations or [other modes].\u201d The judge concluded, regarding the \u201ccharacteristics of offender\u201d subset, with a finding that registrant was in the \u201clow risk\u201d category in respect of \u201cresponse to treatment,\u201d rather than in the \u201chigh risk\u201d category proposed by the State. The judge summarized his findings with regard to all subsets and criteria. \u201c[Registrant\u2019s] total score[,] then[,] based on the modifications are 30[] for Seriousness of Offense[;] 24 for Offense History. That\u2019s a 54. Puts him in where he was before, Tier II, except [registrant] is somewhere more square in the middle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">We reject the notion that the RRAS \u201chigh risk\u201d standard of \u201cpenetration\u201d in criterion 2, \u201cdegree of contact,\u201d is satisfied by a showing that a registrant merely possessed depictions of penetrative sexual activity with children, without any concomitant indication that he played a role in the penetrative activity either as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>a participant or a producer. Because we are here concerned with the special evils that arise from child pornography, <em>see United States v. Meiners, </em>485 A.3d 1211, 1213 (9th Cir.2007), and from baneful uses of computer technology in that connection, <em>see, e.g., In re Registrant J.W., </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 140-41, 980 A.2d 7 (App.Div.2009), we do not base our determination on constitutional principles of personal or domestic privacy that invalidate convictions for \u201cmere private possession of obscene matter[.]\u201d <em>See Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 <em>U.S. </em>557, 559, 565-66, 567-68, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1243, 1245, 1248-49, 1249-50, 22 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>542, 546, 549-50, 551 (1969); <em>Mapp v.

Rather, it seems evident from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -23 and authoritative interpretive materials developed to implement the legislation that, under the very terms of Megan\u2019s Law alone, the accused must have engaged in some kind of participation in penetrative activity before he or she can be deemed to be responsible for it on any level. <em>See, e.g., In re Registrant J.G., </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>304, 330-31, 777 A.2d 891 (2001) (requiring penetration to be proven by clear and convincing evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">To be sure, a market for such materials is essential in order to support their production and distribution, <em>see Meiners, supra, </em>485 F.3d at 1213; <em>J.W., supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 140, 980 A.2d 7, but the simple act of possessing them, with nothing further, may not be considered as having the same heinous qualities as generating or producing them. <em>See State v. Sisler, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>199, 208, 827 A.2d 274 (2003) (\u201cAlthough the person who possesses child pornography helps to foster a pernicious industry, his or her offense is less severe than the person who creates an image that then can be sold, distributed, circulated, or simply viewed.... That lawmakers would consider less culpable [than those who create, distribute, or sell child pornography] the simple possessor, namely, the person who views or prints a computer image for his or her sole use, appears ... rational.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>In a related vein, in response to criticism by federal judges<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> frustrated that following the advisory United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) Guidelines \u201coften result[s] in <em>higher </em>sentences for child pornography than for actually attempting to abuse a child,\u201d a practitioners advisory group of the USSC, in comments for a February 15, 2012 USSC hearing on federal child pornography offenses, observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">The enhancements that relate to the images possessed \u2014 both the nature or type of images and their volume \u2014 punish typical offenders as though they committed aggravated child pornography offenses, when in fact their offenses reflect no truly aggravating conduct. In 2010, two-thirds of child pornography offenders had their sentences raised by five offense levels for number of images alone. Given the online climate of file sharing programs such as Gigatribe, offenders often receive far more images than they requested or intended to receive. Other programs such as peer-to-peer networks offer unlimited access to another user\u2019s files. Many offenders end up with large amounts of material that they never actually view and did not want. Forensic review of our clients\u2019 computers frequently shows child pornography files that were never opened, or that were opened, quickly reviewed and deleted. The guidelines\u2019 focus on number of images thus mistakes quantity for culpability and fails to recognize real differences in the viewing habits and intent of individual defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">[Letter from Practitioners Advisory Group to Hon. Patti B. Saris, Chair, United States Sentencing Commission, at 3-4 n. 6 (February 13, 2012), http://www.ussc. gov/Legislative_and_Public_Affairs/Public_Hearings_and_Meetings/20120216-16/ Testimony_15_PAG.pdf Oast visited June 27,2012) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Based on the reasoning expressed in <em>J.G., Sisler, </em>and the Practitioners Group comment, we regard the trial court\u2019s allocation, in this matter, of 15 points for \u201cpenetration\u201d to have been unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The trial court\u2019s determination regarding criterion 6, \u201cduration of offensive behavior,\u201d must also be reversed because it had no basis in evidence that would satisfy the required \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. <em>See In re Registrant M.F., </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>45, 54, 776 A.2d 780 (2001); <em>J.W., supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 130, 136, 980 A.2d 7. The court disallowed the State\u2019s argument for a \u201chigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>risk\u201d finding in this regard with a 9-point rating, and concluded, without evidentiary support, that, instead, a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d finding with a 3-point rating was appropriate. Apart from the quantity of the material, there was no evidence at all before the court regarding the duration of the offensive behavior, <em>ie., </em>for how long a period registrant had possessed any of the material. All the court had was the surmise of the prosecutor based upon the quantity of material. No proofs, via expert witnesses or otherwise, were proffered to establish the length of time the material may have been on registrant\u2019s computer, or how much time would have been required to compile the quantity discovered. Without some such evidence, there was no basis for any finding at all in this category. The only finding permitted by the evidence, therefore, was zero points because the State had failed to produce clear and convincing evidence supporting any finding at all regarding criterion 6, \u201cduration of offensive behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The 15 points found for \u201cpenetration\u201d and the 3 points found as a result of the court\u2019s \u201csplitting-the-difference\u201d determination regarding \u201cduration,\u201d together, total 18 points. Elimination of these 18 points reduces registrant\u2019s RRAS score from the 54-point total found by the court to 36 points, resulting in registrant being placed in the \u201clow range\u201d of RRAS scoring, albeit at the highest end of that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The RRAS is designed to assess the risk of re-offense by one who has committed the crimes enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2b. Under the statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-8c, understood with the guidance provided by the authoritative <em>Attorney General Guidelines for Law Enforcement for the Implementation of Sex Offender Registration and, Community Notification Laws, </em>http://www.nj.gov/ oag/dcj/megan/meganguidelines-2-07.pdf (last visited June 26, 2012), required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-8d, \u201cif the risk of re-offense is low, law enforcement agencies likely to encounter the person registered shall be notified\u201d of the registrant\u2019s presence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>community. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-8c(1). Higher levels of risk assessment involve more sweeping community notification, including Internet registry. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-8c(2),(3), -12, -13. There is no provision for concluding \u201cthat any registrant could be classified as posing <em>no </em>risk of reoffense.\u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 22, 662 A.2d 367 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Accordingly, having reversed the trial court\u2019s findings on two of the RRAS criteria, resulting in registrant\u2019s movement from the second tier, moderate range of \u201crisk to re-offend,\u201d to the first tier, low range, we remand to the trial court for a determination of the registration and notification regime that ought to apply in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Several other aspects of the trial proceeding, as challenged by registrant, call for comment in the cause of good judicial administration, notwithstanding they are not essential in reaching our conclusions on the questions squarely presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">In the context of what is before us, we would be remiss if we omitted to emphasize the prohibition of <em>Rule </em>1:36-3 that \u201cno unpublished opinion shall be cited by any court.\u201d This norm applies even in so specialized a subject matter as this, along with the concomitant prohibition precluding any party from citing an unpublished opinion \u201cto any court\u201d without first providing a copy to the adversary along with \u201call contrary unpublished opinions known to counsel.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">In addition to the trial court\u2019s reliance on unpublished opinions, registrant identifies another flaw in the trial court\u2019s approach to this matter. The verbatim record opens with the following exchange after counsel entered their appearances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>THE COURT: Go ahead. Is this a similar application to the last case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Identical. It\u2019s virtually identical with respect to the legal arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">THE COURT: Well, I already heard your argument, let me hear from [registrant\u2019s counsel].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Whereupon, registrant\u2019s counsel proceeded to articulate his argument to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Attached to his argument on appeal regarding the State\u2019s and the trial court\u2019s reliance on unpublished opinions, registrant also contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">During oral argument the Judge revealed that he had already heard argument on the issue before it from the prosecutor ..., but the real unfairness is that the Judge may have heard it, but [registrant\u2019s] counsel did not and thus this argument was heard outside of the case and the record. This is a denial of [registrant\u2019s] right to a fair trial and his right to confront the evidence and the case against him, not to mention his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under the United States Constitution as well as Article I, section 10 of the New Jersey Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">[Quoting from <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 <em>U.S. </em>257, 273, 68 <em>S.Ct. </em>499, 508, 92 <em>L.Ed. </em>682, 694 (1948).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-13\">Of course this right to have counsel is not worth much if one\u2019s attorney has not heard the argument of the other side.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">This apt criticism of a court relying upon an argument made in a different case implicates another problem apart from its distortion of the effectiveness of counsel: when an appeal is taken, the record on appeal lacks the argument propounded that may have influenced the trial court\u2019s decision. Unless the trial court, in its disposition, is careful to articulate, in detail, the argument that was made, the record is entirely wanting in this essential element. <em>See Outline of Procedures for Megan\u2019s Law Cases </em>(Rev. Mar. 31, 2009), http:/Avww.judiciary.state.nj.us/notices/2009/n090413a.pdf (last visited June 26, 2012). The latter source, promulgated by the Supreme Court, directs the trial judge conducting a hearing to render a final determination which \u201cshall contain express findings of fact based on the standard of clear and convincing evidence that support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the State has or has not met its burden of persuasion both as to tier classification [and] scope of notification,\u201d as well as Internet registry. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Thus, where the State does not offer its arguments and proofs at the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>on the very matter, or the court does not set them out in detail, the record will be bereft of illumination on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">An appellate court cannot properly evaluate the matter on appeal without this material. <em>See </em>Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 1 on <em>R. </em>2:5-4 (2012) (\u201cIt is, of course, clear that in their review the appellate courts will not ordinarily consider evidentiary material which is not in the record below by way of adduced proof, judicially noticeable facts, stipulation, admission or a recorded proffer of excluded evidence.\u201d). It behooves a trial court to be certain that the record being produced before it in each case reflects, at length, all significant elements of the proofs and arguments made. This is for the benefit of an appellate court as well as those involved in the trial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">This matter presents a third topic that we need not address in order to dispose of the issues before us, but which merits attention. Registrant here contends that, as the Bergen County Prosecutor administers the second numbered RRAS criterion, \u201cdegree of contact,\u201d all computer depictions of penetrative activity are treated as \u201cpenetration,\u201d placing mere possession of such matter, with nothing more, in the \u201chigh risk\u201d category. Registrant asserts that other county prosecutors have different perceptions and practices in this regard. The result, registrant contends, is that the bottom-line evaluation of any registrant depends more upon where he resides than upon the qualities of his conduct or record, a recipe for arbitrariness and caprice.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Although the State responds to this argument by categorizing it as speculative, to the extent registrant is even partially accurate in his portrayal of different standards governing the administration of Megan\u2019s Law from county to county, we are constrained to note the Legislature\u2019s expressed disapproval of disparity in respect of basic matters in this subject matter area. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-20. Clearly, the <em>Attorney General Guidelines </em>are intended to eliminate or minimize any basic differences in evaluation and elassifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tion, but that document is not the only mechanism for promoting \u201cmore uniform and equitable\u201d application of Megan\u2019s Law, the desideratum established by the Legislature in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-20. Although a remedy for all instances of disparity may be elusive, the goal must constantly be sought by the several county prosecutors, in whose offices first-line administration of the subject matter area is reposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">For the reasons expressed in part II of this opinion, the matter is remanded for modification of the order\u2019s findings in accordance with our ruling classifying registrant in the \u201clow range\u201d of \u201crisk to re-offend\u201d; and for the application of appropriate registration and notification standards to him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-12\"> The order contains no provision referring to criterion 6 on the RRAS, \"duration of offensive behavior,\u201d notwithstanding that element informed a finding the trial court made on the record and contributed to the ultimate finding made regarding registrant\u2019s RRAS total score. The finding and conclusion on that element is addressed in a point raised by registrant on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-9\"> \u201cAll judicial determinations regarding tier classification and scope of notification, whether in a contested or default proceeding, must be by clear and convincing evidence.\" <em>G.H. v.
