(Association) challenges amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-4.9(e), 13:36-5.17(c) and 13:36-5.18(a), adopted by the Department of Law and Public Safety, Division of Consumer Affairs, State Board of Mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tuary Science (Board). 43 <em>N.J.R. </em>2360 (Sept. 6, 2011). The amendments were proposed to \u201cclarify a registered mortuary\u2019s responsibilities with respect to the participation of unlicensed persons in the removal and preparation of bodies for disposition.\u201d 42 <em>N.J.R. </em>1674 (Aug. 2, 2010). The responsibility is to \u201censure\u201d that unlicensed persons follow \u201cuniversal precautions\u201d as set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-6.4 and \u201ccomply with applicable Board rules concerning the handling of human remains.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Board proposed the amendments to protect the public health by preventing the spread of infection and disease. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The Association does not contend that the Board deviated from the statutorily prescribed procedures for rulemaking, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 to -15. Its challenges are to the Board\u2019s authority to adopt the regulations affecting unlicensed persons by obligating licensed persons to \u201censure\u201d their compliance with the Board\u2019s rules. The Association contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">I. THE AMENDMENTS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THEY EXTEND THE BOARD\u2019S REGULATORY AUTHORITY BEYOND THAT GRANTED TO IT BY THE LEGISLATURE UNDER THE MORTUARY SCIENCE ACT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">II. THE AMENDMENTS ARE ARBITRARY AND UNREASONABLE BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE REGISTERED MORTUARY TO COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATION IMPOSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">III. THE AMENDMENTS ARE INVALID BECAUSE THEY ARE UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The scope of the amendments to the regulations must be understood in order to address the issues the Association raises. In interpreting regulations, we take the same approach we do in construing statutes. <em>US Bank, N.A. v. Hough, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>187, 198-99, 42 A.3d 870 (2012). The primary goal is to give regulations the meaning intended by the drafter as revealed by the language of the provision. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 42 A.3d 870; <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005). Regulatory provisions adopted together and addressing the same problem are read and understood together. <em>See, e.g., Hough, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>at 210-11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>42 A.3d 870. Where there is ambiguity, or where a literal reading would lead to an absurd result, a court informs its interpretation with evidence of the meaning the drafter has assigned. <em>Aronberg v. Tolbert, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>587, 598, 25 A.3d 1121 (2011). In the ease of regulations, that intent may be evidenced in the l\u2019ecord of the rulemaking process. <em>Hough, supra, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 42 A.3d 870 (noting the relevance of \u201cthe meaning given to the particular regulation by the agency charged with its enforcement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The Legislature has charged the Board with regulatory responsibility for \u201cmortuary science\u201d and defined that term to include both \u201cembalming and funeral directing.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:7-34. Those terms are broadly defined to encompass \u201cthe disinfecting or preservation of a dead human body\u201d by various means and \u201cpreparation (other than embalming) for burial or disposal and the direction or supervision of burial or disposal of dead human bodies.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The Board\u2019s regulations generally bar unlicensed persons from participating in mortuary science, but there are exceptions. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-4.9, entitled \u201cParticipation of unlicensed persons,\u201d states the prohibition and the exceptions in paragraphs (a) and (b) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">(a) No unlicensed person shall actively participate in any capacity in the actual funeral arrangements, preservation or disposal of dead human bodies, <em>except that interns may participate </em>in such activities pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:7-47.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">(b) No unlicensed person shall actively participate in any capacity in the actual preparation of dead human bodies except for the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">1. Interns;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">2. Persons who perform religious and/or ritual preparations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">3. Unlicensed persons who perform tasks on behalf of the registered mortuary for which a license is not required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">The Association does not challenge the Board\u2019s decision to authorize the participation of unlicensed persons who are interns, or performing tasks on their behalf, or performing religious or ritual preparations. Those persons have had that authorization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>since 1999. 31 <em>N.J.R. </em>3126(a) (Oct. 18, 1999). The Association commented positively on the rule proposal that extended authorization to performers of religious and ritual preparations without commenting on that aspect of the proposal. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The 2011 amendments to which the Association objects address its members\u2019 responsibility for those unlicensed persons. We describe the amendments in the order in which the provisions would be implicated following a death.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The first step is removal of the body. Paragraphs (b) and (c) were added to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-5.17, the regulation addressing removal of the body. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(a) No person shall remove human remains from any residence or institution without first securing authorization consenting to the removal from the next of kin or a person legally entitled to grant said authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">(b) All removals of human remains shall be made pursuant to the direction of a registered mortuary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">(e) A registered mortuary shall ensure that all persons providing removal services utilize universal precautions as set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-6.4 and comply with all applicable Board rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Stating the obvious, paragraph (b) requires the involvement of a registered mortuary from the point the body of the deceased is removed. The Association does not challenge paragraph (b) or the Board\u2019s determination that its members should be involved at the point of removal. Its notice of appeal indicates an objection limited to paragraph (c) of this regulation, which requires a registered mortuary to ensure that persons providing removal services utilize the specified universal precautions and comply with all applicable Board rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">The Association\u2019s second objection is to the addition of paragraph (c) to another regulation that governs participation of the unlicensed persons discussed above, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-4.9. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">(c) A registered mortuary shall retain professional responsibility for all activities conducted by any unlicensed person participating in the preparation of dead human bodies pursuant to (b) above, and shall ensure that such persons utilize universal precautions as set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-6.4 and comply with all applicable Board rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The Association\u2019s third objection is to paragraph (a) of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-5.18, which addresses disposition of human remains. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-5.18, set forth in full, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">(a) Whenever human remains are entrusted to the care of a registered mortuary for disposition, the registered mortuary shall retain professional responsibility for the remains from the point of removal to the final place of disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">(b) Notwithstanding (a) above, a licensed practitioner of mortuary science shall be present at the time of final disposition of human remains, consistent with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-8.10, and shall comply with the requirements of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:9 and shall not remove any body part or dispose of the remains in any manner, except as permitted by law and as authorized by the person legally entitled to grant said authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">(c) Viscera<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> shall be treated in the same manner as the remains and shall be disposed of with the remains.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Before turning to consider the specific issues the Association raises, we address the Association\u2019s interpretation of the breadth of its obligation to ensure that unlicensed persons comply with universal precautions and applicable Board rules. The Association\u2019s arguments assume that the amendments impose these obligations on its members from the point of removal forward without regard to whether the registered mortuary has been entrusted with the body and even when the registered mortuary has no opportunity to act to ensure the unlicensed person\u2019s compliance with universal precautions and Board rules. The plain meaning of the regulations does not support either aspect of that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-5.17(b), removals must be done \u201cpursuant to the direction of a registered mortuary.\u201d Thus, the registered mortuary\u2019s obligation to ensure compliance arises in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Similarly, the obligation imposed in paragraph (a) of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-4.9 cannot be read to apply to actions that occur before the registered mortuary has been contacted. The language of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-4.9 makes it clear that the obligation arises after the registered mortuary has assumed professional responsibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>By its terms, this regulation cannot be understood to reach back in time to some moment before the registered mortuary had been contacted and assumed responsibility because it provides that \u201c[a] registered mortuary shall <em>retain </em>professional responsibility for all activities conducted by any unlicensed person participating in the preparation of dead human bodies pursuant to\u201d paragraph (b). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-4.9(c) (emphasis added). One cannot \u201cretain\u201d what one does not have, and this regulation cannot be understood to obligate a registered mortuary to assume any responsibility for actions undertaken by another before the mortuary was contacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The amendment to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-5.18(a), the third amendment challenged here, also quite clearly limits responsibility to instances in which responsibility has been assumed. It provides: \u201cWhenever human remains are entrusted to the care of a registered mortuary for disposition, the registered mortuary shall retain professional responsibility for the remains from the point of removal to the final place of disposition.\u201d Again, the obligation attaches when the mortuary becomes authorized to direct the removal, <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-5.17(b), and is entrusted with the care <em>and </em>responsibility to \u201cretain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Read together and in accordance with the plain meaning of the regulatory language, these amendments impose an obligation when the registered mortuary has assumed responsibility to direct the removal pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-5.17(b) or has done so at some later point in the course of events between death and final disposition. In those circumstances, the registered mortuary has an obligation to ensure compliance by an unlicensed person who becomes involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The Board\u2019s response to an objection the Association submitted during the rulemaking process indicates that our reading is consistent with the Board\u2019s intent. The Association submitted a comment advising the Board that families frequently contact \u201cburial societies or religious organizations [that] make the removals directly and may perform religious and/or ritual preparation of the remains before a funeral director is even contacted.\u201d 43 <em>N.J.R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>2361 (Sept. 6, 2011). In that circumstance, the Association argued, \u201cit is impossible for a funeral director to have any control or supervision over the actions of the third party.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the same comment, the Association also indicated that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to control the conduct of a third party in other circumstances. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The Board responded by noting \u201cpublic safety dictates that a registered mortuary make <em>reasonable efforts to ensure </em>that unlicensed persons who, although not under the supervision or control of the registered mortuary, are providing services <em>in connection with the final disposition of human remains entrusted to the mortuary\u2019s care, </em>observe these precautions.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). This response suggests that the Board views the obligation as one arising after a registered mortuary becomes involved. It also indicates that the Board does not intend to make the registered mortuary a guarantor; the Board understands the amendments to require no more than \u201creasonable efforts to ensure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Having identified the scope of the obligations imposed with these amendments to the Board\u2019s regulations, we turn to consider the Association\u2019s challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u201cJudicial review of agency regulations begins with a presumption that the regulations are both \u2018valid and reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Jersey Ass\u2019n of School Adm\u2019rs v. Schundler, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>535, 49 A.3d 860 (2012) (quoting <em>N.J. Soc\u2019y for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>366, 385, 955 A.2d 886 (2008) (with citation omitted)). To prevail on its challenges to these amendments, the Association must prove that they are \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schundler, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>at 548, 49 A.3d 860 (quoting <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980)). That burden can be met by showing that the regulations violate policies expressed or implied in the enabling act\u2014that the Board has exceeded its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>delegated authority. <em>In re Petitions for Rulemaking, N.J.A.C. 10:82-1.2 &amp; 10:85-1.1, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>311, 325, 566 A.2d 1154 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The Association has not established that these amendments exceed what the Legislature intended. In reviewing such a challenge, courts \u201cplacet ] great weight on the interpretation of legislation by the administrative agency to whom its enforcement is entrusted.\u201d <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 69-70, 389 A.2d 465 (1978). Nevertheless, \u201c[a]dministrative regulations \u2018cannot alter the terms of a statute or frustrate the legislative policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re N.J. Individual Health Coverage Program\u2019s Readoption of N.J.A.C. 11:20-1, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>570, 579, 847 A.2d 552 (2004) (quoting <em>Med. Soc\u2019y of N.J. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>18, 25, 575 A.2d 1348 (1990)). \u201cAn administrative agency may not under the guise of interpretation extend a statute to include persons not intended, nor may it give the statute any greater effect than its language allows.\u201d <em>Kingsley v. Hawthorne Fabrics, Inc., </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>521, 528, 197 A.2d 673 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The Legislature granted the Board broad authority to regulate mortuary science. \u201cIn the interest of, and to better secure, the public health, safety and welfare,\u201d the Legislature declared \u201cthe practice of mortuary science and the practice of embalming and funeral directing ... to be occupations charged with a high degree of public interest and subject to strict regulation and control.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:7-33. To that end, the Legislature has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">authorized and empowered [the Board] to adopt such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this entire act or any amendment or supplement which may hereafter be adopted, <em>as shall be reasonably proper and advisable for the promotion oi- improvement of </em>the standards of service, protection and practice to be followed in <em>the practice </em>of mortuary science, embalming and funeral directing by individuals, corporations, partnerships and associations in the State of New Jersey, and <em>for and in the interest, preservation and improvement of the public health, morals, safety and welfare.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>45:7-38 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">In addition to the broad grant of authority provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:7-38, that statute gives the Board specific authority to \u201cadopt rules and regulations concerning ... (a) the manner in which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>mortuary or funeral establishment is conducted, ... [and] (e) unethical or unprofessional conductf.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:7-38. In addition, the Legislature has also prohibited unlicensed persons from \u201cengag[ing] in the practice of mortuary science.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:7-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">These amendments do not frustrate or conflict with the Legislature\u2019s purpose in regulating those involved in this profession to \u201cbetter secure the public health, safety and welfare.\u201d Collectively, the amendments require a registered mortuary to direct removals of human remains by unlicensed persons, and in so doing, make reasonable efforts to ensure that unlicensed persons observe universal precautions and comply with applicable Board rules while handling the body at any point during the period in which it is entrusted to the mortuary. The Legislature has prohibited unlicensed practice of mortuary science, and the Board\u2019s imposition of this obligation is reasonably related to that prohibition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These unlicensed persons are obligated to follow universal precautions under a regulation adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">(a) As used in this chapter, \u201cStandard Precautions\u201d means the Standard Precautions, as excerpted from the Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals (January 1996), incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented, written by Julia S. Gamer, RN, MN, and the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, from the Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, published with the following citations in the following scientific journals: Garner JS, Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, Guideline for isolation precautions in hospitals, Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol.1996; 17:53-80, and Am. J. Infect. Control 1996; 24:24-52, and available at http://www.cdc.gov/ ncidod/dhqp/gl_isolation_standard.html.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">1. As used in the Standard Precautions, for purposes of this chapter, the term \u201cpatient\u201d shall be construed to mean \u201cdead body\u201d or \u201cdisinterred remains,\u201d as applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>(b) In the preparation for burial, other disposition, or transportation of a dead body, and during the handling of or work with disinterred remains, all persons present as authorized pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:36-6.1, <em>regardless of where the handling or preparation occurs, </em>shall adhere to the Standard Precautions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">(c) All fluids or other matters removed from such body in the process of embalming and any waste material and used disposable nonreusable equipment shall be disposed of in accordance with all applicable State, Federal and local laws and regulations governing medical and infectious waste.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>8:9\u20141.3 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The regulation referenced in paragraph (b) to identify persons covered is one that was adopted by this Board. Consistent with <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:36-4.9(b), it included licensed practitioners of mortuary science and their employees, authorized instructors of funeral directing schools, interns, public officials or representatives discharging their duties, accredited doctors or nurses, members of the immediate family of the deceased and their designated representatives and persons who perform religious and/or ritual preparations. Thus, by force of this regulation adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services, performers of religious or ritual services are already obligated to use precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The burdens imposed by these amendments are properly viewed as complementing the health regulation by ensuring that persons regulated by the Board make reasonable efforts to ensure that unlicensed persons comply with their independent obligations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:7-38. So viewed, the obligation imposed is in furtherance of the Board\u2019s authority to adopt regulations avoiding \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d by its regulatees. The Board, with its expertise concerning the impact of non-compliance with universal precautions and its applicable rules, could reasonably conclude that the professionals it regulates should take reasonable efforts to ensure that those unlicensed persons handling a body entrusted to the professionals follow their legal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">There is no question that \u201c[a] regulation which in practice is illusory or impossible to comply with is arbitrary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>oppressive and would violate due process.\u201d <em>Group Health Ins. of N.J. v. Howell, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>104, 112, 202 A.2d 689 (1964). Nevertheless, extended discussion is not required to address the Association\u2019s claim that these amendments have that defect. The Association\u2019s claim rests primarily on its overly broad reading of these amendments to make its members responsible for actions that take place before the registered mortuary is contacted. As discussed in Part I of this opinion, the regulations do not impose that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">To the extent that the Association argues that it cannot \u201censure\u201d compliance by persons over whom it has no control, the claim has some facial appeal. But the Board has stated in response to the Association\u2019s assertion of this claim that the Board expects its professionals to do no more than make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to ensure compliance. On this facial challenge, there is no basis to assume that the Board will require any more than it has announced \u2014 reasonable efforts. Moreover, given that unlicensed persons are subject to regulations requiring them to take precautions, this obligation to make reasonable efforts to ensure compliance is necessarily neither impossible or oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">A regulation that is unconstitutionally vague will also be invalidated. <em>See In re Health Care Administration Bd., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>67, 82, 415 A.2d 1147 (1980) (considering and rejecting a vagueness challenge). \u201c[T]he constitutional ban on vague laws is intended to invalidate regulatory enactments that fail to provide adequate notice of their scope and sufficient guidance for their application.\u201d <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 591, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985). The doctrine is applied to require fair notice and avoid the potential for arbitrary enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The Association\u2019s challenge is a facial challenge. The \u201cSupreme Court has stated that the test for facial invalidity is whether the language is \u2018so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence is unable to discern what it requires, prohibits, or punishes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>seyev v. N.J. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5-6, 570 A.2d 988 (App.Div.1989) (quoting <em>Brown v. Newark, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>565, 572-73, 552 A.2d 125 (1989)). These amendments leave no room for such uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">As interpreted by the Board, those subject to these amendments must make reasonable efforts to ensure that unlicensed persons handling a body entrusted to the care of a registered mortuary follow specified precautions and applicable regulations of the Board. Those standards are readily discernible and well known by these professionals because they are also bound by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In addition, the effort required of the registered mortuary\u2014 reasonable efforts to ensure \u2014 is sufficiently definite. \u201cIn the area of occupational restrictions, any imprecision in drafting must be assessed with a recognition that the governing body of the occupation or profession is uniquely qualified to assess the meaning of the language.\u201d <em>Moiseyev, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 6, 570 A.2d 988. The Board is the drafter and the sole enforcer, and that limits the risk of arbitrary enforcement that flows from lack of clarity in other contexts. With respect to \u201cfair warning or notice,\u201d we are mindful of the fact that professionals to whom a statute or regulation applies \u201chave a peculiar expertise in being able to assess\u201d the meaning of its terms. <em>In re Polk, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>550, 575, 449 A.2d 7 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Because the Board understands these amendments to require no more than \u201creasonable efforts to ensure\u201d compliance with discernible objective standards in furtherance of its obligation to protect the public health, the amendments are not impermissibly vague. They compare favorably with a Racing Commission regulation directed at drivers in harness races that we upheld against a vagueness challenge in <em>Moiseyev. </em>It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">In the event a drive is unsatisfactory due to <em>lack of effort </em>..., and the judges believe that there is no fraud, gross carelessness, or a deliberate inconsistent drive, [the race judges] may impose a penalty____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">[239 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 4, 570 A.2d 988.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Judge Dreier explained that \u201cto an expert in the field,\u201d observations of actions such as failing to take the lead could \u201cconstitute objective standards for evaluation\u201d of lack of effort. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 570 A.2d 988. Considering the expertise of the Commission and the drivers and the Commission\u2019s statutory obligation to diligently control the sport, the panel determined that the regulation permitting a sanction for \u201clack of effort\u201d was not void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We see no basis for reaching a different conclusion here. These amendments affect professionals obligated to refrain from conduct dangerous to the public health that is inherently at risk in this line of work. In obligating them to take reasonable efforts to ensure that unlicensed persons participating in the removal, preparation or disposal of a body comply with precautions those persons must follow in any event, the Board appropriately requires the professionals to make \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d Given the Board\u2019s obligations to protect the public health and the risk presented, it is proper for the Board to require professionals to do what is reasonable in each circumstance. That undoubtedly depends on factors that vary from case to case \u2014 factors such as the relationship between the mortuary and the unlicensed person, prior dealings between them, the unlicensed person\u2019s willingness to cooperate and the registered mortuary\u2019s efforts to encourage or compel compliance by, for example, contacting authorities. The duty is stated with sufficient clarity to provide notice of what must be done, and it is sufficiently objective to avoid arbitrary enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\"> The internal organs of the body, especially those within the abdominal and thoracic cavities. <em>Webster's II New College Dictionary </em>1234 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> The Association does not contend that the Board lacks the authority to allow participation by unlicensed persons who perform religious and ritual preparation under the supervision of a registered mortuary to accommodate the beliefs of the decedent or his or her next of kin. Accordingly, we do not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
