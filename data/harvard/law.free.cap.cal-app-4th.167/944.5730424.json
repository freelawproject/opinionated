J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeH\">Plaintiff and appellant Thomas Mangano appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of his employer, defendant and appellant Verity, Inc. (Verity), and his former supervisor, defendant and appellant Steven R. Springsteel. Mangano claimed discrimination and verbal harassment based on a perceived disability in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Government Code section 12900 et seq. We concur with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the FEHA claim and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">In a separate appeal, both parties challenge the trial court\u2019s postjudgment order granting defendants\u2019 motion for expert witness fees and denying defendants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees, filed February 13, 2007. Mangano appeals from the award of expert witness fees, and Verity and Springsteel cross-appeal the denial of their request for attorney\u2019s fees. We find no error and affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">I., II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">III. Expert Witness Fees and Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"AEg\">A. Postjudgment Order</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">After the entry of judgment, on November 17, 2006, defendants moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness fees. On May 1, 2006, approximately five weeks prior to filing their summary judgment motion, defendants offered to pay Mangano $2,500 in exchange for dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice. Under the terms of the settlement offer, each party would bear its own costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Mangano did not accept the offer of settlement. Because the judgment ultimately awarded Mangano less than $2,500, defendants sought an award of their expert witness fees and their postoffer attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">On February 9, 2007, the trial court granted the motion for expert witness fees and, pursuant to the stipulation of counsel at the hearing on the motion, fixed the amount of fees at $20,000. At the same time, the court denied defendants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Both parties timely appealed. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>court previously determined that the appeals from the postjudgment order would be considered with Mangano\u2019s appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">B. Section 998</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">\u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 1032, subd. (b).) Although expert witness fees are not ordinarily recoverable as costs (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (b)), section 998 covers costs and fees in those cases in which there has been a settlement offer by a defendant. The statute provides, in relevant part: \u201c(c)(1) If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant\u2019s costs from the time of the offer. In addition, ... the court or arbitrator, in its discretion, may require the plaintiff to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both, preparation for trial ... or during trial ... of the case by the defendant.\u201d (\u00a7 998.) The purpose of section 998 is to \u201cencourage settlement by providing a strong financial disincentive to a party\u2014whether it be a plaintiff or a defendant\u2014who fails to achieve a better result than that party could have achieved by accepting his or her opponent\u2019s settlement offer.\u201d <em>(Bank of San Pedro v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 797, 804 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 838 P.2d 218].)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">C. Expert Witness Fees<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">D. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Defendants contest the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees as part of their award of costs pursuant to section 998. We again find no error and affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">In addition to expert fees, the costs awarded to a prevailing party pursuant to section 998 may include attorney\u2019s fees \u201cwhen authorized by\u201d statute. (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B); see also \u00a7\u00a7 998, 1032.) In regard to attorney\u2019s fees, FEHA provides, in relevant part: \u201cIn actions brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12965, subd. (b).)  Despite its discretionary language, however, the statute applies only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit is deemed unreasonable, frivolous, meritless, or vexatious. <em>(Cummings v. Benco Building Services </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1387-1388 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 53] <em>(Cummings).) </em>The United States Supreme Court set forth this standard in <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC </em>(1978) 434 U.S. 412 [54 L.Ed.2d 648, 98 S.Ct. 694] <em>(Christiansburg), </em>a federal discrimination action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court affirmed that although a prevailing plaintiff in a discrimination case is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees \u201c \u2018unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust,\u2019 \u201d a prevailing defendant cannot obtain attorney\u2019s fees unless the court finds the claim \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\u201d <em>(Christiansburg, </em>at pp. 416-417, 422.) The court explained that \u201cwhile Congress wanted to clear the way for suits to be brought under the Act\u201d by making it easier for plaintiffs with limited means to bring a meritorious suit, Congress \u201calso wanted to protect defendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.\u201d <em>(Christiansburg, </em>at p. 420.) Thus, \u201c \u2018meritless\u2019 is to be understood as meaning groundless or without foundation, rather than simply that the plaintiff has ultimately lost his case . . . .\u201d <em>(Christiansburg, </em>at p. 421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The trial court\u2019s written order in this case denies the motion for attorney\u2019s fees summarily, but the court\u2019s comments at oral argument suggest that it believed the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard must be applied in a FEHA action regardless of the application of section 998.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendants argue that the court erred in applying the limitations set forth in <em>Christiansburg </em>to determine their eligibility for attorney\u2019s fees. Defendants contend that because they are the prevailing parties pursuant to section 998, and FEHA authorizes the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party, they are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as part of their section 998 costs despite the restrictions generally imposed in awarding a prevailing defendant fees in a FEHA action. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Our high court\u2019s decision in <em>Scott Co. </em>v. <em>Blount, Inc. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 979 P.2d 974] <em>(Scott) </em>provides the blueprint for our analysis in this case. The plaintiff in <em>Scott </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s $900,000 section 998 settlement offer prior to trial. <em>(Scott, </em>at p. 1107.) At trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>plaintiff was awarded approximately $442,000 in damages. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Both sides sought attorney\u2019s fees based on a provision in their contract and on the application of Civil Code section 1717 which governs the mutuality of attorney\u2019s fees provisions in contracts. (See <em>Scott, </em>at pp. 1107-1108.) Because the plaintiff\u2019s recovery failed to exceed the amount of the settlement offer, the defendant relied on the application of section 998 to argue that it was a prevailing party for purposes of its postoffer attorney\u2019s fees. <em>(Scott, </em>at p. 1107.) The trial court awarded the plaintiff its preoffer costs and attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party under the contract, and awarded the defendant its postoffer fees under section 998. <em>(Scott, </em>at pp. 1107-1108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The <em>Scott </em>court affirmed the award of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, finding that section 998 did not limit the preoffer fees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Scott, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1112.) The court further held that section 998 required the trial court to treat the defendant as the prevailing party for purposes of its postoffer costs. <em>(Scott, </em>at p. 1114.) In so concluding, the court stressed that the \u201cvery essence of section 998\u201d is its encouragement of the acceptance of reasonable settlement offers through the treatment of those losing parties whose settlement offers exceeded the final judgment <em>as prevailing parties. (Scott, </em>at p. 1114.) Thus, pursuant to section 998, \u201cthe defendant may recover all those postoffer costs to which it would have been entitled had it been a prevailing party, including attorney fees.\u201d <em>(Scott, </em>at p. 1115.) Because the contract between the parties (combined with the application of Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717) awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in the contract action, the defendant was entitled to his postoffer fees. (See <em>Scott, </em>at pp. 1114\u20141116.) The <em>Scott </em>court did not end its discussion there, however. The court acknowledged the asymmetry that may result even under section 998\u2019s apparently evenhanded treatment of preoffer and postoffer costs. (See <em>Scott, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1115 &amp; fn. 3.) Because the discussion in this footnote bears directly on the issue before this court, we quote it in full; \u201cOrdinarily, the categories of postoffer costs to which a defendant is entitled under section 998 will be the same as the categories of preoffer costs to which the [prevailing] plaintiff is entitled. This will not always be true,, however, because the Legislature has in certain limited instances made a policy decision to treat prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants differently for purposes of attorney fees and other costs. <em>Section 998 takes these differences as it finds them, applying them for purposes of postoffer costs as if the defendant were the prevailing party but neither expanding nor contracting the categories of costs to which a prevailing defendant in the circumstances would be entitled. </em>Thus, if the case is governed by a statute under which a prevailing plaintiff but not a prevailing defendant is entitled to attorney fees, then a defendant who does not prevail but is nonetheless entitled to its postoffer costs under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>section 998 is not entitled to its postoffer attorney fees as part of those costs, even though the prevailing plaintiff may obtain its preoffer attorney fees as part of its preoffer costs. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Scott, </em>at p. 1115, fn. 3, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">In other words, section 998 does not grant greater rights to attorney\u2019s fees than those provided by the underlying statute. Section 998 instead merely expands the group of those who are treated as prevailing parties and who therefore may be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as prevailing parties under the relevant statute. Under FEHA, a prevailing defendant is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees only if the action is deemed unreasonable, frivolous, or meritless. A prevailing plaintiff, in contrast, ordinarily is entitled to fees. A FEHA action therefore presents the very situation contemplated by the California Supreme Court in its footnote: the Legislature has determined that prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants in FEHA actions be treated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Following the court\u2019s observations in <em>Scott, </em>we therefore find that section 998 does not eliminate the substantive requirements for awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing FEHA defendant. We further conclude the trial court was correct to apply the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard and, thus, to deny defendants\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees on the basis that the action was not without any legal or factual foundation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This result is in keeping with the policy set forth in <em>Christiansburg </em>regarding the unequal treatment of prevailing defendants and prevailing plaintiffs in a discrimination suit. (See <em>Seever </em>v. <em>Copley Press, Inc. </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1562 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 206] <em>(Seever) </em>[noting that <em>Christiansburg </em>and related California cases demonstrate judicial \u201csensitivity to the imbalance inherent in allowing equal cost-shifting between unequal parties\u201d].) Defendants present no persuasive argument for allowing the application of section 998 to supplant the established standard that seeks to deter frivolous suits while providing adequate support and incentive for meritorious actions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We thus concur with the trial court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion for postoffer attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>IV.
