The cause being called in its turn on the paper,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-7\"><em>Van Arsdale </em>for the tenant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aczq\">brought up for the consideration of the court, as a preliminary, question, whether in any case, the court would sustain a motion to set a nonsuit aside which had been voluntarily suffered. The demandant voluntarily, of her own free will and accord, departs the court, and abandons her cause, and now requests to be reinstated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-8\"><em>I. H. Williamson, </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahgn\">If the [*] judge was correct in admitting the testimony, which we complain of, we have nothing to say: but if he was wrong, we were driven out of court by this erroneous proceeding. As the cause stood after admitting the testimony, it was clearly against the defendant; there was no use in taking a verdict. But we contend, that the testimony admitted on the part of the tenant, was illegal; if we are right in this, we ought to be reinstated, and, a new trial ordered.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b522-9\">Kirkparick, C. J., and Rossell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoU\">Were of opinion, that the demandant, by voluntarily suffering a nonsuit, was out of court, and had precluded herself from any claim on the court.</p>\n<author id=\"b522-10\">Pennington, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkA\">It\u2019s every day\u2019s practice to set aside a nonsuit improperly ordered by the court, if a judge at the circuit, has, by illegal admission or rejection of evidence, driven the -plaintiff to suffer a nonsuit. I am not satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>but that the nonsuit should be set aside, and the plaintiff reinstated; and incline to the opinion, that the plaintiff be heard on the illegality of the testimony admitted at the circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Rule refused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>CASES ADJUDGED IN THE Supreme Court of Judicature OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
