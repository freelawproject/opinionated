Of the regularity, this court is to decide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-9\">\n<em>Mr. I. H. Williamson</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1v\">moved the court to expunge from the minutes of the court, the rule of February Term last,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allowing this cause to be removed to the Circuit Court of the United States; and that the cause proceed as though no such rule had been taken. As a ground of this motion, he read a certified copy of a rule of the said circuit court, setting forth the refusal of that court to receive the cause as carried up from this court on the rule of February Term last; he alleged that the circuit court was of opinion, that it could not obtain jurisdiction by a fiction of law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-10\"><em>Mr. Griffith </em>opposed the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVE\">He said that the refusal at the circuit court to receive the cause, was done at the instance of the counsel for the plaintiff; that the plaintiff had brought himself into the situation in' which he was; that he must lie in his bed as he had made it; that the circuit court could not take notice that anything done in this court, was done <em>nune pro nunc; </em>that in a legal contemplation it might be considered as done at the time it ought to have been done.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-11\">\n<em>Mr. Williamson.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApZ\">There was nothing improper in his client in opposing the reception of the cause in the circuit court. It was a question of jurisdiction; he had a right to submit that question to the court on the first appearance of the cause; it would be unwise to go on while a doubt should remain as to the jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-12\"><em>A. Ogden, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aen\">There is no collision between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the courts. The circuit court saith it hath no jurisdiction; this court must then have it. But suppose there is a collision between the courts, what is to be done ? This question arises under the Constitution [*] of the United States. The circuit court are, therefore, the constitutional judges of the question; and they have decided that they have no jurisdiction. This [494] court, having jurisdiction, ought to proceed in the cause; if it does not, the plaintiff is thrown out of court, and has no remedy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>Mr. Griffith.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWq-\">Suppose the bond and petition were executed in September Term,- but through some accident it was not presented, would not the court have a right to receive it the next term as of the preceding term ? The circuit court erred in not receiving the cause; they ought to have received and filed it. The defendant has acquired a right to have his cause tried in the courts of the United States, and this court cannot deprive him of it, by asserting a jurisdiction after the cause is removed. If the plaintiff is in a situation, that he cannot proceed in his cause, it is his own fault, and his case is not a new one; parties are frequently in such situation that the cause cannot be proceeded in.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>Mr. Williamson.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVJe\">This court hath jurisdiction until the cause is removed,-and received in the court above. This cause is depending in this court until the circuit court has obtained and taken jurisdiction; it must be depending in one court or the other; it is not depending in the circuit court; it must, therefore, be depending in this.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-14\"> S.
