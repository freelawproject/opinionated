H. Stoelcton </em>objected to the rule,</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-15\">1st. That the notice did not designate the hour in the day that the application would be made; there ought to have been a specification of a precise hour.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-16\">2d.
