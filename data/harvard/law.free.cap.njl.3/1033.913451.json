It appeared from the record of the justice, [753] that a witness was offered by the plaintiff, and objected to, on the ground of interest, and was sworn on his <em>voire dire; </em>and while under examination on his <em>voire dire, </em>he was asked whether the removal of the mill-dam would not operate to his disadvantage ? To which question, the plaintiff objected, and the justice sustained the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-14\"><em>M\u2019Donald </em>and <em>11.
