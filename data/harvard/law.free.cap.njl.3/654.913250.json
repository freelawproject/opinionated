But it appeared that the defendant, on the back of the summons, signed a request to the justice to adjourn the trial. This objection was overruled.</p><p id=\"b243-11\">It was secondly objected, that the justice refused to receive the set-off of the defendant; but this set-off was not accompanied with any plea of payment, and was in general terms for cash and sundries, without specifying the particulars. The court said the justice was correct.</p><p id=\"b243-12\">It was thirdly objected, that the justice did not adjourn the cause on the application of the defendant; the court said this was a subject of discretion in the justice.</p><p id=\"b243-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
