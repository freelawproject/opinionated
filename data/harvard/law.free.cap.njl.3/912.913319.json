He could not tell what the plaintiff below meant by pleading; but the most rational interpretation was, that the plaintiff below, Norris, was one of those persons who are denominated bush lawyers, and that the charges were for advocating causes in justice\u2019s courts. He apprehended that such services would not entitle the person performing them, to an action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AS0\">An action cannot be maintained on this state of demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AvL\">Cited in <em>Seely </em>v. <em>Crane, 3 Gr. 35; Van Atta </em>v. <em>McKinney's Ex. 1 Harr. 235.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
