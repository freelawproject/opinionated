That Daniel Sayre, who was the plaintiff below, had commenced a suit against the defendant before the same justice, for the same cause of action, and an adjournment had taken place; and before the time of meeting on the adjournment had come, he had, in the absence of the defendant, discontinued his suit, and then commenced a new one., This, <em>Mr. Soudder </em>contended, could not be done, but while both parties were in court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-16\"> S.

That the justice permitted the plaintiff below to prove items of a book account, of an older date than a note of hand which the defendant had given him, without proving that these items were not included in the note.
