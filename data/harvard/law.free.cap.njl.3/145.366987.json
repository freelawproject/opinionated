These reasons complained of the irregularity of the proceedings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the justice. These irregularities not appearing on the transcript of the record sent up by the justice, the plaintiff took a rule on the justice, calling on him to state certain proceedings had before him on the trial of the cause below. In compliance with this rule, the justice made a return, denying the facts on which the plaintiff relied for a reversal of the judgment.</p><p id=\"b119-4\">An atempt was then made, to contradict the return of the justice, by the affidavits of by-standers.
