The bill set out, that the defendant had received money belonging to the testator, of several persons, naming them; and then added, also divers other sums of money, of divers other persons, without naming the persons or sums.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-4\"><em>Mr. Griffith </em>contended, that in an action for money had and received, no bill of particulars is necessary, nor could legally be required; but even if it could, yet the one rendered was sufficient, and was as particular as he could make it, without examining the witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-5\">By the 54th section of the practice act, it is enacted, that the plaintiff, or his attorney, if required before plea shall be filed, shall deliver to the defendant, or his attorney, a copy of the account, or <em>a bill of the particulars of the demand, </em>or. a copy of the bill, bond, deed, bargain, contract, note, instrument, or other writing, whereon the declaration is founded.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-16\"> The same time given to plead after oyer, as when it was demanded. <em>7 Salst. 178.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b228-6\">Kirkpatrick, C.

That the action for money had and received, had been carried full as far as safety would warrant; nor did he think the bill delivered by the plaintiff in this case, sufficient; it was, in fact, leaving [473] every thing open; the defendant was as liable to be surprised as if no bill had been delivered; the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ought to strike out the general clause in his bill of particulars; but should be left at liberty to add any items he thought proper.</p>\n<author id=\"b229-5\">Rossell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACP8\">Was of the same opinion, on Mr. Griffith striking out the general clause in this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Rule allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
