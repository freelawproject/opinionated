I inclined to think at that time, and have not changed my opinion since, that the rule to change the venue on the common affidavit, owes its origin to the principles of the common law; that causes should be tried by the neighbors where the matter was transacted, and the cause of action arose. The English statute is in furtherance of that principle, and our act of Assembly does not impair it, but was made to restrain plaintiffs from capriciously laying the venue in any remote corner of the [*] State, to the oppression and vexation of defendants ; but I cannot perceive why the court, in exercising the discretion vested in it by the statute, should not adhere to the common law principle of trying the controversy where the cause of action arose, by a jury of the neighbors, which the changing the venue on the common affidavit is intended to effect. But the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bashford, </em>and the opinion of my brethren at this time, has settled the point; so that in future it must be understood that the venue in this court will not be changed on the common affidavit, but that on all motions to change the venue, special circumstances must be made out by affidavit, on which the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>will exercise the discretion which the statute has invested them .with. Rule refused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> The English statutes on the subject are short, and as follows: VI. <em>Richard the II. </em>c. 2. \u201c To the intent that writs of account, and all other such actions, be from henceforth taken in <em>their </em>counties, and directed to sheriffs of the counties where the contracts of the same action did arise; it is ordained and accorded, that if from henceforth in pleas upon the same writs, it shall be declared that the contract thereof was made in another c.ounty than is contained in the original writ, that then incontinently, the same writ shall be utterly abated.\u201d This not expressly forbidding the writ to be sued in a foreign county, <em>4 Henry 4, </em>c. 18, directs all attorneys to be sworn, \u201c that they make no suit in a foreign county.\u201d Our act of assembly, on the same subject, <em>Pat. 393, </em>is as follows: \u201cThat an action merely transitory, shall, at the discretion of the court, be tried in the county in which the cause of action arose, or the plaintiff or defendant reside at the time of instituting such action; or if the defendant shall not be an inhabitant of this State, in the county in which process shall have been served against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
