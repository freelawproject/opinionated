It was brought by the pauper himself, in his own name, against the overseer. A right of action did not vest in the pauper, by the order and a refusal to obey it. Besides, the order is defective in several respects; particularly, that it was made by the justices of their own accord, without the application of the overseers of the poor, which the statute, <em>Pat. 30, </em>requires. The justices have not any authority to make an order, unless on the application of the overseers of the poor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-9\"><em>Scott, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADf\">The overseers refused, on application made to them, to apply to the justices for an order. The justices, on this refusal, did perfectly right in making the order, otherwise, the pauper might starve. On the order being made, and the overseer refusing to execute it, a right of action vested in the pauper.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-10\">Kirkpatrick, C. J., and Rossell., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al7\">Were of opinion that the order was defective; and therefore, that an action could not be maintained on it; and that the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b382-11\">Pennington, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMk\">I do not think it necessary to take up any time in considering the question raised by the counsel for the plaintiff in <em>certiorari, </em>as to the legality or regularity of the order of the justices. For even admitting that the order is made in conformity to law, yet I am clearly of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>opinion that this action cannot be maintained. If the overseer of the poor was bound to pay this weekly allowance, it was a breach of public duty, not to do it, for which he is liable to be indicted, convicted and punished; <em>3 Burns J. 663, 668 ; 5 Bur. 2677; Wood\u2019s Institutes, J\u00a1!21. </em>But I can perceive no principle of law that will authorize the pauper, in whose favor the order was made, to maintain an action in his own name, against the overseer of the poor, [*] for refusing to obey the order of the justices. I incline, however, to think with my brethren, that the order is insufficient ; that it should have been made on the application of the overseers, as the act directs that mode. But I wish to be understood as putting my opinion on the ground that the action cannot be maintained by the pauper himself. The government will see that its laws are obeyed, and punish delinquent officers; but it appears to be a novel attempt, for an individual to institute a private action against a public officer, for a breach of a <em>public </em>duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"ACc\">Cited in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Inhab. of Perth </em>Amboy, <em>4 Harr. 52; Overs, of </em>Princeton, v. <em>Overs. of South </em>Brunswick, <em>3 Zab. 169.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
