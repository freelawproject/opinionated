Teller, and Samuel Teller, trading under the firm of Peter W. Teller &amp; Co., on a promissory note, alleged to be made by the defendants, in the name of the firm. At the trial, the plaintiff, Muir, offered in evidence a note, which he proved to be in the handwriting of Peter W. Teller, signed by Peter W. Teller <em>&amp; </em>Co. The counsel for the defendants objected to reading the note in evidence, alleging that no evidence had been given of the existence of the partnership, which he contended was necessary, to make out a joint cause of action, and to show the authority of Peter W. Teller to execute a note in the name of the other defendants. The court below overruled the objection; whereupon the note was read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>evidence, on which the plaintiff rested his cause. The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that no joint contract had been proved; but the court refused to nonsuit, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the note.
