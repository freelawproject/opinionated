Such bail must be in double the rent of the lands, and of the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-11\">A writ of error having been presented by the defendants, this term, <em>Leake </em>and <em>Kwing </em>applied to the court, to stay or suspend the execution, on the judgment rendered in the cause, to give time to the plaintiffs in error, to enter into recognizance in compliance with the statute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-12\"><em>L. H. Stockton, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2Uv\">This would be in direct violation of the act of Assembly, both as to the letter and spirit of the act; which contains an express prohibition to the court, restraining it from staying execution in this case, unless the recognizance shall be entered into. <em>Pat. 846.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-13\"><em>Leake </em>and <em>Kwing, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8G\">The act contains no positive injunction, but leaves the discretion of the court over its own process as before. <em>Barnes\u2019 N. 212; 2 Lmpey, G.

The case in <em>Barnes </em>is not repugnant to this opinion. In that case, the costs were not taxed; the judgment was not complete; we may stay execution until the judgment is complete, by the taxation of costs, but not to give time to put in bail, for that would be delaying it by reason of the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Rule refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The next day recognizance was taken. The court as to the sum, adopted the English practice, and required double the annual rent, or profit of the land; and also double the the costs. In this case, $276 in all.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-13\"> <em>Bur. %501; 1 Halst. 473.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
