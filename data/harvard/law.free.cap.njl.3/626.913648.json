The defendant had entered his appearance by attorney, in September Term last; he admitted, that by the laws of the United States, the petition ought to have been presented on the appearance of the defendant, and application made at that time; but as the defendant was not at that time apprised of the nature of the demand of the plaintiff, and that he had entered an appearance for him without [465] adverting to the circumstances of the necessity of the application at the time; he moved that it be done <em>nunc, pro tunc.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-4\"><em>I.

By the constitution of the United States, and statutes made in conformity thereto, the defendant has a right to remove a cause brought against him by a citizen of this State, into the court of the United States, on his declaring such intention, and making affidavit of certain facts on his entering his appearance in this court; this he has not done; and by his not doing it, he has waived that privilege; and the plaintiff has acquired a right to have his cause tried here. This is now to be taken from him by a [466] mere fiction. It is to be done <em>mine pro tune. </em>It is impossible but to perceive that this is a fictitious proceeding. It is to be done now as though it had been done six months ago, that is, in September Term last; although the affidavit, which is the groundwork of the application, was taken not more than four days ago, and so imports on the face of it. Fictions in law, are only tolerated to supply formal defects, mere inaccuracies in <em>form; </em>but are never permitted to vary substantial rights. In this case we are called upon to adopt a fictitious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>.proceeding, in destruction of a vested substantial right of the plaintiff, to have his cause tried in the courts of his own State.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Motion allowed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlZo\">See <em>Wanner </em>v. <em>Sisson, 1 Stew. 117; S C., 2 Penn. 668.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">Cited in <em>Ogden </em>v.
