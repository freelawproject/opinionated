The return of the constable, as to the service of the summons, was as follows:\u2014 <em>\u201c </em>Summons served by leaving a copy with defendant\u2019s wife, informing her of its contents.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-8\">\n<em>Mr. Van Arsdale</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMkq\">offered to read affidavits taken under a rule of court, to prove that the person whom the constable supposed, or pretended was the .wife of the defendant below, was not his wife; and that although she had lived with him under circumstances disreputable to her, yet that at the time of the service of the summons, she did not even live in the house [662] of the defendant, but in another family; and that the defendant resided at that time in New York, although he had a house in Essex.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-9\">\n<em>Ghetwood</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE2A\">opposed the reading of these .affidavits, on the ground that it was contradicting the record of the justice, by affidavits. That the return of the constable was entered according to law, on the justice\u2019s docket, and thereby became part of the record, and could not be contradicted or added to by affidavits, according to former decisions made by this court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b478-10\">By the Court. \u2014 Let</author>\n<p id=\"AeR\">the affidavits be read; they are not read to contradict the record. The service of a summons by leaving a copy with the defendant\u2019s wife is not a good service, unless the wife is at the [f] time of the service, at the resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>dence of the defendant. It is to repel an inference which may possibly be drawn from the return, and as the summons was served on the wife of the defendant, it may be presumed that it was at his place of residence; to take away this presumption, it is proper to read the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The affidavits being read, fully proved the facts as stated by Mr. Van Arsdale.
