For the reasons assigned, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">In January 1996, Kevin Trudeau filed a libel suit against Cat\u00f3n in Illinois state court based on statements Cat\u00f3n made in a book and on an Internet website. Cat\u00f3n removed the action to federal court, but on Trudeau\u2019s motion, the action was remanded. Thereafter, Cat\u00f3n failed to respond to Trudeau\u2019s claims and the court entered a default and noticed an evidentiary hearing. On June 5, 1996, after a hearing, the court rendered a default judgment against Cat\u00f3n, awarding Trudeau $5 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">In November 1996, Cat\u00f3n filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Trudeau filed a complaint therein, seeking to have the Illinois default judgment declared nondischargeable under section 523(a)(6). Trudeau then moved for summary judgment, contending that the Illinois judgment for libel <em>per se </em>established a nondischargeable debt for willful and malicious injury under section 523(a)(6) and further contending that collateral estoppel applied to prevent relit-igation of this issue. Cat\u00f3n responded that collateral estoppel did not apply and that the claims supporting the Illinois judgment should be litigated in the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court applied collateral es-toppel, determined that the Illinois judgment was nondischargeable under section 523(a)(6), and granted Trudeau\u2019s summary judgment motion. The district court affirmed; Cat\u00f3n timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-18\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-19\">Collateral estoppel applies in bankruptcy dischargeability proceedings, but the bankruptcy court retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a debt is dis-chargeable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to give preclusive effect to a state court judgment is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because the judgment in question was entered by an Illinois state court, we apply Illinois rules of preclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-20\">Under Illinois law collateral estoppel applies when: (1) the issue decided in the prior adjudication is identical with the one presented in the pending suit; (2) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party therein; (3) there was a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The existence of these elements is not disputed. Rather, Cat\u00f3n contends that collateral estoppel does not apply to default judgments and that the state court record presented fails to provide a sufficient basis to support reliance on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-21\">The Illinois Supreme Court has not yet determined whether default judgments are entitled to the same preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral estoppel as any other judgment, but it has noted that there is a split of authority on the issue with some courts giving default judgments limited preclusive effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Appellate Court of Illinois, however, recently has held that collateral estoppel may be applied to a default judgment provided no injustice results from the application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This very recent pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>nouncement by an Illinois appellate court forecloses Caton\u2019s contention, and we thus must conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel may be applied to default judgments under Illinois law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">For collateral estoppel to apply, a party must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action and there must be no undue unfairness to the party estopped.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cat\u00f3n clearly had a full and fair opportunity to contest the issue in the state proceeding, and we find no injustice in applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel in this case. Cat\u00f3n was properly notified of the proceeding and, in fact, filed a notice of removal therein. After remand, however, Cat\u00f3n chose not to appear in the proceeding further, even though Trudeau sought actual and punitive damages in excess of $10 million for libel <em>per se. </em>Under these circumstances, it cannot be disputed that Cat\u00f3n had an opportunity to litigate. Cat\u00f3n does not contest that he received notice of the default, as well as the subsequent evidentiary hearing, and he provides no explanation for his failure to pursue his legal remedies after the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Caton further contends that the bankruptcy court cannot rely on the Illinois default judgment because the state record presented is insufficient to support the judgment. He asserts that the facts supporting the judgment are not discernible from the record presented and, thus, dischargeability cannot be determined therefrom. In reviewing the application of collateral estoppel under Texas law, we have articulated the standard upon which Cat\u00f3n relies; that the record reflect the finding made and the supporting facts so that the bankruptcy court may determine that the pertinent issue was litigated and decided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have never required, however, that a full state court record be presented.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We only require that the record introduced have sufficient detail to allow the use of collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Such has been established in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">The state record before us contains Trudeau\u2019s complaint wherein he alleges two counts of libel <em>per se. </em>The complaint details the particular words alleged to be libelous and incorporates by reference the attached publications in question. Trudeau also alleges in the complaint that (1) \u201cthe statements are false\u201d; (2) the statements \u201cwere made maliciously and intentionally with full knowledge of their falsity or in complete and reckless disregard of their truth or falsity, for the purpose of injuring and destroying Trudeau\u2019s personal and professional reputation\u201d; (3) the statements \u201cimpute the commission of a criminal offense to Trudeau, impute the inability to perform or want of integrity in the discharge of Trudeau\u2019s duties of employment and prejudice Trudeau in his business and occupation\u201d; and (4) Cat\u00f3n \u201cacted with actual malice.\u201d Such factual allegations are sufficient to support a cause of action for libel <em>per se </em>under Illinois law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">Under Illinois law, by failing to plead Ca-t\u00f3n admits by default the factual allegations contained in the complaint.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The default judgment must rest upon the allegations of the petition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, because the factual allegations are deemed admitted and the default judgment necessarily rests thereon, we are able to determine conclusively the issue decided by the court when rendering the default judgment. The judgment provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>after hearing the case on \u201cprove-up\u201d at which Trudeau testified, Trudeau is awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Libel being the only cause at issue, and punitive damages requiring allegations of outrageous conduct or acts perpetrated by evil motive or with reckless indifference to the rights of others,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the state court necessarily determined these issues by rendering the judgment. <em>No </em>additional record support is required under Illinois law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-3\">Having determined that collateral es-toppel applies under Illinois law, we turn to the dischargeability inquiry. Section 523(a)(6) provides that a debt for \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d by the debtor is nondis-chargeable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Previously, we defined \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d to mean \u201cwithout just cause or excuse.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Recently, however, this definition was displaced by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Kawaauhau v. Geiger.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In an intervening decision, <em>In re </em>Miller,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a panel of our court recently held that \u201can injury is \u2018willful and malicious\u2019 where there is either an objective substantial certainty of harm or a subjective motive to cause harm.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">Applying our precedential <em>Miller </em>standard to the instant case, we find that there was a deliberate or intentional injury, precluding discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6), as Caton\u2019s libelous statements were objectively substantially certain to result in the injury to Trudeau. Accordingly, we find no error in the determination by the courts <em>\u00e1 quo </em>that the Illinois default judgment had collateral estoppel effect as to \u00a7 523(a)(6) dischargeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">The judgment appealed is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">. <em>Grogan v.
