His sole complaint herein is that the evidence adduced on the trial of the action was insufficient to support the verdict and that the verdict is contrary to the evidence. For the prosecution, but a single witness positively identified defendant as one who, with another person, actively participated in the commission of the crime of which defendant was accused, although, aside from generalities, the witness was unable to describe in what manner defendant was clothed at the time the robbery occurred. However, comparing the appearance of defendant with that of the person who concededly assisted in the commission of the robbery, another witness testified that defendant \u201cwas the same type of man; ... his general physical appearance was similar\u201d; but that the witness \u201ccouldn\u2019t say . . . whether or not this defendant sitting at the counsel table here, the man with the glasses on, is the man\u201d. A third witness, who also was present at the time in question, failed to see defendant \u201cor anybody else\u201d other than the person who actually committed the robbery. A fourth wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ness testified that the \u201cgeneral appearance\u201d of the man who assisted in the robbery \u201cwas the same as that of this defendant\u201d. Although the witness \u201ccouldn\u2019t say positively that the defendant Yeoman was the man\u201d, she also stated that \u201cIf I were asked to stretch my imagination, I would say that he was\u201d. A fifth witness testified that he did not \u201cbelieve . . . that he was able to see these men sufficiently so that he could identify either one of them\u201d, but that, as compared with the robber in question, defendant \u201cwas a man of similar build\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">For the defendant a very strong \u201calibi\u201d was presented. Judging from facts appearing in the reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings at the trial, no adverse criticism may properly be made of any of the witnesses who testified in that regard. Apparently each of them was a person of good reputation, and the testimony given, which was of a most positive-character, was clearly to the effect that under no condition would it have been possible for defendant to have participated in the commission of the crime of which he was charged. Indeed, viewed from the \u201ccold record\u201d, it would be hard to conceive of a more convincing \u201calibi\u201d in any case than was presented by defendant in his own behalf. If, considering the entire evidence adduced at the trial of the action, it be difficult to reconcile one\u2019s mind to the verdict of the jury, or to understand the reasoning by which the testimony given by defendant\u2019s witnesses failed to accomplish the result of creating in the \u201cmind\u201d of the jury a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant, a compensating thought is presented with knowledge of the rule of law which presumably was followed herein:  That in order to be justified in his denial of the motion for a new trial the judge who presided at the trial must have been convinced, not only that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, that the weight of the evidence was in favor thereof, but that in all respects it was legal and in furtherance of justice. (20 Cal. Jur. 25 et seq., and authorities there cited.)  Thus fortified, aided by the legal principle that on appeal from a judgment if it appear that the verdict was supported by substantial evidence the appellate tribunal- is without authority to direct a reversal of the judgment or the order by which the motion of the defendant for a new trial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>denied, the proper course of this court in the premises is clearly indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The judgment and the order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Conrey, P. J., and Bishop, J., <em>pro torn., </em>concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on July 29, 1931, and a petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on August 13, 1931.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
