From the reporter\u2019s transcript we note that at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case on August 31, 1928, defendant moved for a nonsuit, to which the trial judge responded, after the motion had been argued: \u201cIt is the order of the Court that the motion be granted.\u201d In the clerk\u2019s transcript we find this order, entered in the minutes of August 3'lst, in these words: \u201cDefendant's motion for a non-suit is by the Court granted.\u201d Thereafter, September 27th, extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed and at the same time a judgment dismissing the action was made, which was entered the following day. Not quite a month later, October 23d, another set of findings was filed, but no judgment appears to have followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The appeal before us was taken December 21st from \u201cthe judgment made and entered ... on or about September 27, 1928\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">This appeal must be dismissed.  It is provided in section 581 of the Code of Civil Procedure that the entry in the minutes of an order granting a nonsuit is the final act in entering a final judgment, and there is no place thereafter for another judgment. <em>(Henry </em>v. <em>Lingsweiler, </em>(1927) 81 Cal. App. 142 [253 Pac. 357]; <em>Bengel </em>v. <em>Traeger, </em>(1929) 100 Cal. App. 526 [280 Pac. 538]; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Hammond Lumber Co., </em>(1931) 114 Cal. App. 390 [300 Pac. 49].)  As a reversal of the judgment appealed from, if that should be required, would be of no avail because the judgment of nonsuit (August 31st) would still be left un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>disturbed, this appeal presents only moot questions and should be dismissed. <em>(Burks </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>(1922) 58 Cal. App. 143 [207 Pac. 1018].) The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Conrey, P. J., and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
