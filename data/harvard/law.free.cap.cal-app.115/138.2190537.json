It clearly appears from the record that appellant\u2019s co-defendant pleaded guilty to the charge, as stated to him by the court, that he did \u201cunlawfully steal and take away an automobile\u201d. In the same proceeding, and immediately thereafter, the court asked appellant: \u201cHow do you plead, Mr. Raymus, guilty or not guilty to the same charge?\u201d To which question Raymus answered \u201cGuitly\u201d. He subsequently offered no proof, by affidavit or otherwise except the oral suggestion of substituted coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>sel, that he had not voluntarily pleaded guilty to a charge of grand theft. There was no abuse of discretion upon the part of the trial court in denying a motion to set it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Other matters discussed by appellant are not properly a part of, nor included in the record; and they cannot be considered upon appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cruse, </em>24 Cal.
