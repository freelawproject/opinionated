In such circumstances, the authorities are universal that the power of deciding the submitted issue of fact rests with the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>and that its decision thereon cannot be disturbed by this tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on July 31, 1931, and a petition by appellants to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on August 31, 1931.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
