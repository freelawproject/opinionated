No decision of an appellate court upon the exact state of facts here present has been cited and there seems to be some- contrariety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>in the conclusions reached by the various courts of common pleas in which the question has been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We gather from the record that the procedure below was as follows: Divers inhabitants of the Township of Lancaster, Lancaster County, petitioned the quarter sessions of that county for the appointment of viewers to lay out a public road therein and assess damages, if any, in favor of the owners of lands over which the road may pass. Viewers were appointed; their report was presented on April 15, 1929, and endorsed, \u201cPiled, read and confirmed nisi.\u201d In it they awarded \u201cto L. V. Wright [appellant herein] the owner of the only land affected by the opening of said street the sum of $300.\u201d On April 23rd Wright appealed to the common pleas from this award; the same day, upon motion of his counsel in which the county solicitor joined, an issue was framed to try what amount of damages had been sustained by him, in which it was directed that he should be plaintiff and the county defendant. No exceptions were filed to the viewers\u2019 report and on September 21st (more than five months after the filing thereof) it was \u201cconfirmed absolutely\u201d by the quarter sessions. The issue was on the common pleas trial list for November 25th but was continued. On November 27th, more than thirty days after confirmation absolute, the county commissioners petitioned for and obtained in the common pleas a rule to strike off the appeal upon the ground that it \u201cwas not taken within thirty days after the final or absolute confirmation of said report of viewers\u201d but, as recited in the petition, had been taken within thirty days after confirmation nisi and months prior to final confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The court below filed an opinion in which it referred to one of its quarter sessions\u2019 rules providing, in effect, that exceptions to reports of viewers \u201cshall be filed on or before the first Saturday of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>next after that to which the report shall be returnable;\u201d reviewed the Acts of April 15, 1891, P. L. 17, and May 26, 1891, P. L. 116 (hereinafter considered); and, after citing a number of authorities, concluded that the appeal was taken prematurely and therefore should be stricken off. From the order so directing Wright took this appeal. It may be observed in passing that the rule of court quoted in the opinion seems to be out of harmony with the provisions of the Act of March 27, 1903, P. L. 83, providing that reports of viewers shall be confirmed at the expiration of thirty days from the filing thereof, unless exceptions have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">As the county, after joining in the motion for the awarding of an issue, did not raise any question relative to the invalidity of the appeal until more than two months after the report had been confirmed absolutely it should be able to point to a clear justification of its present position, but we are not convinced that it has succeeded in its effort. It will assist in clarifying the issue to bear in mind that we are here dealing with the method of recovering damages for the laying out of a township road and not with the ascertainment of damages under the Act of June 13, 1874, P. L. 283, providing for the regulation of appeals from assessments of damages to owners of property taken for public use, or with appeals from awards incident to the taking of private property, for public use by corporations upon which the right of eminent domain has been conferred. The Act of 1874 is not applicable here: Lamoreux v. Luzerne County, 116 Pa. 195. Moreover, the present question does not relate to exceptions attacking the regularity of the proceedings, but to an appeal taken for the purpose of having the extent of the damages determined by a jury according to the course of the common law. Another distinction is that in township road cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the appeal is from a \u201cdecree of the quarter sessions\u201d and not \u201cfrom the ascertainment of the damages or the filing a report thereof in court\u201d as provided for in the Act of 1874. Upon the general question of the distinction in procedure as between appeals from, and exceptions to, reports of viewers, the language of Mr. Justice Queen in Bowers v. Braddock Borough, 172 Pa. 596, 600, is applicable, although that was a case under the Act of 1874: \u201cThe filing of exceptions to the report of viewers has nothing to do with the right of appeal. That right can only be exercised according to the terms in which it is given. The hearing of the exceptions can go on and be completed before the case is actually tried and if the exceptions are decided favorably to the appellant so as to defeat the proceeding no trial will be necessary. If otherwise the trial can then proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The \u201cterms in which\u201d the appeal in this case \u201cis given\u201d are found in two acts adopted in 1891: the first, approved April 15th, P. L. 17, provides, inter alia, that in all cases where a jury of view appointed by any court of quarter sessions shall assess damages for the laying out of any public road the county commissioners of the county required to pay the damages \u201cor any owner or tenant of property through which said......road......shall be laid out\u201d shall have the right to appeal to the common pleas \u201cfrom the decree of the court of quarter sessions confirming the award of such jury for the determination of the question of damages by a jury according to the course of the common law; provided the appeal be taken within thirty days after the final confirmation of the report of said jury;\u201d the second, approved May 26th, P. L. 116, provides for appeals to the common pleas \u201cby any party aggrieved\u201d by the decree of confirmation \u201cwithin thirty days from the entry of said decree of confirmation by the court of quarter -sessions and not \u00e1fter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>wards.\u201d The proviso of the first act refers expressly to \u201cthe final confirmation of the report\u201d and we think the \u201cdecree of confirmation\u201d mentioned in the second is, by implication, the final decree. One thing perfectly clear under these statutes is that no appeal may be taken when more than thirty days have elapsed after final confirmation, but there is nothing therein prohibiting the taking of the appeal at any time after the decree nisi and prior to the expiration of thirty days after final confirmation. The Act of 1874 expressly provides that the appeal under it may be taken \u201cwithin thirty days from the ascertainment of the damages or the filing a report thereof in court.\u201d While there is no conflict between the Act of 1874 and those of 1891 (Vernon Park, Philadelphia\u2019s Appeal, 163 Pa. 70, 75), under the latter the appeal is from a decree of the quarter sessions confirming the award and not from the award itself. But the endorsement, \u201cFiled, read and confirmed nisi,\u201d placed upon the report April 15th was just as truly a decree as the endorsement \u201cconfirmed absolutely,\u201d written upon it on September 21st. Where a statute authorizing the appropriation of land by street railway companies gave the right of appeal \u201cfrom the report of said viewers......within thirty days after confirmation of the report\u201d it was held that the thirty-day period began with the entry of confirmation nisi: Altoona and Logan Valley Electric Railway Company v. Miller, 49 Pa. Superior Ct. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The effect of the word \u201cnisi\u201d in a decree of confirmation was considered by Rice, P. J., in that case. It was an attempted appeal from a proceeding under the Act of June 1, 1907, P. L. 368, supplementing the Act of May 14, 1889, P. L. 211, relating to street railways. The company had appropriated land of the appellant in that case. Viewers awarded damages and filed their report on July 6, 1910, upon which date the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>court endorsed on it, \u201cWithin report read and confirmed nisi.\u201d On August 6th, the prothonotary made this endorsement, \u201cNo exceptions having been filed, confirmed absolutely.\u201d Nine days later the property owner appealed, but the appeal was stricken off upon the ground that it should have been taken within thirty days after the first confirmation; this court affirmed. There the statute gave the right to appeal \u201cwithin thirty days after confirmation of the report.\u201d It was pointed out that the statute contained no provision with respect to confirmation nisi, and that is eauallv true of the legislation here involved. In discussing the true intent and meaning of the confirmation nisi, Judge Rice said: \u201cIn the first place, the court acted judicially, and not merely ministerially, in making it. This is not only to be presumed, but is affirmatively shown by the order itself. The confirmation was entered after the court had examined the report. If the word \u2018nisi\u2019 had not been added, there would be no room for doubt that the period of thirty days within which the right of appeal must be exercised began to run at the date of the order. But the confirmation thus made would have been subject to the right of appeal given by the subsequent portion of the section. If, instead of using the word \u2018nisi,\u2019 the court had said that the confirmation was subject to this right, this might have been surplusage, but it certainly would not have changed the effect of the order so as to postpone the running of the period within which the right was to be exercised. We are not convinced that any broader meaning is to be given to the word \u2018nisi,\u2019 unless, perhaps, it was also intended to afford opportunity to file exceptions.\u201d Later in the opinion this language was used: \u201cSo it may be said here that when the court after reading the report made its first order it thereby indicated its approval, but, at the same time, its intention to preserve the parties right of appeal,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>A majority of the members of this court find no difficulty in holding that in township road cases the confirmation nisi is a decree which furnishes sufficient ground for an appeal to the common pleas by any person aggrieved thereby, and that it may be taken at any time after the confirmation nisi but must, in any event, be taken not later than thirty days after the decree of final confirmation. Support for this conclusion is found in the Act of March 27, 1903, P. L. 83, already referred to as requiring confirmation of the report at the expiration of thirty days from its filing, in the absence of exceptions. It further provides that upon such confirmation the parties to whom an award has been made, \u201cand from whose award no appeal has been taken,\u201d shall be entitled to collect their awards in the manner specified. This act applies, among other things, to an award of damages for the opening of any road. Another act, that of May 10, 1921, P. L. 428, applying to any public improvement, provides for final confirmation at the expiration of thirty d\u00e1ys from the filing of the report \u201cunless in the meantime exceptions to such report, or any portions thereof, have been filed by any party interested, or unless an appeal from such report, or any portions thereof, is taken and demand for a jury trial is made before the expiration of said period of thirty days;\u201d when exceptions or appeals relate only to portions of the report, the portions not affected thereby are to be confirmed absolutely at the expiration of the thirty-day period. Both acts clearly contemplate the taking of appeals before the time for final confirmation has arrived. There is nothing contrary to this view in Mansfield Borough\u2019s Appeal, 158 Pa. 314. That was a road case and the question was whether an appeal taken within thirty days after final confirmation was in time. It was held that it was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>but the writer of the opinion in the court below, upon which the case was affirmed, also said, \u201cI am not clear but that the order of December 9, 1891, [confirmation nisi] might have been considered as a decree of confirmation so far as appeals are concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We accordingly hold that the appeal in this case was not premature and that the court below erred in striking it from the records of the common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The order is reversed, the appeal reinstated and the record remitted with a procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
