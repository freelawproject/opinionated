Accepting Kipling\u2019s pronouncement as true <em>arguendo, </em>the question becomes who received the \u201cfatal overdose,\u201d Bankers or the appellees?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">For the reasons stated <em>infra, </em>we conclude that Bankers\u2019 appeal must fail, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Washington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Effective April 30,1973, Bankers issued an aircraft liability policy to Electro Enterprises, Inc. (Electro) of Hagerstown, Maryland. The policy provided for bodily injury coverage limits in the amount of $1,000,000 for each occurrence and $100,000 for each person. Item No. 7 of the policy contained the pilot limitation set out above <em>ipsissimis verbis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">On March 29,1974, Electro owned a Cessna Model 421 dual control aircraft. The plane left Hagerstown on that date for Scottsdale, Arizona <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> where a business meeting was to take place. There were five persons aboard including Paul Erickson, president of Electro, who was a pilot with a private plane license, Earl G. Bittle, a pilot who held a commercial license, Joseph Urie, Caswell Nuger and Irvin G. Turner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A transcript of a recorded conversation between the pilot of the Cessna and the Air Route Traffic Control Center, Olathe, Kansas revealed that on the evening of March 29, 1974, at 7:19 p.m., the pilot reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201c[Wje\u2019re picking up very heavy icing we\u2019d like to start a route around this please.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>The route around the icing conditions was granted by the Control Center. Three minutes later a \u201cMay day may day\u201d transmission was heard by Control and other aircraft in the area. The distress call was followed by \u2014 \u201cThree one<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (unintelligible) spinning.\u201d No more was heard by the Control Center from the Cessna, but an Ozark Airlines flight radioed that he heard an aircraft report \u201cout of control and spinning in heavy icing....\u201d A ground search was initiated, and shortly thereafter the wreckage of the Cessna was found where it had crashed, in Clark National Forest, near Bunker, Missouri. There were no survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">All the appellees, except Electro, brought suit against the corporate owner of the aircraft. Demand was made by Electro that Bankers defend the actions. Bankers disclaimed coverage on the ground that \u201cat the time of the alleged fatal accident [the plane] was being piloted by Earl G. Bittle, and second pilot, Paul C. Erickson, in direct violation of the .policy contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Bankers, on December 13, 1974, filed, in the circuit court, a declaration for declaratory judgment and petition for injunction as ancillary relief. The declaration was subsequently amended. The matter went to trial before Judge Irvine H. Rutledge and a jury on July 28,1976. A single issue, <em>videlicet, </em>\u201cDo you find that Earl Bittle was actually manipulating the controls of the airplane at the time of the' crash?\u201d, was submitted to the jury on the third day of the trial. The jury answered the issue by the single word, \u201cNo.\u201d Thus, the jury implicitly found that Paul Erickson was the pilot of the ill-fated aircraft at the time of the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Following the jury\u2019s factual finding, Judge Rutledge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201c(1) The words \u201cGoldman <em>and </em>Erickson mean \u201cGoldman <em>or </em>Erickson\u201d, so as to afford coverage if either was the pilot at the time of the ... accident. (2)... [Bankers] is not relieved from defending [the] cases filed against it in related proceedings arising</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUZR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>out of the ... accident. (3) No stay in [the related] proceedings is granted____\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The application for Electro\u2019s aircraft insurance policy was signed on behalf of the company by Paul C. Erickson, its president. Immediately preceding Mr. Erickson\u2019s signature appeared the legend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cAll particulars herein are warranted true and complete to the best of my/our knowledge and no information has been withheld or suppressed and I/we agree that this Application and the terms and conditions of the policy in use by the insurer shall be the basis of any contract between me/us and the Insurer. I hereby authorize this Company to investigate all or any qualifications or statements contained herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The application contained a statement that the aircraft was for \u201cCorporate \u2014 Executive\u201d purposes and would be \u201cflown by professional pilots employed for this purpose.\u201d Additionally, \u201c[o]ther [u]ses not indicated above\u201d were explained by the wording, \u201cPaul Erickson, Pres. \u2014 Student Pilot,\u201d thus clearly showing that Mr. Erickson would also pilot the plane. The application made manifest that \u201cINA declined to write policy with Paul Erickson as a student pilot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">During the course of the three-day trial involving this matter, Bankers sought to introduce the application into evidence. Following a bench conference, which is not recorded in the transcript, an objection to the admission of the application was sustained.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is the declination by Judge Rutledge to admit the application into evidence that Bankers perceives to be reversible error, but, as we have previously indicated, we do not share that point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Maryland has unflinchingly adhered to the theory of the objective law of contracts at least since <em>McKeever v. Washington Heights Realty Corp., </em>183 Md. 216, 220, 37 A. 2d 305, 308 (1944). <em>See also, e.g., Orkin v. Jacobson, </em>274 Md. 124, 128, 332 A. 2d 901, 903-04 (1975); <em>Little v. First Federated Life Ins. Co., </em>267 Md. 1, 5, 296 A. 2d 372, 375 (1972); <em>Slice v. Carozza Properties, Inc., </em>215 Md. 357, 368, 137 A. 2d 687, 693 (1958); <em>Ray v. Eurice, </em>201 Md. 115, 126-27, 93 A. 2d 272, 279 (1952). By \u201cobjective law of contracts,\u201d w\u00e9 mean that the written language of the contract will be determinative of the liabilities and rights of the parties thereto, regardless of the contemplation of the parties, exclusive of fraud, duress or mutual mistake, at the time they entered into the agreement, unless the written language is not open to an unqualified understanding. <em>Orkin v. Jacobson, supra, </em>274 Md. at 128, 332 A. 2d at 903-04; <em>Slice v. Carozza Properties, Inc., supra, </em>215 Md. at 368; 137 A. 2d at 693; <em>Ray v. Eurice, supra, </em>201 Md. at 127, 93 A. 2d at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The objective law rule was trenchantly explicated by Judge Levine in <em>Fasten Constr. Co. v. Rod Enterprises, Inc., </em>268 Md. 318, 301 A. 2d 12 (1973), when he penned for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cThe cardinal rule in the construction and interpretation of contracts is that effect must be given to the intention of the parties, unless it is inconsistent with some established principle of law, <em>Hardy v. Brookhart, </em>259 Md. 317, 270 A. 2d 119 (1970); <em>Cadem v. Nanna, </em>243 Md. 536, 221 A. 2d 703 (1966); <em>Schapiro v. Jefferson, </em>203 Md. 372, 100 A. 2d 794 (1953). But, where a contract is plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>unambiguous, there is no room for construction, and it must be presumed that the parties meant what they expressed, <em>Little v. First Federated Life, </em>267 Md. 1, 296 A. 2d 372 (1972); <em>Kermisch v. Savings Bank, </em>266 Md. 557, 295 A. 2d 776 (1972); <em>Devereux v. Berger, </em>253 Md. 264, 252 A. 2d 469 (1969). And, when the language of a contract is clear, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. <em>U.S.I.F. Triangle v. Rockwood Dev. Co., ... </em>[261 Md. 379, 275 A. 2d 487 (1971)]; <em>Seldeen v. Canby, </em>259 Md. 526, 270 A. 2d 485 (1970); <em>Katz v. Pratt Street Realty, </em>257 Md. 103, 262 A. 2d 540 (1970).\u201d 268 Md. at 328-29, 301 A. 2d at 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The contract in the case <em>sub judice </em>was integrated in the form of the aircraft liability policy issued by Bankers to Electro. Of course, by integrated we mean that the parties adopted the written policy \u201cas the final and complete expression of the agreement. An integration is the writing or writings so adopted.\u201d 1 <em>Restatement of Contracts </em>\u00a7 228 (1932). <em>Ray v. Eurice, supra, </em>201 Md. at 127, 93 A. 2d at 279, states: \u201c... [W]here there has been an integration of an agreement, those who executed it will not be allowed to place their own interpretation on what it means or was intended to mean. The test in such case is objective and not subjective.\u201d Thus, \u201c[i]t follows that the test of the true interpretation of an offer or acceptance is not what the party making it thought it meant or intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 1 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 94 (3rd ed. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The insurance policy in the case now before us contained the following integration clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201c25: Declarations. By acceptance of this Policy the Named Insured agrees that the statements in the Declarations are his agreements and representations, that this Policy is issued in reliance upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>truth of such representations and that this Policy embodies all agreements existing between himself and the Company or any of its agents relating to this insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">When, as here, the language employed in a contract is clear and unambiguous, it is the province of the court rather than the jury to construe the contract. <em>H &amp; R </em>Block, <em>Inc. v. Garland, </em>278 Md. 91, 97, 359 A. 2d 130, 133 (1976); <em>Masano v. Albritton, </em>245 Md. 423, 431, 226 A. 2d 299, 303 (1967); <em>Rothman v. Silver, </em>245 Md. 292, 296, 226 A. 2d 308, 310 (1967); <em>Keyworth v. Indus. Sales Co., </em>241 Md. 453, 456, 217 A. 2d 253, 255 (1966); <em>Ebert v. Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>220 Md. 602, 610, 155 A. 2d 484, 488 (1959). In construing an insurance contract, the court must read the policy as a single document and construe it as a whole. <em>Fed. Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>275 Md. 460, 473, 341 A. 2d 399, 407 (1975). Words are to be given their customary and normal meaning in the interpretation of insurance contracts. <em>C &amp; H Plumbing and Heating, Inc. v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>264 Md. 510, 511-12, 287 A. 2d 238, 239 (1972); <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. v. DeJames, </em>256 Md. 717, 720, 261 A. 2d 747, 749 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Having set out the principles of construction and interpretation applicable to the instant case, we now turn our attention to the first contention raised in this appeal by appellant. Bankers argues that \u201cthe application [for the insurance policy] should have been admitted in evidence [as] ... it was a material means of determining the meaning of words in the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">We have already seen that the insurance policy provides that the aircraft was to be piloted by \u201cPAUL ERICKSON <em>AND </em>WILFORD GOLDMAN.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Bankers would have us construe the conjunction \u201cand\u201d as necessitating that both Erickson <em>and </em>Goldman be at the controls of the plane whenever it was in use in order for coverage under the policy to apply. Bankers then proceeds one more step by asserting that inasmuch as there is doubt, as to the meaning of the insurance contract, the application was properly admissible to explain the intent of the parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>We, however, are unable to trod the same path of reasoning as Bankers. In our view, there is no ambiguity in the insurance contract, either as a whole or in the use of the conjunction \u201cand\u201d in the clause relative to pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Where the court finds no ambiguity in the language of a contract, there is no need to resort to outside aids to its construction. <em>Walker v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., </em>231 Md. 168, 178-79, 189 A. 2d 91,96 (1963); <em>Coopersmith v. Isherwood, </em>219 Md. 455, 460, 150 A. 2d 243, 246 (1959). <em>See also Rice v. Rice, </em>246 Md. 212, 217-18, 227 A. 2d 742, 744-45 (1967); <em>Ensor </em>v. <em>Wehland, </em>243 Md. 485, 492, 221 A. 2d 699, 703 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Neither Judge Rutledge nor this Court perceive any ambiguity in the insurance policy so as to require the admission into evidence of the proffered application.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The conjunction \u201cand\u201d as used in the insurance policy has only one clear and unambiguous meaning to any reasonable person, and that is that \u201cand\u201d was used in the disjunctive sense to mean \u201cor.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The reasoning of Judge Rutledge, we think, is most apropos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\u201cIf the interpretation of the plaintiff is correct, then both Erickson and Goldman would have had to be flying the plane. Although there are dual controls, for two to attempt to fly it would at once spell disaster. If one pilot tried to go right and the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>left, the stronger might prevail or simply impede the other. Two persons in a plane with dual controls are like two persons in a car with dual controls. One or the other can operate, but not <em>both. </em>And the Court will not attempt to intuit what the framers of the policy may have had in mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">But if the policy meant that Goldman ... had to be in the plane with Erickson for the policy to afford coverage, the policy completely fails to say so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In construing \u201cand\u201d to mean \u201cor\u201d under the circumstances of the particular facts presented by this case, we follow the lead of the Court of Appeals in <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Mattingly Lumber Co., </em>176 Md. 217, 4 A. 2d 447 (1939), wherein the word \u201cand\u201d in a contractor\u2019s bond was interpreted to be in the disjunctive as \u201cor,\u201d so as to effectuate \u2022 the intent of the parties to provide indemnity protection to both the labor and the material man, where the surety had agreed to satisfy claims against the contractor \u201cfor all material furnished, installed, erected and incorporated in\u201d the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Violating the old military clich\u00e9 \u201cNever reinforce a failure,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Bankers makes one final sortie. It advocates that \u201c[t]he same strict view of coverage,\u201d which Bankers contends was \u201ctaken\u201d by the Court of Appeals in <em>Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. v. Urner, </em>264 Md. 660, 287 A. 2d 764 (1972), should be applied \u201cwith respect to the policy here.\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. v. Urner, supra, </em>dealt with an aviation policy which covered an aircraft piloted by \u201cGerald E. Weikel holding an FAA Private Pilot Certificate____\u201d When Diane Twigg, a passenger in a plane piloted by Weikel, was killed as a result of an aircraft crash near Fort Ritchie, Maryland on October 10, 1968, Aetna denied coverage. One reason for the denial was that Weikel did not and apparently never had held an \u201cFAA Private Pilot Certificate\u201d or higher. In short, the basic requirement of coverage, the Private Pilot license, was the missing ingredient that voided coverag\u00e9. We believe <em>Urner </em>to be inapposite to the case at bar. If, however, <em>Urner </em>can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>said to apply to the instant case, it is by way of strengthening the position of the appellees. Rather than traveling the route of <em>Urner, i.e., </em>private license to student pilot, Erickson went from student pilot to licensed private pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We hold that the Circuit Court for Washington County properly construed the aircraft policy issued by Bankers to Electro.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-11\">.

To obtain his private pilot\u2019s license, F.A.A. regulations required Erickson, as a student pilot, to fly an airplane alone for at least twenty hours. 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.109 (1977). The regulation was in effect, without revision, during 1973-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">As appellee points out, if Bankers\u2019 position were correct,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">\u201cErickson would not have been covered by the policy for the solo flights required by Federal regulations or which Bankers ..., an aviation insurer, must have been aware, nor for any flight after he received a private or more advanced license. To accept... [Bankers\u2019] argument would be to inject into the policy a requirement that Erickson, who had obtained a student license for the purpose of attaining more advanced qualifications, was prohibited from pursuing the higher levels of skill and certification for which he was training and studying.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Such a result would, we think, be not only agonistic but patently contrary to the manifest intention of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\">.
