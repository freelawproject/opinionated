The record discloses that late on the afternoon of August 16, 1973, Alton Vann, Sr. (Vann), the appellant, launched himself on his daily swim in a placid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>part of Bush River. Vann\u2019s swim was abruptly halted when he was struck by a motorboat. The collision resulted in injury to Vann\u2019s head and right arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">While the plot line is simplicity itself, the details of the narrative lead to considerable complication. Although the offending motorboat was the property of H.E. Koontz Creamery, Inc., (Koontz), it was kept at Bush River for the use and enjoyment of Koontz\u2019s trusted executive employees. Immediately prior to the injury of Vann, the boat was used by one such employee, appellee, Wilbur Willie (Willie), for water-skiing. Willie had just released the tow line so as to \u201cdrop off\u201d near shore when the boat, piloted by Willie\u2019s son-in-law, Richard Varnedoe <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Varnedoe), struck Vann.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">During the three-year period preceding the collision, Willie and through him, Varnedoe had access to the boat and used it. Neither Willie nor Varnedoe ever received more than cursory instructions on operating the boat. Neither had boating experience prior to 1969 or 1970, and they were not familiar with water safety regulations. Furthermore, neither Willie nor his son-in-law ever availed himself of any courses on boating procedure or safety.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The main stage prop in this drama was an Aristocraft 66 fiberglass boat approximately sixteen (16) feet in length and powered by a sixty (60) horsepower outboard motor. At full throttle, the boat was capable of a land speed equivalent to twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) miles per hour. As with any stereotype villain, the vessel bore an identifying scar. Stretching from the top to the bottom of the windshield, just to the right of the helm, forming a jagged line about one-quarter (V*) of an inch wide was a crack. A storm or accident caused the fracture in the windshield sometime in 1969 or 1970. When the crack occurred and continuing thereafter, George C. Oursler, president of Koontz, and another employee, rejected the idea of replacing the windshield. Instead, they had the crack secured by bolts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>nuts, and washers. The washers were described in1 Vann\u2019s brief as being the size of quarters, and they were three (3) or four (4) inches apart, in the right front of the pilot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Oursler testified that the method of repair he chose left the windshield stronger and better able to withstand the bumping action that comes from propelling the boat at high speeds over the wave motion of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The scene now shifts to Alton Vann who, as we have previously noted, was, at the time of the incident, taking his daily late afternoon swim. Vann was habituated to following a set course at approximately the same time each day. Oursler had observed Vann\u2019s swimming on about a dozen prior occasions, but he never warned Vann to stay away from in front of the Koontz property,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor did he alert guests at the Koontz beach house as to Vann\u2019s recurrent jaunts.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">On the day of the happening of the impact giving rise to this litigation, Vann chose to swim a slow crawl,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a stroke in which he brought one arm and then the other out of the water, with his face submerged on the stroke with his right arm but turned out of the water in order to breathe when he raised his left arm. His kick was a flutter under water. While swimming, Vann noticed a boat on the same side of the river on which he was swimming, but he paid no attention. He did not check again to see what course the vessel was following, although he did occasionally look up to get his bearings. Vann told the jury that he never heard the sound of the boat motor.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The record shows that both Vann and Varnedoe were oblivious to the sight and sound of Mrs. Varnedoe, Mrs. Willie and Mrs. Haas (Mr. Haas was at that time the observer in the boat),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> frantically waving and yelling in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>attempt to alert Vann and Varnedoe that they were in danger of hitting each other. Varnedoe said that he noticed his wife running along the pier gesturing and calling out, but he did not think her behavior particularly unusual. The women saw that the boat and the swimmer were on a collision course with the distance between them rapidly closing. The parties could not agree, however, on whether the swimmer was out beyond \u201cthe safety point.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In any event, their attempts to signal the parties amounted, in the end, to a charade with both boat and swimmer being stumped as to its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Ignorant of the Maryland Agency Rules and Regulations, Title 08, Department of Natural Resources, Rule 08.04.22<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> mandating that when water-skiing the towing boat must not be within one hundred (100) feet from shore, piers, bridges, people in the water, or passing other boats, Varnedoe operated the boat as close as twenty-five (25) to forty (40) feet from piers north of the Koontz property. Rule 08.04.22 contains an exception not applicable to the case <em>sub judice, </em>and that is that it is permissible for \u201ca person . . . [to] begin skiing on land or shore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">After Willie had released the tow line, Varnedoe cut back on the throttle, put the gear shift in neutral, and turned sharply to starboard, <em>i.e., </em>toward the center of the river. While in the midst of the starboard turn, Varnedoe felt \u201ca bump.\u201d He had not seen anyone in the water, nor did he realize that he had struck Vann until the boat stopped and he heard a yell. Varnedoe then saw Vann and jumped overboard so as to assist Vann in making his way to shore. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>An ambulance was called and Vann was transported to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Subsequently, Vann brought suit against Varnedoe, Willie and Koontz. After a series of pleadings and demurrers, the case finally went to trial before Judge Edward D. Higinbothom and a jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County on Vann\u2019s fourth amended declaration. At the close of the evidence presented by Vann, Judge Higinbothom directed a verdict in favor of all defendants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">On appeal to this Court, Vann raises seven (7) issues for our review. He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201c1. The evidence of the condition of the windshield of this boat as it had remained for several years with the irregular crack held together by a number of nuts, bolts, and large washers was sufficient to submit to the jury the question whether it was unsafe for proper vision and lookout through that part of the windshield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">2. Maritime Law does apply to this collision and operation of this boat on the navigable waters of the Bush River, so that the jury could have found that the Appellee Koontz provided an unsea worthy boat and/or crew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">3. Also, if question 1 is answered affirmatively, there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the negligence of the Appellees, or at least the Appellee Koontz, for negligent entrustment of an unsafe boat to Varnedoe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">4. There was also sufficient evidence to submit the negligence of the Appellees, or at least the Appellee Koontz, to the jyry for negligent entrustment of this boat to those not properly trained to operate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">5. There was evidence from which the jury could find that the Appellee Willie was liable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>negligence of Varnedoe as bailee from Koontz in charge of this boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4K\">The Trial Court erred in excluding the testimony of the Appellee Willie at the District Court hearing on the charge against Varnedoe that \u2018It is certainly our fault that we could not see him.\u2019 and later \u2018It\u2019s no excuse why we did not see him.\u2019 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM9\">The Trial Court erred in sustaining Demurrers to the Fourth Amended Declaration claim for punitive damages against Koontz arising out of negligent entrustment of this boat with the cracked, repaired windshield to those not trained in the safe operation of a boat.\u201d 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Issues one (1) through six (6) are all interwoven with a common thread, namely, an attempt by Vann to reach Koontz on the theory of negligent entrustment. In order to do so, Vann asserts that the mere allowing of the use of the boat with its cracked windshield was negligent. He then couples to that hypothesis that Varnedoe was an inexperienced boat operator, completely lacking in training. Vann stresses that Varnedoe received no schooling on boat safety or the watermen\u2019s \u201crules of the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Our review of the record discloses that despite the valiant effort of Vann\u2019s counsel to elicit testimony that the crack in the windshield prevented Varnedoe from seeing Vann in the water, his effort fell short of the mark. Of the four witnesses who testified regarding the cracked windshield, not one of them said that the crack or the bolts and washers materially impaired the vision of the operator. Vann\u2019s attorney sought to have the trial court and this Court take judicial notice \u201cthat an object right in one\u2019s line of vision a couple feet away distorts vision beyond.\u201d To bolster his contention, he seeks to have us employ \u201c[a] simple test of holding a pencil or coin at arm\u2019s length from the eyes.\u201d Such a test, he says \u201creveals two images of that object, if the viewer is looking beyond the object, or, upon looking at the object, reveals two images of the background.\u201d Counsel then asserts that, \u201cThe testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>was that the head of the pilot was 2 or 3 feet from the windshield. Thus, the operator attempting to keep a lookout through the windshield to the water beyond would see 2 images of each large [quarter size] washer and the crack as he looked through that area of the windshield.. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">We do not know of any rule of evidence which would permit us to conduct experiments and then take judicial notice of the result. Furthermore, the entire windshield was quite expansive in comparison to the area of the crack, and there would appear to be nothing that impaired vision through the uncracked portion of the windshield. Even with respect to the cracked area, the washers were four (4) or five (5) inches apart, so that there was no unbroken obstruction to vision. More important, however, is the uncontradicted testimony of witnesses produced by Vann that the crack in the windshield did not materially interfere with their ability to see through the windshield. That a similar crack in the windshield of a Koontz truck would require replacement, Md. Ann. Code Art. 66V2, \u00a7\u00a7 11-1104 (c) and (d) (Repl. Vol. 1970), does not mean that the crack in the windshield of the boat also requires that the boat windshield must be replaced. The legislature has not seen fit to address itself to that subject and the rules and regulations of the Department of Natural Resources do not prescribe replacement of a cracked windshield.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Aside from the \u201csimple test\u201d regarding the pencil, Vann urges that we hold that a photograph, depicting the vessel with its cracked windshield secured by bolts and washers, was sufficient evidence to take the case to the jury. Patently, he invokes the Chinese proverb that, \u201cOne picture is worth more than ten thousand words.\u201d The difficulty with Vann\u2019s position is that the \u201clive\u201d witnesses called by Vann said that the cracked windshield did not materially interfere with their vision, and Vann may not use the photograph so as to impeach his own witnesses and simultaneously create a jury issue. Thus, negligent entrustment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which is grounded on the loaning of a defective chattel was not proven because the \u201cdefect\u201d in the chattel was not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We note that while Varnedoe was not schooled in boating safety or operation,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> he did successfully run the boat for three (3) years, apparently without incident. The fact that he did not receive formal training in boat operation does not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>under existing law, give rise to a rational inference that his ability to operate the boat was somehow so wanting as to involve \u201cunreasonable risk of physical harm to himself and others.\u201d 2 <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 390 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We' turn now to a discussion of whether the law of admiralty applies to a collision between a sixteen (16) foot pleasure craft and a swimmer. We do so, because, if it does apply, the standard for measuring the unseaworthiness of the Koontz vessel would be quite different than that of ordinary negligence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Traditionally, admiralty jurisdiction has encompassed \u201call waters, salt or fresh, with or without tides, natural or artificial, which are in fact navigable in interstate or foreign water commerce, whether or not the particular body of water is wholly within a state, and whether or not the occurrence or transaction that is the subject matter of the suit is confined to one state.\u201d Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>Admiralty </em>29 (1957); Note, <em>Pleasure-Boating and the Admiralty Jurisdiction, </em>10 Stan. L. Rev. 724, 725 (1958). <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Admiralty Jurisdiction Over Pleasure Craft Torts, </em>36 Md. L. Rev. 212, n. 2 (1976). This definition has been applied to actions involving boats and adequately embraces bodies of water such as Bush River. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Historically, the determinative test of admiralty jurisdiction has been a simple locality test. <em>The Plymouth, </em>70 U. S. (3 Wall.) 20, 18 L. Ed. 125 (1866).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>The Plymouth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>was interpreted by many to mean that if the tort was committed on navigable waters it was within the admiralty jurisdiction. <em>See Victory Carriers, Inc. v. Law, </em>404 U. S. 202, 205-06, 92 S. Ct. 418, 421-22, 30 L.Ed.2d 383, 387-88 (1971), and cases cited therein, <em>rehearing denied, </em>404 U. S. 1064, 92 S. Ct. 731, 30 L.Ed.2d 753 (1971). Recently, however, the Supreme Court decided that its language in <em>Plymouth </em>does not mean what it seems to say,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that there is nothing magical about navigable waters. The locality test is not the sole determinant of maritime jurisdiction. Retreating from the mystical attraction of the navigable water site, the Court, in <em>Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, </em>409 U. S. 249, 93 S. Ct. 493, 34 L.Ed.2d 454 (1972), held, unanimously, that in addition to the locality test, there must be shown some connection with \u201ctraditional maritime activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 93 S. Ct. at 501, 34 L.Ed.2d at 463. In <em>Executive Jet, </em>the Court had before it a fact pattern involving a plane crash into Lake Erie. The crash was caused by some seagulls becoming ingested into the plane\u2019s jet engines with a resulting \u201calmost total loss of power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 93 S. Ct. at 496, 34 L.Ed.2d at 457. The owner of the aircraft, Executive Jet, invoking federal admiralty jurisdiction, sued the City of Cleveland in a United States District Court, which dismissed the action. Mr. Justice Stewart, writing for the Court, noted that the locality test was conceived in 1813 by Mr. Justice Story, on Circuit, in <em>Thomas v. Lane, </em>23 F. Cas. 957, 960 (No. 13, 902) (CC Me. 1813), at a time when it was difficult to imagine \u201ca tortious occurrence on navigable waters . . . [except those involving] a waterborne vessel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 93 S. Ct. at 497, 34 L.Ed.2d at 459. The Court then said that it had \u201cnever explicitly held that a maritime locality is the sole test of admiralty jurisdiction. The last time the Court considered the matter, the question was left open. <em>Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, </em>234 U.S. 52, [34 S. Ct. 733, 58 L. Ed. 1208] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>(1914).\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 258; 93 S. Ct. at 499, 34 L.Ed.2d at 461. The Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201cIn sum, there has existed over the years a judicial, legislative, and scholarly recognition that, in determining whether there is admiralty jurisdiction over a particular tort or class of torts, reliance on the relationship of the wrong to traditional maritime activity is often more sensible and more consonant with the purposes of maritime law than is a purely mechanical application of the locality test.\u201d 409 U. S. at 261, 93 S. Ct. at 501, 34 L.Ed.2d at 463.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Thus exits <em>The Plymouth </em>litmus paper locality test as the sole test for ascertaining when admiralty jurisdiction exists in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Since the decision in <em>Executive Jet, </em>the test is whether there exists some nexus between the tort and traditional maritime activity. If there is such a bond, admiralty law applies. In the absence of the link, however, admiralty law does not apply, and the case is governed by the law of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Save for those small pleasure craft used in charter service, motorboat owners and operators have no discernible commercial or maritime interests to protect. <em>Executive Jet </em>makes manifest that admiralty jurisdiction necessitates a connection \u201cwith traditional maritime activity.\u201d The Court, in <em>Executive Jet, </em>indicated, without deciding, that such activities as swimming and waterskiing are not within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>scope of \u201ctraditional maritime activity.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Drawing on the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale that a maritime nexus test is required to cover those situations \u201cwhere the invocation of admiralty jurisdiction seems almost absurd,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 93 S. Ct. at 498, 34 L.Ed.2d at 460, the Fourth Circuit echoed the Supreme Court\u2019s disapproval of decisions holding claims by injured swimmers and waterskiers against owners and operators of towing motorboats within the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts. <em>Richards v. Blake Builders Supply Inc., </em>528 F. 2d 745 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Crosson v. Vance, </em>484 F. 2d 840 (4th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Therefore, although we think Vann met the requisites of the erstwhile locality test, neither he nor either of the appellees was engaged in any \u201ctraditional maritime activities.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> While swimming and waterskiing may be pleasurable pursuits performed in or on water, they cannot be said to fall within the ambit of \u201ctraditional maritime activity\u201d as that phrase is employed in <em>Executive Jet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In our view, the law of admiralty has no application to the case <em>subjudice, </em>and Vann\u2019s allegation of unseaworthiness of the Koontz boat must fail. It follows that the directed verdict on Vann\u2019s unseaworthiness claim was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We agree with Judge Higinbothom that Willie\u2019s testimony in the Maryland State District Court at the trial of Varnedoe should not have been permitted to go to the jury. Consequently, we reject Vann\u2019s argument that Willie was liable, as bailee from Koontz, for the negligence of Varnedoe, his son-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The evidence clearly shows that Willie had \u201cdropped off\u201d from the tow line prior to the boat\u2019s striking of Vann. Moreover, the skier, as was Willie, is not the operator of the boat, and unless he falls or lets go of the tow line, he is pulled wherever the operator chooses to steer the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>We have already seen that there was no evidence presented which would demonstrate that Varnedoe had displayed any prior signs of negligent or careless operation of the vessel so that Willie\u2019s permitting Varnedoe to pilot the craft was certainly not a negligent act. The main point that Vann makes is that his counsel wanted to inform the jury in opening statement that Willie \u201chad made an admission before the [District] Court at another hearing arising out of the same accident ... to the effect that he [Willie] and Mr. Varnedoe were at fault for not seeing Mr. Vann ..., and that he also admitted that there was no excuse why we did not see him, we still should have seen him.\u201d Counsel for each defendant objected. Among the reasons assigned for the objections were 1) the transcript was incomplete because of inaudible portions of the recording from which it was transcribed; 2) Vann\u2019s testimony was unavailable because of the inaudible portion of the record; 3) Willie was not in the boat at the time of the incident and since the only allegation against Willie was negligent entrustment, the statement would have no bearing upon that issue; 4) Willie\u2019s utterance could not be used to bind Varnedoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Judge Higinbothom refused to permit Vann\u2019s attorney to \u201cmake any reference to the District Court hearing or statements of Mr. Willie at that time.\u201d We perceive no error. We agree with the trial judge that inasmuch as Willie was sued on the basis of negligent entrustment/ his \u201cadmission\u201d against Varnedoe\u2019s interest was inadmissible. Moreover, it was, under the circumstances of the case, no more than a conclusory opinion. Furthermore, the transcript of the hearing was never offered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In the light of what we have discussed, it is unnecessary for us to consider the remaining issues posed by Vann.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-17\">.

Trucks were not registered until 1905, and buses were first registered in 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The Department of Natural Resources reports that there were, in 1976, 130,072 boats registered with it. That figure does not include an additional 7,000 boats of five (5) tons or over that have been documented by the Coast Guard. In addition, boats from Delaware, Virginia, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia regularly ply Maryland waters. There is, as yet, no statute regulating the licensing of boat operators nor is there any requirement that boat owners or operators undergo any type of formalized training before setting forth upon the water. Our policy seems to follow the 1670 English proverb that, \u201cIn a calm sea every man is a pilot.\u201d In short, if you can buy, rent, borrow or beg a boat, you are free to operate it upon Maryland tidal waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Rule 08.04.11 of the Maryland Agency Rules and Regulations, Title 08, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Department of Natural Resources, provides that equipment requirements for motor boats are governed by the federal regulations \u201cset forth in the Boating Act of 1940\u201d as amended in 1958. Significantly, the federal regulations do not require a windshield. They are concerned primarily with fire control and running lights.
