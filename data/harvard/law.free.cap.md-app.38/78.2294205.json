He also asks whether that court further abused its discretion by refusing to allow him to \u201cengage in discovery\u201d before ruling on his motion to set aside the judgment. We do not believe that the court\u2019s discretion was abused in either instance, and therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The case arises from the following circumstances. On July 20, 1976, Realty Growth Investors, appellee, sued appellant, Robert S. Bounds, James B. Caine, and Harbor Mile Limited Partnership Number One Bayside (Harbor Mile). It alleged that appellant, Bounds, and Caine were the sole general partners of Harbor Mile; that Harbor Mile had made a promissory note for $1,500,000 payable in ten annual installments of $150,000 each, with interest at 6% per annum; that appellee had purchased the note; and that $418,908 was then due and owing. Thus, it asked for judgment in that amount against each of the defendants \u2014 the partnership and its three general partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Filed with the Declaration was appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The motion was supported by a copy of the note, which was attached as an exhibit to the Declaration, and an affidavit of F. L. Wilson, Jr. The affidavit was in proper form, on personal knowledge, and attested both to the gross indebtedness under the note and to the claim that $418,908, plus per diem interest, was then due and owing on it. The note was signed by the three individual defendants as \u201cGeneral Partners\u201d named in the Limited Partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The docket entries reveal, and appellant does not dispute, that on July 28, 1976, he was duly served with a copy of the Declaration, Writ, note, motion, and affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The defendant Caine filed an answer to the Declaration and the motion in which he admitted the indebtedness but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>contested the amount alleged to be then due and owing. Appellant did not file a responsive pleading. On September 3, 1976, appellee filed, and served on appellant, a Notice stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cTake notice that unless you make your defense to the Motions for Summary Judgment served upon you, and filed in these proceedings, within the time allowed by law a rule of civil judgment will be answered against you. If you assert a defense, the motion may be heard by the Court any time after the 23rd day of September, 1976, in accordance with Maryland Rule 610.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Appellant made no response; and, on October 26,1976, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and entered judgment against appellant in the amount of $400,217.41.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">On November 26, 1976, appellant filed a motion to set aside the judgment. In support of the motion, he filed an affidavit in which he alleged that (1) he was only a \u201cnominal general partner\u201d, (2) he took no active part in the operations of the partnership, (3) he became a general partner only because of his availability to sign partnership papers, and (4) after being served by the sheriff, he was advised by his partner, Bounds, \u201cnot to be concerned\u201d because officers of the plaintiff (appellee) were also investors in the venture and \u201cwould see to it our interests were not jeopardized.\u201d The affidavit states that the affiant was competent to testify, but does not state that he had personal knowledge of the substantive facts alleged in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">On December 13, 1976, appellee filed a lengthy answer to this motion, supported by a number of counter-affidavits. Eight days later, December 21, the clerk notified all parties that a hearing would be held on appellant\u2019s motion on February 24, 1977. Two days before the hearing, appellant filed an affidavit of Herbert A. Callihan, Jr., an attorney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>raising questions about the dealings between Robert Bounds and others and the partnership. The next day, appellee responded with a motion ne recipiatur addressed to this new affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">At the hearing on February 24, the court denied both appellee\u2019s motion ne recipitaur and appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment. The judge stated that he had read the entire file, and was acting essentially on the following bases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">(1) Appellant was clearly a general partner, and therefore liable for the partnership debt. He is presumed to have known what that status entailed when he agreed to accept it, and is now bound by this act. <em>Cromwell v. Sharon Bldg. Assoc., </em>220 Md. 317 (1959).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">(2) There was nothing in appellant\u2019s motion or affidavit to show a meritorious defense against appellee. \u201cThere is no statement that he has paid [the note]. There is no statement that it isn\u2019t due and owing. There is no statement that the amount is wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">(3) The claims made by appellant with respect to the activities of his partners and others may support an action against them, or a complaint to one or more regulatory agencies, but had nothing to do with his obligation on the note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">After the court had announced its decision and the reasons for it, appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court to hold the ruling in abeyance in order to permit appellant to \u201ctake discovery\u201d. He did not indicate what type of discovery he wanted. The court rejected the request, stating that from what the court had read and heard, \u201cthere is no way for you to discover anything that would create a meritorious defense against the holder of the note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">With this background, we may now consider appellant\u2019s allegations of abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">Maryland Rule 625 provides that \u201cfor a period of thirty days after the entry of a judgment, or thereafter pursuant to motion filed within such period, the court shall have revisory power and control over such judgment.\u201d After 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>days, the judgment becomes enrolled, and the court\u2019s revisory power is limited to cases of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The judgment in question here was entered on October 26, 1976. Appellant\u2019s motion to set it aside was filed November 26, 1976, which was <em>31 </em>days after entry of the judgment. However, as the thirtieth day, November 25, was Thanksgiving, a legal holiday, by virtue of Maryland Rule 8 b. the motion is considered to have been filed within the thirty day period and thus subject to the court\u2019s broad revisory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The applicable standard in this situation was set forth in <em>Clarke Baridon v. Union Co., </em>218 Md. 480, 483 (1958), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201cAfter the judgment properly was entered, the question of whether it should or should not be vacated in whole or in part was within the sound discretion of the trial court for the ensuing thirty days. The decisive point no longer was whether there existed a genuine dispute as to a material fact, but rather whether the court was satisfied that there had been shown a reasonable indication of a meritorious defense or other equitable circumstances that would justify striking the judgment \u2014 that is, whether the court entertained a reasonable doubt that justice had not been done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The \u201creasonable indication of a meritorious defense\u201d must come, if at all, from the two affidavits filed in support of appellant\u2019s motion, since no other evidence of such a defense was produced; and we must therefore focus upon these affidavits \u2014 both their form and their content \u2014 in determining whether the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The revisory power granted by Rule 625 over unenrolled judgments is to be liberally exercised, \u201clest technicality triumph over justice.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Hamilton, </em>242 Md. 240 (1966), <em>cert. den. </em>385 U. S. 924 (1966). But the Rule is not designed to place a defaulting party in a better position after the entry of judgment than he was prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>to it. We do not construe the Rule, or the standard enunciated in <em>Clarke Baridon, </em>to mean that evidence which, if presented prior to judgment, would have been insufficient to defeat the claim, will suffice to require that the judgment be vacated if presented within thirty days after the judgment is entered. If, then, under the applicable law and rules of court, the affidavits in question would have been inadequate to prevent the entry of the judgment, they are inadequate to justify setting it aside. We can best determine whether justice had been done in this case by placing appellant in the same position as he would have been in had the affidavits been filed before October 26, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The posture then was the pendency of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the requirements of Maryland Rule 610 become not only relevant, but determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Maryland Rule 610 a. requires that where a motion for summary judgment is filed with the Declaration, as was appellee\u2019s, it be supported by affidavit. That Rule further provides that, where a motion is required to be supported by affidavit and the opposing party desires to controvert a statement in it, he must file an affidavit or deposition in support of his answer. His failure to do so constitutes an admission, for purposes of the motion, of all statements of facts in the affidavit of the moving party. Rule 610 b. provides that both supporting and opposing affidavits \u201cshall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">It is clear from its face that appellant\u2019s affidavit does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 610 b. Not only does it fail to aver in a positive fashion that appellant had personal knowledge of the statements contained in it, but it actually states that, as to some of its material allegations, he was without knowledge, or was acting only upon \u201cbelief\u201d. Thus, on that basis alone, the affidavit would have been legally defective, and therefore insufficient to defeat summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>judgment. <em>Phelps v. Herro, </em>215 Md. 223 (1957); <em>Mercier v. O\u2019Neill Associates, Inc., </em>249 Md. 286 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Appellant is not helped, in this regard, by the subsequent affidavit of Mr. Callihan. It does not controvert any of the facts alleged in the affidavits filed by appellee and raises no genuine dispute of material fact relevant to appellant\u2019s liability, as a general partner, to appellee. Neither does it aver facts that would support a counterclaim or a defense of set-off. It deals entirely with collateral matters. Moreover, though it recites that it is made upon \u201cpersonal knowledge of the facts herein stated,\u201d it is clear, from their very wording, that many of the substantive allegations, upon which appellant\u2019s claim appears to be based, are made upon supposition and hearsay, rather than personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">It is clear, then, that had these two affidavits and the allegations contained in appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment been before the court prior to October 26, 1976, they would have been insufficient to defeat appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. They stand in no better position at this point. We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to set aside the judgment. <em>Clarke Baridon v. Union Co., supra; Hill v. Lewis, </em>21 Md. App. 121 (1974), <em>cert. denied </em>272 Md. 742 (1974); <em>Brewer v. Mele, </em>267 Md. 437 (1972). <em>Compare Ryan v. Johnson, </em>220 Md. 70 (1959); <em>J. B. Corporation v. Fowler, </em>258 Md. 432 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Appellant\u2019s second contention \u2014 that the court abused its discretion by failing to afford him the opportunity for discovery prior to ruling on the motion to set aside the judgment \u2014 is equally without merit. For one thing, it is based upon an entirely erroneous premise. As noted above, the record shows quite clearly that the request for discovery was not made until <em>after </em>the court had ruled on the primary motion. Moreover, appellant gave no indication of what type of discovery he had in mind or how, in any specific way, it might lead to a meritorious defense. Counsel said only, \u201cif we were able to take discovery, and if we were able to prove an allegation, for instance, of fraud, that Your Honor\u2019s ruling would be different.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the court\u2019s declining to suspend its ruling on appellant\u2019s motion based upon that request made at that point in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">. The discrepancy between the amount claimed and the amount of the judgment apparently arises from the calculation of interest. The amount of the judgment is not in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
