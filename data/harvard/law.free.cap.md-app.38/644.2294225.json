J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Al4\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">A commercial corporation is a legal entity conceived by the mind of man and legitimated by statute for the avowed purpose of achieving a maximum profit with a minimum exposure to liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When such an entity is the parent of multiple offspring in the form of subsidiary corporations, woe unto the creditor who seeks to rip away the corporate facade in order to recover from one sibling of the corporate family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>what is due from another in the belief that the relationship is inseparable, if not insufferable, for his is a herculean task.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In the matter now before us, William E. Dixon and Ernest J. Litty failed in their bid in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to have that court decree that the property and assets of the appellee, The Process Corporation (TPC), were those of Process Incorporated of Maryland (PIM), so that a judgment lien against the latter would be collectable from the former. The appellants also met with an utter lack of success in their efforts to impress a trust upon the property of TPC in favor of the now defunct PIM.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Refusing to accept what to some may have appeared \u201cto be inevitable defeat,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in an effort to salvage their investment, the appellants vigorously assert in this Court that Chancellor William B. Bowie erred in dismissing the amended bill of complaint at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019-appellants\u2019 evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Just as strenuously, TPC asseverates that Judge Bowie was correct in taking the action that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that TPC has the better of it, and we shall affirm the dismissal of the bill. We now explain why we have reached that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The scenario from which this appeal arises is intricate, ofttimes confusing and, yet, probably typical of many present-day land developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">TPC was initially created as an independent body but later became one of eleven (11) known subsidiaries of the parent corporation, PIM.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The objective of PIM was land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>development in various counties of Maryland. The subsidiaries came into being with the view in mind of limiting liability to the particular corporation given life for the purpose of developing a specified tract of land. PIM conducted the management affairs of all its subsidiaries, owned the equipment they used, hired their employees, paid their office rents, and operated the payrolls and unemployment matters. PIM then charged to each subsidiary the expenses PIM incurred on their behalf. The directors were the same for all corporations, and at board meetings, any matters of the various corporations were discussed. Minutes were kept and an undocumented set of bylaws, uniform as to all the corporations, was adopted. The stock of PIM was paid for but not issued \u201cbecause of the neglect of the secretary.\u201d Articles of incorporation for both PIM and TPC were filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In early 1972, John Healey, a law partner of Thomas A. Garland, and a friend and former employee of the appellant, William E. Dixon, contacted Dixon to solicit his investment in a proposed development in Prince George\u2019s County known as Clinton Woods. Dixon, an attorney with extensive experience in land development and real property law, was also chairman of the board and two-thirds stock owner of The Monumental Title Company (MTC). Dixon reviewed the plat, the purchase contract, and the construction estimates. Although Dixon was \u201cnot too much interested in who ... [Clinton Woods] was titled to,\u201d the purchase agreement and option revealed that the contract was between TPC and the Ryland Group Incorporated. Dixon declined to invest in the Clinton Woods project.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Sometime in late November or early December of 1972, Healey once again contacted Dixon. The contact concerned the acquisition and development of a large tract of land located in Charles County and known as Maxwell Hall. Healey needed $150,000 by the end of December to purchase, engineer, and rezone a 384 acre parcel known as the Chaney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>tract, which comprised but a portion of Maxwell Hall. Dixon was interested in the venture and contacted his friend,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the appellant, Litty, who had previously financed a real estate development undertaking. Litty, the owner of the Leimbach Construction Corporation, agreed to participate and to finance the venture from surplus corporate funds so that he could convert ordinary income into capital gains and thus avail Leimbach of a tax advantange. In furtherance of the venture, Dixon and Litty formed a partnership known as Benedict Associates, whose goal was to conduct the transaction and to divide the profits \u201c50-50.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Under the relevant terms of the transaction, the Chaney tract was to be purchased by Garland (the president of PIM and TPC) acting individually as trustee <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the partnership of Benedict Associates. PIM agreed to repurchase the Chaney tract from the partnership within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">A meeting was held at the offices of PIM in Columbia, Maryland in order to discuss the development, financial details, and to close the deal. Dixon, worried that the funds to repurchase the Chaney tract would not be available within the one year period, testified that he was reassured by Garland that \u201c[w]e own the [Clinton Woods] property,\u201d and that it would generate the cash necessary to repurchase the Chaney land from the partners. According to Dixon,, throughout the complex negotiations and discussions of the various development projects under way, everything was referred to as being the projects of \u201cProcess.\u201d Dixon and Litty both told Judge Bowie that they believed one corporation, \u201cProcess,\u201d was the owner and developer of all the real estate projects. They said that it was never explained to them, and they did not ask whether the corporation they were dealing with, PIM, held title to the Clinton Woods property. Without further investigation or ascertaining who held title to Clinton Woods, the appellants agreed to loan PIM the $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Execution of the Benedict Associates partnership agreement, as well as the loan agreement, including a repurchase option in PIM was on December 27, 1972. PIM, through Garland as president, signed two confessed judgment notes in favor of appellants of $35,000 and $25,000 respectively. The option-loan agreement clearly shows that the transaction was between Dixon and Litty trading as Benedict Associates and PIM. Litty told the court that he did not bother to read the papers, and that he entered into the transaction, trusting in the expertise of his friend and partner, Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">A letter dated December 14, 1973, and bearing the letterhead, \u201cProcess, Incorporated,\u201d was received by Messrs. Litty and Dixon. The content advised the appellants that \u201cProcess Incorporated of Maryland [PIM] exercises its option to purchase the partnership interests ... [the Chaney tract].\u201d Apparently, because of a lack of funds, the repurchase did not materialize. PIM, however, in consideration of a promissory note in the amount of $50,000 payable to Dixon and litty, executed by Garland as president of PIM, obtained a ninety (90) day extension of the December 27, 1972 agreement. Nevertheless, the repurchase was never consummated because of PIM\u2019s fiscal embarrassment, nor were the notes paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Appellants exercised the powers contained in the notes and obtained confessed judgments in the Circuit Court for Charles County against PIM in the amounts of $28,722.83, $40,213.05, and $56,186.17, respectively.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The original judgments were certified to Prince George\u2019s County and entered of record. Following hearings on motions to vacate, the judgments, including accrued interest, were again certified to Prince George\u2019s County and again entered of record as an integral part of appellants\u2019 design to establish that Clinton Woods was actually an asset of PIM.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Dixon related to Judge Bowie that in the latter part of 1974 or early 1975, he conducted a title search wherein he discovered, much to his dismay, that title to Clinton Woods was held by TPC and not PIM. A telephone call to Healey and independent verification by counsel confirmed the existence of PIM and TPC as two separate corporate beings. Meanwhile, MTC, of which Dixon is chairman of the board, conducted settlements on various lots at Clinton Woods. Those settlements, which were preceded by a title search, revealed that TPC held the deed to Clinton Woods. Notwithstanding the settlement\u2019s being conducted by MTC, Dixon disclaimed any knowledge of TPC\u2019s ownership of the Clinton Woods property. MTC\u2019s title abstracters apparently did not show the judgments against PIM as a lien on the TPC property until Dixon directed them to do so. Dixon then undertook to withhold money due TPC and to place it in escrow pending a determination of the true ownership of Clinton Woods. Dixon\u2019s withholding of the funds led to an argument with Garland as president of TPC over whether TPC and PIM were one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The encounter spilled over into the circuit court. There appellants charged that Garland, an officer, director, and stockholder <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of PIM and TPC fraudulently misrepresented that PIM had \u201crecord title\u201d to the Clinton Woods property and that appellants relied on this assertion to their detriment as title was actually held by the subsidiary corporation, TPC. The bill urged that the separate corporate identities of PIM and TPC be disregarded, that the judgment lien against PIM also be imposed on the property of TPC, and, as we have previously stated, that a trust be impressed upon the property and assets of TPC in favor of PIM.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Judge Bowie made it unmistakable that Dixon\u2019s testimony that he assumed the difference in the names TPC and PIM in the title search \u201cwas a typographical error\u201d was \u201cincredulous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Appellants aver that \u201cGarland was the principal, the promoter, the dominating individual in both ... [PIM and TPC]. The corporations were his alter ego.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Ergo, </em>appellants urge that Garland\u2019s domination of the corporations for his personal ends, without regard to their separate corporate identities should not shield TPC from liability in equity for the actions of PIM. That argument is better tailored to fix individual liability upon Garland rather than to hold PIM and TPC liable for representing and acquiescing to the false representation that PIM owned and operated the Clinton Woods property when in fact it was an asset of the subsidiary TPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The Court of Appeals has indicated that in an appropriate case it will hold liable in equity the \u201calleged chief actor\u201d of the perpetration of a fraud \u201caccomplished through the medium of a corporate fiction\u201d where the principal actor \u201cis asserted to have dominated and controlled the intervening corporate entities and, through that domination and control, to have accomplished his personal ends and enterprises.\u201d <em>Crocker v. Pitti, </em>179 Md. 52, 58, 16 A. 2d 875, 877 (1940). <em>See also William Danzer &amp; Co. v. W. Maryland Ry., </em>164 Md. 448, 457, 165 A. 463, 466-67 (1933). <em>Crocker </em>is inapposite for at least three reasons: One, Judge Bowie stated he \u201cfelt that there was not one iota of fraud in the case\u201d; two, it is patent that the chancellor did not believe that appellants relied upon any misrepresentation by Garland that PIM owned Clinton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Woods; three, assuming, arguendo, the truth of appellants\u2019 claim that they were ignorant of the existence of TPC, that TPC was a subsidiary of PIM and that TPC owned Clinton Woods, then TPC could not be a conduit through which appellants and PIM dealt. Under appellants\u2019 own argument, TPC was neither the \u201calleged chief actor\u201d in the purported perpetration of a fraud, nor was TPC an intervening corporate entity on whom they reasonably relied to their detriment in contracting with PIM.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u201cWhen the business corporation is born, the lawyer is the midwife who brings it into existence; while it functions he is its philosopher, guide and friend; in trouble he is its champion, and when the end comes and the last sad rites must be performed, the lawyer becomes the undertaker who disincorporates it and makes final report to the Director of Internal Revenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The Court, in <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Raymond Concrete Pile Co., </em>141 Md. 67, 118 A. 279 (1922), believed the \u201cinstrumentality rule\u201d was applicable. That case involved an action against Bethlehem Steel to recover for the death of an employee caused by the negligent operation of a train owned by a railroad company which was controlled by and almost exclusively owned by Bethlehem.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">On appeal, the Court ruled that the trial judge\u2019s grant of appellee\u2019s prayer that recovery could be had against Bethlehem if the deceased was killed by a train being operated \u201cby persons in the employ of or subject to the control of\u201d Bethlehem was erroneous. The error was caused by the trial judge\u2019s reference to the word \u201ccontrol\u201d which might have led the jury to believe that control could be established simply through ownership of the railroad\u2019s stock. After an examination of the \u201cinstrumentality rule,\u201d the Court said that in order to hold the steel company liable the jury should \u201cbe required to find that the railroad company was merely an instrumentality or adjunct of the steel company, or something to that effect....\u201d 141 Md. at 86, 118 A. at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Unfortunately, the \u201cinstrumentality rule,\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as with many other guiding legal principles, is not given to a hard and fast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>definition. It has, however, been summarized in 1W. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 43 (rev. perm. ed. 1974). There it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">\u201c[T]he corporate entity is disregarded ... wherein it is so organized and controlled, and its affairs are so conducted, as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit, or adjunct of another corporation. The control necessary to invoke what is sometimes called the \u2018instrumentality rule\u2019 is not mere majority or complete stock control but such domination of finances, policies and practices that the controlled corporation has, so to speak, no separate mind, will or existence of its own and is but a business conduit for its principal.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">That the parent corporation owns the subsidiary, <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Raymond Concrete Pile Co., supra </em>at 81, 118 A. at 284, or the stock is held by one person, does not justify a disregard of the corporate entity. <em>Carozza v. Fed. Fin. &amp; Credit Co., </em>149 Md. 223, 238, 131 A. 332, 338 (1925); <em>Quinn v. Quinn, </em>11 Md. App. 638, 648, 276 A. 2d 425, 430 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Courts have considered various alternative factors in determining whether the subsidiary constitutes a mere instrumentality of the parent corporation. Some of those alternatives are expressed in Annot., 7 A.L.R.3d 1343, 1355 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">\u201c(1) the presence in both corporations of the same officers or directors; (2) common shareholders; (3) financial support of the subsidiary\u2019s operations by the parent; (4) underwriting the incorporation and purchase of all of the capital stock of the subsidiary by the parent corporation; (5) the fact that the subsidiary was organized with a grossly inadequate capital structure; (6) a joint accounting and payroll system; (7) the subsidiary lacks substantial business contacts with any save the parent and operates solely with assets conveyed by the parent corporation; (8) in the financial statements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>parent, the subsidiary is referred to as a division of the parent corporation or obligations are assumed to be those of the parent; (9) the property of the subsidiary is used by the parent corporation as its own; (10) the individuals who exercise operating control over the subsidiary exercise it in the interest of the parent; and (11) failure to observe the formal requirements attributable to the operation of a subsidiary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>See also </em>H. Henn, <em>Law of Corporations </em>\u00a7 148 (2d ed. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Garland, the president and a director of both PIM and TPC, testified that the directors for the corporations were the same, the stock of PIM was paid for but not issued, PIM owned all the equipment used by its subsidiaries, hired their employees, rented their offices, operated their payrolls and unemployment matters, and managed their affairs. At meetings of the boards of directors, inferentially, of PIM,.the business matters of the various corporations were discussed. Separate board meetings for TPC were not held.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Dixon and Litty testified that Garland asserted that the Clinton Woods property was owned by \u201cProcess,\u201d without specifying that he was referring to the subsidiary TPC, of whose very existence appellants claimed total ignorance at the time of the December 1972 agreement. We think there was legally sufficient evidence to cast doubt as to the separate corporate identities of PIM and TPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Appellants\u2019 invocation of the \u201cinstrumentality rule\u201d nevertheless, avails them naught as Maryland law is crystalline \u201cthat the corporate entity will be disregarded only when necessary to prevent fraud or to enforce a paramount equity.\u201d <em>Bart Arconti &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Ames-Ennis, Inc., </em>275 Md. 295, 312,340 A. 2d 225, 235 (1975). <em>See Damazo v. Wahby, </em>259 Md. 627, 633, 270 A.2d 814, 817 (1970); <em>William Danzer &amp; Co. v. W. Maryland Ry., supra </em>at 457, 165 A. at 467; <em>Carozza v. Fed. Fin. &amp; Credit Co., supra </em>at 238, 131 A. at 338; <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Raymond Concrete Pile Co., supra </em>at 81, 118 A. at 284; <em>Quinn v. Quinn, supra </em>at 648, 276 A. 2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>430. In <em>Bart Areonti, </em>the Court, absent evidence of fraud or similar conduct, refused to \u201cpierce the corporate veil\u201d so as to hold liable, in addition to Areonti, the principals of that company, and two other corporations controlled by the same principals. Even though all three corporations had commingled their equipment, operated out of one place of business belonging to Areonti, permitted Areonti to become dormant while the affairs of the other two corporations improved simultaneously, made personal loans to the principals and transferred insurance policies to them. 275 Md. at 309, 340 A. 2d at 233-34, Judge Levine, writing for the Court, pointed out that there was no finding of fraud or paramount equity and that it was error to go behind the corporate fiction absent such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Similarly, Chief Judge Northrop, in <em>Gordon v. SS Vedalin, </em>346 F. Supp. 1178, 1181 (D. Md. 1972), applying the Maryland rule, refused to slash through the corporate screen and hold a shareholder liable, in the absence of fraud or the necessity of protecting a paramount equity, for the corporation\u2019s obligation to purchase a vessel. Judge Northrop noted that \u201cthere was significant doubt from the evidence that the legal niceties of corporate existence, such as the formal issuance of stock and corporate meetings, were regularly, if ever, observed,\u201d but filing of the articles of incorporation with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation satisfactorily established the existence of the corporation as a separate entity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Judge Bowie expressly found that there was no fraud and that no paramount equity was present in the case <em>sub judice </em>which required the intervention of equity\u2019s awesome powers. We are unable to say that his findings on the evidence were clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086. We perceive, in the record, no justification for the disregard of corporate identity. <em>Bart Arconti &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Ames-Ennis, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Appellants maintain that \u201cthe court erred in granting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>motion to dismiss\u201d because it applied \u201cthe wrong burden of proof to the evidence.\u201d Appellants take issue with the trial judge\u2019s requiring that they demonstrate by \u201cclear and satisfactory\u201d proof that there was a fraud, rather than allowing them to show fraud by a preponderance of the evidence. Judge Bowie did not err. This Court, after a thorough study of the cases on point, <em>Peurifoy v. Congressional Motors, Inc., </em>254 Md. 501, 517, 255 A. 2d 332, 340 (1969); <em>Bachrach v. Washington United Coop., Inc., </em>181 Md. 315, 321, 29 A. 2d 822, 825-26 (1943); <em>Rent-A-Car Co. v. Globe &amp; Rutgers Ins. Co., </em>161 Md. 249, 267-68, 156 A. 847, 855 (1931), concluded in <em>Loyola Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Trenchcraft, Inc., </em>17 Md. App. 646, 659, 303 A. 2d 432, 439 (1973), that the law of Maryland mandates that \u201cproof of fraud in a civil action, either in law or in equity, must be \u2018clear and convincing.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also First Nat'l Bank of S. Maryland v. United States Fidelity and Guar. Co., 275 Md. 400, 411, 340 A. 2d 275, 283 (1975); Garris v. Dickey, </em>22 Md. App. 618, 630, 325 A. 2d 156, 164 (1974); <em>Goodman v. Poland, </em>395 F. Supp. 660, 686, n. 17 (D. Md. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Appellants have not persuaded us that we were wrong in <em>Loyola, </em>and we reject their urging to overrule that case and establish a lesser burden of proof where fraud is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">We make clear that the rule of law in this State is that no matter how flimsily woven is the corporate curtain, it may not be flung aside except to prevent fraud or enforce a paramount equity. <em>Bart Arconti &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Ames-Ennis, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">While not alleged in the bill nor pressed at trial, appellants advance the contention that the evidence had shown that a constructive fraud had been perpetrated upon them. Appellants asserted in this Court that the evidence viewed, as must be in the posture of the case before Judge Bowie, Md. Rule 535, in the light most favorable to them, exhibited fraud, either actual or constructive. What appellants overlook is that they elected to call Garland as an adverse witness pursuant to Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-113, and his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>completely eroded that of the appellants. Garland\u2019s testimony was not contradicted nor impeached, and, hence, it was binding upon the appellants. <em>Gross v. J &amp; L Camping &amp; Sports Center, Inc., </em>270 Md. 539, 548-49, 312 A. 2d 270, 276 (1973); <em>McClearn v. Southeast Concrete Co., </em>253 Md. 135, 137-38, 251 A. 2d 896, 898 (1969); <em>Nizer v. Phelps, </em>252 Md. 185, 203-04, 249 A. 2d 112, 122-23 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Appellants imply that the chancellor did not consider their argument relative to constructive fraud and estoppel. We think that implication to be ill founded. Judge Bowie made manifest in his oral opinion that \u201cno fraud\u201d was shown by appellants, and that he had not \u201cseen anywhere in the evidence, anything to justify the [c]ourt [in] declaring a paramount equity in their behalf....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Appellants seem to be advocating a rule of law which would permit relief in constructive fraud or estoppel cases upon the production of evidence amounting in quantum to a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">We fail to see why constructive fraud should require a lesser degree of proof than actual fraud because allegations of either seek the same end result. Indeed, if the former could be proved by a lesser standard than the latter, it would seem that the overwhelming majority of cases in which a form of fraud is alleged would be brought on the theory of constructive fraud so as to minimize the burden carried by the alleger. <em>See generally </em>37 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Fraud and Deceit </em>\u00a7 469 (1968); 37 C.J.S. <em>Fraud </em>\u00a7\u00a7 94, 114a (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Judge Bowie, as we have previously stated, found that the appellants had shown \u201cno fraud.\u201d We interpret that unqualified finding to include \u201cconstructive\u201d as well as \u201cactual\u201d fraud. There being no clear and convincing proof of either type of fraud, the appellants failed to meet the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Interwoven with appellants\u2019 argument relative to constructive fraud is the averment that the appellee is estopped from asserting as a defense the separateness or isolation of TPC from PIM because of Garland\u2019s supposed misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>3 J. Pomeroy, <em>A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a7 804 (5th ed. 1941), defines equitable estoppel as \u201cthe effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed, either of property, of contract, or of remedy, as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse, and who, on his part, acquires some corresponding right, either of property, of contract,, or of remedy.\u201d (Footnote omitted.). <em>See Pearre v. Grossnickle, </em>139 Md. 1, 8-9, 114 A. 725, 728 (1921); <em>Rodgers v. John, </em>131 Md. 455, 462, 102 A. 549, 551 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Whether the doctrine is to be applied in a given case is dependent solely upon the particular facts and circumstances of that case. <em>Rodgers v. John, supra </em>at 462, 102 A. at 551. Unless the party against whom the application of the doctrine is sought has been blameworthy \u201cof some unconscientious, inequitable or fraudulent act of commission or omission upon which another has relied and been misled to his injury, the doctrine will not be applied.\u201d <em>Id; Pearre v. Grossnickle, supra </em>at 9, 114 A. at 728-29. <em>See also Savonis v. Burke, </em>241 Md. 316, 319-20, 216 A. 2d 521, 523 (1966); Bayshore Indus., Inc. v. Ziats, 232 Md. 167, 176, 192 A. 2d 487, 492 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Judge Prescott (later Chief Judge), for the Court, in <em>J.F. Johnson Lumber Co. v. Magruder, </em>218 Md. 440, 448, 147 A. 2d 208, 212 (1958), added, as a condition precedent to the availability of equitable estoppel, <em>reasonable diligence. </em>Where the one who claims the aid of the doctrine of estoppel has not acted with such diligence, equity will afford him no relief. <em>Savonis v. Burke, supra </em>at 320, 216 A. 2d at 523; <em>Rupp v. M.S. Johnston Co., </em>226 Md. 181, 190, 172 A. 2d 875, 880 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The two obvious answers to appellants\u2019 attempt to apply the doctrine of estoppel to. the facts of the instant case are: 1) The trial judge, as finder of fact, did not believe on the basis of appellants\u2019 evidence that there was an \u201cunconscientious, inequitable or fraudulent act of commission or omission\u201d on the part of Garland which misled Dixon and Litty to their detriment. From review of the record, we are unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>declare that Judge Bowie\u2019s findings, bottomed upon the evidence, were clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086. 2) Appellants failed to illustrate that they exercised <em>reasonable diligence </em>to protect themselves from what they perceive as the wrong about which they presently lament. In fact, the appellants may well have demonstrated their lack of diligence through the testimony of the appellant Dixon and Daniel Kammer, a vice-president of the Union Trust Company. The transcript reveals that in the early part of 1972, Dixon was approached by Healey and offered the opportunity to invest in Clinton Woods. The information supplied to Dixon by Healey disclosed that the contract for the development was between TPC and the Ryland Group, Inc. Dixon examined the contracts and declined to invest. Mr. Kammer testified that his bank did business with TPC and that a check made by the counsel for the bank at its request disclosed the existence of PIM and TPC as two different corporations. Moreover, an inference may be drawn from the evidence that MTC\u2019s \u201cfree lance\u201d title abstracter considered PIM and TPC as two distinct corporations inasmuch as he did not list the appellants\u2019 judgment against PIM as being a lien on the TPC property, known as Clinton Woods. Dixon, being a seasoned title expert and real property attorney, as well as a developer of land, could have easily and quickly ascertained the name of the titleholder to Clinton Woods. We think the chancellor correctly held that appellants had not demonstrated a paramount equity necessitating the scuttling of the barrier of corporate protection to satisfy the disillusioned creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Finally, appellants aver that TPC carried on business under other titles and designations, namely, \u201cProcess\u201d and \u201cProcess, Incorporated,\u201d or \u201cProcess, Inc.,\u201d in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 2, \u00a7 18. That statute requires \u201c[a]ny person or persons, engaged in any mercantile, trading or manufacturing business as an agent or agents, or doing business in any name or under any title or designation other than his or their own names,\u201d to file a certificate with the clerk of the circuit court and with the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Assessments and Taxation \u201cdisclosing, the true and correct name or names ... of the principal or principals or true owner or owners of the said business.\u201d Section 20 of the same article grants additional protection in cases of failure to file the certificate provided for in \u00a7 18, to \u201cany person or corporation who -shall become a creditor of such person or persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The manifest purpose of the quoted \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 20 of Article 2, the Agents and Factors Act, is to protect creditors from the misleading machinations of persons engaged in \u201cmercantile, trading or manufacturing business[es]... under ... other than his or their own name or names----\u201d <em>See Mundon v. Taxicab Co., </em>151 Md. 449, 455, 135 A. 177, 180 (1926). As we see it, the word \u201cperson\u201d as utilized in both \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 20 reasonably includes \u201ccorporation.\u201d Md. Ann. Code art. 1, \u00a7 15. Neither section, however, affords appellants any support in the instant case inasmuch as the evidence does not establish an agency relationship between PIM and TPC. Moreover, none of the corporate entities, <em>see </em>n. 5, <em>supra, </em>is engaged in a \u201cmercantile, trading or manufacturing business\u201d within the ambit of Md. Ann. Code art. 2. The ostensible purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 18 to 20 is to protect the rights of agents\u2019 creditors who finance the agents\u2019 purchase of inventory. <em>See In re Lexington Appliance Co., </em>202 F. Supp. 869, 871-72 (D. Md. 1962); Stiller, <em>Inventory and Accounts Receivable Financing: The Maryland Maze, </em>18 Md. L. Rev. 185, 224-25 (1958).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Appellants would have us impose upon all corporations with subsidiaries the additional duty of registering their corporate names pursuant to the \u201cAgents and Factors Act.\u201d By so doing, we would add an elasticity to the language of the \u201cAgents and Factors Act\u201d that would permit its being stretched far beyond the purpose intended by the General Assembly.
