Imagine then the grief of Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the owner of that tax base, when, five months after trial of the matter had been concluded, Baltimore County expressed a desire to intervene in the case \u201cin order to present evidence and file briefs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">That\u2019s what this case is about. On October 29,1976, the Tax Court said that the county could not intervene; and to make matters worse, in the county\u2019s eyes, on the same day, the Tax Court affirmed a $25.6 million reduction in Bethlehem\u2019s assessment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Aggrieved in the truest sense (i.e., in the purse), the county appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>with an allegation that the Tax Court\u2019s action in denying the county\u2019s petition to intervene was arbitrary, capricious and illegal. It asked that both orders of the Tax Court be reversed, and that the case be remanded to the Tax Court \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with the right of Baltimore County to intervene, present evidents [sic] and make argument.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The Circuit Court correctly framed the question before it: did the Tax Court, by failing to allow Baltimore County to intervene, abuse its discretion? <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After summarizing the arguments on both sides of the issue, the court found that \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d it must grant the relief requested by the county. The \u201cmost compelling reason\u201d for this, it said, was that the Tax Court failed to state any reasons for its decision on the petition to intervene, which rendered it impossible to determine whether or not it abused its discretion. From this action of the circuit court, Bethlehem has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We reverse the order of the Circuit Court, as we do not believe the Tax Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">We begin, as the Court of Appeals began in <em>Comptroller v. Diebold, Inc., </em>279 Md. 401 (1977), \u201cby noting that judicial review of decisions of the Maryland Tax Court is severely limited.\u201d Md. Annot. Code, art. 81, \u00a7 229 (o) provides that, on appeal, the circuit court \u201cshall determine the matter upon the record made in the Maryland Tax Court [and] shall affirm the Tax Court order if it is not erroneous as a matter of law and if it is supported by substantial evidence appearing in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Thus, the Court in <em>Diebold </em>stated at 407:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">\u201cWe have held that the standard by which a result reached by the Tax Court is reviewed is whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion which that agency reached, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>Fairchild Hiller Corp. v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>267 Md. 519, 521, 298 A. 2d 148, 149 (1973). The application of this test need not and must not be either judicial fact finding or a substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">It was incumbent upon the circuit court, therefore, to look to the record in the Tax Court. The mere failure of the Tax Court to state the reasons for its decision as to intervention does not, of itself, require reversal if the record discloses substantial evidence supporting the decision; and thus, what the circuit court considered the \u201cmost compelling reason\u201d for its action would not, of itself, justify that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The record shows that the cases reached the Tax Court on November 7, 1975, on an appeal by the Supervisor of Assessments for Baltimore County from the action of the Baltimore County Property Tax Assessment Appeal Board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issues centered around the questions of (1) whether, and to what extent, the property assessed was personal rather than real, and (2) whether fair and adequate depreciation had been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Trial was held on March 81,1976, at which four witnesses testified and seventeen exhibits were admitted. The principal evidence of valuation came from the testimony and appraisal report of Sherwood S. Vermilia. Mr. Vermilia had made a complete appraisal of the Bethelehem property for Baltimore County in 1953, updated it in 1960 and 1973, and was under contract with the county to make semi-annual appraisals of all additions to and changes in the Bethlehem plant. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>appraisal report \u2014 twelve volumes covering over 1,000 buildings and more than 100 miles of rail \u2014 was introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The court stated at the conclusion of the hearing that \u201cit was an excellently presented case.\u201d At the request of counsel, the Supervisor was permitted two weeks to file a post-trial memorandum, and Bethlehem was allowed to file a reply memorandum within a week thereafter. The record shows that such memoranda were filed on April 19, and April 28, 1976, respectively. Nothing further transpired, except for court consideration of the mass of evidence before it, until September 8, 1976, when the county filed its petition to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The county alleged that it had not received notice of the proceedings and did not learn of them until it received an application for a refund of 1973-74 taxes from Bethlehem in \u201cJuly, 1976.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The full story, it said, was not revealed until the county\u2019s inquiry, prompted by this application, was answered by the Attorney General\u2019s Office on August 12, 1976. The delay between August 12 and September 8, was not explained in the petition. Bethlehem objected to the petition, and asserted that the county had \u201cactual notice\u201d of the proceedings by virtue of the facts that its checks for taxes from 1973-1976 were marked \u201cPAID UNDER PROTEST,\u201d a letter from the County Office of Finance acknowledged such taxes to be paid under protest, and the principal witness in the case \u2014- Mr. Vermilia \u2014 was under contract with the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The Tax Court held a hearing on the county\u2019s petition on September 29, 1976. The proceedings were not transcribed, but the record shows that the court had before it the county\u2019s petition, Bethlehem\u2019s answer, the county\u2019s reply to Bethlehem\u2019s answer, accompanied by a memorandum of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and various affidavits, letters, checks, and other documents relating to when the county knew or should have known about the proceedings. Its written order, dated October 29, 1976, recites these pleadings and states that, \u201cthe Hearing having been held and the matter considered ... Baltimore County\u2019s Petition to Intervene be and the same is hereby DENIED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The issues before the Tax Court in terms of the county\u2019s intervention were clearly presented by the pleadings and undoubtedly amplified at the hearing. There is nothing hidden or mysterious about them. The Court had to balance the county\u2019s undisputed interest in the outcome of the case against the inconvenience of reopening it five months after the evidentiary hearing had been concluded, four months after final memoranda had been filed, and two months after the county admittedly had notice of the proceeding. This is clearly a matter that involves the exercise of discretion; intervention is neither compelled nor forbidden as a matter of law. There was evidence before the tax court from which, if believed, the court could have reasonably concluded that the county was put on notice of the proceedings as early as April, 1976.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Whether, given the same facts or considerations, we, or the circuit court, would have struck the balance in favor of intervention is not relevant. We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the Tax Court, or conclude that its decision was either erroneous as a matter of law or unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The county seeks assistance from <em>Montgomery Co. v. Supervisor, supra, </em>275 Md. 58, in which, it says, the Tax Court allowed Montgomery County to intervene in \u201can equivalent situation.\u201d That case is of no help to the county, because the situation there was not \u201cequivalent.\u201d The principal difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>was that the county\u2019s petition to intervene in that proceeding was filed <em>before </em>the hearing on the merits, and not five months after it. The issue before the Court of Appeals, in any event, was not whether the Tax Court was correct in allowing the county to intervene, but whether, having allowed formal intervention, the county was entitled to participate in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">This case would not likely have arisen before 1973. Until then, the county supervisor of assessments was a county employee, paid by the county.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> His knowledge was the county\u2019s knowledge, and his actions were on its behalf. In 1973, the General Assembly, as part of a general revision of the assessment laws, made the supervisor and his assistants State employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> His actions are no longer those of the county. He serves a different master now, and there is no requirement that he keep his former master apprised of appeals taken from his decisions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This case is the unfortunate result of a lack of communication, <em>both ways, </em>between officials of different governmental entities whose offices are most likely within walking distance of each other. It is unfortunate, but there is no legal justification to disturb the determination of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\n<em>Order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County vacated; case remanded to the circuit court for entry of an order dismissing the appeal of Baltimore County from the orders of the Maryland Tax Court; costs to be paid by Baltimore County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-12\"> Note: <em>Certiorari </em>denied, Court of Appeals of Maryland, March 8, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-13\">. At issue in the Tax Court was the assessment for the 1973-74 tax year.

The relevant statutory provision considered in <em>Diebold </em>was the predecessor of \u00a7 229 (o); but tne Court mentioned the current statute and noted that it is \u201csubstantially similiar\u201d to the one then before it. The differences are essentially stylistic, and not sufficient to create a different standard of judicial review than that stated in <em>Diebold.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\">. There were two parcels involved. Case No. 1063-A concerned 2160 acres, identified as Sparrows Point Plant and Land; No. 1063-B concerned 212 acres identified as Sparrows Point Yard Land and Improvements. The Supervisor had assessed the two parcels, together, at $174,686,360. The appeal board reduced the combined assessment to $149,647,850 \u2014 a reduction of $25,038,510. On November 20, 1975, Bethlehem also appealed to the Tax Court with respect to the assessment qn the Sparrows Point Plant and Land, requesting an additional reduction of $8.9 million. As to that property, therefore, there were cross-appeals. The Bethlehem appeal was noted as Case No. 1072.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. The record shows that the application was dated June 29, 1976, and states that it \u201cis based on those matters currently being litigated in the Maryland Tax Court in the cases of <em>James M.

Barry, Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore County, </em>Case No. 1072.\u201d This application concerned the Sparrows Point Plant and Land property.
