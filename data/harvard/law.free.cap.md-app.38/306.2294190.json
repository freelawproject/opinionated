Both were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder convictions and consecutive five year terms for the handgun convictions. Additionally, terms of ten and five years, respectively, were imposed on each appellant for the attempted robbery and assault convictions, to run concurrently with the life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Appellants contend in this appeal that the trial court erred (1) in denying their motions for separate trials and (2) in admitting extra-judicial statements uttered by Walters which implicated Johnson in these crimes in violation of the rule against the admission of hearsay evidence and the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment; that (3) appellants\u2019 simultaneous convictions for felony murder and the underlying felony violate the fifth amendment prohibition against double jeopardy and (4) appellants\u2019 convictions for assault should merge into their convictions for attempted robbery with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The record reveals that on March 15, 1975, at approximately 8:25 p.m., Ralph Charles Hull was shot and killed while in the grocery store which he operated in Hagerstown, Maryland. During the course of a four day trial, the State elicited the following testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Claudus Barger, who was peripherally connected to the offense, testified that several days prior to the crimes he and several friends, including appellants, drove past the victim\u2019s store. According to Barger, one of his passengers \u201csaid something about it would be an easy place to knock off or something.\u201d Although not certain, Barger thought that Walters had made the remark. Barger also testified, over objection, that between 5 and 5:30 p.m. on the evening of the crimes Walters told him that \u201che was going to pick up Ike and make some money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">It was further revealed that Barger, upon learning that appellants had been arrested, removed a .38 caliber pistol and holster from Walters\u2019 car. Barger removed three live shells and one spent shell from the gun and flushed the shells down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the toilet. The gun was eventually recovered by the Hagerstown Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Lieutenant Paul Mentzer testified that the .38 caliber bullet removed from the victim\u2019s body was discharged from a gun similar to the one that Barger had found in Walters\u2019 car, although the bullet was too mutilated to be positively identified. There was also testimony that Walters was carrying a .32 caliber revolver when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The State produced two witnesses, Stephen Hull and Donald Pitznogle, who identified Johnson at a lineup as being one of the participants in the robbery. Although unable to identify either appellant at the lineup, the father of Donald Pitznogle testified that he saw Johnson flee from the victim\u2019s store carrying a gun, shortly after he had heard a shot emanating from within the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">John Kahl-Winter, when called to the witness stand by the State, testified that he had approached Walters earlier on the day of the shooting and asked him to repay a prior loan. Walters instructed Kahl-Winter to meet him at the Hat Tavern that evening as he \u201cwould be picking up a check at 8:00 p.m.\u201d At the tavern Walters showed Kahl-Winter a .32 caliber revolver and told him that \u201cthis is what I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d Walters also told him that he had just finished \u201cpulling a job\u201d in Damascus for $400 and that he had \u201cpulled a couple\u201d others around town. Later that evening, after Walters had returned to the Hat Tavern, Kahl-Winter once again approached Walters for the money. Walters retorted that \u201c[i]t didn\u2019t go down right, we had to shoot the man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The final witness called by the State was Margaret Shawyer, Johnson\u2019s girlfriend. She testified that Johnson called her on the evening of March 15,1975, at approximately 8:35 p.m. and \u201csounded nervous and his voice was quivering.\u201d Johnson mentioned something to her about a \u201cfight,\u201d although he was vague over the telephone about details. Johnson informed Shawyer that he would \u201chave to leave town for three or four days\u201d and wanted her to come with him. Although she told him that she would be unable to leave Hagerstown, she did comply with his request to pick him up in a taxi. She further testified that during the course of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>telephone conversation Johnson had exhibited anxiety about the police. Upon rendezvousing with appellants at the Hat Tavern, Shawyer stated that Walters rhetorically asked, \u201cWhy does everybody have to be a hero?\u201d; and that Johnson inquired of her how she would feel \u201cif . . . [he] had shot and killed somebody?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In his defense Walters presented several alibi witnesses and attempted to discredit Shawyer\u2019s testimony. Johnson did not put forth a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Appellants first contend that the trial court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in denying their motions for separate trials pursuant to Maryland Rule 735,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201cIf it appears that an accused or the State will be prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment, or by joinder for trial together, the court may order an election or separate trial of counts, grant separate trials of defendants' or provide such other relief justice requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The propriety of the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a severance is measured by the standards we recently articulated in <em>McCree v. State, </em>33 Md. App. 82, 92-93, (1976), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">\u201cAs we stated in <em>Peterson v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 478, at 496:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">\u2018The decision as to whether to grant a severance lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge under Maryland Rule 735, and one of the factors to be considered is the saving of time and expense which unnecessary separate trials would entail. <em>Jennings v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 312. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney proffered and the evidence bore out such a strong probability of a common criminal effort by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>all defendants, including Logan, that the evidence admissible as to one would have been admissible as to all.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cWe see no abuse of discretion. We feel here as we did in <em>Mason v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 130, at 141:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u2018Under the circumstances of this case, where the evidence necessary to convict one of the appellants was the same evidence required to convict all of them, to have granted a severance would have resulted in a multitude of trials and unnecessary expense.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">As in <em>McCree </em>and <em>Mason, </em>most, if not all, of the evidence admitted below would have been admissible in each trial if Johnson and Walters had been separately tried. We do not feel that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a severance in light of the length of the trial \u2014 four days \u2014 and the concomitant expense thereof. <em>McKnight v. State, </em>280 Md. 604 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\"><em>McCree </em>notwithstanding, Johnson argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a severance because it was apprised of possible issues arising under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U. S. 123 (1968), which, Johnson feels, mandated the granting of his request for a separate trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">In <em>Bruton, </em>the petitioner was convicted partially on the basis of a confession given to a law enforcement official by Evans, Bruton\u2019s co-defendant, which not only incriminated the confessor but also incriminated Bruton. Since Evans asserted his fifth amendment right not to testify, Bruton argued that the admission of Evans\u2019 confession violated his right under the sixth amendment to confront all witnesses against him because he was denied an opportunity to cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>examine Evans on the witness stand. <em>See Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400 (1965). In reversing Bruton\u2019s conviction Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">\u201cThis case presents the question, last considered in <em>Delli Paoli v. United States, </em>352 U. S. 232,whether the conviction of a defendant at a joint trial should be set aside although the jury was instructed that a co-defendant\u2019s confession inculpating the defendant had to be disregarded in determining his guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">\u201c[T]he court [below], relying upon Delli Paoli, affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction because the trial judge instructed the jury that although Evans\u2019 confession was competent evidence against Evans it was inadmissible hearsay against peititoner and therefore had to be disregarded in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence.... We have concluded, however, that <em>Delli Paoli </em>should be overruled. We hold that, because of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt, admission of Evans\u2019 confession in this joint trial violated petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. We therefore overrule <em>Delli Paoli </em>and reverse.\u201d 391 U. S. at 123-26.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\"><em>Bruton </em>thus stands for the proposition that the introduction of a co-defendant\u2019s confession to a law enforcement official, which also inculpates his co-defendant, violates the non-confessing defendant\u2019s right to confront all witnesses against him and that said violation cannot be cured by an admonition to the jury not to consider the confession against the non-confessing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The State, in this appeal, adopts the argument advanced by the state\u2019s attorney below that \u201che did not believe <em>Bruton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>would apply in the instant case because he believed <em>Bruton </em>to apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u2018... only to extra judicial admissions made to law enforcement officers where there are two or more defendants, and we have them. These two men were never interrogated. The police didn\u2019t even try to take a statement from them. So, I submit to you there is no <em>Bruton </em>problem ... and if they [statements] would be improper under <em>Bruton, </em>the court wouldn\u2019t permit them. If I thought they were improper, I wouldn\u2019t offer them. But we don\u2019t even have them, we have no testimony or statements which come under the <em>Bruton </em>rule ....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We do not here reach the soundness of the State\u2019s position since, as we shall discuss below, even if the failure to grant a severance in light of alleged <em>Bruton </em>problems was erroneous, such error, in the context of this case, would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">We agree with appellants\u2019 contention that the out-of-court statements by Walters and Kahl-Winter <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were pure hearsay and erroneously allowed into evidence against Johnson <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in violation of the rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements. \u201cHearsay evidence has been defined as \u2018testimony in court of a statement made out of court, the statement being offered as an assertion to show the truth of the matters asserted therein, and thus resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mutyambizi v. State, </em>33 Md. App. 55, 65 (1976), quoting McCormick, Evidence 584 (2d Ed. 1972). Thus, there can be no question that the testimony Johnson complains of was hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">We think it equally clear that it does not fall within any of the established exceptions to the hearsay rule. It is true that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cthe modern cases and text leave no room to doubt the statement that the accepted principle today is that evidence of declarations of a plan, design or intention presently entertained by the declarant is ... admissible when offered as evidence that the design was carried out by acts or omissions of the declarant.\u201d <em>Md. Paper Products Co. v. Judson, </em>215 Md. 577, 591 (1958). <em>See also Bartell v. Bartell, </em>28 Md. App. 180 (1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>278 Md. 12 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The availability of this exception to the hearsay rule is, however, subject to the following caveat when Walters\u2019 out-of-court comments ar\u00e9 offered into evidence against Johnson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cA further related problem is raised when the declarant\u2019s statements tend to prove cooperative actions on the part of others. If those cooperative actions themselves are at issue, there is a significant danger that the jury will use the declarant\u2019s statements as proof not only of the declarant\u2019s actions but also of the cooperative actions by a third person. In effect, the declarant\u2019s statement will be taken as proof of the other person\u2019s intent and as proof that this intent was carried out. For example, in the homicide prosecution of Frank, a witness testifies that on the morning of the killing the victim said, T am going out with Frank tonight.\u2019 While this tends to prove the victim\u2019s acts, it also tends to prove that Frank went out with the victim, a fact very much in issue. Despite the danger that juries will be neither willing nor able to make the distinction, courts have tended to admit the statements in these cases with limiting instructions directing the jury to consider them only on the issue of the declarant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>McCormick, supra </em>at 699.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Since the trial judge did not instruct the jury that Walters\u2019 inculpatory out-of-court statements were not to be considered in assessing Johnson\u2019s culpability, their admissibility is not permitted under the plan, design or intention exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>In <em>Mutyambizi v. State, supra </em>at 66, Judge Liss, speaking for this Court, set forth with approval the following statement from 2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence, \u00a7 272, at 21 (13th ed. 1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">\u201cWhere hearsay evidence has been improperly admitted over the objection of the adverse party, the error will require a reversal if the evidence relates to a material issue or is prejudicial to such adverse party. If the hearsay evidence is neither material nor prejudicial, the error will be ignored, provided that the conviction is amply supported by other competent evidence. Thus, the admission of hearsay evidence will not constitute reversible error where it is merely cumulative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\"><em>See also Johnson v. State, </em>23 Md. App. 131, 136 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Whether the admission of Walters\u2019 out-of-court statements was a violation of <em>Bruton, </em>which we do not decide, or simply a violation of the hearsay rule, our review of the record convinces us that the introduction of the hearsay testimony was harmless \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt, [and] that the error in no way influenced the verdict\u201d rendered against Johnson. <em>Dorsey v. State, supra </em>at 659. Johnson\u2019s girlfriend, Margaret Shawyer, testified that she spoke to Johnson over the telephone shortly after the murder had occurred at which time he \u201csounded nervous\u201d and exhibited anxiety about the presence of the police; that he mentioned something about a \u201cfight\u201d and indicated that he had to leave town for a few days. More importantly, Shawyer testified to Walters\u2019 rhetorical statement, \u201cWhy does everybody have to be a hero?,\u201d as well as Johnson\u2019s fatal query: \u201cHow would you feel if I had shot and killed somebody?\u201d If any doubts remained as to Johnson\u2019s involvement in these offenses, they were dissolved, in our view, by the eyewitness testimony of Stephen Hull, the younger Donald Pitznogle and the elder Donald Pitznogle that they had observed Johnson wielding a gun while participating in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">We agree with appellants\u2019 next contention that the simultaneous convictions and sentences for felony murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>and the underlying felony (attempted robbery with a deadly weapon) violate the fifth amendment prohibition against being twice placed in jeopardy. <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260 (1977). Accordingly, we reverse appellants\u2019 convictions for attempted robbery with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Appellants lastly contend that the convictions for assault merge into their convictions for attempted robbery with a deadly weapon. As this contention was not raised in the court below, it may not be made for the first time here. Maryland Rule 1085; <em>Colbert v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 632 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>Judgments of first degree murder, assault and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, affirmed; judgments of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, reversed; appellants to pay one-half the costs; one-half the costs to be paid by Washington County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-12\">. A hearing was held on Walters\u2019 motion for severance on October 20, 1976, before Judge Stuart F. Hamill. Johnson\u2019s motion was heard immediately prior to trial on February 22, 1977, by Judge Fred A. Thayer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-14\">. Rules 734 and 735 were consolidated into Rule 745, effective July 1, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\">. Appellants refer specifically to Walters\u2019 statement to Barger on the evening of the crimes that \"he was going to pick up Ike and make some money\u201d and to Kahl-Winter\u2019s testimony that Walters related to him at the Hat Tavern at 9:45 p.m. on the evening of the crimes that \u201c[i]t didn\u2019t go down right, we had to shoot the man.\u201d It is patent that the use of \u201cwe\u201d referred to Johnson and Walters (Adam and Green v. State, 14 Md. App. 135, 142 (1972)) and that \u201cIke\u201d was appellant Isaac Newton Johnson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\">.
