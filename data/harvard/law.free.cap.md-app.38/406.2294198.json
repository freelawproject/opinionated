What gives rise to controversy is not the general proposition of mankind\u2019s obligation to provide what is best for the child, but rather, what is best. The theoretical best mankind can provide is not always the best that society, through its courts, can implement. Consistently, the courts of Maryland have endeavored, in custody cases, to look to the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child. <em>See e.g., Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 175, 372 A. 2d 582, 585 (1977); <em>DeGrange v. Kline, </em>254 Md. 240, 243, 254 A. 2d 353, 354 (1969); <em>Kline v.

Godfrey, </em>157 Md. 264, 267, 145 A. 614, 616 (1929). Courts, however, are limited to the framework of that which is available in each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In the case now before us, the Montgomery County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Department of Social Services (MCDSS) and Edwin Owen Sanders, Jr., seek to have us place judicial imprimatur upon the socio-psychological concept of \u201cthe psychological parent,\u201d J. Goldstein, A. Freud, A. Solnit, <em>Beyond the Best Interests of the Child 7 </em>(1973), as <em>the </em>paramount factor in awarding custody. On the other hand, the biological mother, Rebecca Sanders, asks that we reject outright that approach to custody determination. We shall neither sweepingly commend nor condemn the \u201cpsychological parent\u201d concept in custody proceedings, but we expressly limit our holding in the particular circumstances of the case <em>sub judice </em>to declaring that the award to the psychological parent is not in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The child, Christopher Robyn Sanders, was only ten (10) months old when his mother, the appellee, Mrs. Rebecca Sanders, took him, on January 3, 1976, to Walter Reed Hospital for treatment of what she believed to be a viral infection. The hospital records, however, indicate that the actual cause of Christopher\u2019s debilitated condition was a \u201cfractured left clavicle, first left rib fracture, older fracture of right femur, older chipped fracture of left femur, periosteal elevation of the left humerus, multiple bruises, bite mark on left cheek, scratch marks on right .abdomen, and old bruises on the head.\u201d This shocking physical condition of the child prompted the MCDSS to petition the District Court for Montgomery County for Juvenile Causes to declare Christopher a \u201cChild in Need of Assistance.\u201d The petition was filed pursuant to the Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 3-801 (e) (2) (1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Following an emergency hearing on January 26, 1976, the court ordered Christopher removed from his parents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>custody, placed under the jurisdiction of the court, and committed to MCDSS \u201cfor temporary shelter care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On April 26, 1976, an adjudicatory hearing was held, and Judge John C. Tracey found that Christopher\u2019s best interest and welfare would be served by his continuing, temporarily, in his foster home with Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Shepard. At a subsequent dispositionary hearing, July 2, 1976, Judge Tracey reaffirmed Christopher\u2019s commitment to MCDSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Evidence presented at both the adjudicatory and the dispositionary hearings indicated that the appellee, Rebecca Sanders, was not the cause of Christopher\u2019s injuries. Mr. Edwin Sanders, Jr., apparently ignorant of the old maxim, <em>\u201cpatria potestas in pietate </em>debet, <em>non in atrocitate, consisted, </em>\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> admitted biting his son on the face as a disciplinary measure because the infant child had bitten him on the ear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sanders also testified that he may have been too rough in his expressions of paternal affection, which may have resulted in physical injury to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Dr. Frederick Ruyman, Assistant Chief of the Department of Pediatrics at Walter Reed Hospital testified that the cause of the fracture of the left clavicle could have been a severe fall. Similarly, the fractures of the left tibia and humerus could have been caused by Mr. Sanders\u2019 pulling and twisting Christopher\u2019s arm in the course of \u201crough play.\u201d Sanders told the court that although he believed his wife f\u00e1iled to care properly for their son he had never seen her strike or attempt to harm the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">A polygraph test, administered to Rebecca Sanders on February 25,1976, confirmed that she had neither knowledge of, nor was responsible for, her baby\u2019s injuries. Moreover, Mrs. Sanders contradicted her husband\u2019s allegations of neglect and offered evidence that she kept Christopher well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>fed and clothed, and that she never left him unattended for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">During Christopher\u2019s enforced absence in 1976, Mrs. Sanders made a good-faith effort to create an environment for her son which would meet with the approval of MCDSS. She, having moved to Toledo, Ohio, entered a counselling program under the auspices of the Family Services of Toledo. Her counselling sessions were later expanded into a full therapy program. Mrs. Sanders also retained a pediatrician specializing in abuse cases to examine Christopher periodically after his return to her custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Mrs. Sanders\u2019s movement to the home of her parents in Ohio was caused by her separation from her husband in 1976 and resulting severe financial problems. The combined effect of her almost dire financial plight and the fact that she was experiencing a difficult pregnancy <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prevented Mrs. Sanders from travelling to Maryland and visiting Christopher. Nevertheless, inferentially, she telephoned the MCDSS weekly to inquire about her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">On October 15, 1976, appellee filed a \u201cPetition for Change of Placement of Minor Child to the Natural Mother.\u201d At the hearing in January 1977, Mrs. Sanders testified that she was continuing her therapy and was willing to consult additional psychologists or psychiatrists if so ordered by the court. Her expectations concerning Christopher\u2019s homecoming were realistic, and she recognized that a period of adjustment would be involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The record reveals that during her residency in Ohio, prior to the October hearing, appellee completed five (5) courses at the University of Toledo Community College, including one on child development in which she said that she received a grade of \u201cA.\u201d She aspires to attain an associates degree in social service technology. As part of the academic requirements, she has been working with and observing young children. Dr. Robert A. Wilson, Chairman of the Department of Social Behavior at Columbia Union College, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>offered expert testimony, in July 1977, that Mrs. Sanders is capable of putting her newly acquired knowledge on child rearing into practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The appellee is a devout Seventh Day Adventist and has been assisting children under the age of four (4) years in her church\u2019s Sunday school program. Additionally, she has been babysitting the infant son of a friend. Mrs. Sanders has arranged for a babysitter to watch Christopher while she attends classes at the Community College. Efforts have also been made by her to obtain employment and to secure public housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Among the original reasons set forth by MCDSS for opposing transfer of custody back to Mrs. Sanders is the possibility of Christopher\u2019s living with his maternal grandparents, the Bilbys. MCDSS has expressed reservations concerning the suitability of the Bilby home as a temporary shelter for the child. Social Services\u2019 reports characterized Mr. Bilby as nervous, defensive and hostile. Mr. Bilby\u2019s attitude, in light of his strong belief that his grandchild had been unjustly removed from the family unit, is not completely indefensible. The Social Services\u2019 description of Mr. Bilby must also be balanced against the fact that he holds a responsible job as a vocational high school teacher, is deeply concerned over the welfare of his family, and displays no propensity for violence. There is absolutely nothing in the record to cause one to suspect that he would ever harm his grandson. The reports pictured the grandmother, Mrs. Bilby, as a patient, intelligent woman with deep religious convictions. She indicated a willingness to resign her job, a clerical position, in order to spend extra time assisting her daughter in caring for Christopher. The Bilbys have also offered financial aid to their daughter and grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">On petition, the court appointed an attorney to represent \u201cthe best interest and welfare\u201d of Christopher. Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 2-102 (a) (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Review hearings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>were held on June 14, June 15, July 20, and July 28,1977. In the course of the July 20, 1977 hearing, Dr. James Harrell, Chief Psychologist and Coordinator of Mental Health Services for the Montgomery County, Health Department, testified that persons \u201cequally] or more so psychologically distressed\u201d than the appellee function adequately as parents. He rendered no opinion as to which home, the appellee\u2019s or the foster parents\u2019, would prove to be the \u201cbest of possible worlds\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for Christopher.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The hearings before Judge Tracey also disclosed that MCDSS had determined as early as December 1976 that Christopher should never return to his biological mother. It is clear that MCDSS\u2019s determination to oppose Christopher\u2019s return to the custody of his mother was not a reflection on Mrs. Sanders\u2019s culpability, or lack thereof, for her son\u2019s injuries or upon her ability to care for him adequately. The justification for MCDSS\u2019s unbending stand is, as we have previously indicated, the socio-psychological theory called \u201cpsychological parenthood\u201d espoused by Joseph Goldstein, Anna Freud, and Albert J. Solnit,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in their book, <em>Beyond the Best Interests of the Child. </em>Under the \u201cpsychological parenthood\u201d principle, separation from the natural parent for a sufficient length of time saps the bond of love and affection between child and parent while simultaneously forging a strong psychological link which joins the child to a surrogate parent. Under those given circumstances, the surrogate parent becomes the \u201cpsychological parent,\u201d the one to whom the child turns for security, love, and a sense of emotional well-being. After the shift of allegiance by the child to the \u201cpsychological parent\u201d is completed, a return to the biological parent would, theoretically, result in severe emotional trauma, detrimental to the child\u2019s best interests. In the case of a child under five (5) y\u00e9ars of age, such as Christopher, the authors of <em>Beyond the Best Interests of the Child </em>opine that a two (2) month time frame severs forever all psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ties to the natural mother. J. Goldstein, A. Freud, A. Solnit, <em>Beyond the Best Interests of the Child </em>41 (1973). Seemingly, because Christopher was ignorant of that theory, he continued to call Rebecca Sanders \u201cmother\u201d long after the two (2) month deadline had passed. MCDSS apparently arbitrarily changed the time frame to six (6) months instead of the two (2) advocated by Goldstein, Freud, and Solnit. For whatever unexplained reasons, MCDSS chose not to enlighten appellee on either the six (6) or two (2) month theories and their dire consequences. Thus, even if Mrs. Sanders grew and developed into a paragon of motherhood, she still could never reclaim Christopher because of the attachment formed by the infant to the \u201cpsychological parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">When MCDSS presented the theory to Judge John C. Tracey on July 20, 1977, he reacted with caution and skepticism. Judge Tracey said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cTo accept the standard of the \u2018best interest theory\u2019 as presented by the .. . [MCDSS], based upon the book by Dr. Goldstein, Dr. Freud, and Dr. Solnick, [sic] <em>Beyond the Best Interest </em>[sic] <em>of the Child \u2019, </em>without regard to the circumstances for the original taking of the child by the social agency or of the conditions of the mother at that time and during the process of these proceedings, and based solely on the time element to establish the \u2018psychological parents\u2019, after which time, \u2018six months is excessive\u2019 as set forth in the testimony of Dr. Paul Glass, [Chief of the Section of Child Mental Health for the Health Department of Montgomery County] places an impossible burden on any natural parent which may well lead to a disincentive for agencies and foster families to provide a positive program to the natural parents of help and services which could possibly lead to the return of the child to his or her biological parent. To accept as a certainty a theory presented within <em>Beyond the Best Interest </em>[sic] <em>of the Child', </em>knowing the uniqueness of each factual situation, the fragmentation of services offered by ... [MCDSS], the lack of a positive re-enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>program to natural parents in all cases, the present apparent lack of co-ordination of services in these proceedings by the evaluators, the workers, the diagnosticians, and by the Court, would be totally untenable and are not supported by the facts and evidence presented in these proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Judge Tracey then proceeded to return custody of Christopher to his biological mother, the appellee. On August 8, 1977, this Court granted a Stay of Final Order Pending Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Unfortunately, there is no such thing as \u201ca simple custody case,\u201d for as we articulated in <em>Mullinix v. Mullinix, </em>12 Md. App. 402, 412, 278 A. 2d 674, 679 (1971), \u201c[c]ustody cases are like fingerprints because no two are exactly the same.\u201d B. Botein, in his book, <em>Trial Judge, </em>correctly declares, \u201c[a] judge agonizes more about reaching the right result in a contested custody issue than about any other type of decision he renders.\u201d B. Botein, <em>Trial Judge </em>273 (1952). The Court cannot simply appraise both parties and cavalierly Solomonize the child by dividing \u201cthe living child in two, and giv[ing] half to the one, and half to the other.\u201d I Kings 3:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The Supreme Court has termed the right to rear one\u2019s child \u201cessential,\u201d <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U. S. 390, 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 626, 67 L. Ed. 1042, 1045 (1923), and one of the \u201cbasic civil rights of man.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma, </em>316 U. S. 535, 541, 62 S.

Under the early English common law, the <em>paterfamilias </em>was entitled to the custody of his offspring as an absolute legal right regardless of the welfare of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thomas, <em>Child Abuse and Neglect Part I: Historical Overview, Legal Matrix, and Social Perspectives, </em>50 N.C.L.

Unfortunately, there is no litmus paper test that provides a quick and relatively easy answer to custody matters. Present methods for determining a child\u2019s best interest are time-consuming, involve a multitude of intangible factors that ofttimes are ambiguous. The best interest standard is an amorphous notion, varying with each individual case, and resulting in its being open to attack as little more than judicial prognostication. The fact finder is called upon to evaluate the child\u2019s life chances in each of the homes competing for custody and then to predict with whom the child will be better off in the future. At the bottom line, what is in the child\u2019s best interest equals the fact finder\u2019s best guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>What critics of the \u201cjudicial prognostication\u201d overlook is that the court examines numerous factors and weighs the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative environments. <em>See Chapsky v. Wood, </em>26 Kan. at 655, 40 Am. Rep. at 325. The court\u2019s prediction is founded upon far more complex methods than reading tea leaves. The criteria for judicial determination includes, but is not limited to, 1) fitness of the parents, <em>Cornwell v. Cornwell, </em>244 Md. 674, 224 A. 2d 870 (1966); <em>Barnard v. Godfrey, </em>157 Md. 264, 145 A. 614 (1929); 2) character and reputation of the parties, <em>Hoder v. Hoder, </em>245 Md. 705, 227 A. 2d 750 (1967); 3) desire of the natural parents and agreements between the parties; <em>Breault v. Breault, </em>250 Md. 173, 242 A. 2d 116 (1968); <em>McClary v. Follett, </em>226 Md. 436, 174 A. 2d 66 (1961); <em>Colburn v. Colburn, </em>20 Md. App. 346, 316 A. 2d 283 (1974); <em>Davis v. Jurney, </em>145 A. 2d 846 (D.C. Mun. App. 1958); 4) potentiality of maintaining natural family relations, <em>Lippy v. Breidenstein, </em>249 Md. 415, 240 A. 2d 251 (1968); <em>Melton v. Connolly, supra; Piotrowski v. State, </em>179 Md. 377, 18 A. 2d 199 (1941); 5) preference of the child, <em>Ross v. Pick, </em>199 Md. at 353, 86 A. 2d at 469; <em>Young v. Weaver, </em>185 Md. 328, 44 A. 2d 748 (1945); <em>United States v. Green, </em>26 Fed. Cas. 30, 31-32 (No. 15256) (C.C.R.I. 1824); 6) material opportunities affecting the future life of the child, <em>Thumma v. Hartsook, supra; Butler v. Perry, supra; Cockerham v. The Children\u2019s Aid Soc\u2019y of Cecil County, </em>185 Md. 97, 43 A. 2d 197 (1945); <em>Jones v. Stockett, 2 </em>Bland. 409 (Ch. 1838); 7) age, health and sex of the child, <em>Alden v. Alden, </em>226 Md. 622, 174 A. 2d 793 (1961); <em>Cullotta v. Cullotta, </em>193 Md. 374, 66 A. 2d 919 (1949); <em>Piotrowski v. State, supra; </em>8) residences of parents and opportunity for visitation, <em>Rzeszotarski v. Rzeszotarski, </em>296 A. 2d 431, 440 (D.C. App. 1972); 9) length of separation from the natural parents, <em>Ross v. Hoffman, supra; Melton v. Connolly, supra; Powers v. Hadden, </em>30 Md. App. 577, 353 A. 2d 641 (1976); and 10) prior voluntary abandonment or surrender, <em>Dietrich v. Anderson, supra; Davis v. Jurney, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">While the court considers all the above factors, it will generally not weigh any one to the exclusion of all others. The court should examine the totality of the situation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>alternative environments and avoid focusing on any single factor such as the financial situation, <em>Cockerham v. The Children\u2019s Aid Soc\u2019y of Cecil </em>County, <em>supra, </em>or the length of separation. <em>Powers v. Hadden, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">MCDSS, however, contends that in failing to apply the \u201cpsychological parenthood\u201d theory to the exclusion of all else, Judge Tracey abused his discretion. In its well-intentioned zeal to lay down simple, definite criteria for ascertaining a child\u2019s best interest, MCDSS has oversimplified ti.c problem. In effect, MCDSS has devised and advocates a formula based on <em>Beyond the Best Interests of the Child. </em>The adoption of the formula would reduce custody disputes to mathematical certainty. By adding a child\u2019s age to the time spent away from his natural parents, MCDSS arrives at the appropriate custody situs. Thus, in an exercise of basic algebraic principles, <em>A </em>(age) + TTtime) = C(custody), all custody cases are easily mathematically resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">As with many seemingly simple solutions to complex problems, <em>A + T = C </em>is not a panacea. Custody cases involve too many people, conditions, and human emotions to be reduced summarily to a mere mathematical process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The intricacies of the many human relationships that are interwoven into each custody dispute defy the type of simplification proposed by MCDSS.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201cOne may illustrate the essential idea by a spiderweb, pull a strand here, and a complex pattern of adjustments runs through the whole web. Pull another strand from a different angle, and another complex pattern results.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Fuller, <em>Collective Bargaining and the Arbitrator, </em>Wis. L. Rev. 3, 33 (1963). One patent fallacy in the <em>A </em>+ <em>T = C </em>formula is that it leaves no room for adjustments to individual situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">We have previously rejected the notion of examining a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>child\u2019s age and time apart from his natural parents while ignoring every other aspect of the circumstances and personalities involved in the case. <em>Powers v. Hadden, supra. </em>Obviously, the length of time apart is a factor to be considered in weighing the merits of each potential home. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 353 A. 2d at 645.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">\u201c[T]ies of blood weaken, and ties of companionship strengthen, by lapse of time. . . . Consequently, the longer the period of time required for a parent to prove reformation, the less chance he or she has to reclaim a lost child.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Unrestrained application of the \u201cpsychological parenthood\u201d theory can lead to absurd results as evidenced by the views espoused by Dr. Glass in his testimony in the instant case. A hypothetical was posed to the doctor in which a child was removed from his home by kidnappers and kept safe and well cared for by the criminals for an extended period of time. Dr. Glass said that it would be in the child\u2019s best interest to remain with the kidnappers since psychologically they would be his family. While the probability of the average youngster being carried off by kidnappers or gypsies is slight, the instance of natural, adoptive or foster parents fleeing the jurisdiction with a child they have been ordered to relinquish is growing increasingly common.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To allow a person to abscond with a child and then judicially condone the action after a pre-established time period has lapsed is to place a premium on disobedience of court orders and simultaneously to reduce the child to \u201cpersonal property\u201d to which any person can acquire some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>sort of \u201csquatter\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Jeffreys, </em>40 N.Y.2d 543, 552, n. 2,356 N.E.2d 277, 285, n. 2,387 N.Y.S.2d 821, 829, n.2 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201cThe resolution of cases must not provide incentives for those likely to take the law into their own hands. Thus, those who obtain custody of children unlawfully, particularly by kidnapping, violence, or flight from the jurisdiction of the courts, must be deterred. Society may not reward, except at its peril, the lawless because the passage of time has made correction inexpedient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 356 N.E.2d at 284, 387 N.Y.S.2d at 827.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Evidence offered by social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists may be necessary in custody cases. The equity court, however, is entitled to weigh that evidence along with contradictory testimony and its own observations. Reliance upon \u201cthe auxiliary services of psychiatrists, psychologists, and trained social workers ... should not be too obsequious or routine or the experts too casual.\u201d <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. at 191, 372 A. 2d at 594. Such reliance could lead the courts, in acts of misapplied psychology, to separate unjustly family members.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">\u201cParticularly important is this caution where one or both parties may have the means to retain their own experts and where publicly compensated experts or experts compensated by only one side have uncurbed leave to express opinions which may be subjective or are not narrowly controlled by the underlying facts.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Jeffreys, </em>40 N.Y.2d at 549, 356 N.E.2d at 283, 387 N.Y.S.2d at 827.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Caution is particularly apropos in the case <em>sub judice </em>where Mrs. Sanders was financially unable to match the weight of experts brought forth by the MCDSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The appellants stress that Christopher is now in a home offering superior material advantages. Mr. and Mrs. Shepard, his foster parents, appear to love the child and have expressed an interest in adopting him. Judge Tracey, however, was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>clearly erroneous in refusing to award custody to the MCDSS because of Mrs. Sanders\u2019s financial plight. The fact that parents are poor is not itself a reason for placing a child in foster care. <em>Cockerham v. The Children\u2019s Aid Soc\u2019y of Cecil County, </em>185 Md. at 101, 43 A. 2d at 199. Although the foster parents have expressed an interest in adopting Christopher, the trial court had no guarantee such adoption would be consummated. We point out that there is no requirement that the foster parents adopt Christopher, and that there is no assurance that Christopher will remain in the same foster home. To leave him in the \u201clegal limbo,\u201d <em>Bennett v. Jeffreys, </em>40 N.Y.2d at 551, 356 N.E.2d at 284, 387 N.Y.S.2d at 828, of foster care when an adequate, if not utopian, home is offered by the natural mother hardly seems to be in anyone\u2019s \u201cbest interest,\u201d much less the child\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We think Judge Tracey\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, if, indeed, they be erroneous at all. The evidence before the trial judge clearly substantiates Mrs. Sanders\u2019s claim that she was never the abuser, and that although the Sanders\u2019s home may once have been a dangerous environment for Christopher, such is no longer the case. \u201cConditions which might justify relieving a parent temporarily of the custody of his child would not necessarily support absolute and permanent transfer of the child to a stranger.\u201d <em>Roy v. Holmes, </em>111 So. 2d 468, 470 (Fla. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">MCDSS is legitimately concerned with preventing Christopher from once again falling victim to the battered child syndrome. Its concern, however, has been carried to the point of protecting Christopher from a danger that no longer exists.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">\u201c[Sjocial workers sometimes develop \u2018rescue fantasies\u2019 in well-intended efforts to save helpless children from bad parents. These emotions tend to obscure objective evaluations of the strengths of the child\u2019s own home.\u201d Thomas, <em>Child Abuse and Neglect Part I: Historical Overview, Legal Matrix, and Social Perspectives, </em>50 N.C.L.
