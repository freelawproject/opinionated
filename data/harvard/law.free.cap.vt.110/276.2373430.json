'The commission finds, however, that the respondent had no intent to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The report of the commission exonerates the respondent from the charges of violating professional confidence and of representing conflicting interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">It appears, however, from such report that the respondent, while actively participating in the trial of the MeDurfees\u2019 case, became a witness for his clients and-testified to material and disputed matters. Such conduct was contrary to the spirit of canon 19 of the code of ethics of the Vermont Bar Association and to both letter and spirit of canon 19 of the canons of professional ethics of the American Bar Association, as interpreted by opinion No. 50 rendered Dec. 14, 1931, by the committee on professional ethics and grievances. This conduct as well as his carelessness above referred to warrants censure and reprimand by the Court and the respondent is hereby so reprimanded therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>Presentment dismissed with reprimand.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
