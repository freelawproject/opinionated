L. 3401 which provides : \u20181A sheriff or deputy sheriff shall not appear in any court as counsel, nor make a writ,, complaint, answer or other precept or process, except in his own cause. A writ, complaint or other process herein prohibited made by him shall be dismissed and the defendant recover his costs. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">As this is not a proceeding against the one who served this process to determine his right to hold these three offices at the same time, it is unnecessary to comment upon the points raised. No question is made that the officer here had anything to -do with making the writ or process, or that he was not duly appointed and qualified as a deputy sheriff. It is only claimed that he was ineligible to the office. He is, therefore, at least a <em>de facto </em>officer, and his acts in serving this process are valid as between the parties hereto. <em>Fancher </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>61 Vt. 616, 18 Atl. 455, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>Judgment overruling defendant\u2019s plea affirmed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
