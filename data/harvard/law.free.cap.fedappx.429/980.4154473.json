Cir. R. 27(f) and dismiss Willie E. Tatum\u2019s appeal. Tatum opposes. The Secretary replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">Tatum served on active duty from May 1958 to March 1980. In February 2002, Tatum filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs regional office (RO) seeking compensation for a disability resulting from prostate cancer associated with herbicide exposure during his service, and residual disability resulting from surgery and treatment he had undergone for his cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-17\">The RO awarded Tatum a staged rating consisting of a 100% disability rating award through May 2002, and a 10% disability rating effective thereafter based on a medical examiner\u2019s report that Tatum\u2019s condition had improved. The Board sustained the RO\u2019s staged-rating award, which Tatum appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-18\">On appeal, the court set aside the Board\u2019s determination not to award Tatum entitlement to a rating award of higher than 10% after May 2002, and remanded the matter for additional proceedings. In doing so, the court held that the Board did not adequately address whether Tatum\u2019s 100% disability rating should have continued pursuant to applicable regulations based on a local reoccurrence or metastasis or continued treatment for malignant neoplasms.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">The court rejected Tatum\u2019s argument that he was currently entitled to a 100% disability rating award based on an argument that the Department failed to fulfill its obligations under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.105(e) in notifying him that his rating was going to be reduced. The court explained that Tatum\u2019s argument ignored \u00a7 3.105(e)\u2019s clear directive that notice was only warranted when there is a reduction in \u201ccompensation payments currently being made,\u201d and that it was undisputed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>Tatum was not receiving compensation at the time the staged rating was assigned thereby rendering the regulation\u2019s requirement inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The Secretary moves to dismiss Tatum\u2019s appeal from the court\u2019s remand order as non-final. Our review of decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is governed by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. While that statute does not explicitly impose a final judgment requirement, we have nonetheless \u201cgenerally declined to review non-final orders of the Veterans Court\u201d on prudential grounds. <em>Williams v. Principi, </em>275 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2002). <em>Williams </em>establishes a three-part test for deviation from the strict rule of finality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">(1) there must have been a clear and final decision of a legal issue that (a) is separate from the remand proceedings, (b) will directly govern the remand proceedings or, (c) if reversed by this court, would render the remand proceedings unnecessary; (2) the resolution of the legal issues must adversely affect the party seeking review; and, (3) there must be a substantial risk that the decision would not survive a remand, <em>ie., </em>that the remand proceeding may moot the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1364 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Our precedent confirms that to take up a remand order on appeal, the appellant must challenge a remand action that itself would independently violate the rights of the veteran, for example, where a remand would be barred by statute. <em>Compare Joyce v. Nicholson, </em>443 F.3d 845, 849-50 (Fed.Cir.2006) (dismissing appeal from remand order); <em>Jones v. Nicholson, </em>431 F.3d 1353, 1359 (Fed.Cir.2005) (same); <em>Myore v. Principi, </em>323 F.3d 1347, 1351-52 (Fed.Cir.2003) (same); <em>Winn v. Brown, </em>110 F.3d 56, 57 (Fed.Cir.1997) (same) <em>with Stevens v. Principi, </em>289 F.3d 814, 817 (Fed.Cir.2002) (deciding merits of appeal from remand order where veteran challenged court\u2019s authority to remand); <em>Adams v. Principi, </em>256 F.3d 1318, 1321-22 (Fed.Cir.2001) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">This requirement is notably absent here. Tatum does not seek to challenge the basis for remand, but a separate issue \u2014 that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 3.105(e)\u2019s notice obligations erroneously denied him entitlement to a 100% disability rating award effective immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The right to appeal a remand order does not \u2014 despite Tatum\u2019s objections \u2014 hinge on the possibility that a reversal by this court could eliminate the need for a remand to the agency. In <em>Myore, </em>the veteran sought to appeal a remand order in which the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims addressed and rejected the appellants\u2019 contention that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1310(a) cannot be interpreted to deny her dependency and indemnity compensation because of misconduct by the veteran. We dismissed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">The mere fact that the Veterans Court as part of a remand decision may have made an error of law that will govern the remand proceeding \u2014 even one that, if reversed, would lead to a decision in favor of the claimant \u2014 does not render that decision final. Rather, \u2018there must be a substantial risk that the decision would not survive a remand.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">323 F.3d at 1352 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>275 F.3d at 1364).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">We see no sound reason to treat this case differently. Just as in <em>Myore, </em>if Tatum does not obtain all the benefits he seeks before the Board and the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, then Tatum may seek review of the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3.105 on what will then be a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>judgment. We therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">It is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motions are granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
