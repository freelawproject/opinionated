Noreen appeals the final decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) that affirmed the decision of the Board of Veterans Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying his claim for benefits for a lung disorder due to asbestos exposure. <em>Noreen v. Shinseki, </em>No. 07-2514, 2010 WL 4806903 (Vet.App. Nov.19, 2010). We <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-21\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b424-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-23\">Mr. Noreen served on active duty with the United States Navy from January of 1951 through November of 1954. In October of 2003, he filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) for \u201ca lung condition secondary to asbestos disclosure.\u201d <em>Noreen, </em>2010 WL 4806903, at *1. After the RO denied the claim, Mr. Noreen appealed to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-24\">In May of 2007, the Board denied the claim for lack of service connection. <em>In re Noreen, </em>No. 05-36 235 (Bd.Vet.App. May 2, 2007). Central to the Board\u2019s ruling was its determination that the opinion of Dr. Frank Maldonado, the VA\u2019s specialist, was more probative than that of Dr. M. Lahiri, Mr. Noreen\u2019s private treating physician. Dr. Lahiri stated that there was evidence of pleural fibrosis in Mr. Noreen\u2019s lungs and that Mr. Noreen\u2019s exposure to asbestos during his active service more probably than not was the cause of his lung condition. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 5. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>Maldonado, however, concluded that there was no evidence that Mr. Noreen had any asbestos-related lung condition. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The Board credited Dr. Maldonado\u2019s opinion over Dr. Lahiri\u2019s because it found the former to be more comprehensive and to be based upon a more detailed review of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Mr. Noreen appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Veterans Court. As noted, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision; this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">This court\u2019s ability to review a decision of the Veterans Court is limited. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), we may review \u201cthe validity of a decision of the [Veterans] Court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the [Veterans] Court in making the decision.\u201d We have exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under [38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292], and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). However, except to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In its decision, the Veterans Court did not decide any constitutional issue, and it did not interpret any statute or regulation. Rather, the court ruled (1) that the Board\u2019s determination that the VA had satisfied its duties to notify and assist was not clearly erroneous; (2) that the Board properly relied on Dr. Maldonado\u2019s medical opinion; and (3) that the Board provided adequate reasons in support of its decision. Accordingly, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. On appeal, Mr. Noreen does not raise any constitutional issue, any issue relating to the validity of a statute or regulation, or any issue relating to the Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation of a statute, a regulation, or a rule of law. Instead, he challenges the Board\u2019s findings of fact relating to his claimed lung disorder. Mr. Noreen thus presents factual contentions that are beyond the scope of our jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Finally, in his brief, Mr. Noreen states that his claim before the RO included a request for an increased rating for hearing loss. However, it does not appear this issue was raised before the Board or the Veterans Court. As seen, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), we may only review a ruling of the Veterans Court on a matter within our jurisdiction if it was relied on by the court in its decision Moreover, \u201c[a]s a general rule, an appellate court will not hear on appeal issues that were not clearly raised in the proceedings below.\u201d <em>Boggs v. West, </em>188 F.3d 1335, 1337-38 (Fed.Cir. 1999). In any event, Mr. Noreen\u2019s statement in support of the claim (\u201cThe VA\u2019s hearing test documented the increased hearing loss and the claim should have been approved. The noise level on the aircraft carrier was way beyond the safe decibel levels.\u201d) presents factual issues that are beyond the scope of our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Noreen\u2019s appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
