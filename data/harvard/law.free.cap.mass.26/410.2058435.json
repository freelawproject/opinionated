He contended that the purpose of the assignors was to make an equal and equitable provision for the benefit of all their creditors. No other creditor will be injuriously affected by the plaintiffs\u2019 obtaining a share of the trust fund, because the assignors will remain chargeable to him for the unpaid balance of his debt. If the indenture had contained a release of the debts due to those creditors who executed it, and the assignors had attempted, through the influence of hope and fear, to procure a speedy discharge, the plaintiffs might have been resisted successfully, upon the ground that releases were given under an expectation of an augmented dividend, on account of the refusal or neglect of some creditors to become parties within th.e appointed time, or were given through fear of a total loss. The clause respecting the six months had relation to the time when the assignees might be required to divide the trust fund. Time is not generally considered in equity an essential part of the contract, and therefore relief is often given where objections are founded on time only ; particularly where no injury is sustained. He cited <em>Dunch v. Kent, </em>1 Vern. 260 ; <em>Lashley </em>v. <em>Hogg, </em>11 Ves. 602 ; <em>Angell </em>v. <em>Haddon, </em>1 Madd. R. 529.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-8\"><em>Sullivan, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A5J\">\n<em>Per Curiam,.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ao1A\">We are of opinion that the plaintiffs have no right to become parties to the indenture, the six months having expired before they made application for that purpose. The property is assigned, through the trustees, to the creditors who executed the instrument seasonably. Public notice was given, so that all the creditors might have an opportunity of sharing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the trust fund. The plaintiffs had an agent in Boston who had control of this particular demand, and they must have had notice of the assignment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-12\"> See <em>Battles </em>v. <em>Folies, </em>21 Pick. 239; <em>De Caters </em>v. <em>Le Ray De Chaumont, 2 </em>Paige, 490; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Love, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Cressw. 242; <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Hutton, </em>1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 398.
