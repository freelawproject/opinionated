Judgment was given for the defendants in the Common Pleas, upon a statement of facts drawn up by <em>Strong </em>J. <em>of </em>that court, according to the agreement of the parties. The action was brought to recover the amount of a tax assessed on the plaintiff for the year 1826, which he paid after it had been demanded by the collector. The town, on May 15th, 1826, voted the sum of $ 600 to be paid to the Rev. George Morey, and the plaintiff\u2019s proportion of the sum was included in the tax which he paid. The proceedings which led to this vote, on account of which the legality of the tax is questioned, are as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">The selectmen of the town issued a warrant for calling a town meeting on March 6th, 1826, in which the 4th article to be acted upon is the following. \u201c To see if the town will hire a clergyman to assist the Rev. George Morey in his ministerial duties, or take such other measures in relation thereto as they shall see cause.\u201d At this meeting a committee was chosen to confer with Mr. Morey to ascertain if he would dissolve his ministerial connexion with the town, and on what terms, and to report at an adjourned meeting in April.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7-pl-split\">At the adjourned meeting of the town, held April 3d, 1826, this committee reported that they had conferred with Mr. Morey, and they stated certain questions which they had put to him and his answers, from which it appeared that he declined giving up his salary, or relinquishing his ministerial connexion unless his whole salary should be paid during his life, but that he hau no objection to having a colleague settled. At this meeting a committee was chosen to obtain legal advice in rela <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tion to the contract with Mr. Morey, and how far the same is binding on the town, and to report at the May meeting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-3\">A meeting of the town was held on May 1st, 1826, in the warrant for which meeting, the 7th article to be acted on is stated to be, \u201cTo hear the report of the committee respecting the settlement of Mr. Morey, &amp;c. and act thereon as they see cause.\u201d At this meeting it was voted to be the wish of the town to dissolve the ministerial connexion with Mr. Morey. A committee was also appointed to wait on Mr. Morey, to give him an opportunity to make any propositions in relation to a dissolution of the ministerial connexion, and if he made any proposal which the committee should think satisfactory, they were to request the selectmen to call a town meeting to act upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">A meeting of the town was held on May 16th, 1826, in the warrant for which meeting the second article is, \u201c To hear the report of the committee that was chosen to consult with the Rev. George Morey relative to dissolving his ministerial con-' tract with said town, and act thereon as they see cause ;\u201d and the third, \u201c To adopt such measures in relation to their ministerial concerns as may then and there seem expedient, and act thereon as they see cause.\u201d At this meeting the committee reported, that Mr. Morey had agreed to receive $600 as a final compensation for all claims, and to relinquish the ministerial connexion ; they also stated that a gentleman had given them $ 50 to make a part of the 600, in case the town should accept the proposal of Mr. Morey. The town thereupon, after a pie-amble reciting that Mr. Morey had become incapable of discharging the duties of his office by reason of the infirmities of age, and expressing a desire to promote the comfort and welfare of their venerable pastor, voted, \u201c that the town pay the Rev. George Morey the sum of six hundred dollars \u201d in full of all claims for a stipulated salary, and that the committee appointed at the last meeting be authorized to carry this vote into effect and to make a settlement and take a release from Mr. Morey. The town also voted \u201c to grant six hundred dollars to pay Rev. George. Morey and ministerial uses.\u201d. At this meeting the plaintiff attended, and observed to a person present that they did not give Mr. Morey enough; though it did not appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>whether he voted on the question. At a subsequent meeting expressed his satisfaction with the proceedings of the town relative to Mr. Morey, and observed that he should be willing to pay his portion of $ 1000.

George Morey and ministerial uses,\u201d </em>and contended that the warrant, even by relation to former proceedings of the town, did not authorize the vote, within <em>St. </em>1785, c. 75, \u00a7 5. At any rate a part of the $ 600 was granted without any color of legality, viz. the sum of $ 50, which was intended to be covered by the phrase \u201c ministerial uses.\u201d The warrant did not give sufficient notice of the design to <em>grant </em>money, even if it was sufficient to authorize a vote to <em>pay </em>it. The inhabitants might be willing to expend money already in their treasury, though unwilling to make a new assessment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVq\">But the tax was illegally assessed, if the grant was not unauthorized. The rate list did not conform to the requisitions of the statutes. By <em>St. </em>1785, c. 50, \u00a7 8, all county, town, &amp;c. taxes are to be apportioned according to the rules of the last tax act. The last tax act, <em>(St. </em>1823 c. 133,) before May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>1826, . directs assessors to tax \u201c <em>the amount of the income o\u00ed </em>the inhabitants from any profession, handicraft, trade,\u201d &amp;c. The 4th section requires the assessors to set forth in distinct columns how much each person is assessed for polls, and for real and personal estate, and <em>income </em>respectively. The 8th section requires assessors to make their rate lists in the form prescribed at the end of the act, and that form contains a distinct column for income.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-6\">The <em>St. </em>1823, <em>c. </em>138, which the defendants will rely on, applies only to the form of the invoice or valuation, as is manifest from the 3d section, which directs a copy of the lists of assessments <em>and </em>of the invoice or valuation, to be deposited in the assessors\u2019 office, for the inspection of all persons interested, as a means of correcting errors. The invoice alone would have been sufficient for this purpose, if the rate lists were to be in the same form. Besides, this statute, and the general tax act which affects this question, were passed on the same day, and no contradiction is to be raised between them by mere implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-7\">The warrant and the return on it, which are the basis of the grant and of the assessment, should have been recorded, in order to make them admissible in evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-8\"><em>Fletcher </em>and Walcott, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIX\">It was not necessary for the town clerk to record the warrant. <em>St. </em>1785, c. 75, \u00a7 2 ; <em>Thayer </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ars\">The tax assessed upon and collected of the plaintiff, was granted by the inhabitants of the town of Walpole at a meeting held on the 15th of May, 1826, pursuant to a warrant under the hands and seals of the selectmen, dated the 8th of the same month. The grant of the tax was in these words, <em>\u201c </em>Voted to grant 600 dollars to pay the Rev. George Morey and for ministerial uses.\u201d The purpose of this payment to Mr. Morey was, to execute a contract made between him and a committee of the town, in virtue of which he was to discontinue his pastoral relation with the town and exonerate them from any farther expense for his support. This was within the authority of the inhabitants <em>of the </em>town, acting on parochial matters ; there being no incorporated parish within the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>It </em>is objected, that there was no article in the warrant by which the meeting was called, which would justify the vote to grant the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The 2d article in the warrant is, \u201c To hear the report of the committee that was chosen to consult with the Rev. George Morey relative to dissolving his ministerial contract with said town, and act thereon as they see cause.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The 3d article in the warrant is, \u201c To adopt such measures in relation to their ministerial concerns as may then and there seem expedient, and act thereon as they see cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The treaty with Mr. Morey had been going on several months, and all the inhabitants of the town must have been fully aware that an adjustment of the terms of separation had been in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">At the March meeting on the 6th of March, 1826, under a warrant of the 20th of February of the same year, a committee was raised to confer with Mr. Morey on the subject of the dissolution of the contract, and the terms on which it should take place. This proceeding was regular, under the 5th article of the warrant, which was, \u201c To see if the town will hire a cier<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>gyman to assist the Rev. George Morey in his ministerial duties, or take such other measures in relation thereto as they shall see cause.\u201d The committee made report at an adjourned meeting held on the 3d of April, 1826, no agreement having then been made. Whereupon a committee was chosen to consult counsel on the legal effect of the contracts of Mr. Morey.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">At a meeting held on the first day of May, 1826, it was voted, that it was the wish of the town to dissolve the ministerial connexion, and a committee was again chosen to confer with Mr. Morey.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The 7th article in the warrant for calling this meeting is as follows : \u201c To hear the report of the committee respecting the settlement with Mr. Morey, and act thereon as they see cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">This gave sufficient notice of the subject matter, and authorized the vote passed at the meeting, to take measures to dissolve the contract, and the appointment of a committee to bring this matter to a close.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">This committee made an amicable adjustment with Mr. Morey, and their report was made to and accepted by the town at a meeting regularly called, held on the 15th of May. And this proceeding was clearly justified under the second and third articles of the warrant for calling this meeting. And no meeting nor more particular notice was necessary, to authorize the vote for granting a tax for the purpose of executing the contract which had been finally made. \u201c To hear the report of the committee that was chosen to consult with the Rev. George Morey relative to dissolving his ministerial contract with said town, and act thereon as they see cause,\u201d considering the publicity o&lt;\u2019 preceding measures, and the knowledge which must be presumed in the inhabitants, that the terms of settlement were in train, was sufficient to advertise the town that a contract would be reported, and that if accepted, money would be raised to carry it into execution. The tax was therefore legally gianted, and was binding upon all the inhabitants, whether present at or absent from the meeting ; least of all ought the plaintiff to complain, who was present, and, if he did not vote for the tax, declined merely because he thought the sum granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>was too small \u2022 for <em>we </em>cannot suppose he was acting w.bi duplicity upon that occasion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">Whether the tax was legally assessed then, is the remaining question, and in regard to this, it will certainly require some substantial defect to disturb the whole financial concerns of a town for the year; for such must be the effect of adjudging a tax to be void on account of a fault in the assessment. The principal objection, and the only one which has caused any doubt in our minds, is the omission of a column in the tax bill, of income, as distinct from other objects of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">By the particular tax act for the year 1824, which was the last general tax act before the town tax in question, it is required in the 4th section, \u201cthat the treasurer shall require the selectmen or assessors to malee a fair list or lists of their assessments, setting forth in distinct columns against each person\u2019s name, how much he is taxed for polls, and for real and personal estate and income respectively as aforesaid and such list or lists, when completed and signed by them, or the major part of them, to commit to the collector or constable of such town, district, &amp;c. respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">If this act stood alone, there would be no question as to the duty of the assessors in the above particulars, more especially as there is appended to the act a printed form of rate lists to be made by assessors and committed to collectors, which has in it a distinct column for income. The only question then would be, whether a strict adherence to this form, would be essential to <em>the </em>validity of an assessment, or whether it should be considered directory only, <em>so </em>that the omission of it would not avoid the whole tax ; and of this we should entertain some doubt, considering the mischievous effects of avoiding a tax legally granted, and to all appearance fairly assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">But we feel ourselves relieved from determining this point, by the doings of the legislature the same year, and indeed the same session, in which the abovementioned tax act was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">By a general statute passed on the 21st of February, 1824, <em>(S\u00ed. </em>1823, c. 138, \u00a7 1) it is provided, that whenever the treas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>urer shall be directed to send a tax act to the assessors of any town, &amp;c., it shall be his duty to send therewith a suitable number of blanks for invoice and valuation books, <em>in the form hereinafter </em>prescribed, and also suitable and convenient forms of warrants, certificates of assessments for state, town, &amp;c. taxes, and also blanks for tax lists or books, sufficient, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">By the 3d section it is provided, \u201c that a copy of the list of the assessments of all taxes, together with a copy of the invoice and valuation from which such assessment shall be made, shall, before the taxes assessed are committed for collection, be deposited in the assessors\u2019 office, &amp;c. and there to remain, to the end that all persons interested may have an opportunity of examining, and exposing any errors, for the purpose of correction, which may have happened in the assessment of said taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The 4th section enacts, \u201cthat hereafter, the form of an invoice or valuation, with the assessments thereon, to be deposited as aforesaid, shall be substantially as follows.\u201d Then follows the form, having no column for income, but including that, as we must suppose, in the column for personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">And by the 6th section, all acts before passed, so far as they are inconsistent, are repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">It is very difficult to account for the difference in the forms thus provided in the two acts. In the last, the only valuable purpose of particularity is stated as the end and object of the provision. In the first act, the list to be delivered to the collectors is evidently to be a copy of that, which by preceding laws was to be lodged in the assessors\u2019 office. There is nothing by which it can be ascertained which of these statutes was enacted first or last, except the arrangement of chapters, which may have been accidental, or may have been from the secretary\u2019s knowledge of the order in which they were passed. We are inclined to adopt the opinion, that the general act, though passed the same day, should be considered as paramount in authority to the particular act, which is usually copied from preexisting tax acts with little or no variation, and passes without any discussion, being founded upon principles before settled. We cannot suppose that the legislature, in providing regulations for all taxes in future, would hastily omit a provision of the for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>mer acts, if such provision had been deemed essential to the validity of the tax, or would suffer it to be repealed by implication, unless that effect was intended. We cannot suppose that they intended to require that the list committed to the collector, should be more particular than that which was to be recorded, in order that all persons interested might expose errors and have them corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\">We consider then, that a column for income, though useful, is not essential, and that the legislature has in fact authorized lists in the form adopted by this town, by causing to be sent to them this general form. This act is perpetual in its form and its requisitions. The assessors might well suppose that it superseded a particular statute limited in its operation to one year, and that they were released by this general provision - from strictly adhering to forms prescribed in an act wh ch had ceased to operate two years before they were called upon to assess the tax in question. We are all of opinion, therefore, that the tax is not void on account of the omission, and therefore the plaintiff must be nonsuit and the defendants recover their costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\"> See Revised Stat. c. 20, \u00a7 16; <em>Torrey </em>v.
