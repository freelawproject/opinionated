Snell junior, as follows : \u2014 \u201c Westport, March 9th, 1809. Value received, I promise to pay W. White or order 100 dollars, to be paid if I recover of T. Shearman my demands against said Shearman, &amp;c. to be paid when recovered of said Shearman,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATl\">The plaintiff, in his second count, alleged that Snell had no demands against Shearman. In his fourth count, filed under leave to amend, he set out the note, and alleged, that although Snell had demands against Shearman, yet he \u201cnever collected or recovered said demands of said Shearman, nor used proper diligence to recover and collect the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Upon the trial, before <em>Wilde </em>J., the jury were instructed, that it was not necessary that the plaintiff should prove a demand on the testator to collect his demands of Shearman, if they should be of opinion that due diligence had not been used in collecting the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AhR\">White -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, upon the ground that the defendant had not used due diligence, and the plaintiff took a verdict upon the fourth count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVA\">The defendant moved for a new trial, on account of the instruction to the jury. He likewise moved in arrest of judgment, on the ground that judgment could not be rendered on the fourth count, because this count was incompatible with the second ; also, because it was bad and insufficient to found a judgment upon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-7\"><em>Coffin </em>and <em>Battelle, </em>for the defendant,'</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXg\">said, among other things, that if due diligence was necessary on the part of the defendant, it should have been averred to be necessary. In the case of a condition precedent not involving a duty, mere non-feasance does not give a right of action. 1 Chit. PI. 317.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-8\"><em>W. </em>Baylies, <em>Bassett </em>and Spooner, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b25-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AdT\">It is objected that the second count is founded on a tort, but it is in assumpsit ; for it being made to appear that Snell had no demands against Shearman, the promise would be absolute. There is, therefore, no misjoinder of the second and fourth counts, on the ground that one is in tort and the other in assumpsit.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">It is further objected, that these counts are repugnant, the one averring that there were no demands against Shearman, the other that there were such demands. But no authority has been produced, to show that judgment should be arrested, after verdict, for such a repugnancy. And after a verdict has been applied to a good count, there is no reason for arresting the judgment on that ground, although the objection might have been valid upon a special demurrer. But there is not a legal repugnancy here, however there may be a repugnancy m common parlance.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-12\">The question then is, whether the fourth count is sufficient. It is said that a promise to use due diligence to collect the demands against Shearman should have been set forth, whereas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>it is merely alleged that due diligence was not used. But we think the contract itself imports that the testator should use due If he had power to neglect looking up those demands and thus to get rid of his contract, the law would aid him in the commission of a fraud. Negligence shows a breach of his contract; as much so as a refusal to pay the plaint if, in case the demands had been collected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><em>Motion in arrest of judgment </em>overruled, <em>and judgment entered according to verdict.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-7\"> See <em>White </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>5 Pick. 425; <em>Blight </em>v.
