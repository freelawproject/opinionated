The husband was not within the Commonwealth when the judgment was recovered, nor when the wife was committed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJyX\"><em>B. Parsons </em>now contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ASaJ\">that a married woman cannot</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A6z\">lawfully be imprisoned for debt. The husband has all her property, and she ought therefore to be protected so long as the marriage continues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b376-12\">Upon mesne process, it is clear, that a wife cannot be com mitted without her husband : nor with him, according to some of the authorities. <em>Edwards </em>v. Rourke, 1 T. R. 486.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b376-13\">Our statute of 1784, c. 41, allowing debtors the liberty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the jail-yard upon their giving bond, and <em>St. </em>1784, c. 87, providing for their discharge upon their swearing that they have no property, repeal the supposed common law right to imprison a <em>feme covert </em>for debt; for <em>a feme covert </em>cannot give a valid bond, and the presumption of law is, that she has no property of her own. Here it is not pretended that the wife has any separate property, and she is entitled to be discharged. <em>Sparkes v. </em>Bell, 8 Barn. &amp; Cressw. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b377-5\">Imprisonment for debt is at variance with the principles of the constitution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-6\">S. <em>D. </em>Parker, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aa35\">The law is settled in England, that a wife cannot be legally arrested \u00f3n mesne process, and if she is arrested, she may be discharged on common bail. The law is different in the case of an execution, unless the wife is committed by collusion between the creditor and the husband. In New York the law agrees with that of England. We find no precedent which will authorize us to liberate this woman.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">It is urged that imprisonment for debt is unconstitutional ; and that it is contrary to the unalienable rights of man ; and other arguments have been used, which would be more properly addressed to a legislative body than to a court of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The immemorial practice in this Commonwealth has been to imprison for debt, and there is nothing against it in our constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The prisoner will be remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\"> See, on this subject, <em>Pitts </em>v.
