Wheels were selected by the defendant at the inteiLdLs\u2019s shop, but it was not proved that they were used for the wagon. Before , if&gt;3 \u00bf\u00a1estate\u2019s death, which was in May 1828, the wagon was set up in the yard by his dwellinghouse, and his son, who attended to his business during his last illness, painted it once before and once after his death. A few days before his death, the intestate gave the defendant notice that the wagon was ready, and that he could take it away when he pleased. In November 1827, the defendant put his account, for the mutton into the hands of an attorney for collection, with directions to receive the wagon. The wagon not being, ready when the attorney demanded it, he commenced an action on the account, which he told the intestate should be discontinued if he would deliver the wagon. The intestate\u2019s estate was insolvent, and in November 1828, the attorney, without any directions from the defendant, and not knowing that he had taken the wagon, presented the account for the mutton to the commissioners of insolvency and it was allowed by them. The suit against the intestate was discontinued in 1829. It was held, that the property m the wagon had not vested in the defendant, and that he was liable to the administrator in trover.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\">Trover for a wagon. It was admitted that the wagon was made by Brown, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and that it was taken by the defendant about a fortnight after Brown\u2019s decease, and converted to the defendant\u2019s own use.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-5\">H. Baker testified,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJE3\">that as the agent of the defendant he contracted with Brown for a wagon, which was to be finished and ready for delivery in the spring of 1827, and for which the defendant was to pay Brown 1600 pounds of mutton. Baker went to Brown\u2019s shop and selected wheels for the wagon, and marked them with the defendant\u2019s name. Brown was to have the wagon ironed by J. Keep. Baker delivered to Brown a greater quantity of mutton than was stipulated for, and he supposed that the wagon was to be delivered at Brown\u2019s in Lee. He did not know whether the wheels selected by him were used for the wagon taken by the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQKg\">S. Walker testified,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_s\">that in April 1828, at the request of Brown\u2019s son, who attended to Brown\u2019s business during his last sickness, he brought the wagon from Keep\u2019s shop, where it had been ironed, to Brown\u2019s dwellinghouse, and that it was set up in the yard. Brown\u2019s son painted the wagon once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>before his father\u2019s death and once afterwards. A few days before the father\u2019s death, which was on May 9th, 1828, the son called on the witness to take notice that he turned out wagon to the defendant, and that it was the defendant\u2019s property ; but no person was present on behalf of the defendant to receive it. Before this the witness had frequently heard the intestate say it was intended for the defendant. When it was taken by the defendant, it was in the yard where it had been set up.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-6\">R. Hinman testified,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aujy\">that three or four days before Brown\u2019s death, after the wagon had been painted once, he wrote, by the direction of Brown, to the defendant, informing him that the wagon was ready and that he could take it away when he pleased.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-7\">W. Porter junior testified,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkTs\">that in November 1827 the defendant left with him the account against Brown for mutton, for collection, and i0directed him to receive the wagon. Porter called upon Brown for the wagon, but it not being ready, he commenced an action on the account. The action \u201ewas entered at February term 1828, and continued in court until June term 1829, when it was discontinued. After the action was commenced, he told Brown it should be discontinued, if he would deliver the wagon. Brown\u2019s estate was insolvent, and when the commissioners on the estate met in November 1828, Porter presented the defendant\u2019s account for the mutton, together with the bdl of costs in the action against Brown, which were both allowed. The administrator then informed Porter that the defendant had taken the wagon. Porter then said if the administrator would relinquish all claim to the wagon, he would not present the defendant\u2019s claim before the commissioners ; which offer the administrator refused to accept. Porter had no directions from the defendant to present the account, and he did not know that the defendant had taken the wagon until informed of it by the administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-8\">The defendant was defaulted, but if on the foregoing facts he had a right to take and retain the wagon, the default was to oe taken o.ff; otherwise judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfU\">48 *</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANWF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Briggs </em>and <em>Porter, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArKM\">cited Long on Sales, 148, 149, 168 [see Rand\u2019s ed. 3, 75, 287] ; <em>Bach </em>v.

It appears by the report of the case, that the wagon in question was built by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate for the defendant, in pursuance of a contract, but was not completely finished at the time of the intestate\u2019s death. It had been then painted once, whereas it was to have been painted a second time ; and it was so painted after the intestate\u2019s death. According to the case of <em>Mucklow v. Mangles, </em>1 Taunt. 318, the property in the wagon did not vest in the defendent, but remained in the intestate, and on his death passed to the administrator. <em>Lawrence </em>J, says, \u201c that no property, in such a case, vests until the thing is finished and delivered.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is not, however, necessary to discuss the question, whether a delivery in this case was necessary, or whether the wagon was so far finished as that the defendent might have brought trover if the intestate had sold it to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">By the contract, the wagon was to have been finished in the spring of 1827. It was not done within the time stipulated, and the defendant was not bound to receive it. In the November following the defendant left his account for mutton delivered to pay for the wagon, with an attorney, for collection, authorizing him, however, to receive the wagon. The attorney called on Brown and demanded the wagon, but it not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>being ready, he commenced a suit against Brown, which was discontinued in 1829 ; and after the death of Brown the defendant\u2019s claim was proved before the commissioners of insolvency and was allowed. After these proceedings it is impossible to uphold the defendant\u2019s claim on the wagon. He was bound by the proceedings of his attorney. He had an undoubted right to rescind the contract, and it was rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The contract was broken by the failure of the intestate to build the wagon within the time stipulated by the parties. This was an executory contract, and not a contract of sale. The defendant\u2019s remedy was an action on the promise for the breach of the contract. It was optional with the defendant afterwards to waive his right of action, and accept the wagon, but not to take it without the plaintiff\u2019s consent. The property in the wagon was clearly in the plaintiff and could not pass to the defendant except by a new agreement or an actual delivery. The taking therefore was tortious and the default must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\n<em>Judgment for plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-11\"> See <em>Oldfield </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>9 Barn. &amp; Cressw. 73 ; <em>Goode </em>v. <em>Langley, 7 </em>Barn. &amp; Cressw. 96; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>8 Barn. &amp; Cressw. 277 ; <em>Maberley </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>10 Bingh. 99; <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Hamlet, </em>12 Pick. 82, 83; <em>Glover r.
