At his decease he was seised of the following parcels of land in Richmond, namely, a homestead, appraised at $3270, a lot appraised at $1075, and the \u201c Tracy lot\u201d appraised at $119', amounting in the whole to $5535. On May 9th, 1821, the heirs met for the purpose of making a</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>settlement of the estate and a division of the real estate among themselves. At this meeting it was agreed, that Timothy and William were indebted to the estate, and that the estate was indebted to Martin, Luther, and Harvey ; and that the personal property, except $ 67-85, had been expended in payment of debts and expenses qf administration. The real estate was so divided among the heirs, that Timothy and William paid their debts, and Martin, Luther and Harvey received payment of their claims. Timothy\u2019s share amounted to $591, and was set off from the north part of the Tracy lot. The division was effected by deeds of release executed by the heirs to each other, which were recorded on March 5th, 1822. The petitioner, M\u2018Mechan, attached Timothy\u2019s undivided share on February 12th,.1822. On May 6th, 1822, as surviving partner of M\u2018Mechan &amp; Winkoop, he attached the land set off and released to Timothy ; previous to which time M\u2018Meehan\u2019s attorney did not know but that his whole claim was due to him in his individual capacity, and included in the first action ; but being then informed to the contrary, the other suit was commenced. At October term 1822 M\u2018Mechan recovered judgment in both actions, and in November 1822 he levied the execution in his first suit, upon two thirteenths of the homestead, appraised at $ 365-86, and the other on a part of Timothy\u2019s several share, appraised at $373-50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\">The object of this petition was, to have two thirteenths of the homestead set off to the petitioner in severalty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-5\"><em>C.

Peirce, 10 Johns. R. 414. The petitioner\u2019s second attachment was a ratification of the partition made by the heirs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A0t\">Wilde J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao3T\">delivered the opinion of the Court. Upon the facts agreed we are of opinion, that the plaintiff\u2019s attachment of February 12th, 1822, was a valid attachment of Timothy Griffing\u2019s undivided share of the premises, notwithstanding the previous division between the heirs, as the deeds of release, by which the division was effected, were not recorded until after the time of the plaintiff\u2019s attachment;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and this attachment was not waived or defeated by the subsequent attachment, made by him as surviving partner of the firm of M\u2018Mechan &amp; Winkoop. The demands were different, and he did not act in the same capacity in both of these transactions. He has a right to adhere to his first attachment. The defect of title, if any there be, is in that derived from the second attachment. But if both titles should stand, no injustice will be done; for it appears that the amount of both executions does not exceed the value of Timothy Griffing\u2019s share.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">It has been argued, that the first attachment, after the division between the heirs was completed by the registry of the deeds of release, attached to the separate share assigned to Timothy Griffing in the division ; and the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. Peirce, 10 Johns. R. 414, is cited in support of this position. But that case does not apply to this. In that case, the whole purparty in dispute was assigned by the partition in severalty. Here the division was void against the attaching creditor, he having no notice, at the time of the attachment, and it appearing, that the debt due to the deceased from Timothy Griffing was taken into consideration, and his share thereby greatly reduced. This debt was not considered as an advancement, and there is no evidence that it was so intended, nor is there indeed any pretence that it can be so considered. <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Breed\u2019s </em>Heirs, 17 Mass.
