The plaintiff objected to the allowance of this account; and upon this point it was admitted by the parties, that after the .death of the testator his estate was represented by the executrix to be insolvent ; that the defendant laid before the commissioners of insolvency the claim now in question, together with a further claim of $ 4-34 ; that the executrix did not produce to the commissioners the note now in suit, and the commissioners allowed to the defendant his claim of $ 4-34, and disallowed his other claim. The defendant gave no notice of his intention to prosecute his claim at common law, or of his dissatisfaction with the determination of the commissioners. Afterward the executrix demanded pay ment of the note now in suit. The defendant, thereupon, paid the sum of $ 13-95, and the executrix indorsed this sum and the sum of $ 4-34 upon the note, leaving a balance due thereon of $ 14-50. The defendant then claimed of the executrix the allowance of his account for $ 14-50, now filed in set-off, in ordei to balance the note in full, but the executrix refused to allow it, and this action was prosecuted to recover the balance of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6-pl-split\">The counsel for the plaintiffs contended, that these facts and proceedings were a bar to the defendant\u2019s claim, but the judge, being of a different opinion, overruled the objection to the admission of the account, and permitted the same, together with the defendant\u2019s evidence in support of it, to go to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>who thereupon returned a verdict for the defendant.
