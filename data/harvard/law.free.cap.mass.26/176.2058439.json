A trial was had before <em>Wilde </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The assignment was an indenture between Hemy Prince of the one part, and George Hodges and the plaintiff of the other part. After a recital that Henry Prince is indebted to Hodges in the sum of $3000 and to the plaintiff in the sum of $4000, according to a schedule annexed, Henry Prince assigns to Hodges and the plaintiff one half of the brigantine Ann with her appurtenances, \u201cbeing now at sea,\u201d with the part of her cargo, and the proceeds thereof, belonging to him, to have and to hold to them respectively in the proportions which the sums of money due to them respectively bear to each other; and Henry Prince covenants with them respectively, that he is the lawful owner of the bargained premises, that he has good right to sell the same, and that he will warrant and defend the same to Hodges and the plaintiff against the lawful claims and de mands of all persons ; and he constitutes Hodges and the plain tiff jointly and severally his attorneys and attorney in the premises, to receive the property and settle all accounts, matters and things relative thereto, as they shall judge expedient; provided, that if Henry Prince shall pay the sums mentioned in the schedule, the indenture shall be void ; and Hodges and the plaintiff, for themselves respectively, covenant that so soon as the sums respectively due to them shall be paid, they will execute a reconveyance of the property assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-3\">The nominal defendants held the proceeds of the property assigned, under an agreement with divers creditors of Henry Prince, dated May 17th, 1827.

Prince, an attorney at law, testified, that before he drew up the assignment, he had, by request of the plaintiff, made an attachment against Henry Prince and Henry Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>junior to secure the plaintiff\u2019s debt, which the plaintiff stated t0 be about $ 4000 ; that he understood from the plaintiff, when he was requested to make the assignment, that his claim consisted of the abovementioned demand for services and commissions, and also some money of the plaintiff in the hands of D. L. Pickman, N. and Z. F. Silsbee and R. Stone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-3\">Pickman testified, that he and the Silsbees and Stone were shippers in the brig Ann ; that they had paid their part of the commissions to Henry Prince junior as agent, he having had the management of the business of the voyage ; that at the time of the assignment there was a sum due to the plaintiff and Millet, the master of the Ann, on account of a shipment of tin at Java in an invoice of theirs, in which the plaintiff and Millet were interested, which, with part profits, amounted to $337, the account concerning which was settled with the plaintiff and Millet in August 1827 and paid to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-4\">It did not appear that there was any particular reason whj the plaintiff\u2019s commissions should be paid by Pickman and others to Henry Prince junior in the first instance, otherwise than that it was their practice, and Henry Prince junior\u2019transacted the business of the Ann. Nor did it appear, otherwise than by such practice and the other evidence before stated, that money thus paid to Henry Prince junior had ever been considered as received by him and Henry Prince as partners or jointly, nor that they ever had jointly paid or received any such money, or otherwise ; but it did appear that Henry Prince junior was the agent for the owers of the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIDd\">Joseph H. Prince, who was again called by consent, after the argument of the defendants\u2019 counsel, said that Hodges requested him to draw an assignment ; that his father, Henry Prince, afterwards wished him to secure the plaintiff; that he had before attached real estate for the plaintiff, at his request, on a writ against Henry Prince and Henry Prince junior for $ 4000 ; that the assignment was executed first by his father, then by Hodges, then by the plaintiff; that he did not know any thing about the consideration of Hodges\u2019s note ; that Hodges and the plaintiff were never at his office together ; that when the writ was filled up, no account was before him, but the plaintiff said that about $4000 was the amount due ; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>plaintiff had been much in want of money, and he had lent him some himself, and had borrowed money to pay his expenses to Baltimore, where he now resided ; and he stated, but not in answer to any interrogatories to that point, that the plaintiff had often complained, before the lime of making the writ, that his father and brother were indebted to him. After the witness stated this, the defendants\u2019 counsel objected to it, but the judge overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\">The defendants\u2019 counsel contended that this action could not ue maintained, because it was not brought by the plaintiff as survivor of Hodges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">The jury were instructed, that the action in the present form would lie ; and they were directed to consider, whether the transaction on the part of the plaintiff was fraudulent in the whole or in part; that if a part of his demand was fraudulent, it would avoid the whole transaction ; that the assignment to Hodges was fraudulent in law and void, but that a distinction was to be made in cases of an assignment for the benefit of several parties, for it might be good as to one party and void as to another ; that the circumstance of the want of consideration in the case of Hodges, would have a tendency to throw suspicion upon the plaintiff\u2019s demand, but that if it was proved that the plaintiff had not any knowledge of it, it should not affect his claim ; that the strongest circumstance was, that the sum mentioned in the assignment was about $ 400 more than the note, which if the plaintiff knew it not to be due, would avoid the whole, but if it was included in the assignment by any mistake merely, it was not fraudulent; that the jury should take all the circumstances into consideration, and if they were satisfied there was fraud, the plaintiff could not recover ; that if they believed the transaction to be honest, they should consider what was really due to the plaintiff, and return a verdict for such a proportion of the amount in the hands of the defendants as the amount due to him would entitle him to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-8\">The defendants moved for a new trial : \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-9\">1.

Because the judge instructed the jury, that unless the plaintiff was privy to the transaction with Hodges, it ought not in any manner to operate against the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-3\">3. Because the plaintiff and Hodges, by the assignment, take as tenants in common, and ought to have been joined in an action for the property conveyed by it or the proceeds thereof, and the same matter which is a defence as to both, is a defence as to either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\">4. Because the plaintiff sues, in point of law, as the survivor of Hodges, and the same matter which would be a defence to an action brought by both, is a defence to this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">5. Because Joseph H. Prince was admitted to testify in behalf of the plaintiff, to conversations between him and the plaintiff, in which the plaintiff stated that Henry Prince and Henry Prince junior were indebted to him, and in which the witness, upon these statements, advised the plaintiff to commence an action, the same conversations having been had, not at the time of making the plaintiff\u2019s writ, but at other times, long before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">6. Because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, upon the point of the excess of the debt. mentioned in the assignment over that attempted to be proved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A5O\"><em>Choate </em>and <em>Huntington, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeA\">Henry Prince was interested in the event of the suit, for if the Oriental Insurance Company prevail, he is liable to the plaintiff on his warranty ; and in an action upon the warranty he will be liable to the costs of this suit, so that his interest is not balanced. <em>Jackson </em>v.

Pl. 5, 12 ; 1 Wms\u2019s Saund. 294. The agreement with the defendants saves all legal rights of all parties. The deputy-sheriff then being in possession, the plaintiff and Hodges must have sued him in replevin, trespass, or trover. Suppose replevin to be brought; the deputy says that the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>erty is in Henry Prince and Henry Prince junior ; the plaintiffs reply that it is in themselves ; and the deputy shows that the assignment is fraudulent as to Hodges. This would avoid the assignment. So here the action should have been brought by the plaintiff as the survivor, and we should then have shown the assignment fraudulent as to one, and so void as to both. 1 Wms\u2019s Saund. 28 ; <em>Moors </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>3 Mass. R. 310 ; <em>Marsteller </em>v. <em>M'Lean, 7 </em>Cranch. 158 ; Chit. Pl. 3, 10, 11 ; <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Davis, 7 </em>Mass. R. 257; Co.

It should have been trespass, trover, or replevin against the attaching officer. The agreement contains no provision that these defendants shall pay any one until his right shall be judicially determined, unless by the assent of all parties. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hoar, </em>5 Pick. 285.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-6\">The declaration of the plaintiff at other times than vrhen in consultation with Joseph H.

And if not, the subsequent agreement by which :he property was put into the hands of the defendants, operated severance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A4t\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG6\">drew up the opinion of the Court. We are not aware \u00b0f any sufficient reason for determining that Henry \u00ed&gt;r*nce was not a competent witness. He stands as other debtors do, who have assigned their effects to a favored creditor; if his assignment stands, it pays his debt, but leaves him indebted to the party attaching ; if it is avoided, he is still indebted ; it only changes the creditor. His covenant is nothing more than the implied covenant in all transfers of personal property, viz. that it is his to sell;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor is his liability to costs greater or other than in the usual case of transfer of property by failing debtors. There is no direct liability on his part for costs, and his covenant in the indenture cannot make him liable in damages beyond the amount of his debt ; for which he was liable without the covenant, if the property intended to secure it was taken away by a superior legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\">And in regard to the testimony of Joseph H. Prince relative to declarations of the plaintiff, that the assignor was indebted to him, this seems to have fallen from the witness incidentally, without any fault of the plaintiff or his counsel, and it was considered, in the order in which it was introduced, as part of the <em>res gestee </em>; as a complaint made to an attorney in the course of business. This may admit of doubt, but if the evidence was not strictly competent, still it was not material, and could have no improper influence with the jury ; for the plaintiff\u2019s proof of his debt, to a certain amount, is perfectly satisfactory, and a verdict ought not to be set aside for a slight slip, when the verdict is clearly right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The great questions in the case are, what is the legal effect of the assignment of Henry Prince to the plaintiff, and has the plaintiff a right to support this action, under the circumstances proved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>We consider the question made at the trial, of fraud in the assignment, so far as regards the present plaintiff, as settled by the verdict; and rightly settled, so far at least as to deprive us of the power or wish to interfere with it. The only questionable part of the transaction arises from the apparent surplus intended to be secured by the assignment beyond the amount o' the note to the plaintiff; but that was a matter explainable by evidence, and the jury were rightly instructed respecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">It being apparent that the assignment, in relation to the intended interest of Hodges in it, was fraudulent and void, it is a question of some nicety, whether it can be upheld in relation to the plaintiff, who did not participate in the fraud. It is insisted, that as the debt to the plaintiff was attempted to be secured in the same instrument as the feigned debt to Hodges, the assignment is void in the whole, so that the plaintiff can claim nothing under it. This must depend upon the nature of the transaction, and of the instrument by which the assignment was made, and the connexion of the parties to whom the property is conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Without doubt, property may be conveyed in one and the same instrument, to several persons independent of each other, so as to be available for the benefit of one and not of another. In the common case of assignments to trustees for the use of creditors who shall become parties, it has never been supposed, that if one of the parties should by collusion with the debtor sign for a fictitious debt, the conveyance to the others would be defeated. Such a transaction might avoid the release of all the creditors, it being a fraud upon them, but their interest in the property would not be impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The deed of assignment in this case, though made to the plaintiff and Hodges jointly, so as to make them tenants in common of the property assigned, if the deed were valid in the whole, most clearly shows a separate interest in the fund, and in its whole tenor it regards them as separate and not as joint creditors. The property is conveyed to them respectively in proportion to their respective debts, and in a schedule annexed the amount of the debt and the interest of each is specified. Certainly this would have been a good conveyance to the plaintiff, if made to him separately, notwithstanding another similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>conveyance had been made to Hodges, which was fraudulent Why then should the conveyance of the plaintiff be defeated, because it is contained in the same instrument ? The deed itself is not void, for against Henry Prince it was valid in favor of both of the assignees. If fraudulent, the property does not pass by it to the prejudice of creditors. There is no reason that we can discern, nor have we discovered any authority, which requires us to pronounce it void in its effect <em>in toto. </em>On the contrary, by analogy to cases somewhat similar we are warranted in pronouncing the conveyance valid in regard to the plaintiff, though void in regard to Hodges.</p>\n<p id=\"AEA\">There are cases where a deed even to one grantee has been held to be void in part and good in part; indeed this is laid down as a principle of the common law, that where one subject of the conveyance is void as being affected by an illegal consideration, another subject of the same deed not so affected is good. Chit. on Contr. 229, [4th Am. ed. 537, 538.]</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">It is only where the deed is made void by statute, that the contrary principle prevails. But even in the latter case a distinction is recognized between the several subj\u00e9cts of a deed, some of which are declared void by statute. By <em>Brit. St. </em>9 <em>Geo. </em>2, c. 37, conveyances to charitable uses, under certain circumstances, are declared to be null and void to all intents and purposes. Yet in the case of Doe v. <em>Pitcher, </em>6 Taunt. 369, a conveyance of several parcels of estate,- some of which were to charitable uses and others not, was good and valid to pass the estate of the grantor in those parcels which were not appropriated to the prohibited use.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We also consider this deed of assignment as capable of being construed a several conveyance to each of the grantees, in proportion to his debt; like the case of covenants, which, though drawn in terms which import a joint interest in the covenantees, may be taken distributively if their interest was several, and each may maintain his separate action upon them. This is most distinctly settled in 1 Saund. 153 ; 3 Barn. &amp; Cressw. 254 ; 8 Taunt. 245 ; 1 Wendell, 228. Indeed it is familiar doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>But still the case is not free from all difficulty, for the plaintiff became, by virtue of the assignment, owner of only an undivided portion of the property conveyed ; so that he could not maintain replevin or trespass or trover against the attaching officer, who had a right to attach, as belonging to the debtors, so much of the property as was fraudulently assigned to Hodges, that being still, in regard to the creditors, left in the Princes. Certainly such action could not be maintained, but the plaintiff\u2019s property is not thereby lost to him. The attaching officer could legally sell on execution only the part which belonged to the Princes, and the purchaser would become tenant m common with the plaintiff. Or if the whole were sold, the plaintiff might legally claim his proportional share of the proceeds, if he chose to affirm the sale, giving the officer notice before he paid over.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">But we think all difficulty is cured by the disposition of the property agreed to be made by all parties interested in it by attachment, assignment, or otherwise. They are to share the net proceeds according to their legal rights, and the legal right of the plaintiff is the proportion which his debt bears to the interest of Henry Prince in the proceeds of the vessel and cargo</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-5\"> See <em>Buchnam </em>v. <em>Goddard., </em>21 Pick. 71; Long on Sales, (Rand\u2019s ed ) 20l ; <em>Mockbee </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>2 Har. &amp; Gill, 176 ; <em>Sweet </em>v.
