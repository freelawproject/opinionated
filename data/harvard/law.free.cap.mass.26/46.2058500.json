(giving some of the courses and distances,) to a stake and-stones opposite the dwellinghouse of Asa Downs, thence (in different courses 757 rods) \u201cto a notched oak tree standing in the line of Bristol and Plymouth counties, thence passing in the county of Plymouth four and a half miles and forty one rods to a sycamore tree in the line of Bristol and Plymouth counties,\u201d thence, &amp;c.

Because so much of the highway as is located in the county of Bristol, was not of common convenience and necessity, and the commissioners were induced to adjudge the whole of the highway to be so, and to lay out the same, by offers of indemnity improperly made by individuals and accepted by the commissioners, whereby certain persons, in consideration of the highway\u2019s being located, undertook that so much of the same as was situated in Plymouth county should be laid out by the commissioners of highways of Plymouth county, and that if it was not laid out, it should be built, kept open and kept in repair.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\">6.

To show the necessity of notice, he cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>2 Mass. R. 118 ; <em>St. </em>1786, c. 67, \u00a7 4 ; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Lancaster, </em>1 Mass.

But if they had located the road in Plymouth county, it would not vitiate the whole of their proceedings. <em>Commonwealth v. Blue Hill </em>Turnpike, 5 Mass. R. 420.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-16\">Sufficient notice was given to parties interested, and we now offer evidence to prove it. This is an application to the discretion of the Court, and the Court will inquire into the circumstances of the case, and if injustice has not been done, a certiorari will be refused. <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>17 Mass.

A return at the \u201c next court\u201d is important, in order that individuals aggrieved may know when to apply for a jury</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\">After the argument, witnesses were examined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-9\">Noah Claflin, one of the commissioners of highways, stated that the commissioners were accustomed to publish notice ol applications for highways, in a newspaper, and to give notice to the clerks of the towns through which the road prayed for would pass ; that the commissioners viewed this road and adjudged it not to be of common convenience and necessity ; that after-wards there was a rehearing, but that no view was had after the petition for the rehearing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-10\">Another witness testified, that so much of the road as lies in the county of Bristol (being about twelve and a half miles) was finished, with the exception of about one mile, and that the part lying in Plymouth county was not worked at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-11\">From the testimony of David Gray, one of the commissioners, it appeared that Hathaway\u2019s petition was presented to the commissioners on October 25th, 1826, and that notice of it was ordered to be given to the clerks of towns ; that in April J827, the road was adjudged not to be of common convenience and necessity ; that at the meeting of the commissioners in September 1827, there was a petition by Francis Baylies and others for a rehearing, notice of which was ordered to be printed- in a newspaper, the commissioners having then, as the witness believed, departed from their rule, of giving notice to the town clerks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-12\"><em>Hathaway </em>stated that it could be proved that no notice was given to the town clerk.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A96\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A3U\"><em>We see </em>no objection to-the bond in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">It was very proper, under the circumstances, that such a bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>should be taken. It cannot be supposed to have infl .enced the minds of the commissioners in determining whether a new road from Taunton to New Bedford would be of common convenience and necessity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The road would have been useless, if it nad stopped at the lines of Plymouth county, and it was proper to take measures to prevent a useless expense to the county of Bristol in case the commissioners of Plymouth county should refuse to locate the part of the road falling within the county. It is a strong case for the exercise of the discretion of the Court in support of the proceedings, unless injustice has been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">We think the objection, that the location goes to and from the trees described, cannot avail. When the part of the road which lies in Plymouth county shall be made, the road will lead from town to town.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The objection that the return of the location was not made to the next Court of Sessions held after the service was performed., would be fatal in case the writ of certiorari had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">But the persons interested in the return are those who own the land over which the road runs. No complaint has been made by any such owner. It is true that the inhabitants of Freetown are in some-degree interested, as they may be burdened with the expense of repairs ; but this is not so high an interest as to require the issuing of a certiorari, when the public convenience demands the establishment of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The only doubt in our minds is in respect to the notice. The objection on this point would be cured by proof of notice, or of an app\u00e9arance on behalf of the town of Freetown. Claflin states, that it was customary to give notice to town clerks, hut as the counsel for Freetown says he can prove by the clerk of that town that no such notice was given, we cannot presume notice from Claflin\u2019s testimony. The case will, therefore, be i ontmued nisi, in order that the parties may produce evidence on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The Court were accordingly furnished, in the vacation, with several affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">In the advertisement published in November 1826, and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>sequently to the petition of Baylies in 1827, the proposed road was described as \u201c a public highway from New Bedford to Taunton by the way of Rounseville\u2019s furnace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtP\">By the affidavit of Job Morton, the chairman of the commissioners of highways, it appeared that at their first meeting it &lt; was determined by them, that notice of the pendency of a petition, published in a newspaper printed in the county, was reasonable and sufficient notice within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap6\">The opinion of the Court was afterward drawn up by</p>\n<author id=\"Azi\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyC\">This application for a certiorari comes be-f\u00b0re us under circumstances which incline and authorize us to refuse it, if the parties in interest have had a hearing before the commissioners, or such notice of the time and place of hearing, that they might have presented their objections seasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Towns or individuals whose interests may be affected by the opening of a new road, ought not to lie by and withhold their objections until great expense has been incurred, and then apply to this Court to rip up the whole proceedings. As most of the objections to the doings of the commissioners are aside from the real merits of the case, we have taken much pains to ascertain whether due notice was given of the meeting of the commissioners, to consider the application for this road, so that a hearing might have been had of the inhabitants of Freetown, who now ask to have the proceedings quashed. The result of our inquiries is, that there was without doubt such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The statute giving authority to commissioners of highways prescribes no particular mode of notice. It merely requires that \u201c reasonable notice \u201d shall be given of the time and place appointed for viewing the road prayed for, and after such view and hearing of the parties, the commissioners shall have power to order and determine the making &amp;c. of such road. <em>St. </em>1825, c. 171. The mode of giving notice seems to have been left by the legislature to the discretion of the commissioners. They adopted the practice of advertising in a newspaper printed in the county, the time and place of meeting for the consideration of the application. All official notices had been usually published in the same way. We have seen that the original application for the road, and the time and place of hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>thereon, were thus advertised, and that other parties interested did in fact attend the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">The petition was, upon the first hearing, dismissed ; after which it was revived by an application for a rehearing by Francis Baylies and others, and upon this application new notice was given of the time and place of hearing, in the same way. The route of the proposed road was sufficiently described, by referring to Rounseville\u2019s furnace, to give notice to the inhabitants of Freetown, of the course it would take through that town. In addition to this, one of the commissioners, the chairman, was also one of the selectmen of that town ; and be states \"n his affidavit, that he informed another of the selectmen of hat town (there being hut three) of the pendency of the petition for the road, and that they determined it was not necessary to call a meeting of the inhabitants on the subject. There having been legal notice of <em>the </em>meetings, and reason to suppose there was actual notice to those officers of the town whose duty it was to take charge of the matter for the town, we do not think that at this period, after the road has been laid out and actually worked at a great expense to the individual who contracted with the commissioners, a certiorari ought to be granted on account of formal defects in the proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-14\"> See <em>Dudley </em>v.
