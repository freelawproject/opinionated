If these acts made the defendant liable to an indictment, as a common seller of rum &amp;c. by retail, then the defendant was to retract his plea and plead guilty ; otherwise the indictment was to be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\">This case was argued by Crosby, for the defendant, in writing, and by <em>Minot, </em>county attorney, for the Commonwealth, at the bar.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Avf\">\n<em>Crosby.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AreW\">The facts which are agreed do not support the indictment, which is for being a <em>retailer </em>without license. The clause on which the indictment is founded provides, that \u201cno person may presume to be a common victualler, innholder, taverner, or seller of wine, beer, &amp;c. by retail, or in a less quantity than twenty-eight gallons, and that delivered and carried away all at one time,\u201d without a license. <em>St. </em>1786, c. 68, \u00a7 1. The words <em>by retail </em>and retailer, in this statute, have throughout a technical meaning, which is stated in the clause cited. The words victualler, innholder, and taverner, are also defined in the statute. If the defendant had sold his liquor in less quantities than twenty-eight gallons and to be carried away, he would have been liable to this indictment as a common <em>seller by </em>retail, without license. But the <em>offence </em>which he has com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>milled, which is that of selling liquor and suffering it to be drunk in his shop, would subject him to indictment as a common victualler, <em>innholder, </em>or <em>taverner, </em>but not as a retailer.\u2014 He might also have been indicted for each act of selling under another clause in the same section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-4\">The indictment is insufficient, because it does not allege that the liquors were retailed \u201c in a less quantity than twenty-eight gallons,\u201d &amp;c. pursuing the words of the statute. In the statute, to sell by retail is explained to mean, in a less quantity than twenty-eight gallons. If the defendant sold spirituous liquors by the single hogshead or barrel, it would have been selling by retail, in the common meaning of the term, and yet no offence against the statute What is alleged in the indictment, therefore, is not necessarily an offence. <em>St. </em>1786, c. 68, \u00a7 1 ; 7 Dane\u2019s Abr. 265, 266 ; Hawk. P. C. <em>bk. </em>2, c. 25, \u00a7 60; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Cheere, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Cressw. 902 ; <em>Pearce </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>13 Mass. R. 343 ; <em>Gore </em>v. <em>Brazier, </em>3 Mass. R. 540 ; <em>Holbrook </em>v <em>Holbrook, </em>1 Pick. 248.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-8\"><em>Minot </em>cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Messenger, </em>4 Mass. R. 462.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AQvu\">It seems to us that the indictment is sufficient. The allegation that the defendant presumed to be a common seller, by retail, is enough, without alleging that the quantity was less than twenty-eight gallons. That may be deemed the legislative definition of the term <em>retail; </em>and it is matter of evidence for the defendant, to show that the quantities which he sold were not less. It is like the case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Messenger, </em>4 Mass. R. 462, a prosecution for a violation of the statute for the due observation of the Lord\u2019s day ; in which the allegation, that the defendant worked on the Lord\u2019s day, was held sufficient, although the statute defines precisely the hours which are to be considered the Lord\u2019s day, and there was no allegation that it was within these hours that the offence was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-18\">According to the agreement of the parties, the defendant m jst plead guilty to the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
