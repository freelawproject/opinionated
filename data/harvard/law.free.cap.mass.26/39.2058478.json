But the jury were instructed, that the remarks of the defendant relative to this suit might refer to the former note as well as the latter, and that the service of the writ upon the defendant did not raise a legal presumption that his remarks related to the latter note rather than the former, unless there was evidence that he knew of the existence of the latter note or of the contents of the writ; but that it was proper for the jury, upon the whole evidence, to determine whether the conversations of the defendant referred to the latter or the former note. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; but if the above instructions were wrong, a new trial was to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A-\"><em>W.
