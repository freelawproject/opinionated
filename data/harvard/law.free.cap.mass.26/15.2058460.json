The evidence also tended to show, that the defendant shot the doves and used them for food, and that he did it <em>animo furandi.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-6\">The judge instructed the jury, that if they believed the evidence. and that the doves were taken by the defendant with a felonious intent, they ought to find him guilty. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to this instruction, on the ground that doves could not be the subject of larceny. The jury having found the defendant guilty, a motion was made for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-7\"><em>Russell, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0j\">cited <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Mease, </em>3 Binney, 546 ; East\u2019s P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9e\">delivered the opinion of the Court. It is held in all the authorities, that doves are <em>ferce natures, </em>and as such are not subjects of larceny, except when in the care and custody of the owner ; as when in a dovecot or pigeon-house, or when in the nest before they are able to fly. If, when thus under the care of the owner, they are taken furtively, it is larceny</p>\n<p id=\"b23-12\">The reason of this principle is, that it is difficult to distinguish them from other fowl of the same species. They often take a flight and mix in large flocks with the doves of other persons, and are free tenants of the air, except when, impelled by hunger or habit, or the production or preservation of their young, they seek the shelter prepared for them by the owner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Perhaps when feeding on the grounds of the proprietor, or rest\u00a1ng on ^arn or other buildings, ify killed by a stranger, the owner may have trespass, and if the purpose be to consume them as food, and they are killed or caught or carried away from the enclosure ofj the owner, the act would be larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\">But in this case there is no evidence of the situation they were in when killed, whether on the flight, a mile from the grounds of the owner, or mingled with the doves of other persons, enjoying their natural liberty. Without such evidence the act of killing them, though for the purpose of using them as food, is not felonious. Therefore a new trial is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
