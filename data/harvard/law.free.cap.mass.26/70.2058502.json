Raym. 1476 ; <em>Berkley v. Howard, </em>2 Str. 907. And they will examine into the circumstances of the case. <em>Ex parte </em>Weston, 11 Mass. R. 417. Here the object was to determine the question of a right of way, and the plaintiff expected to recover only nominal damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-9\">The record of the Court being under their own control, the judge had a right to certify what was necessary to sustain the judgment; and this without a bearing of the parties. If by inadvertence of counsel or of the judge, the certificate was not made before the judgment, he might certify afterwards. 1 Salk. 51 ; <em>Dickinson </em>v. Plaisted, 7 T. R. 474 ; <em>Dewitt </em>v. Post, 11 Johns. R. 460 ; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Skipwith, </em>Cro. Jac. 277 ; <em>Tully </em>v. Sparkes, 2 Str. 867, and 2 Ld. Raym. 1570.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-12\">If the plaintiff recovers nothing in the court below, but does recover some damages in this Court, there was reasonable ground to appeal. The record as amended shows a certificate to that effect, and error cannot be assigned to contradict the record.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-13\"><em>Leland </em>and <em>Gardner, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am0\">insisted that the certificate should have been made before the rendition of judgment. 2 Sellon\u2019s Pr. 431, 433, 436 ; Tidd\u2019s Pr. 871 ; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Parr, </em>2 Wils. 21 ; <em>Toioers </em>v. <em>Vielie, </em>1 Johns. Cas. 221 ; <em>Heaton </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>1 Johns. R. 146.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-14\">The certificate should not have been granted without notice to the adverse party. The reasonableness of the appeal may depend upon what took place in the court below, and which must be made known to the judge who certifies, by the production of evidence. Tidd\u2019s Pr. 813, 814, 843 ; <em>Godfrey </em>v <em>Godfrey, </em>1 Pick. 236 ; <em>Chace </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>2 Pick. 27.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-15\">There is no amendment of the record here. The cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>amendment after judgment relate to circumstantial errors ; this error is one of substance. 6 Dane\u2019s Abr. 290 ; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. Crossen, 10 Mass. R. 252.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b81-3\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AIn\">The provision of the statute, that where the judge shall certify that the plaintiff had reasonable ground to appeal, the plaintiff shall recover his costs, does not mean that in all such cases he shall recover full costs. If the damages recovered are less than twenty dollars, he is entitled to costs u. the amount of one quarter part of the damages. Here he has recovered one dollar as damages and full costs. Therefore if the certificate had been given in due time, the judgment would still be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">But we think the certificate was made too late. The statute clearly implies that it shall be given before the judgment is entered up. The parties are then both in court, when there may be a motion for a certificate and a hearing upon the motion, without any formal notice. The judge here gave the certificate without considering the question whether it would avail the plaintiff, and for the reason above stated we are all of opinion that it can have no effect. The only ground, if any, on which the judgment can be supported, is, that the suit was in the nature of a real action, but we have not before us the facts required to present this question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-5\"> See Revised Stat c. 121, \u00a7 10 ; <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>13 Pick. 321, <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>6 Wendell, 555.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
