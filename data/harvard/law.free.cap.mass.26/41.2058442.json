One Packard testified, that in May 1828, he, Packard, was the clerk of the company ; and that in the autumn of that year he resigned his office and surrendered his sergeant\u2019s warrant to the captain, who accepted the same, and that he then went into the ranks. Kingman was appointed clerk in April 1829. The objection was, that Packard could not make his resignation to the captain and go into the ranks, and consequently he continued still to be the clerk. But, <em>per </em>Curiam,, the captain had a right to appoint the clerk, and of course a right to accept his resignation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p><p id=\"b50-5\">Another alleged error was, that the order to the warning officer to warn the company was signed, \u201c By order of said commanding officer, Matthew Kingman, Clerk; \u201d instead of being signed by the captain himself. But, <em>per </em>Curiam, the form pursued was correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p><p id=\"A0jN\">The order was, that the company should be warned to appear \u201c at Col. Edward Southworth\u2019s store in North Bridgewater,\u201d and the complaint against the petitioner was for neglecting to appear at that place ; but he was warned to appear \u201c at the usual place of parade of said company in North Bridgewater.\u201d It was objected that he was not warned to appear at the place mentioned in the complaint. Evidence was produced before the justice, that Southworth\u2019s store was, and for years had been, the usual place of parade of the company, and that the petitioner had been enrolled in the company in 1828, and had performed military duty therein. <em>Per Curiam. </em>This was sufficient to sustain the complaint, so far as regards this obje' tion.</p><p id=\"b50-8\">A writ of <em>certiorari, </em>therefore, was not granted.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
