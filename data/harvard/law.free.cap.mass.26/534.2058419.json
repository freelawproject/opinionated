The defendant having failed to perform his agreement, the notes were delivered to the plaintiff. It was <em>held, </em>that the relinquishment of the plaintiff\u2019s attachment was a sufficient consideration for the defendant\u2019s note, and that the plaintiff might maintain an action upon it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b551-12\">Held, also, that the note was in the nature of a penalty, and that the defendant was eutitled to show, as the measure of damages, the sum actually due to the plaintiff from his debtor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-13\">Assumpsit upon a promissory note, for $ 150, dated February 23d, 1828, made by Reuben Stoddard, the intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-14\">Trial before <em>Putnam </em>J., upon the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-15\">The plaintiff, on December 8th, 1827, sued out a writ against one Knapp, in which the <em>ad damnum </em>was laid at $200, and attached certain real estate which Knapp had previously conveyed to Stoddard. This conveyance the plaintiff considered to be fraudulent and void as against creditors. T. Lee testified, that when Stoddard made the note to the plaintiff, the plaintiff also made a note to Stoddard, and that both notes wei <em>b </em>written upon a sheet of paper containing an agreement of even date with the notes, and signed by the plaintiff and Stoddard, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>follows : \u2014 \u201c This may certify, that R. Stoddard and I. Kell\u00b0gg have agreed to leave out all the difference between A. E. Knapp and I. Kellogg to three men, namely R. Brown, A. Haskins, and T. Lee, and to abide their judgment. We agree to have it decided on next Tuesday at 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d Upon entering into this agreement, the plaintiff, at the request of Stoddard, relinquished his attachment, and discontinued his suit against Knapp, who had absconded, and the notes were deposited with Lee, to be delivered up against the party who should fail to perform the agreement. Stoddard did not perform it, and the note in suit was accordingly deliv- ' ered to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfL\">The defendant contended, that as the agreement to ascertain by arbitration the amount due from Knapp to the plaintiff was binding on the parties, the plaintiff should have declared on that agreement, averring performance on his own part and a refusal to perform on the part of the defendant, and also setting forth the amount due from Knapp to the plaintiff. The judge overruled the objection, considering the action to have been properly brought on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-6\">The defendant also contended, that the plaintiff must prove that his claim against Knapp was a just demand. But the judge ruled, that as the plaintiff gave up his attachment and discontinued his suit at the request of Stoddard, upon entering into the agreement, there was a sufficient consideration for the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-7\">The defendant then offered to show, that at the time when Knapp was sued, nothing was due to the plaintiff. But the judge refused to let the defendant go into the merits of the case of the plaintiff against Knapp.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AeKg\"><em>Dwight </em>and Barnard, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7iK\">insisted that the action ought to have been brought upon the agreement to abide by the decision of the arbitrators, and not upon the note. Either party had a right to ask the arbitrators to proceed <em>ex </em>parte, and no notice was necessary, the time for the hearing being fixed by the'submission. <em>Wood </em>v. Leake, 12 Ves. 412 ; <em>Allen </em>v. Watson, 16 Johns. R. 205, 209 ; <em>Freeman v. </em>Adams, 9 Johns. R. 115; 2 Wms\u2019s Saund, 62 6, note 5. The plaintiff introduces parol evidence to vary this written agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-10\">The note was not founded upon any consideration, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>debt of Knapp to Kellogg was not extinguished. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Charnock, </em>8 T. R. 139 ; <em>Street </em>v. <em>Rigby, </em>6 Ves. 821.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-3\">The note was given by way of a penalty, and the plaintiff ought to have proved the amount due to him from Knapp ; but on the contrary, the defendant was even prevented from showing that Knapp was not indebted to the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-5\"><em>Hall, </em>on the other side,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqe\">to show that the plaintiff\u2019s relinquishment of his attachment was a sufficient consideration for the note, cited <em>Lent </em>v. <em>Padelford, </em>10 Mass. R. 230. He argued that the note was given as liquidated damages.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b553-6\">Putnam J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amf\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The first question to be considered is, whether there was a good consideration for the note. It would be sufficient if there were gain to the promisor or damage to the promisee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But in the case at bar both concur. ' By the arrangement, the promisor procured a discontinuance of an attachment upon the estate which he claimed, whereby his title was confirmed, and the promisee thereby gave up his security. We think, therefore, there was a sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The note was given upon a condition which the defendant failed to perform. The jury so found the fact, upon the evidence which was submitted to them upon the trial. There is no objection to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery on that ground. It was to be delivered to the party who performed ; and the party &lt;vho failed to perform the condition became answerable for the non-performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The question remaining to be considered regards the amount which the plaintiff is entitled to recover. If, as his counsel contends, the amount of the note was the damages liquidated by the parties, then the whole sum, with interest, should be the measure of damages. If the notes, which were given by each to the other, were in the nature of a penalty for the non-performance of the agreement of submission, then the rule of damages should be the real injury sustained by the plaintiff. And upon consideration, we all think the latter is the correct view of the transaction. The defendant assumed the liability of Knapp to the plaintiff. The amount of the claim was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ascertained by the arbitrators mutually agreed upon by the parties. But the defendant prevented the decision or arbitration. He should therefore be held to put the plaintiff in as good a situation as if his claim against Knapp had been ascertained by the arbitrators. The measure of damages would have been the amount of the award of the arbitrators. The loss of the debt due from Knapp to the plaintiff is the injury which he has sustained by giving up his attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We all think that the judge should have permitted the defendant to prove, either that nothing was due from Knapp to the plaintiff, in which case nothing should be recovered ; or that a sum, less than that expressed in the note, was due, in which case that sum should be recovered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqCT\">A new trial must therefore be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-10\"> See 1 Metcalf &amp; Perkins\u2019s Dig 99 <em>tit \u00a3greement. art. </em>II.
