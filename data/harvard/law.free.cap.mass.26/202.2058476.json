On January 6th, 1829, the same shares were attached on mesne process in suits against Winthrop Sargent, by creditors of his, who had no notice of the assignment. These suits were still pending. On January 24th, 1829, Winthrop Sargent\u2019s certificate was presented to the treasurer of tha corporation, by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, who then demanded the dividend and a transfer of the shares to the plaintiffs and a certificate in their names, all which were refused by the treas urer on account of the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-4\">The act incorporating the company, <em>(St. </em>1825, c. 66,) con tains no provision on the subject of the transfer of shares, but confers upon it the usual powers of corporations, and authorizes it to make by-laws. One of the by-laws of the corporation requires, that \u201c all transfers shall be made in a book to be kept by the treasurer for the purpose, in the following foim,\u201d &amp;c. Another article prescribes the form of the certificate, in which it is expressed, that \u201c the shares &amp;c. are transferable on the books of the corporation or by lawful attorney.\u201d A third requires, that \u201c all transfers shall be recorded in a book to be kept for that purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">The case was argued in writing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b214-6-pl-split\">Saltonstall, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A41\">contended that the shares being an incorporeal right, the plaintiff\u2019s title to them was complete by the execution of the deed of assignment and the delivery of the certificates. Indeed a mere delivery of the certificates for a valuable consideration, would have been sufficient to pass the property. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>17 Johns. R. 284 ; <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>19 Johns. R. 95 ; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Witter, </em>13 Mass. R. 304 ; <em>Mechanics Bank of Alexandria </em>v. <em>Seton, </em>1 Peters, 308 ; <em>Quiner </em>v. <em>Marblehead Social Ins. Co. </em>10 Mass.

The corporation has no power by its by-laws to alter the general law relative to this description of property. 2 Kyd on Corp. 107 ; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Portland Bank, </em>3 Mass. R. 374 ; <em>Chester Glass Company </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>16 Mass. R. 101. The defendants are not a manufacturing corporation, and their act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of incorporation does not make them subject to the statute of 1808, c. 65, regulating such corporations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-3\"><em>B. Merrill, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR4J\">The transfer made by Winthrop Sargent was informal and void, as to all persons except himself and the plaintiffs, because it was not made in conformity with the general law, <em>(St. </em>1808, <em>c. </em>65, \u00a7 4,) requiring shares in manufacting companies to be transferred by deed, acknowledged and recorded in the corporation books, or because it did not conform to the defendants\u2019 by-laws, regulating transfers, which were made under the authority of their act of incorporation. Shares of stock are not mere <em>choses in action, </em>but are capable of transfer and delivery and may be attached like other personal property. <em>St. </em>1804, c. 83. The plaintiffs having neglected to take possession until after the attachment was made, they and the attaching creditors stand in the same relation to each other as two purchasers of the same goods by different conveyances. In such case the party which first lawfully acquires possession will hold them. <em>Lanfear </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>17 Mass. R. 110. The title of the attaching creditors, therefore, being subsequent purchasers without notice, who have first acquired possession, must prevail. Even in the case of the transfer of ships at sea, possession must be taken in a reasonable time. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>12 Mass. R. 54 ; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Pick. 288.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b215-8\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABf\">drew up the opinion of the Court. The question is, whether the property in the shares passed from Winthrop Sargent to the plaintiffs by the deed of assignment made on the 5th of January, 1829, and by the delivery over to the plaintiffs of the certificates of the shares. This assignment we take to have been <em>bona fide </em>and for a valuable consideraci\u00f3n. The attachment was made on the 6th of January, and must therefore fail if the assignment is valid. That the assignment is good in equity, cannot be disputed. This point is settled in the case of <em>Quiner </em>v. <em>Marblehead Social Ins. Co. </em>10 Mass. R. 476, and in the case of <em>Nesmith </em>v. <em>Washington Bank, </em>6 Pick. 324. Under this assignment the officers of the corporation would have been obliged to enter the transfer on their books and issue certificates of the shares to the assignee. The property was equitably, if not legally, out of W. Sargent at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>time of the attachment, and was vested in the plaintiffs. This \u2019nterest ln the funds of the company, as represented by the certificate of shares, is something more than a chose in action,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the transfer of it by deed or by any valid assignment, is a transfer of the interest and property itself, and being completed by a record in the books of the corporation, all right of the former owner is extinguished, and the purchaser is substituted as the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">But the by-laws provide that all transfers shall be made in a book to be kept by the treasurer for that purpose, and according to a particular form therein prescribed. This is not essential to the passing of the property as between the parties, or against creditors, if the assignment is not fraudulent. It was an arrangement of the corporation for their own convenience, and is so far binding upon purchasers, that they cannot compel any payment of dividends, or insist upon certificates, without applying to have a transfer made conformably to the by-laws. Neither the act of incorporation, nor any other statute, requires that an assignment shall be recorded, in order to give it validity. Certainly the purchaser of shares, perhaps at a distance from the books of the company, shall have a reasonable time to apply to the office to procure a registry of the transfer; and yet this attachment was made the very next day after the assignment was made. It is true that no application was made to the treasurer by the plaintiffs until a fortnight after the assignment was made, but this could not be important except as evidence of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">In the case of <em>Sargent et al. </em>v. <em>The Franklin Ins. Co. </em>8 Pick. 90, an assignment by a stockholder was held to pass the property in the shares, although there had been no transfer entered in the books according to a by-law similar to that in the pres\u00e9nt case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\"> See <em>Harris v.
