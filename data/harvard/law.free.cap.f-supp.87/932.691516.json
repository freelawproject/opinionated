S. ex rel. Potash v. District Director of Immigration and Naturalization at Port of New York, 169 F.2d 747, and U. S. ex rel. Doyle v. District Director of Immigration and Naturalization at Port of New York, 169 F.2d 753, and the more recent case decided September 30, 1949, entitled U. S. ex rel. Pirinsky v. Shaughnessy, 177 F.2d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">The Court will enter an -order in this case, in form to be later settled and entered, requiring that if the petitioner presents to the District Director of Immigration and Naturalization a good and sufficient bail or bond, to be approved by said Director, in the penal sum of $5000, conditioned in the usual manner, thereupon the petitioner shall be released on such bail or bond. That bail or bond may be cash or it may be a surety bond on which an approved commercial corporate surety is the surety.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
