Appellant Union, as certified bargaining representative of the companies\u2019 employees, filed with the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board a charge of unfair labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act. The Regional Director informed the parties on March 2, 1962, that it had been \u201cdecided not to issue a complaint\u201d, but he did not dismiss the Union\u2019s charge. He said \u201cin the present posture of the case the County is the employer\u201d, and \u201cthe statutory exemption in \u00a7 2(2) of the National Labor Relations Act is applicable\u201d; but he also said the outcome of \u201cpending litigation in the Florida State Court * * * may conceivably have an impact on the unfair labor practices charge\u201d. He concluded: \u201cFor that reason, and in order to permit a reexamination of the charge in the light of the final outcome of the State Court litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tion and to avoid prejudicing the rights of the charging parties under the National Labor Relations Act\u2019s 6-month statute of limitations, the charge will not be dismissed at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">On June 21, 1962, the General Counsel <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> informed the parties: \u201cIt has been concluded that, under the circumstances here disclosed, and for the reasons specified by the Director in his letter to the parties dated March 2, 1962, insufficient basis exists for the issuance of complaint at this time. Accordingly, this matter is being remanded to the Director with instructions to adhere to the procedure set forth in his letter of March 2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">On November 7, 1962, the Union brought this suit in the District Court against the General Counsel, seeking a judgment that the transit system and Dade County are not exempt from the prohibitions imposed upon employers by \u00a7 8 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The Act gives the General Counsel discretion, independent of the courts, regarding charges of unfair labor practices. Retail Store Employees Union, etc. v. Rothman, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 2, 298 F.2d 330 (1962), and eases cited. The General Counsel\u2019s decision to defer action on the Union\u2019s charge was within this discretion. The Union relies on very different cases, e. g., Office Employees International Union, etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 353 U.S. 313, 315, 77 S.Ct. 799, 800, 1 L.Ed.2d 846 (1957). In that case the Board \u201cengrafted a blanket exemption upon the Act\u201d. We affirm the District Court\u2019s action because we think the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\">. By Section 3(d) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 139 (1947), 73 Stat. 542 (1959), 29 U.S.C., Supp. IV, \u00a7 153(d), the General Counsel, who is appointed by the President, is given \u201cfinal authority, on behalf of the Board, in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints * * * and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the Board * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
