Defendant argues that inasmuch as the jury did not know that a conviction carried with it a mandatory sentence, the Court\u2019s willingness to accept a mercy recommendation might have persuaded them the more easily to agree to a conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-15\">\u201cWhether or not the Court answered the question from the jury in the absence of defense counsel is sharply disputed by government counsel who states defendant\u2019s counsel was present and did not object. It has been this Court\u2019s invariable practice not to answer notes sent by a jury while deliberating without consulting both counsel. This, together with government counsel\u2019s memory of the affair makes the Court feel that defense counsel is mistaken in his assertion. <em>The record is unfortunately silent and the Court has forgotten. </em>In any event, even defense counsel agrees that <em>before </em>the jury returned to the box to give its verdict, <em>the Court advised defense counsel </em>it had instructed the jury that it might make a recommendation of leniency, and defense counsel, neither at that point nor <em>after </em>the jury had returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation of mercy, took any exception to the Court\u2019s alleged action. \u201cMoreover, the Court doubts the action was prejudicial. Although the sentence was mandatory, the Court could have imposed a wide range of penalties over and above five years. * * * \u201d (emphasis supplied except with respect to the word \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d which were emphasized by the trial judge)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">That the jury did make inquiry of the trial judge and that he replied to it is evidenced by the trial transcript at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>point the jury\u2019s verdict was received. After the foreman of the jury had returned its verdict of guilty on the six counts of the indictment he said to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201cMay we recommend leniency?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">The trial judge replied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cThe Court will accept the recommendation of mercy. As <em>I said to you, </em>however, the Court must in cases like this feel free to disregard it if it desires.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The foreman then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cWe realize that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">The record discloses that the defend.-ant\u2019s trial commenced January 13, 1961; the case was sent to the jury on January 17th and it continued its deliberations \u2022throughout January 18th and returned its verdict on January 19th. Defendant timely moved for a judgment of acquittal \u2022or in the alternative for a new trial, assigning inter alia the giving of instructions to the jury in his absence and that \u2022of his counsel. Oral argument on the motions was had January 8, 1962. On January 31, 1962 the trial judge wrote \u2022to counsel for the defendant and the \u2022government<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stating that he had \u201cno \u2022memory of the incident whatsoever\u201d and requested that he be advised \u201cwhether, in fact, this incident actually occurred.\u201d On the same day the assistant United States Attorney who had prosecuted the case, wrote to the trial judge <em>that he had, in chambers, advised defendants counsel </em>and the prosecutor, .of receipt of the jury\u2019s inquiry as to whether they could recommend mercy and that he was \u201csending back word\u201d that he would accept such a request but reserved the right to ignore it; that both counsel had made no objection at the time. On February 2, 1962 defendant\u2019s counsel wrote to the trial judge taking issue with \u201cthe faulty recollection\u201d of government counsel and stating that he was first advised of the communication with the jury a few minutes before the jury returned its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">The letters, it should be observed, were made part of the record below, and the trial judge adverted to them in his Memorandum Opinion, as earlier indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-18\">What has been said establishes that there was an inquiry from the jury with respect to a recommendation of leniency and that the trial judge replied to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-19\">From the welter of contradiction as to whether or not the defendant\u2019s counsel was timely advised of the jury\u2019s inquiry and the trial judge\u2019s reply before he made it there emerges this undisputed critical <em>fact </em>\u2014 the <em>defendant was not present when the inquiry was received and 'when it was answered by the trial judge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-20\"> It was settled as long ago as 1892, in Lewis v. United States, 146 U.S. 370, 372, 13 S.Ct. 136, 137, 36 L.Ed. 1011, that \u201cafter indictment found, noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ing shall be done in the absence of the prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in restatement of existing law, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u201cThe defendant shall be present at the arraignment, at every stage of the trial including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, except as otherwise provided by these rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In Evans v. United States, 284 F.2d 393 (6 Cir. 1960) the defendant\u2019s conviction of violation of the narcotics laws was reversed because the trial judge gave additional instructions to the jury in response to its request in the absence of the defendant even though the instructions were given in open court and in the presence of the defendant\u2019s counsel and the instructions were later repeated in the defendant\u2019s presence. In reversing the appellate court cited Rule 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In United States v. Noble, 155 F.2d 315 (3 Cir. 1946) we held (p. 318):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cIt is * * * essential that all instructions to the jury be given by the trial judge orally in the presence of counsel and the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Although not necessary to our disposition, in view of the settled law, we must note the lack of merit in the government\u2019s contention that assuming both the defendant and his counsel were not present when the mooted additional instruction was given it was \u201charmless error\u201d since \u201cno substantial right of the defendant was affected\u201d in view of the fact that he was given the minimum sentence of five years. This contention ignores the fact that this jury was deadlocked for a two-day period on the issue of the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and the fact-of-life that one or more of the jurymen might have been persuaded to \u201cgo along\u201d with the guilty verdict in the mistaken belief that the \u201cleniency\u201d recommendation would result in nothing more than a suspended sentence or a few months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">In view of our disposition it is unnecessary to consider the point presented with respect to the contention that the trial judge erred in his instructions on the score of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">For the reasons stated the judgment of conviction and sentence will be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to proceed in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-13\">. Defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment on each of the six counts of the indictment, to run concurrently. Three of the counts charged illegal sale of narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174; three, illegal sale of narcotics without a written order on a form issued by the Secretary of the Treasury in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-11\"><em>. </em>The trial judge\u2019s letter follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">\u201cIn considering the motion for new trial in the above matter, I noticed in the \u2019briefs the point involving alleged instructions by the Judge, outside the presence \u25a0of defense counsel, pursuant to a note \u2022from the jury. This note apparently asked whether it was permissible to recommend mercy in returning a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">\u201cI overlooked this point in reading the \u2022briefs and, to my memory, neither counsel argued it at the motion for new trial in Philadelphia recently. However, in coming across it in the briefs, I am disturbed because I have no memory of the incident whatsoever. The record does not seem to reflect it and yet defense counsel \u25a0seems to have heard of it and government counsel answers the defendant\u2019s brief on this point as if the incident actually occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-22\">\u201cI should like to be advised either by the Clerk of the Court who was in the trial, the reporter who took the notes, or the United States Attorney who prosecuted the case, whether, in fact, this incident actually occurred. It seems curious that I would have done a thing such as this which is completely at odds with my normal practice of never instructing a jury on any point without the presence of both counsel. However, if I did do so in this case, I would like to be advised to that effect and will thereafter come to some conclusion on point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-23\">\u201cVery sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-24\">\u201cCRL, 3rd:p</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-25\">\u201ccc: Mr. Gilbert W.
