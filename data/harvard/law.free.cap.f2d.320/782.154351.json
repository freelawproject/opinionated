S. Atty., Frank Q. Nebeker, Donald S. Smith and Robert A. Levetown, Asst. U. S. Attys., submitted on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b829-11\">Before Bazelon, Chief Judge, Edger-ton, Senior Circuit Judge, and Wright, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b829-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">Appellant was convicted on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and mayhem, and sentenced to concurrent terms of 2^ to 9 years imprisonment on each charge. His chief complaint in this appeal is that the trial court\u2019s instruction on flight, which was not objected to below, constituted plain error requiring reversal under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-20\">At trial, the complaining witness identified appellant as his assailant. A bystander testified that immediately prior to the assault he observed appellant following the complaining witness, that he then lost sight of the pair but that shortly thereafter he saw appellant running \u2014 - his shirt stained with blood \u2014 and that he \u201cran into me\u201d and continued running away. A second bystander corroborated the testimony that appellant ran away from the scene of the crime. Appellant, claiming that this was a case of mistaken identification, took the stand and testified to an alibi: that he was in a certain poolroom at the time of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-21\">The trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury included the statement \u201cthat if a person flees from the scene of a crime for the purpose of avoiding arrest, or apprehension or prosecution, it creates a presumption of guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This was error. Flight does not create \u201ca presumption of guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Courts have long recognized that flight is, at best, ambiguous evidence of guilt feelings;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and students of human behavior have observed that guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>feelings \u201cmay be present without actual guilt.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">If appellant had. objected to the instruction, reversal would be required. But in the circumstances of this case where the crucial issue was one of identification, the evidence of appellant\u2019s alleged flight was of such slight independent significance that we cannot characterize the instruction as plain error affecting substantial rights. Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-14\">. The complete instruction regarding flight was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-15\">\u201cThere is a rule of law that says that flight may be considered as evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-16\">\u201cThe Government, consequently, has offered testimony to you, ladies and gentlemen, alleging that this defendant fled from the scene of the crime. The defendant, of course, denies this and denies that he was seen at the scene of the crime. The significance of this evidence, however, is that if a person flees from the scene of a crime for the purpose of avoiding arrest, or apprehension or prosecution, it creates a presumption of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-17\">\u201cThis principle of law, however, is one that must be applied with some caution. I instruct you as a matter of law that flight means not merely a leaving of the scene of a crime; it means a leaving or concealment under a consciousness of guilt for the purpose of evading arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apk-dedup-0\">\u201cIf you find in your deliberations that the defendant did flee and that his conduct was induced by fear of arrest, then this action constitutes a flight from justice and you may consider it as a circumstance indicating guilt. If, on the other hand, you find that this defendant, of course, was not at the scene of this crime, this evidence alleging flight has no validity whatsoever and it creates no presumption of guilt if you find that it was not this defendant who fled from the scene of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-24\">.
