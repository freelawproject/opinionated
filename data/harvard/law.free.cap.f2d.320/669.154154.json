The officers, in their search, found narcotics in a ceiling light fixture and in a shoe belonging to appellant, the shoe being located \u201cdirectly beneath the [appellant], who was seated on the bed there.\u201d The arresting officers testified that appellant stated \u201cthat everything in the room was his, that all the narcotics and capsules were his,\u201d and one of the officers testified that appellant admitted that the room was his. Appellant, who took the stand, admitted the search and the finding of the narcotics in the ceiling light fixture, and stated that the officers picked up an envelope near his shoes. He denied that he made any admissions that he owned the narcotics and, while he denied paying rent for the room or possessing the key to it, he admitted staying in the room \u201cmaybe two days a week or four days a week; sometimes one day,\u201d and that on the day of the search he had been there since early in the morning. The persons in the room with him were not called as witnesses; nor was their absence accounted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-25\">Viewing the evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to the Government, we think there was ample evidence, if believed by the jury\u2014as it apparently was\u2014to show possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>We have examined the other points ably urged on us by counsel appointed by this court for appellant, and find no -error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\">Appeal No. 17,119 is an appeal allowed by this Court from an order denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Appeal No. 17,303 is a direct appeal from his conviction, allowed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Both judgments must be and are</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-26\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) (1958); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
