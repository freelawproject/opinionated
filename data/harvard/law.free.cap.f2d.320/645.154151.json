Appellee is incorporated in and has its principal place of business within the State of Washington. Appellants are incorporated in and have their principal place of business within the State of California. The matter in controversy exceeds exclusive of costs and interest, the sum of $10,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Jurisdiction on appeal rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-30\">This also involves a cross-appeal. Plaintiff below, Isaacson Ix*on Works (here both appellee and appellant) will be referred to as \u201cplaintiff\u201d or \u201cIsaac-son.\u201d Pacific States Steel Corporation and American Forge Company (here both appellees and appellants) will be referred to jointly as \u201cdefendants,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>individually as \u201cPacific\u201d or \u201cForge, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Plaintiff sued in Count I on an open book account, and in Count II on an account stated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants counterclaimed for an offset, charging defective merchandise was delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">It seems clear (and it was stipulated between the parties) that California law applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Plaintiff forged, fabricated and manufactured steel. Defendant Forge manufactured and processed steel. From 1952 on, plaintiff sold some $886,000 worth of steel to Forge, up to January 1958. In 1955, an analysis of this account, made by plaintiff, disclosed a higher proportion of rejections by defendants of plaintiff\u2019s products, as allegedly defective, than claimed by other customers. In November 1955, Isaacson refused to sell to defendants a particular type of steel (known as C-1040) except on a \u201cwithout recourse\u201d basis. Just what the two parties believe \u201cwithout recourse\u201d means will be hereafter developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The dispute here involves six purchase orders; three for \u201cC-1040 type\u201d steel, and three for non 1040 or \u201calloy\u201d steel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The latter type was not sold on a \u201cwithout recourse\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">I \u2014 THE COURT\u2019S FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">(a) That the C-1040 steel purchases here involved were by defendants from plaintiff on the specific term: \u201csubject to acceptance without recourse based on ultrasonic inspection by Isaacson.\u201d The trial court found that such purchases were so made, and made with the additional understanding that defendants waived any and all right to any and all claims for defective merchandise, except \u201cpipe or slag.\u201d (Finding 11.) The plaintiff disputes this exception, claiming the C-1040 steel was sold \u201cas is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"acg-dedup-0\">\u201cPipe\u201d is steel with holes or bubbles in it. \u201cSlag\u201d is foreign material found within steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">Forge did not use the steel delivered to it immediately. In certain instances,' when attempting to later put this delivered steel to use, it allegedly discovered the steel to be of non-forging quality, and useless save for scrap.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-19\">(b) That plaintiff\u2019s ledger sheets (Ex. 1) constituted an open book account; that defendants became indebted to plaintiff for items furnished from November 1, 1957 to January 30, 1958 (save the last six items dated December 31, 1958); that the unpaid balance was $13,023.77; that this had been demanded and was unpaid. (Findings 5, 6 and 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">(c) That there was no account stated between plaintiff and Defendant Forge on April 31, 1957, for $56,449.77, or on January 31, 1958, in the sum of $28,-402.75. (Findings 8 and 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-21\">(d) That defendant Forge <em>was </em>entitled to an offset in the sum of $323.73 for authorized expenditures. (Defendant\u2019s Purchase Order 1929; Plaintiff\u2019s Invoice 9403. Finding 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-22\">(e) That defendants were entitled to an offset of $5,101.38 for C-1040 steel purchased (P.O. S-893; Plaintiff\u2019s Inv. 9868(b)) because of \u201cpipe\u201d in said steel. (Finding 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-23\">(f) That defendants <em>were not </em>entitled to offsets with respect to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">(1) Defendants\u2019 P.O. S-744 Plaintiff\u2019s Inv.

Was there an open book account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">2. Does the plaintiff rely on so-called \u201cdisputed\u201d or \u201cundisputed\u201d items of the account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">3. Did the court err in casting the burden of proof on defendants with respect to \u201cdisputed\u201d items, requiring them to be raised by counterclaim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">4. Was the ultrasonic inspection of the C-1040 items (and <em>proof </em>thereof) a condition precedent to recovery on such items?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-13\">5. Was there error in the court failing to find upon the chemical specifications for the C-1040 steel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-21\">6. Was there error in failing to find on Purchase Order S-745, in the sum of $1,900.51, in view of the special agreement to settle this dispute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-22\">Appellant Forge raises four other general \u201cbasic questions\u201d as to the findings (whether they are clearly erroneous, sufficiently explicit, binding on this court if based on documentary evidence, binding on this court if erroneous in law, and finally a fifth: \u201cthe effect of plaintiff\u2019s failure to produce [certain] key witnesses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-23\">Plaintiff Isaacson agrees upon the six legal questions above presented, but prefers to frame them in different language.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also raises a different basic question: \u201cHow can a seller, after experiencing an inordinately large amount and number of claims from a buyer, protect himself from such unjustified claims if the buyer is not bound by the terms of an agreement between the parties calculated to prevent this very abuse?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-24\">B. <em>Was There an Open Book Account?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-25\">Defendant Forge first recognizes the force and validity of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That general rule is inapplicable, however (urges Forge), (a) if the reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>court, on the entire evidence, is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed; (b) where the finding largely rests on documentary evidence; (c) where the finding is induced by an erroneous view of the law. These are all sound legal principles, and we reaffirm them. The problem is whether they are, singly or jointly, here controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">An open book account, urges Forge, did not exist here, because the ledger sheets do not set forth \u201cthe requisite of the history of the transaction,\u201d or \u201ca detailed statement\u201d; hence, are allegedly fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The extent of what need and need not be shown on an open book account is largely, as in so many evidentiary matters, a matter of degree, the determination of which is a matter lying within the judicial discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 337a, was admittedly added in 1959,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and was not retroactive in effect, but both parties agree it merely codifies the pre-existing case law of California on the subject. Agreeing on the law, Forge urges there was \u201cinsufficient history of the transaction,\u201d no \u201cdetailed statement,\u201d nothing to show the \u201cnature of the transaction.\u201d It quotes from Tillson v. Peters, 1940, 41 Cal.App.2d 671, 107 P.2d 434, with partisan emphasis (its own italics underscored):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-14\"><em>\u201cThe books contain no history of the transaction </em>of the leasing of the ranch under which the installments of rental were paid. Neither <em>the nature </em>or amount of the original indebtedness, nor any unpaid installments of rental were entered in the books. <em>The book entries did not purport to record the nature of the transaction, </em>nor the debits and credits of the respective parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">Plaintiff Isaacson, with the same partisan assurance, urges that its ledger cards \u201cmeet <em>every </em>requirement of that Code section,\u201d and specify the detail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The trial court thought, as we think, that the alleged open book account was a sufficiently \u201cdetailed statement, kept in a book, in the nature of debit and credit,\u201d (to quote Wright v. Loaiza, 1918, 177 Cal. 605, 171 P. 311), a case heavily relied upon by each side. And see the peculiar facts of Tillson v. Peters, supra, 41 Cal. App. at 677 and 678, 107 P.2d at 437 and 438. Further, we think the record here discloses such facts that an open book account could well have been implied from the conduct of the parties: that they had <em>agreed </em>that their various transactions \u201cshould be the subject of an account between them.\u201d Cf. Warda v. Schmidt, 1956, 146 Cal.App.2d 234, 303 P.2d 762. See also Costello v. Bank of America, N.T. &amp; S.A., 9 Cir. 1957, 246 F.2d 807, 812; Parker v. Shell Oil Co., 1946, 29 Cal.2d 503, 507, 175 P.2d 838; Millet v. Bradbury, 1895, 109 Cal. 170, 41 P. 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">We cannot see our way clear to hold on this issue the trial court was clearly erroneous, nor that it did utilize any erroneous theory of law, nor are we left with any firm or definite conviction that a mistake was committed by the trier of fact. The'finding there was an open book account is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">C. Was <em>There a Mistake Made by the Court as to the So-Called \u201cDisputed Items\u201d? \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">We think not, nor do we think it necessary to discuss this phase of the appeal in great detail. Paragraphs five and six of the first count of the first amended complaint plead an open book account. The defendant Forge urges two certain amendments (one made by order of court, Trans, pp. 365-6, line 20; Trans, p. 361, lines 14-16, upon motion of plaintiff unopposed by defendants ; the second made upon stipulation of the parties, Trans, p. 315, lines 2-25) \u201cdid not erase the controlling effect of earlier pleaded language.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">By such reasoning, defendants urge, so we understand, that the pleading of the open book account was defective and improperly sustained as to the burden of proof \u2014 that plaintiff established an open book account for so-called \u201cundisputed items,\u201d but not for \u201cdisputed items.\u201d Defendants emphasize certain testimony that Edenholm (credit manager for Isaacson) \u201clet slip\u201d that the \u201cdisputed items\u201d were not paid or settled, yet in the next breath, defendants quote his contrary testimony. This conflict is one of fact and credibility, for the trier of facts to decide. From Edenholm\u2019s testimony that he made entries on the ledger cards only when authorized by Mr. Isaacson, defendants maintain the entries in the account were \u201ctentative\u201d only; and that the monthly statements sent by plaintiff to defendant Forge could not be considered \u201cdemands\u201d \u2014thus sustaining there was no demand for the payment of the undisputed items appearing on the open book account.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">Although appellants purport to quote in their brief <em>all </em>the relevant evidence on the subject of the open book account,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> appellee points out ten \u201csalient points\u201d in the evidence omitted by appellants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Some one or more of these points, at least, <em>are </em>salient and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We agree with appellee that the finding an open book account existed, and the amount of it, is, despite some contrary evidence, fully, fairly and amply sustained by the evidence, and no improper shifting of the burden of proof was permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">D. <em>Were the Findings in Error With Respect to the Two C-10A0 Steel Orders for Which Plaintiff Recovered? I. e., Was an Ultrasonic Inspection, and Proof Thereof, a Condition Precedent to Plaintiff\u2019s Recovery?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">We hold the findings were not in error, that the performance of <em>any particular kind </em>of an ultrasonic test was not a condition precedent; that even if we\u2018 were to find that some ultrasonic test,, as determined and established by the seller, was a condition precedent, that, condition precedent had been complied <em>with </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that there was sufficient sub-, stantial proof of such tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Though interspersed with argument, we quote as a fair summary of the record, in the margin, a portion of plaintiff\u2019s brief on the subject.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>that may be said for defendants\u2019 argument here is that it is based on negative factors (that Hargis did <em>not </em>testify as to ultrasonic tests; that Dahl, who performed the tests, was <em>not called </em>to testify; that Rodgers was <em>not present </em>when the tests were made, etc., etc.) This may attack the convincing effectiveness of the existing positive testimony that such tests were made, but it does not destroy it. Defendants\u2019 statement \u201cthere is no evidence of any [ultrasonic] inspection\u201d simply is not a correct statement of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">E. <em>Was There Error in the Court\u2019s Failing to Find Upon the Chemical Specifications of C-10b0 Steel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Defendants claim Finding 13 is in error (relating to Debit Memo 502, Def\u2019s Ex. D-3, and P.O. S-744, Def\u2019s Ex. R) for $3,135.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">Here defendants-appellants\u2019 position is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\">\u201cDefendants contend that Isaac-son so greatly exceeded the chemistry requirements of the P.O., the steel supplied having a carbon content of .51 to .52, rather than .40 to .45 as ordered, that the steel was worthless except for scrap purposes and indeed was not C-1040 steel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-13\">\u201cThe Court, however, was of the view that the \u2018without recourse\u2019 proviso precluded Forge from showing any defects in steel other than such as might be discovered by an ultrasonics inspection, to-wit, \u2018pipe\u2019 or slag, notwithstanding the fact the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Court expressly recognized that an ultrasonics inspection would not show chemistry deficiencies or excesses and notwithstanding the further fact that nothing done by Forge could alter the chemical content of the steel as furnished by plaintiff. \u2022 Thus, the Court stated that the \u2018non-recourse\u2019 language would permit defendants <em>only to go into that aspect of defects which would have been shown by ultrasonic tests. </em>Since the ultrasonic tests would not have disclosed chemistry, the Court opined any complaint as to chemistry was precluded by the \u2018no recourse\u2019 language: that with regard to chemistry, that is just what the \u2018no recourse\u2019 meant; as to chemistry, the \u2018without recourse\u2019 provision is a limitation (p. 1081, line 12 to p. 1087, line 12.)\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief, pp. 89-40. (Emphasis by appellants.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We find no merit in this because we find no condition precedent existed, other than ultrasonic inspection. We need not consider the plaintiff\u2019s argument as to the number and effect of heat operations applied to the steel after delivery,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or the integrity of the tests.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The evidence was conflicting as to the chemical nature of the steel delivered. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Finding 15, covering the C-1040 steel item of $817.09, which the court would not allow as an offset, is next attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">This finding by defendants\u2019 specific admission (Opening Br. p. 45) rests on disputed evidence. To quote defendants\u2019 expert witness\u2019 testimony in detail, and next characterize the contradictory testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witness as \u201cweak,\u201d actually graphically portrays the weakness of defendants-appellants\u2019 position on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">F. We come to the sixth question \u2014 the findings of the court<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that defendants had failed to prove their right to offsets with respect to alloy steel (Debit Memo 503; P.O. S-745 for $1,-900.57; and Debit Memo 201, P.O. S-5408 for $1,746.02 \u2014 Def\u2019s Exs. D-2, AA, D-5 and AD, respectively).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">On the first of these items \u2014 the rejected billet was returned to Isaacson because of cracks. Tests were made to determine their cause. Hargis (for plaintiff) reported the acid-etched macro-sample produced a picture which indicated a great number of bursts originating from the center as well as the outside, which indicated a \u201ctremendous thermal condition must have <em>occurred\u201d </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>blaming the condition found on the heating procedures used by Forge. Forge insisted it had placed the 12' to 15' long, 24\" square billet, only five feet into the furnace; <em>i. e., </em>that the crack outside the portion not put in the furnace must have been due to an inherent defect in the steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">On September 18, 1957, there was an oral agreement that plaintiff was to make another \u201cmacro-etch\u201d <em>towards </em>the tong-hold; and if it showed the same defect as the first macro-etch, this would substantiate Forge\u2019s position, and if it showed no defect, it would support Isaac-son\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">This oral agreement, says Forge, was confirmed by a letter dated October 29, 1957 (Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 1). This letter is self-explanatory, and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-14\">\u201cOn September 18, 1957, Ed Rodgers and the writer visited you, Jerry Thorp, Walt Riddle and Claude Roberts at Niles. During the discussion about subject billet, it was agreed that we were to make another macro etch <em>towards the tong hold. </em>If this second etch <em>(beyond zone subject to any heat) </em>were in the <em>same condition </em>as original picture submitted with our letter of 9/9/57, then Isaacson Iron Works would acknowledge your claim; but if not, then American Forge Company would withdraw the claim (Debit 503). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\u201cIn our letter of 9/9/57 we stated that the original macro etch was taken in that portion \u2018just beyond the point where the furnace door was\u2019 <em>which is in error, </em>rather the <em>macro was 18\" aiuay from tonghold. </em>The second macro etch is taken in the center of the tonghold (photo enclosed) and shows good material.\u201d (Emphasis appellants\u2019.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">\u201cIt is conclusive,\u201d says Forge, \u201cthat if the earlier picture in reality * * * had been taken of a \u2018cut\u2019 or sample from the unheated portion, <em>i. e., toward the tonghold </em>a portion * * * [of] the defect would have been shown to have existed in the unheated portion of the billet.\u201d This assumes, of course, that the billet was of sufficient length <em>to possess an unheated portion. </em>The length of the billet was thus critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Isaacson\u2019s answer to this is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It points out that while <em>two </em>macro-etch photos were placed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>evidence, <em>three </em>were testified to and about.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Suffice it to say, we must conclude there was a conflict in the evidence from which the trier of fact made a determination. His findings are supported by substantial and ample evidence, which we are not authorized to disturb.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">G. With respect to Finding 16, no comment is required by this court to find support for it. Appellants agree \u201cthe witnesses on both sides did not take too positive a position as to the cause of the crack.\u201d Defendant-appellant Forge did not carry its burden of proof raised by its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">As to all questions raised by defend\u25a0ants-appellants Pacific and Forge, the .judgment of the court below is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Ill \u2014 ISAACSON\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-1\">Three specifications of error are relied on by plaintiff-appellant, which are presented in the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">1. \u201cIs Isaacson entitled to an award of interest from the' date that payment was due until date of Judgment, on that portion of Isaacson\u2019s claim not offset by Forge\u2019s counterclaim ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">2. \u201cWere \u2018pipe or slag\u2019 exceptions to Forge\u2019s waiver of all right to any claims for defective merchandise, when ordering C-1040 steel in 1956 on terms of \u2018subject to acceptance without recourse\u2019?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">\u25a03. \u201cWas there an account stated between Plaintiff and Defendant American Forge Co. on April 30, 1957, and was there an account stated between Plaintiff and Defendant American Forge Co. on January 31, 1958?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">A. <em>Interest</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">The court below found the open book account sued on in Count I was $13,023.77; that this amount was \u201cascertainable and certain,\u201d but that the amount of the claimed offset was in dispute \u2014 though claimed at the same figure, $13,023.77.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">We think the offset was as \u201cascertainable and certain,\u201d and to the same effect and degree, as the amount claimed on the open book account. Appellant Isaacson characterizes his open book account as \u201cascertainable\u201d; the offset as \u201cunascer-tainable.\u201d We think one as certain \u2014 and as ascertainable (subject to the wisdom of the trial court in allowing or disallowing each item of either) as the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">When <em>a contract </em>is sued upon and an offset claimed, then one may well refer to the sum due under the contract as liquidated, and the offset as unliquidated.

The parties to a contract have ascertained and specified the amount to be claimed when they enter into it \u2014 not so with a running open book account.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-18\">The trial judge relied upon 1 Cal.Jur. 2 \u2014 \u201cAccounts and Accounting,\u201d sec. 40, p. 363:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-19\">\u201cWith respect to the allowance of interest, <em>accounts </em>ordinarily draw interest <em>only from the day on which they are settled and a balance is ascertained. </em>The provision of the Civil Code [note] that every person who is entitled to recover damages that are certain or capable of being made certain by calculation, the right to which is vested in him upon a particular date, may also recover interest thereon from that date, has no <em>application to actions to recover upon an open book </em>or mutual account that was never settled or balanced, or to the items of the account as they become due, even though the claim be for goods sold and delivered.\u201d (Emphasis appellants\u2019.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Defendants-appellees correctly point out that the cases cited by Isaacson are contract cases, not open book account cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The trial court also cited Arocena v.

To agree to accept steel, without recourse, still requires the manufacturer to deliver steel, and not a substitute therefor \u2014 not pure slag, for example. Isaacson\u2019s \u201cabsolute\u201d argument would render the dealings illusory. Isaacson recognizes this when it states it did not intend to ship material containing pipe or slag; or steel of a non-forging quality. The conduct of the parties<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> indicates Isaacson adopted, as it should have, a lesser position than a right to ship Forge anything it desired to ship \u2014 whether forgeable steel or non-forgeable steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Further, the written expression of Isaacson\u2019s understanding of the meaning of the term \u201cwithout recourse\u201d \u2014 and particularly the one sentence most emphasized by plaintiff-appellant Isaacson in Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 11, clearly discloses it was \u201cevery bit of hazard <em>connected with their use </em>[referring to \u201ctorching,\u201d \u201cand several other major factors entering into proper handling\u201d] was yours\u201d; meaning Forge\u2019s use of the steel.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> To hold that Isaacson had no duty other than to deliver whatever conglomerate it desired, calling it marketable steel, would, as we stated, render the contract totally illusory.

Hargis, Jr., Forging Sales Manager for Isaacson since 1947 (Trans, p. 1026, lines 17-23) advised Forge\u2019s General Manager (Spaich) and its Purchasing Agent (Thorpe) that from that date forward, Isaacson \u2018would accept orders only upon an <em>acceptance without recourse </em>basis\u2019 (Trans, p. 1038, line 22 to p. 1039, line 5), and would sell 0-1040 steel to Forge only if Forge would \u2018accept the billets <em>\u201cas is,\u201d </em>and would waive any right to place a claim against it.\u2019 (Trans, p. 1040, lines 2-5). This demand by Isaacson resulted from a review of its prior sales to Forge and claims by Forge, which disclosed that Forge had a magnitude of claims, compared with other customers, to the extent that Isaacson\u2019s Forging Sales Manager questioned whether it was profitable to do business with Forge (Trans, p. 1031, lines 14-24). Hargis\u2019 examination disclosed that Forge\u2019s <em>claim ratio </em>(tonnage of claims as against tonnage sold) was <em>approximately twice as much as the customer ^oith the next highest claim ratio </em>(Trans, p. 1031, line 25 to p. 1033, line 8). After this information was discussed and reviewed by Isaacson\u2019s Management (Trans, p. 1033, lines 17-18), a decision was reached as to the terms of future sales to Forge (Trans, p. 1034, lines 3-16), this decision was communicated to Forge\u2019s General Manager (Spaich) and its Purchasing Agent (Thorpe) as heretofore described.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\u201cThe true and uncontroverted nature and terms of the agreement between,the parties is clearly set forth in the letter from Hargis to Forge, Attention Forge\u2019s General Manager Milo Spaich, dated November 18, 1955 (Pi\u2019s. Ex. 11) which reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">\u201c \u2018Approximately two years ago we shipped some heavy 1040 billets to you which were to be made into crankshafting. The difficulty encountered in producing your crankshafting resulted in quite a controversy between us, and in our finally allowing you quite a large credit. To prevent this from ever occurring again, we <em>refused to sell </em>you any billets of 1040 when we felt certain the end would be crankshafting, wherein torching and several other major factors entering into the proper handling of 1040 are disastrous, if not done in the proper manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">\u201c \u2018We have your order #S-603 for two large cranksliafting billets forged to shape and of 1040 steel. This order does not call for \u201cAcceptance Without Recourse,\u201d and in the face of what has happened to your order S-525, <em>we now ash that you cancel this order </em>S-603 without cost to you, although one of these forgings is completely finished, including heat treatment, <em>unless </em>you change your order to read the same as the previous one \u2014 \u201cAcceptance As Is Without Recourse.\u201d \u2019 (Trans, p. 1044, to p. 1046.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">\u201cSpaich\u2019s reply (to Hargis\u2019 letter of November 18, 1955) dated November 30, 1955 (Pi\u2019s. Ex. 12), confirms the testimony of Hargis when it says, \u2018We are cognizant of the fact that certain 1040 billets which you supplied to us were supplied on the basis of \u201cWithout Recourse\u201d,\u2019 and where it says, \u2018If your position, however, is to stand on the original terms to which the order was accepted, we have no alternative but to abide by your decision. * * * \u2019 (Trans, p. 1049, lines 3-6 and lines 16-19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">\u201cThe nature of Isaacson\u2019s attitude toward Forge\u2019s claims, and its reaction to Forge\u2019s arbitrary and unauthorized deductions is amply described by Isaacson\u2019s curt demand that Forge \u2018clear up their account\u2019 and that \u2018any future sales would be on a O.O.D. basis.\u2019 (Trans, p. 1052, lines 3-9). The unreasonableness of Forge\u2019s position and Isaacson\u2019s deep concern and dissatisfaction with Forge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>claims is emphasized by the fact that Hargis in his twenty-six years with Isaacson, fifteen as Forging Sales Manager (Trans, p. 1026, lines 14-23), had <em>never </em>instituted or demanded such severe terms, on <em>any </em>other customer of Isaacson because of claim problems (Trans, p. 1052, lines 10-18), and the testimony of ' Rodgers, Isaacson\u2019s Forge Shop Superintendent (Trans, p. 718, lines 3-5), on cross-examination that he did not know of <em>any </em>other instance in which Isaacson imposed \u2018without recourse\u2019 requirements on <em>any </em>other customer (Trans, p. 781, lines 13-18).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\u201cThus it was clearly established, that it was the agreement and intent of the parties upon Isaacson\u2019s insistence and demand that Isaacson be absolved and released of <em>any </em>responsibility, that Forge purchased the steel involved on an \u2018as is\u2019 basis and \u2018waived any right to place a claim against it.\u2019 (Trans, p. 1040, lines 2-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">\u201cThe ultrasonic test term terminology was introduced by Isaacson to insure in their own mind that they were shipping \u25a0 good steel (Trans, p. 1040, line 23 to p. 1041, line 10). That is, it was introduced by Isaacson as a self imposed check on themselves for their own purposes, even though they did not deem it necessary to conduct such tests on steel from which they themselves made crankshafts (Trans, p. 865, line 25 to p. 867, line 2). No specific or particular ultrasonic test or specific method of ultrasonic testing was requested or demanded by Forge, nor was any specific or particular test or method of testing agreed upon by the parties (Trans, p. 1041, lines 11-16). Forge presented no evidence that contradicted this direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">\u201cRodgers, Isaacson\u2019s Forge Shop Superintendent, testified that Isaacson had <em>one </em>standard of ultrasonic testing, which is applied to all material regardless of whether Isaacson intended to use it or it was being shipped to another user, that is to say, Isaacson did <em>not </em>have a better test for material which it intended to use and a poorer test for material which it sold to others (Trans, p. 865, lines 4-24).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">\u201cDespite Forge\u2019s statement to the contrary in its Brief, there <em>was </em>evidence of ultrasonic inspections. Rodgers testified, uncontradicted by Forge, that the 0-1040 steel shipped to Forge <em>was submitted to the standard ultrasonic inspection conducted by Isaacson at that time, performed by his laboratory metallurgical department under Ms direction and conti-ol, </em>and that it consisted of preparation (rough grinding) of the billet, application of the testing fluid and scanning through either the flat surface or two adjacent sides of the billet (Trans, p. 867, line 25, to p. 872, line 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">\u201cForge presented <em>no evidence </em>that an ultrasonic test had not been performed at and by Isaacson, in fact Forge admitted that <em>all </em>of the C-1040 steel received by it had the \u2018rough grinding\u2019 that accompanies an ultrasonic test (Trans, p. 540, liner 21 to p. 541, line 3; p. 566, lines 14r-19; p. 583, lines 8-13).\u201d (Isaacson\u2019s Br. pp. 27-31.)

On direct examination he testified that the piece of steel in question was <em>\u201815 feet long, 12 or 15 perhaps.\u2019 </em>(Trans, p. 613, line 8), whereas on cross-examination he testified that he did not know how long it was and did not know if there were one or two billets in that order, he <em>thought </em>there were two, and assuming there were two of approximately equal size they would each be approximately <em>ten feet long </em>(Trans, p. 671, line 9 to p. 672, line 2). This is critical because if 5 feet of the billet was in the forging furnace (Appts.\u2019 Opening Br. p. 46), then there was only five feet extending out of the furnace, and if the heat from the forging furnace and the gas hose raised the temperature of that portion of the billet that extended outside of the furnace for <em>three feet, </em>to 800 degrees (Trans, p. 613, lines 21-24), then there are only two feet of billet left, which also must have been affected by this heating and cooling performed by Forge, thus the entire billet received and was affected by Forge\u2019s improper handling and heat treating. This refutes and virtually smashes the basis of Appellants\u2019 argument, i. e., that the billet had not been heated by Forge at a place 18 inches from the tonghold (Trans, p. 626, lines 18-19), which, measuring from the other direction would be 6 inches from where the billet was, by Riddle\u2019s own testimony, 800 degrees hot.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\u201cAppellants\u2019 own witness, Riddle, testified\u2019 that a visual examination of the billet' was conducted upon receipt of the billet, that no defect was observable or detected at that time, that the crack appeared and became visible <em>only after </em>being handled and heat treated by Forge and this longitudinal crack developed in that portion of the billet that was just immediately adjacent to the door, f. e., which reached a temperature of 1500 degrees (Trans, p. 615, lines 16-18; p. 613, lines \u2022 21-23).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">\u201cThe only direct, eyewitness testimony of this question, is that of Isaacson\u2019s Forge Shop Superintendent, Rodgers, who testified without equivocation that he saw the unused portion of the billet returned by Forge and that he <em>examined </em>it personally (Trans, p. 723, lines 17-23), that he <em>instructed </em>the \u2018Lab Department\u2019 to take two cross-sections of the billet, one next to the furnace which he identified as \u2018X\u2019 section, and another 18 inches from the tonghold (Trans, p. 726, line 4 to p. 727, line 5). Rodgers\u2019 direct, unvarying, unyielding testimony, was that the picture attached to Defendants\u2019 Ex. AC accurately portrayed the internal conditions of that billet at a section \u2018next to the furnace\u2019 and that that condition could not have arisen if this, piece of metal had not been raised to-forging temperature (Trans, p. 720, line-23 to p. 730, line 8), and that the picture portrayed tremendous thermal bursts which occur if precautionary measures are not taken to prevent it (Trans, p.. 730, lines 17-23).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">\u201cIn their argument, Appellants state that \u2018 * * * Isaacson never performed, the agreement to settle by taking an etch of a portion toward the tonghold for comparison with the original picture.\u2019 (Appts.\u2019 Opening Brief pp. 50-51). Appellants\u2019 attention is directed to Trans, p. 733, line 8, to p. 734, line 5, where Mr. Rodgers testified that, under his. instruction, a section was, in fact, taken \u2018approximately 18 inches from the tong-hold, and that the picture identified as Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 1 represents a cutout of the tonghold and that no defects were disclosed therein.\u2019, supporting Isaac-son\u2019s position, that the portion of the-billet not subjected to heat by Forge was not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">In summary, Rodgers\u2019 direct testimony of his own observations proves that the portions of billet closest to Forge\u2019s, furnace disclosed tremendous thermal bursts, the portion farther away (i. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>18\" from the tonghold) showed a crack, with a small related crack adjacent, and the section farthest away from the furnace (i. e. in the tonghold), and not affected hy Forge\u2019s heating operation, \u25a0showed no defects, with the unalterable conclusion that the defects were caused by, and emanated from Forge\u2019s mishandling in their heating process.\u201d (Isaac-son\u2019s Br. pp. 37-39.
