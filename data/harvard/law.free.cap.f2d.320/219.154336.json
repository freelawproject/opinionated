He alleged that a news dis-patchTiransmitted by defendant on October 17, 19.58, under an Atlanta, Georgia, dateline, which reported the dynamiting of an Atlanta synagogue, contained a defamatory reference to him as a \u201c \u2018fat cat\u2019 financier\u201d of anti-Semitic terrorist activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint did not allege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the dispatch was printed or broadcast in Vermont, although we do read it as alleging the transmission ,o\u00a3 the dispatch to UPI\u2019s subscribers ..there. Neither did the complaint allege that Arrowsmith was known to anyone in Vermont, that he had any \u201creputation\u201d in that state, or that such \u201cpublication\u201d as occurred in Vermont resulted in any injury to him in any state where he did have a reputation. The complaint sought \u201cgeneral damages\u201d of $56,280,000, a sum calculated at $JLQ,000 for each_of_UEL\u2019fi_Sffii!8 subscribers in the United States and foreign countries. Although the record does not reveal why the action was brought in Vermont, a quite sufficient, explanation can be perceived by taking appropriate account of the dates recited in the first two sentences of this opinion, of Vermont\u2019s three-year statute of limitations for libel, 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 512(3), and of the much shorter ones of other states.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">UPI moved under F.R.Civ.Proc._12(b)___ to dismiss on various grounds, including lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, and failure of the complaint (primarily because_it~alleged no special damages)..^ state a claim upon which relief could be granted? Judge Gibson .sustained the last mentioned, ground; he did not pass on the first two. 205 F.Supp. 56 (D.Vt.1962). Plaintiff.appeals from the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">We all agree it was error for the district court to proceed as it did. Not only does logic compel initial consideration of the issue of jurisdiction over the defendant \u2014 a .court without such jurisdiction lacks power_ to_ dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\u2014 'but the functional difference that flows from the ground selected for dismissal likewise compels considering jurisdiction^ and venue questions first. A dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or improper venue does not preclude a subsequent action in an appropriate forum, whereas a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is with prejudice. We shall therefore vacate the judgment dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and remand the case for consideration of the issue of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant and, in the event that this be found, the issue of venue, prior to consideration of the merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so remanding it is incumbent on us to decide what standard should govern the judge\u2019s determination as to tile)jurisdiction of the District Court for Vermont over the person of the foreign corporation \u2014 .defendant\u2014in ' particular, whether a \u201cstate\u201d or a \u201cfederal\u201d standard should here be applied. A summary will provide the needed background.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The affidavits submitted by UPI. on the motion to dismiss showed the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ing facts relevant to the issues of jurisdiction and venue: UPI has eleven subscribers in Vermont (two newspapers, eight radio stations, and one radio-television station) to which it transmits news and news pictures over circuits leased from the Bell System, which owns all the equipment save for teletypewriters in the subscribers\u2019 premises, these being owned by UPI. UPI has one employee \u201c in Vermont, Isabelle McCaig, who is the \u201cmanager\u201d of its Montpelier \u201cnews bureau\u201d and upon whom service of process was made. UPI has no office in Vermont; Miss McCaig occupies desk space in a general news room in the State House in Montpelier. There she \u201cpunches out\u201d Vermont news stories on a wire leading to UPI\u2019s Boston office, where her transmittals are rewritten, as well as to the nine broadcast subscribers in Vermont and fourteen in New Hampshire. With the exception of the dispatches received over this wire, all of UPI\u2019s transmissions to its Vermont subscribers originate outside the state, as was true of the allegedly libelous dispatch here. UPI\u2019s gross billings to its Vermont subscribers in 1960 represented less than 0.14% of its total gross billings to subscribers in the United States and foreign countries. Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit added nothing significant to his complaint; he indicated that he expected to be able to prove the transmission of the offending dispatch to some of UPI\u2019s Vermont subscribers, but said nothing as to its use by them or as to any injury suffered by him in Vermont or elsewhere as a result of the \u201cpublication\u201d there.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The issue of the standard to be in determining whether a federal court has jurisdiction over the person of a foreign corporation in a suit where federal jurisdiction is founded solely on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, has arisen frequently since the late Judge Goodrich\u2019s penetrating opinion, written for the First Circuit and concurred in by Judges Magruder and Woodbury, in Pulson v. American Rolling Mill Co., 1 Cir., 170 F.2d 193 (1948). He analyzed the problem as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201cThere are two parts to the question whether a foreign corporation can be held subject to suit within a state. The first is a question of \"\u201cstate law: has the state provided for bringing the foreign corporation into its courts under the circumstances of the case presented ? There is nothing to compel a state to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign corporation unless it chooses to do so, and the extent to which it so chooses is a matter for the law of the state as made by its legislature. If the state has purported to exercise jurisdiction over the foreign cor- ,/ poration, then the question may arise whether such attempt violates the due process clause or the interstate commerce clause of the federal ^constitution. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 3; Amend. 14. This is a federal question and, of course, the state authorities are not controlling. But . it is a question which is not reached\u2019?? for decision until it is found-that the^ State statute is broad enough to assert jurisdiction over the defendant in a particular situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Finding that the Massachusetts statute as interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court did not purport to subject the defendant to suit in Massachusetts, the court affirmed Judge Wyzanski\u2019s dismissal of the suit, saying \u201cwe have no occasion to discuss how far recent decisions might allow a state to go in extending its jurisdiction in this field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">This conclusion, that a federal district court will not assert jurisdiction.over a corPora^on in an ordinary diversity case unless that would be done by the state court under constitutionally valid state legislation in the state where the court sits, has been reached in almost every circuit that has considered the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">First: Pulson v.

However, it may not be amiss . i to add that the premise of the argument, <em>\\! </em>|namely, that all cases arising under F.R. ' Civ.Proe. 4(d) (7) must be disregarded, is quite unsound. F.R.Civ.Proc. 4(d) ! (3) and (7) both relate to the manner of \u00a1service and leave open the question ^whether the foreign corporation was sub-l.ject to service in any manner. Thus, although the Pulson case, for example, arose under Rule 4(d) (7), the issue was not as to the person served but as to the liability of the defendant to s\u00e9rvice. v It was that issue which Judge Goodrich, writing for the First Circuit, held to be one of state law, subject only to federal constitutional limitations. Judge Goodrich cited and relied on Pulson and expressly disagreed with the contrary view,. stated in an earlier edition of Professor Moore\u2019s treatise and advanced in the instant dissent, when he wrote for Judge Hastie and himself in Partin, supra, 202 F.2d at 542-543, in his own circuit, a case which our brother Clark recognizes to be directly in point against the position advocated by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The only contrary voice by a court of appeals is our decision, by a divided panel, in J^ftex \u2014 jCorpniatiaQ^ v. Randolph Mills, Inc., 282 F.2d 508 (2 Cir. 1960). In that case all three judges agreed that a judgment in the Southern District of New York dismissing a complaint against a North Carolina corporation should be reversed because New York would have asserted jurisdiction under a constitutionally valid statute. But a majority went on to elaborate in -an opinion by Judge Clark, as an alternative ground for coming to the same conclusion, \u201cthat the question whether a foreign corporation is <em>present </em>in a district to permit of service of process upon it is one of federal law governing the, procedure - of the United States courts and is to be determined accordingly.\u2019\u2019 282 F.2d at 516. T)he service there was evidently thought to be good under this \u201cfederal standard\u201d, although the opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ion does not say just what that standard is or where it can be found. <em>In banc </em>reconsideration of Jaftex was not sought. In the instant case a majority of the panel (Friendly and Marshall, JJ., Clark, J., dissenting), believing that the alternative ground of decision in Jaftex was unwarranted, was causing confusion by its failure to identify or define the \u201cfederal standard\u201d, and was leading to unfortunate results in the district courts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that we should bring ourselves in line with other circuits, requested that .the case be considered <em>in banc </em>on the briefs already before us. This request for <em>in banc </em>consideration was granted, Judge Clark alone dissenting. We have concluded that the alternative ground of decision in Jaftex, asserting a \u201cfederal-standard\u201d for jurisdiction over foreign! corporations in ordinary diversity cases, should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"Aac\"> No federal statute or Rule of Civil Procedure speaks to the issue either expressly -axJay_fair implication. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(c), providing that \u201c[a] corporation mfty be sued in any judicial district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do Jiusiness or is * doing business,\u201d relates to venue and not to jurisdiction, as is made clear by considerations polnted out in the concurring opinion in Jaftex, 282 F.2d at 518, and there recognized by the majority, 282 F.2d at 512. Neither is anv instruction to be found by combining the provlsinn ip F.R.Civ.Proc. 4(d) (3) that, service may be made \u201cupon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering a. copy of the summons and of the complaint to an officer. a managing or general agejijt, or to anv other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process(and7jf the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant,\u201d witR-the provision of Rule 4(d) (7) that m 'the\" case of \u201ca defendant of any class refeTred to in paragraph (1) or (3) of this subdiviYsion of this ruTe, it is\u201dalso'\u2019sufficient if the summons and complaint' are served in the manner prescribed by any statute of the United States or in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the service is made for the service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of summons or other like process upon any such defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of that state.\u201d To do so would put far .more strain on the words \u201cor foreign\u201d in Rule 4(d) (3) and \u201calso\u201d in Rule 4(d) (7) than they will bear, bjo one reading the Rul^would be lik^JcrgeETEeTinpfession \u00dcjaJ]Kll\u00ab4(i)-4^)w?asA\u00bfhaxto <em>\u00a1 </em>to the federal courts to make their own <em>\u25a0J </em>law as to <em>when </em>a foreign corporation is subject to suit and that the effect of-Rule 4(d) (7) is to make state standards of j urisdiction <em>T(MentatwePy </em>^applicable, The Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes.reveal no such intention; leather they emphasize^ the much more limited one, whichvthe language of the Rule indicates, of regulating the <em>'gwmner </em>of service, saying that paragraph (3) \u201cenumerates the oflieers and agents of a corporation or of a partnership or other unincorporated-*association upon whom service of process may be made * * Eminent authority thus seems entirely justified in concluding that \u201cRule 4(d) (3Lof the Rules of \u25a0s Civil Procedure tells (hoa) service .of ^process is to he^ made upon a cornora- <em>{/ </em>tion which(iis subject)to service; but it ^ does not tell w\u00edi\u00e9\u00f1 the corporation is* so subject.\u201d Hart &amp; Wechsler, The Federal Cofirts and the Federal System, 959 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Despite contrary intimations as to our position in the dissent, we fully concede that the constitutional? doctrine announced in Erie R.

But we find no federal nojicv that should lead federal courts in diversity cases to override valid state laws as to the subjection of foreign corporations to suit, in the absence of direction by fed'eral statute or rule. State statutes determining what foreign corporations\"may be sued, for what, and by whom, are not mere whimsy; like most legislation they represent a balancing^of-variogs. corisid\u201d erations \u2014 for example, affording a forum fdFwrongs connected with the state and conveniencing resident plaintiffs, while avoiding the discouragement of activity within the state by foreign corporations. We see nothing in the concept of diversity-jurisdiction that should lead us to read into the governing statutes a Congressional mandate, unexpressed by Congress itself, to disregard the balance thus struck by the states.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The famed ji dicial statement'oF the reason for diversity jurisdiction, \u201cHowever true the fact may be, that the tribunals of the states will administer justice as impartially as those of the nation, to parties of every description, it is not less true that the constitution itself either entertains apprehensions on this subject, or views with such indulgence the possible fears and apprehensions of suitors, that it has established national tribunals for the decision of controversies between aliens and a citizen, or between citizens of different states,\u201d Marshall, C.

Supreme Court decisions enforcing state \u201cdoor-closing\u201d statutes in the federal courts, and the reasons there expressed. Angel v.

State policy is involved in one case as much as in the other, and in the absence of an overriding federal interest intimated by Congress or its delegate, should be equally respected.</p>\n<p id=\"A09p\">Our belief that neither the federal legislature nor the~TederaT rtfle- \\ makers have nad\u2019myi\u00f1f\u00e9iffib\u00f1^t\u00f3 'dfsplace ;\u25a0 state\"^at\u00fc\u00ed'es\u201c\u00e1s\"T\u00f3_fF\u00e9\"faking of \u201cjuris- - diction \u00f3y\u00e9rffor\u00e9i^y\u00f3rp\u00f3rations in \u00f3rcti- r nary' TlfveTslfy \u201ccases' Ts\u201ds\"trengthened by instaTHygs~wheW,'Yffc\u00a5rtmn~typlesbgf''federal question litigation, Congress has provided for-servic^off nrbcess outside \u2018 the district.

At the start, they had to overcome the notion that a corporate entity could have no legal existence outside the state of its creation. See Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. (38 U.S.) 519, 588, 10 L.Ed. 274 (1839). For many years, beginning with LaFay-ette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. (59 U.S.) 404, 408, 15 L.Ed. 451 (1856), the received theory, which can be found in Supreme Court decisions as late as Mr. Justice Stone\u2019s in Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. Chatters, 279 U.S. 320, 325-326, 49 S.Ct. 329, 73 L.Ed. 711 (1929), was of \u201c\u2018implied consent\u201d by the foreign corporation to state statutes conditioning the right to do business on amenability to suit. Most of the Supreme Court cases as to challenges to the assertion of jurisdiction over foreign corporations during this period came from state courts. There the state had., authoritatively construed its statute and the Supreme .Court decided only the issue of constitutionality. But even when the case came from a lower federal court, the question whether the corporation\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d embraced the particular suit was necessarily one of state law, for the \u201cconsent\u201d was to what the state statute constitutionally demanded, and the construction of state statutes, even in the heyday of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. (41 U.S.) 1, 10 L.Ed. 865 (1842), was for state judges, although the question whether the state might permissibly exact such a consent was a constitutional one. Hence we find it_impqssible to regard the four opinions by Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the future author of Erie, which are cited in Professor Moore\u2019s treatise, 2 Federal Practice (2d ed. 1962), at 969, although not for this precise point,.as establishing a \u201cfederal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>standard\u201d as to jurisdiction over foreign corporations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The writer\"of\"the opinion in Barrow S.S. Co. v. Kane, 170 U.S. 100, 18 S.Ct. 526, 42 L.Ed. 964 (1898), on which Professor Moore does rely, id. at 970, appears to have been unconscious that he was giving birth to a \u201cfederal standard\u201d of jurisdiction over foreign corporations; the thrust of the opinion was rather that the corporation was doing enough in New York to be suable there on any standard, and that the state\u2019s \u201cdoor-closing\u201d statute with respect to causes of action arising outside the state would not be honored in the federal courts \u2014 a view inconsistent with the later decisions in Angel v. Bullington, supra, and Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The consent doctrine was later succeeded, or supplemented, by a theory of \u201cpresence\u201d ; judges developed wondrous capacity to determine that a foreign corporation was \u201cpresent\u201d in the state in certain instances, but \u201cabsent\u201d from it in others although something had somehow gotten done there. These spooks were banished, and fresh air let in, by Judge Learned Hand\u2019s observation in Hutchinson v. Chase &amp; Gilbert, Inc., 45 F.2d 139, 141 (2 Cir. 1930), that \u201cIt is difficult, to us it seems impossible, to impute the idea of-locality to a corporation, except by virtue of those acts which realize its purposes. * * * If we are to attribute locality to it at all, it must be equally present wherever any part of its work goes on, as much in the little as in the great\u201d; the basis for determining whether or not to take jurisdiction, he suggested, was., to be found not in metaphysical subletiesjj but \u2019 in a standard of reasonableness; Since Hutchinson was a removed case,' Judge Hand could hardly have been thinking in terms of \u201cfederal law,\u201d see Bomze v. Nardis Sportswear, Inc., 165 F.2d 33, 35 (2 Cir. 1948), save for the limiting principles of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (and in sopie instances other constitutional provisions). Then came International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 317, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), a case from a state court, in which the Supreme Court recognized that concepts such as consent and presence are mere rationalizations and that, in the words of Chief Justice Stone, the true question is the existence \u201cby such_c.ontacts of the corporation with \"the.state of \"the forum as make it reasonable, in the context of our federal system of government, to require thj^corporatio.n to. dpfejid the particular suitjwhich is brought there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The-decision..of\u201ewhat_conta&amp;ts,-within the constitutionally permitted sphere, shall suffice to make a' foreign corporation subject to suit is, one for the state to make in tha-first instance: once the state'has made this, there is no reason for a federal court to go further \u2014 or less far \u2014 when it is acting under a head of jurisdiction supposedly designed to protect certain suitors from possible prejudice by state courts. We do not deny that the diversity clause of the Constitution also Has^~potentiaI~utility in\u2019perffrftting a federal court, with the possibility \u00f3f\u00f1ation-wide service of process, to give a remedy'unavairable''elsewhCTa\"Butto \"do that Jn limited classes of\" cases .\"'under &lt;Tsfatutes specially designed for the purpose, e. g., interpleader, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2361, or proposals currently underU\u00cdIscussion by the American Law Institute,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>quite a different matter from permitting every \"plaStiflT entitled~forfnvoEe\" 'fiiveriinty\" Jurisdiction to escape state policy \u201cwith'respect to the amenability to suit oT\"for\u00e9ign corporations. alwavsTsuaEle in the' state of their domicile, by bringing ~fiis~ actionjji_a federal ratlief~than _a_ state \u2022 'co\u00fcrtT.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">I We see little relevancy in the citation of Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Co-op., 356 U.S. 525, 537-540; 78 S.Ct. 893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958), and Simler v. Conner, 372 U.S. 221, 83 S.Ct. 609, 9 L.Ed.2d 691 (1963), holding that whether an isisue is of the sort triable.to a jury must 1 be decided as a matter_ of federal law \u00a1regardless of the law of the state where I the court sits,(am) surely no warrant for 6 saying that the latter decision has reinforced the alternative ground of Jaftex. These cases proceed on the basig^iat \u201cthe federal policy favoring j ury decisions of disputed fact questions^, a policy framed \u201cunder the influence \u2014 if. not the command of the Seventh Amendment\u201d, 356 U.S. at 537-538, 78 S.Ct at 900, 901, and \u201cof historic and continuing strength,\u201d 372 U.S. at 222, 83 S.Ct. at 610 was such that federal courts should not yield to a contrary \u201cstate rule in the interest of furthering the objective that the litigation should not come out one way in the federal court and another way in the state court,\u201d 356 U.S. at 538, 78 S.Ct. at 901. We are aware of no federalh policy of similar strength or constitution-I al basis that would justify disregard of \u00a1 state laws as to when a foreign corpora- | tion may be held to answer in a suit ljke ' the present. How warily the Supreme Court proceeds in disregarding state law even in the area of jury trial is shown by its refusal to decide whether federal courts in diversity actions may develop ftheir own standards as to the quantum \u2018\u25a0of evidence necessary for submission to a jury. Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 437, 444-445, 79 S.Ct. 921, 3 L.Ed.2d 935 (1959); and see the recent denial of certiorari, two Justices dissenting, 371 U.S. 935, 83 S.Ct. 307, 9 L.Ed.2d 271 (1962), to review Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v.

One may agree with the premise of the dissent that the quest for uniformity between: state and federal courts 7'cant-b'e-\"pushed too far, particularly when the issue may reasonably be denoted as one of procedure, without accepting the apparent conclusion that deliberately creating a difference in result between state and federal courts on an issue such as jurisdiction over foreign corporations in a diversity case is so demonstrable a good as to warrant federal judges in substituting their views for state legislators\u2019. This is especially true when the inevitable result is to ^create still another difference \u2014 between^ di- | versify cases coming to the federal courts \\ initially and those coming on removal. \\where we do not understand how it can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>be asserted that the federal court has] jurisdiction over a foreign corporation if \u2018 the state court did not.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Viewed in the light of International Shoe and the subsequent cases, assertion of a state\u2019s judicial jurisdiction over foreign corporations was simply an earlier instance of the same principle that underlies the assertion of such jurisdiction over non-resident individuals having, or having had, sufficient \u201ccontacts\u201d with the state. See Chief Justice Stone\u2019s reference to Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 47 S.Ct. 632, 71 L.Ed. 1091 (1927), in International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 318, 66 S.Ct. at 158, 159.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Absent a direction in statute , or rule, there is no more reason, in an fordinary diversity case, for a federal court to make up its own law in the former situation than in the latter.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Having concluded that jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is to be determined here on the basis of conjstitutionally valid Vermont law, we fSaah, the quesMoirwiieth\u00e9r'we should -rfiake the] determination on our own account or remand for initial consideration by the district judge. '</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Vermont's provisions with respect to personal jurisdiction over foreign corporations are contained in Subchapter 6 of Title 12 of the Vermont Statutes. Section 851 provides that \u201c[w]hen a foreign corporation has appointed the secretary of state as its process agent, pursuant to the statutes relating to such corporations, service of process, made upon such secretary by delivering to him duplicate copies thereof, shall be sufficient.\u201d Whether Vermont would thmk UPI had been \u201cdoing business\u201d in the state to an extent requiring it so to ap-noint the secretary of state, 11 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 652(a), 691(a), 692(3), is not clear. See Kinnear &amp; Gager Mfg. Co. v. Miner, 89 Vt. 572, 96 A. 333 (1916); cf. Star-Chronicle Pub. Co. v. United Press Ass\u2019ns, 204 F. 217 (8 Cir. 1913). In any event, UPI hadnot so appointed him, and Vermont, unlike many states, see, e. g., Conn.Gen.Stats. \u00a7 33-411(b), has no statute providing generally that a for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>eign corporation which does business in the state without obtaining a required certificate of authority and appointing an agent to receive process shall be subject to suit as jf it liar! ^Tip.wliif it nuirM to have done. Vermont does have two statutes that assert jurisdiction over unregistered foreign corporations in certain circumstances, but neither seems applicable here. One, which authorizes service on \u25a0\u201can agent, messenger or operator of such company\u201d \u2014 broadened in 1959, Public Act No. 261, \u00a7 11, to include other persons on whom process against a domestic corporation could be served \u2014 is limited to \u201ca foreign insurance, express, shipping car, telephone, or telegraph company or other foreign company doing like business\u201d in the state, 12 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 853, 854, all of these being companies which serve the public generally and are subject to state regulation, as UPI does not and is not, even if we should assume Vermont would think it was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the state at all.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The other statute, 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 855, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APX\">\u201cIf a foreign corporation makes a contract with a resident of Vermont to be performed in whole or in part by either party in Vermont, if such foreign corporation comA mits a tort in whole or in part in \\ Vermont against, a^esident of Ver-Jmont, such acts shall be deemed to be doing business in Vermont by such foreign corporation and shall be deemed equivalent to the appointment by such foreign corporation of the secretary of the state of Vermont and his successors to be its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be <em>\u00a1 </em>served all lawful process in any ac- <em>! </em>tions or proceedings against such ; foreign corporation arising from or / growing out of such contract or tort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Since plaintiff is not a resident of Vermont as \u00a7 855 requires,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it is unneces-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>eary to determine whether Vermont would consider that the mere transmission from outside the state to defendant\u2019s Vermont subscribers of a dispatch alleged to libel a person not claimed to have any reputation in Vermont, or to have been injured in his reputation elsewhere by the transmission to Vermont, constituted the commission of a tort \u201cin whole or in part in Vermont.\u201d Cf. Ting-ley v. Times-Mirror Co., 144 Cal. 205, 206, 77 P. 918, 919 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Although the case thus does not appear to come within either of these statutes, the questions remain whether Vermont would nevertheless fill the gap beA, tween them and assert jurisdiction over \\ this defendant on the basis, stated a-A half century ago in the attachment case of Somerville Lumber Co. v. Mackres, 86 Vt. 466, 85 A. 977-978 (1913), that \u201cthere being no statute specifically relating to the service of process on foreign corporations doing business in this state other than the one requiring them to appoint a process agent, they must be taken, if they omit that, to assent to be served with process the same as other non-resident defendants are served\u201d, and whether the Fourteenth Amendment would permit Vermont to do that on the facts here. See Hanson v. Denckla v. 357 U.S. 235, 251, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958); Blount v. Peerless Chemicals, Inc., 316 F.2d 695 (2 Cir. 1963). While it would be valuable to have the-benefit of Judge Gibson\u2019s consideration* of the first question, and, indeed, of tfe other matters of Vermont law that we have mentioned, there would be no point in imposing a further burden upon him and upon the parties if assertion of jurisdiction by Vermont over the person of UPI in this action would violate the Fourteenth Amendment. On the rather meagre record before us, this might well be so. UPI\u2019s Vermont activities, while perhaps greater than those of the defendants in Blount v. Peerless Chemicals, Inc., supra, or in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 273 Ala. 656, 144 So.2d 25 (1962), cert. granted, 371 U.S. 946, 83 S.Ct. 510, 9 L.Ed.2d 496 (1963), were rather small and did not arise from a privilege that Vermont could have withheld. Hanson v. Denckla, supra, 357 U.S. at 252, 78 S.Ct. at 1239. The Supreme Court\u2019s most advanced decisions in this area have stressed that the obligation in suit arose out of the corporation\u2019s activity in the state, International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra, 326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. at 159; McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 223, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957); <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that it was owing either to the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>itself as in International Shoe, see also Travelers Health Ass\u2019n v. Virginia, 339 U.S. 643, 70 S.Ct. 927, 94 L.Ed. 1154 (1950), or to a resident as in McGee; and that the McGee case related to \u201can activity [insurance] that the State treats as exceptional and subjects to special regulation.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, supra, 357 U.S. at 252, 78 S.Ct. at 1239. Here the plaintiff has not averred, either in the complaint or in his affidavit in opposition to the motion to dismiss, that he had any reputation in Vermont or was known to a single person there, or that his reputation anywhere else was injured by such \u201cpublication\u201d as occurred in Vermont. The alleged injury was thus, so far as appears, suffered wholly outside Vermont and was not a result of anything done there. Mattox v. News Syndicate Co., 176 F.2d 897, 900 (2 Cir.) (L. Hand, J.), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 858, 70 S.Ct. 100, 94 L.Ed. 525 (1949); compare Christopher v. American News Co., 171 F.2d 275, 280-281 (7 Cir. 1948); see Tingley v.

We therefore remand for consideration of the issues relating to jurisdiction, and, if the District Court should find these favorably to plaintiff, the issue of venue, before any further consideration of the merits. Since the court may not reach the venue issue, we shall not discuss it except to say that the court should not regard us as necessarily committed to the view, generally followed in the Southern District of New York but never passed on by us, whereby \u201cthe criteria which are applied in determining corporate presence for the jurisdictional purpose of effecting valid service of process\u201d are \u201cequally applicable to the venue provisions of \u00a7 1391(c).\u201d Champion Spark Plug Co. v.

A district judge in the Sixth Circuit seems to have construed Scliolnik v. National Airlines, 219 F.2d 115 (6 Cir. 1955) as establishing a \u201cfederal standard\u201d although disagreeing with the view he thought it announced, Shuler v. Wood, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>198 F.Supp. 801 (E.D.Tenn.1961), and a \u201cfederal standard\u201d was approved by another district judge in First Flight Co. v. National Carloading Corp., 209 F.Supp. 730 (E.D.Tenn.1962). However, the issue was not determined in Scholnik. Although the Scholnik opinion discussed federal constitutional decisions rather than Ohio law, this must be read against the Sixth Circuit\u2019s earlier statement that the Ohio courts had declared that the state\u2019s \u201cdoing business\u201d statute \u201cshould be liberally construed to facilitate the obtaining of jurisdiction over a foreign corporation doing business in Ohio, where a citizen of that state seeks redress upon a transaction with such foreign corporation,\u201d Bach v. Friden Calculating Mach. Co., 167 F.2d 679, 680 (6 Cir. 1948), and thus as going to the limits which the Federal Constitution permitted. The per <em>ouriam </em>opinion in Lasky v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., 157 F.2d 674 (6 Cir. 1946), is similarly explicable. The Sixth Circuit later held, WSAZ, Inc. v. Lyons, 254 F.2d 242, 244 (6 Cir. 1958), that in a rejnoved action against a foreign corporation, jurisdiction of the federal court depended on whether the state court had acquired it \u2014 obviously a matter of state statute and decisional law subject to federal constitutional requirements. The writer of the WSAZ, Inc. opinion and a judge who joined in it had also participated in Scholnik; one would suppose that if the Sixth Circuit thought it had adopted a rule leading to different treatment of foreign corporations in original and removed suits, it would have made that clear to the profession. The issue was likewise not determined by the district judges in Shuler v. Wood, supra, where the court found the defendant was within valid Tennessee \u201cdoing business\u201d statutes, or in the First Flight case, supra, where the court ended up by deciding on the basis that federal jurisdiction was founded on the presence of a federal question. Another district judge in the Sixth Circuit has properly not regarded Scholnik as a pronouncement for a \u201cfederal standard\u201d; he held rather, citing Bach and other cases, as well as Judge Goodrich\u2019s opinions in Pulson and Partin, that \u201cstate law governs whether a for'eign corporation is subject to service in a diversity action.\u201d Singleton v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R., 20 F.R.D. 15, 18 (E.D.Mich.1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Aij\">. A striking instance is Southern New England Distrib. Corp. v. Berkeley Finance Corp., 30 F.R.D. 43 (D.Conn. 1962). The. district judge, on the basis of a scholarly review of Connecticut statute and decisional law, found (1) that \u201cConnecticut, as a matter of state policy, has recognized the advantage of not imposing qualifications on the right of foreign corporations to conduct some kinds of commercial and financial transactions, since it has enumerated certain business activities of foreign corporations which do not constitute \u2018transacting business\u2019;\u201d (2) that the defendant\u2019s activities came within these exclusions, as found in Conn. Gen.Stats. \u00a7 33-397(b); and (3) that the complaint did not allege tortious conduct in Connecticut under another statute, \u00a7 33-All (c) (4), authorizing service on a foreign corporation in such a ease \u201cwhether or not such corporation is transacting business in this state.\u201d 30 F.R.D. at 45-48. Yet, in deference to Jaftex, these modern and comprehensive statutes, representing Connecticut\u2019s assessment of the relative interest of plaintiffs, defendants, and the state itself, were set at naught, in an ordinary diversity suit, in favor of a supposed \u201cfederal standard.\u201d ...</p>\n<p id=\"ADRp\">In fact, the Southern New England result may not have followed so inevitably from Jaftex as the judge thought. For the case came into the federal court on removal, and thus Connecticut law would still govern the- validity of the service (subject, of course, to constitutional limitations), unless Jaftex overruled <em>sub silentio </em>not only Judge L. Hand\u2019s decision in Bomze v. Nardis Sportswear, Inc., 165 F.2d 33, 35 (2 Cir. 1948), but also Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore &amp; O. R.R., 258 U.S. 377-382, 42 S.Ct. 349, , 66 L.Ed. 671 (1922)\u2014no mean feat for 1 two judges of a court of appeals. But , this probable error serves to highlight another unhappy effect of Jaftex, discussed below, the undesirability of having two different rules for jurisdiction over foreign corporations in diversity actions depending on whether the case is originally brought in the federal court or is removed there. And the unfortunate result which the judge thought that Jaftex obliged him to reach would/have been required in a suit brought orig-\u2018 inally in federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b272-11\">.

We have taken the references in Jaftex, see 282 F.2d at 510, to leading Supreme Court opinions on constitutionality to mean that the \u201cfederal standard\u201d wad\\ coterminous with the outermost limit per- \\ mitted to a state under the due <em>process/ </em>clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It would seem curious that a \u201cfederal standard\u201d should be framed in terms of an Amendment applicable to state rather than federal action, and the dissent repudiates this view. We are told that the \u201cfederal standard\u201d is quite well known and reasonably precise, but are given little further information about it save for phrases like \u201cdoing business\u201d and \u201cpresence,\u201d which have meant many different things to different courts and, as Judge Learned Hand held in Hutchinson v. Case &amp; Gilbert, supra, boil down to notions of what is fair and reasonable, with much depending on the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. It is far from apparent why principles of fairness and reasonableness concerning the <em>locus </em>of suit should be thought to subject this defendant, which was available for service at its home office in New York and presumably in many other places where it had substantial establishments, but was doing very little in Vermont, to process in Vermont in a suit by a nonresident on a claim which, so far as now appears, is wholly unrelated to anything done in that state. Paraphrasing Judge Hand, 45 F.2d at 142, it would seem fairer that Arrowsmith should have come to New York, or have stayed in Baltimore, than that UPI should go to Vermont.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b278-4\">. 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 853, imposing a penalty-on the specified types of companies doing business in Vermont for failing to designate the secretary of state as process agent as required, and 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 854, providing that when a stipulation so appointing the secretary is not filed, \u201cprocess may be served by delivering a true and attested copy thereof, with the officers\u2019 return thereon to an agent, messenger or operator of such company residing in this state or to any person enum-ei\u2019ated in section 813 of this title,\u201d have been coupled ever since the Vermont legislature adopted \u201cAn Act Providing for Service of Process on Foreign Insurance, Express, Telegraph and Telephone Companies,\u201d Laws of 1884, No. 46, in which these provisions were \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, and codifiers of Vermont law have uniformly linked the two sections thereafter.

Question might be raised whether Vermont\u2019s limiting the benefits of this corporate \u201clong-arm\u201d statute to plaintiffs who are Vermont residents is consistent with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the privileges and immunities clause, Art. IV, \u00a7 2. A sufficient answer may lie in McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957), where the California statute in issue was confined to suits on insurance contracts with California residents and was sustained in part on that very ground; moreover, the Court cited with approval, 355 U.S. at 223, 78 S.Ct. at 201 n. 2, Smyth v. Twin State Improvement Co., 116 Vt. 569, 80 A.2d 664, 25 A.L.R.2d 1193 (1951), sustaining the constitutionality of 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 855. If the validity under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of subjecting a foreign corporation to suit within a state on the basis of isolated activities within it depends upon a balancing of the interests of the plaintiff and the defendant, see 73 Harv.L.Rev. 909, 923-28 (1960), the fact that the plaintiff resides within the state is surely a relevant consideration, as the McGee decision indicates. The state has an interest in not making it too burden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>some for foreign corporations to engage in activity within its borders. Even as regards contracts made or torts committed in the state, it would seem not unreasonable for it to limit a long-arm statute against foreign corporations to suits by its own residents, whose rights and welfare it desires to protect by affording them a readily accessible forum, without having to do this also for non-residents, who may be able to sue with equal convenience in another state and who can always obtain jurisdiction in the state of incorporation. If a statutory classification is thus appropriate in the administration of the due process clause, it can hardly be outlawed by the equal protection clause of the same Amendment. Invocation of the privileges and immunities clause against 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 855 would encounter the further obstacle that the statute speaks in terms of residents rather than citizens. See Douglas v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R., 279 U.S. 377, 49 S.Ct. 355, 73 L.Ed. 747 (1929). But see Toomer v.

As wilh.be developed below,, the decision had a very good presSYn'the law schools and among\"scholars. \"\u00d1oWT\u2019anT at a loss to understand the strong compulsion to eradicate root and branch the view there espoused that federal law con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>trolled, and to do so in what would seem a rather poor vehicle to achieve that result. After all the attempts atoverk\u00fclj in the majority opinion, the quesfionre-^ mains not to be laughed off or otherwise discounted, but is one going to the very heart of our national system of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">^Bjjj; even though this decision as a7 precedent has great potentialities of! harm, the issue is no^one which normally (and here) has any considerable practical effect so far as the litigants are concerned; the use in federal service under F.R. 4(d) (7) of the new \u201clong-arm\u201d statutes becoming popular in the states, as well as the parallel, rather than conflicting, development of state and federal principles in this area, as in Jaftex with reference to New York, ordinarily give little occasion for meaningful federal-state conflict. So here, in order to make a case for their reversal, the majority has to ascribe a really fantastic \u201cdooi\\ closing\u201d meaning, arrived at by way of-negative implication, to Vermont\u2019s affirmative grant to its residents of a \u201clong-arm\u201d remedy by service in particular in-\u00ed stances on the secretary of state. _ The_ most natural conclusion here, just as in.. Jaftex, isthafstate and federal law as to ,' service__w\u00a3ujd__yield the \"same \"resiilt'.\"i' Hence this seems to me a~*substantially \u2022manufactured case to register disagreement with Jaftex before the issue can \u25a0get to the Supreme Court. This inconsiderable result is forced in a case where the district court did not advert to the issue and the plaintiff, a layman, greatly outmatched, filed his brief <em>pro se </em>without any mention of the matter. When I saw the turn the appeal was taking, I urged my brothers to appoint some lawyer of standing to represent the national interest and to assist us to a correct decision; but they have preferred to leave this most important intei\u2019est unrepresented.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In their eagerness to blot out Jaftex, my brothers, it seems to me, have made an erroneous analysis of both the historical background and the present case law. I plan to cover both these aspects below; but since I consider yet more important the underlying philosophy and policy of e law and feel that this is sadly neglected by my brothers, I shall turn to it at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Now I think it clear that it is the assumed compulsion of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, and only that, which leads to my brothers\u2019 conclusion here; only such a positive mandate would justify rejecting the flexible and workable uniform standard so long followed in the federal courts for the vague, uncertain, conflicting rules of the states. And surely this is the more-apparentjyhen .adoption of the supposedstate_ rules -carries with..it an implied invitation...... for . discrimination against federal citizens otherwise elB \u2022 gible to sue federalwise. Butjmtu'ally <em>u</em>there is no such compulsion 7rom ErifL; the bite there was to see that a litigant\u2019s substantive rights are to be determined by the appropriate state law and are not to be prejudiced by the fact that they are being enforced in a federal court. Here state law as to libel will ultimately determine the plaintiff\u2019s rights on the merits, as the considerable and premature discussion of the merits by my brothers demonstrates. But this does <em>/ </em>not say how the federal courts shall be organized and how one is brought before them; indeed to put this in the hands / of the states would be to destroy all rea-; son for having a federal tribunal (af\u00a3 which the litigant has more confidence) enforce a litigant's rights accorded by state law. See Friendly, The Historic j Basis of Diversity Jurisdiction, 41 Harv.L.Rev. 483 (1928). This would seem settled by recent decisions of the Supreme Court upholding the obligation of. affording a trial according to federal standards. As the Court properly says: \u201cThe federal system is an independent system for administering justice to litigants who properly invok^jtsjjurisdiction.\u201d Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Co-op., 356 U.S. 525, 537, 78 S.Ct. 893, 900, 2 L.Ed.2d 953. The Court there declined to follow state law as to issues to be kept from the jury. This principle was definitively and finally set for diversity as well as other actions in Simler v. Conner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>372 U.S. 221, 83 S.Ct. 609, 9 L.Ed.2d 691, decided since, but re-enforcing, the Jaf-tex holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Contrary to the views of distinguished courts and commentators, the majority here brush these cases aside as only applications of the Seventh Amendment. But the matter cannot be so summarily dismissed. There is nothing in the Seventh Amendment to instruct as to this issue; and the result is one reached by the Court through a careful analysis of \u2022what a trial in the federal court essentially means. It is by no means so clearly \u25a0compelled as is the result I am supporting \u2019lere, which has a direct statutory base, as pointed out below. Moreover, reliance t\u00bbn the Seventh Amendment is a late afterthought with our court; in common with other, but not all, circuits we had brashly and overeagerly ruled at least three times that state law governed jury submissions in diversity cases.

Co. of Ohio v. Spach, 5 Cir., 281 F.2d 401, refusing to apply to a federal diversity case a Florida statute excluding from evidence a written statement from a property owner concerning injury to his property where he had not been furnished a copy. Judge Brown speaks of the importance of the constitutional provision for diversity jurisdiction (which of course contains no limitation dependent on state action). He says, 281 F.2d 401, at page 407:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201cNot the least of these countervailing considerations [against state practice] is the indispensable necessity that a tribunal, if it is to be \u00cdan independent court administering law, must have the capacity to regulate the manner by which cases are to be tried and facts are to be pre- j sented in the search for the truth of f the cause. As Erie epitomized, the constitutional factors subject federal courts in diversity cases to special /-&gt; limitations. But the jurisdiction of courts in such cases is no less constitutional than in non-diversitv litigation. The judicial power of the United States vested by Art. Ill of the Constitution \u2018in such inferior Courts as the Congress may * * * establish\u2019 is declared to \u2018extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity * *; to Controversies * * * \u2014 between Citizens of different States * A United States District Court \u2022clothed with power by Congress pursuant to the Constitution is not a mere adjunct to a state\u2019s judicial machinery. In entertaining diversity cases it is responding to a constitutional demand made effective by congressional action and, as the recent abstention cases have made so clear, it has a constitutional duty to hear and adjudicate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">It is significant that the Monarch Ins. Co. case and Jaftex are relied on by two acute commentators to justify their argument that federal rule-making authority may extend to uniform federal rules of evidence, now under consideration by the Judicial Conference of the United States and its committees.

These cases also are relied on to support even more general conclusions of an increasing trend j toward support of federal court control ^of its own organization and procedure,' as in Vestal, Erie R.R. v.

If their conclu\u00ed sion is a necessary one it is hard to see how state rules of evidence must not control, as well as state rules of discovery, pre-trial, and the like. And if there is a dividing line to save some of the vaunted and attractive modern federal proce-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>I </em>dure, where is it and how is it to be dejfined? The opinion puts in jeopardy some of Hie most advanced principles of procedure we have, for, practically, under the majority\u2019s rule, the more technical and restrictive procedure will always control. Only yesterday we ruled that under federal rule the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of a complaint did not restrict a jury\u2019s verdict, even though the state rule be otherwise. Riggs, Ferris &amp; Geer v. Lillibridge, 2 Cir., 316 F.2d 60, Apr. 10, 1963. How is this case now to be sustained under my brothers\u2019 view that state procedure, however outmoded, is the rule for the federal courts, at least in diversity cases? Like questions arise as to other of our decisions, including Iovino v. Waterson, 2 Cir., 274 F.2d 41, cert. denied Carlin v. Iovino, 362 U.S. 949, 80 S.Ct. 860, 4 L.Ed.2d 867, upholding the substitution of a foreign administrator under F.R. 25(a) (1), contrary to New York law \u2014 approved in Notes in 60 Colum.L.Rev. 738 (1960) and 73 Harv.L.Rev. 1618 (1960)\u2014and Hope v. Hearst Consol. Publications, Inc., 2 Cir., 294 F.2d 681, cert. denied Hearst Consol. Publications, Inc. v. Hope, 368 U.S. 956, 82 S.Ct. 399, 7 L.Ed.2d 388, approved in Comment, 62 Colum.L.Rev. 1049, 1061-1076 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The majority opinion affects to findl doubt as to the existing or pre-Erie rule! and to make various assumptions about it, such as that it assumes to accept federal jurisdiction up to the limits permitted the states by the Fourteenth Amendment (an odd straw man, indeed \u2014 one in no way suggested or intimated by me) | that it states no \u201cfederal standard,\u201d and so on. This is a curious failure to react history \u2014 one which, however, is apparently at the root of their difficulty in appreciating the existing federal rule. While there may be lurking constitutional overtones in the background, the federal law is shaped by statutory enactment based on easily understood principles, which reflect still important and widely held views of common sense and I fairness that a person should not be j forced into litigation at a distance from \u00a1 his home: These appear in the First Judiciary Act of 1789 as provisions both of service, then termed \u201ccivil arrest,\u201d and of venue. The famous \u00a7 11, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 78, 79, after providing for diversity jurisdiction in the federal circuit courts in cases where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum of $500 and for their exclusive cognizance of crimes against the United States, continues: \u201cBut no person shall be arrested in one district for trial in another, in any civil action before a circuit or district court. And no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts against an inhabitant of the United States, by any original process in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ, * * These provisions were continued in Rev.Stat. \u00a7 739, Judicial Code \u00a7 51, and in the former 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. During this period the requirements as to service and venue were treated together; but, as the Reviser\u2019s Notes state, they were separated in the recent revision of the Code, the venue requirements going to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391 and the service requirements going to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1693.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This latter statute is completely ignored by my brothers* which may help to explain their error (in note 10 of the majority opinion) in saying that \u00a7 11 \u201chas always been a venue provision and nothing more,\u201d as well as their difficulty in understanding this statutory background. It is true that \u00a7 1693 is expanded and also made less necessary by F.R. 4(f), as pointed out in First Flight Co. v. National Carloading Corp., supra, D.C.E.D.Tenn., 209 F.Supp. 730; but its continuance on the statute books is significant as emphasizing the durable federal policy it embodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">That policy of course is the well known one going beyond venue requirements to require service within the district un- \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>less specifically excepted by statute. Ex^ ception has been made in a limited number of instances, as stated in the opinion, involving antitrust, interpleader, and securities-regulation statutes. More lately limitations have been set by F.R. 4(f) \u2014 which has the force of statute. The first, a provision set in the original rule, was an extension of service of process throughout an entire state \u2014 applicable of course only in districts not coterminous with state boundaries \u2014 upheld in Mississippi Pub. Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U.S. 438, 446, 66 S.Ct. 242, 246, 90 L.Ed. 185, with the statement here most pertinent that \u201cthe rule is a rule of procedure and not of substantive right.\u201d Now the recent amendments to Rule 4(e) and (f), effective July 1, 1963, add two further provisions of relevance here, one providing for service according to state rules in proceedings quasi-in-rem, i. e., started by attachment or garnishment of property,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the other for service not only throughout the state, but also upon additional parties not more than 100 miles from the place of commencement of the action or of trial, as well as persons ordered to respond to an order of commitment for civil contempt. 83 Sup.Ct. No. 7, p. 8; also 83 Sup.Ct. No. 11, p. LXI. Among the various important problems not faced by my brothers is that of adjusting their rule of state control to these new provisions; what law, for ex- j ample, would govern the summons to thei Southern District of New York of corpo-j rations doing some business in adjacent^ portions of Connecticut, New Jersey, or;j Pennsylvania?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">It is true, of course, that the application of this principle of restriction of service to the district had to go through a course of development as to corporations, due to the historic controversy as to location or citizenship of a corporation. But this was settled long ago by the rather natural construction that a corporation must be \u201cpresent,\u201d i. e., must be doing business, within the district to be subject to suit there. See, as examples of the settled law, Philadelphia &amp; Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibbin, 243 U.S. 264, 37 S.Ct. 280, 61 L.Ed. 710; Robertson v. Railroad Labor Board, 268 U.S. 619, 45 S.Ct. 621, 69 L.Ed. 1119; and for full explanation and citation, Jaftex Corp. v. Randolph Mills, supra, 2 Cir., 282 F.2d 508, 512, and notes 2-4. And with this there has occurred the parallel development, as in New York, known to us all and outlined in Jaftex, of the state and federal law as to a corporation doing business within the district, but with the federal law getting its authority from this statutory background.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">From all this I regard as quite clear and subject to dogmatic assertion that, there is a federal law of statutory authority governing the requirements of service of process upon defendants, in- \u00a1 eluding corporations, within the district,\" and that this law, contrary to repeated assertions in the majority opinion, _is quite well known and reasonably precise. Hence the concession in the opinion that the majority would accept a mandate from Congress \u201cor its rule-making delegate\u201d to settle this issue would seem directly applicable, for there exists just that mandate which the majority is rather blithely overriding. And the federal principle, as I have indicated, seems to me flexible and useful, making use of state developments under F.R. 4(d) (7),' but avoiding the confusions and limita,tions inherent in any attempt to apply exclusively state law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To those confusions and limitations I now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>It is significant that, while anouncing this broad fiat, my brothers avoid developing it in particular areas of difficulty. Thus they are hard put to find a meaningful distinction between state and federal law, and, after what, I submit, are strange suggestions as to the effect of recent Vermont statutes concerning service of process, finally dump the matter back into Judge Gibson\u2019s lap for solution. \u201e I have already indicated the quite obvious j difficulties in applying any state principle to the extensions of service authorized j by the new amendments of F.R. 4. But j the area of applicability of the principle |j is left quite in doubt; the majority simply note the problem rather generally and leave it unsolved. Does their vaunted \u25a0^principle apply only to diversity cases, ; / bearing in mind the considerable extent to which the federal question jurisdiction may turn on state law? For example, note the extent to which tax refund actions may turn up questions of state probate and estate law. Passing this, we have a considerable area where jurisdic- &lt; tion may well depend both on diversity J and federal question jurisdiction. Not<em>e </em>the question of unfair competition alleged as \u201cpendent\u201d to a federal case of trademark infringement. These are by no \u25a0means imaginary difficulties, but are inherent in any attempt to break up ex- \u25a0: pansive federal litigation into small state : units and to apply differing rules of es- - tablishing jurisdiction as to each unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>\u25a0J </em>Over-all is the issue of national subj servience to the divisive policies of the f statute, a pattern of law at best belittling and undignified for the national courts ^and in all events inviting states to make \u00a1invidious discriminations in favor of,( s ^Ctheir own locals. True, the states to date have not. been active in such discriminatory legislation, but the effect of the invitation now extended by my brothers may well be to stimulate such legislation on the part of states jealous of or ill disposed toward the. national power. Here, as I develop below, I do not believe it conceivable that Vermont had in mind to prevent as full remedies for New Hampshire or Maryland citizens as for its own. But the opinion suggests that perhaps it is foolish or quixotic for a state not to do just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Contrary to assertions in the majority opinion, this is by no means the law of all the other circuits. In its eagerness to overprove its point, that opinion fails to note a most obvious part, namely, that the great majority of cases cited depend upon an explicit state stat\u00fate made operative by F.R. 4(d) (7) authorizing service according to local state law. Thus in a federal case upholding service upon a foreign corporation by service upon the secretary of state under a state statute, it is obvious \u2014 there being no federal statute or rule directly authorizing such service \u2014 that the holding depends upon this cited rule and tells us absolutely nothing (unless by negative inference) about the supremacy of state service. A count of noses is not of supreme importance, since the Supreme Court must decide and, as we have already seen, our court has been known to go wrong in jumping too fast. But it is desirable to set the record straight; and in an appendix to this dissent, I make the more careful analysis which I think my brothers should have made before advancing their rather reckless version of the state of the precedents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Thus I cannot concur in a remand which directs Judge Gibson to work on a wholly undesirable concept as to the governing law. I would not object to a re-J mand for the taking of evidence as to the ! defendant\u2019s doing business in Vermont, j and for district court findings on this 5 issue which we do not now have. But on the whole, this appears unnecessary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>since defendant in its affidavits has undoubtedly presented what it believes to\u00bb be its strongest ease; and on that IJmlj lieve the service good under-aither-ied-1 eral or state law. It clearly appears1 that Miss McCaig, the agent served, is engaged full time in defendant\u2019s main business activities, to wit, those of dis- \u25a0 covering and processing the news of this entire state and region and then of distributing such news and others collected by United to the various outlets which the defendant serves in the state. This is much more than the mere soliciting of business as an agent for, say, a railroad or a resort hotel, to recall issues in other cases we have had. It is an integral part of the very business for which the defendant is created and has its existence. That its operation here is presently small in bulk is not due to the nature of the business, but to the limited press activities in the state \u2014 which may well disappear as Vermont becomes politically more lively and independent. The point is that they were such as the circumstances called for and thus did all the news-gathering business necessary to keep Vermont attuned to the other parts of defendant\u2019s far-flung operations. This, I believe, makes defendant amenable to service as here. See, e. g., Acton v. Washington Times Co., D.C.Md., 9 F.Supp. 74; Ricketts v. Sun Printing &amp; Pub. Asso., 27 App.D.C. 222; International Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Compensation and Placement, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95, 161 A.L.R. 1057; Mississippi Pub. Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U.S. 438, 445, 446, 66 S.Ct. 242, 90 L.Ed. 185; Jacobowitz v. Thompson, 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 72; Nash-Ringel, Inc. v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 172 F.Supp. 524; Ostow &amp; Jacobs, Inc. v. Morgan-Jones, Inc., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 178 F.Supp. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Further, while I welcome the views of Judge Gibson, sophisticated in Vermont law as he most certainly is, I cannot believe that there is enough doubt about this question to justify a remand. For the statutes dealing with service of foreign corporations, in my judgment, cannot possibly be found to represent a discriminatory or door-closing policy, as the majority imply. These statutes are \u2018clearly but a natural response to the stress which recent Supreme Court cases have placed on contacts with the forum state. See International Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Compensation and Placement, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95, 161 A.L.R. 1057; McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223; Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283. When the Vermont statutory law is read in the light of the admonitions of these cases, the restrictions of its terms to actions concerning Vermont residents and growing out of Vermont occurrences can be seen as a quite sound attempt on the part of the Vermont legi\u00e1lators to insure the statute\u2019s constitutionality by requiring that even the farthest reaches of the long-arm statute necessarily involve sufficient contacts with the forum state<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, e. g., Smyth v. Twin State Improvement Corp., 116 Vt. 569, 80 A.2d 664. The fact that nonresidents are not mentioned in the Vermont statutes dealing with service of foreign corporations does, not therefore show that Vermont wishes'\" to afford a safe haven from suits by out-of-state plaintiffs to out-of-state corporations that conduct business there. Rather, it evidences a desire to save the constitutionality of a rather far-reaching statute. Thus Angel v. Bullington, 330 U.S. 183, 67 S.Ct. 657, 91 L.Ed. 832, and Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524, have no more application here than they did in Jaftex for the reason stated therein, namely, that no clear and precise state <em>r </em>policy would be frustrated by permitting suit in the federal forum. See Jaftex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Corp. v. Randolph Mills, supra, 2 Cir., 282 F.2d 508, 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">It is well, by way of summary, to consider what this opinion and decision actually accomplishes. In the case before us, it postpones decision for some months or years for interim proceedings which, in my judgment, can lead only to one eon- . elusion already indicated, namely, that the court has jurisdiction under either federal or state law. Beyond that, in the realm of federal procedure, it rejects a uniform, flexible, and well understood federal rule for service of process for an uncertain, conflicting, and variable rule of state service, with an invitation to the states to develop discriminatory legislation against nonresidents. And yet further it nullifies attempts applauded by scholars to confine the Erie principle to its proper role of substantive rights without impairment of the integrity of the federal court organization; in so doing it casts doubt upon the validity of the well-conceived and hitherto highly successful steps to improve the administration of justice in the federal system and indeed generally. Surely this is a heavy price to pay to register disagreement with a disliked decision before the issue can get to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">So I dissent from the steps taken to. deny jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00bfn supporting their claim to the unanimous support (except for Jaftex) of the rule they now enunciate, my brothers have made the obvious, but telling, mistake of ignoring the important distinction between service pursuant to F.R. 4(d) (3) and that pursuant to F.R. 4 (d) (7). The latter permits actions to be 'commenced in federal courts by service of process on a foreign corporation in the manner prescribed by the law of the forum state. It would seem needless to say, had not the majority missed the point, that state law must of course be looked to in determining whether a defendant served pursuant to a state statute is properly before the court. So cases applying state law under F.R. 4(d) (7) have no relevance at all to the issue at hand, but show merely that the Federal Rules provide an alternative to the manner of service prescribed by F.R. 4 (d) (3) \u2014 -the rule to which the Jaftex doctrine applies and which is the only one of the rules here in issue. Yet the majority repeatedly wrest from context quotations from F.R. 4(d) (7) cases which are then presented as acclaim for their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Thus in Pulson v. American Rolling Mill Co., 1 Cir., 170 F.2d 193, quoted approvingly, and in the very recent case also cited, Waltham Precision Instrument Co. v. McDonnell Aircraft Corp., 1 Cir., 310 F.2d 20, service was made on the Massachusetts Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation under the provisions of Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 181, \u00a7 3A, which provides for substituted service on a foreign corporation that \u201cdoes business\u201d in the Commonwealth. In such cases there is necessarily (a) question whether the service comports with the state requirements for holding a foreign corporation responsible to the laws of the state, and \u2018Q).) whether these state requirements satisfy the commands of the United States Constitution. But to say this much is still to say nothing about the case in which service is made pursuant to F.R. 4(d) (3), rather than under a special state statute. Thus in all fairness we must disregard the deliberations of the First Circuit as immaterial to the issue which confronts us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The same is true of the Fifth Circuit cases which the majority cite. Connor v. New York Times Co., 5 Cir., 310 F.2d 133, reversing a previous decision, 5 Cir., 291 F.2d 492, concerned service on the defendant under the Alabama Substituted Service Statute, 2 Ala.Code 1940 (1955 Cum.Supp.) tit. 7, \u00a7 199(1), which provides that a foreign corporation appoints the secretary of state as process agent by \u201cdoing business\u201d in Alabama. In Stanga v. McCormick Shipping Corp., 5 Cir., 268 F.2d 544, 548, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals clearly recognizes the distinction between F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>4(d) (3) and F.R. 4(d) (7), which has eluded my brothers. That court starts its discussion of the jurisdictional problem in that case by observing about the person served:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">\u201cAs Holmes clearly was not a person described in F.R.Civ.P. 4(d) (3), 28 U.S.C.A. validity of the service of process depends wholly on it having been \u2018served * * * in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the service is made for the service of summons * * * upon any such defendant * * *.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201cThus have we come face to face with the law of Louisiana. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The language quoted by the Fifth Circuit is, of course, that of F.R. 4(d) <em>(7); </em>the law of Louisiana becomes important when the court determines that F.R. 4(d) (3) is not applicable and turns to F.R. 4 (d) (7). The statement quoted by my brothers to show support for them from! the Fifth Circuit was, as one might guess, taken from the court's discussion of Louisiana law which followed the above quotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The majority\u2019s pretentions of appellate support in the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits are equally unjustified. Electrical Equipment Co. v. Daniel Hamm Drayage Co., 8 Cir., 217 F.2d 656, involved service made in accordance with Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 494.2, subd. 6 \u2014 another statute making the secretary of state process agent for foreign corporations that do business on the forum state. In L. D. Reeder Contractors of Ariz. v. Higgins Industries, Inc., 9 Cir., 265 F.2d 768, the court, without discussion of this issue, looked to general law to decide whether the foreign corporation there did sufficient business in California to sustain service of process. Finally, in Steinway v. Majestic Amusement Co., 10 Cir., 179 F.2d 681, 18 A.L.R.2d 179, cert. denied 339 U.S. 947, 70 S.Ct. 802, 94 L.Ed. 1362, service'\u25a0jvas^'m.ade upon the secretary of state pursu\u00e1ht-4o Okla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 1.17. The court in that- case explicitly recognized that it was'proceeding under F.R. 4(d) (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The Sixth Circuit is admittedly regarded as at least tacitly in agreement with the Jaftex principle. See, e. g., First Flight Co. v. National Carloading Corp., D.C.E.D.Tenn., 209 F.Supp. 730, 735 n. 11 and accompanying text (opinion of Judge Frank W. Wilson approving of Jaftex) ; Shuler v. Wood, D.C.E.D.Tenn., 198 F.Supp. 801, 803 (opinion of Chief Judge Robert L. Taylor disapproving of Jaftex, with which he finds his Court of Appeals in seeming agreement); Paragon Oil Co. v. Panama Refining &amp; Petrochemical Co., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 192 F.Supp. 259, 261. The Sixth Circuit cases which indicate that the Court of Appeals there is allied with the Jaftex majority are Lasky v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., 6 Cir., 157 F.2d 674, where the court in a Per Curiam opinion without mention of the Ohio statute and looking to general law upheld service on the manager of the defendant\u2019s coal bureau at its Cleveland office; Bach v. Friden Calculating Mach. Co., 6 Cir., 167 F.2d 679, 680, where the court explicitly recognized F.R. 4(d) (7) as. an alternative manner of service to that prescribed by F.R. 4(d) (3), and, having noted an Ohio statute, Ohio Gen.Code \u00a7 11290, which provided to much the same effect as F.R. 4(d) (3), looked to both general and Ohio law to reverse a lower court order to quash the service on the managing agent of defendant\u2019s Cincinnati office; and Scholnik v. National Airlines, 6 Cir., 219 F.2d 115, 120, cert. denied National Airlines v. Scholnik, 349 U.S. 956, 75 S.Ct. 882, 99 L.Ed. 1280, where the court again recognized the distinction between F.R. 4(d) (3) and F.R. 4(d) (7) and found that \u201cunder either the Federal or State provision\u201d the service in question was sustainable. WSAZ, Inc. v. Lyons, 6 Cir., 254 F.2d 242, is in no way inconsistent with the above decisions, as my brothers seem to imply,, for not only did the action come to the federal courts by removal, but in addition it involved service upon the secretary of state pursuant to Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 271.385 and 271.610. Thus it was appropriate for the court in that case to have regard for Kentucky law.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Only the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has considered the disputed issue in Jaftex since it was decided, and that court took the not unusual course of expressly ruling on both local and federal grounds. Fiat Motor Co. v. Alabama Imported Cars, Inc., 110 U.S.App.D.C. 252, 292 F.2d 745, cert. denied 368 U.S. 898, 82 S.Ct. 175, 7 L.Ed.2d 94. See also the concurring opinion in Mutual International Export Co. v. Napco Industries, Inc., D.C.Cir., 316 F.2d 393, well stating the distinction in service under the two rules. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has remained silent on this issue; and the district court case, Easterling v. Cooper Motors, Inc., D.C.M.D.N.C., 26 F.R.D. 1, on which my brothers base their claim to the Fourth Circuit, was explicitly one under F.R. 4(d) (7), service having been pursuant to N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1\u201497.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Thus all that fairly remains of the majority\u2019s assertion of universal acclaim for their position is a divided Court of Appeals in the Third Circuit, Partin v. Michaels Art Bronze Co., 3 Cir., 202 F.2d 541, and the Seventh Circuit, Canvas Fabricators, Inc. v. William E. Hooper &amp; Sons Co., 7 Cir., 199 F.2d 485.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-11\">.

This scholarly response of a dozen articles, including a number by some of the most acute procedural scholars of the country, so soon after the decision and so unusual in both quality and quantity, hardly merits the majority\u2019s belittling denigration in its reference in note 13 to \u201cacademic support for Jaftex, based on a few [sic!] law review comments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Of the general law text writers, Professor Moore criticizes as \u201cnot sound\u201d the view of \u201c[s]ome federal courts * * * i that obtaining jurisdiction over a de- \u00a1 fendant is a matter falling under the Erie doctrine,\u201d 1A Moore\u2019s Eederal Practice 1f 0.317 [5], p. 3536 (2d Ed. 1961); 2 id. 1f 4.25, pp. 970, 971 (2d Ed. 1962); while the opposite view is supported in 1 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Eederal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 138, n. 35.4, \u00a7 179, n. 95.3 (Wright Ed. 1960), 1962 Pocket Parts \u00a7 138, nn. 35.4, 85, \u00a7 179, n. 95.3, but admitting a conflict in the cases. It is too early for extensive case citation of Jaftex; it is warmly approved in First Flight Co. v. National Carloading Corp., D.C.E.D.Tenn., 209 F.Supp. 730, and reluctantly followed (though actually doubtfully in point, see note 6 infra) in Southern New England Distributing Corp. v. Berkeley Finance Corp., D.C.Conn., 30 F.R.D. 43. See also the Appendix, p. 242, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">My brothers assume to find a modicum of that academic support, which they seem to need so desperately, in the ALI Study of the Division of Jurisdiction between State and Federal Courts (Tent. Draft No. 1, 1963), prepared by distinguished Reporters assisted by most distinguished Advisers, among whom the opinion writer here modestly omits reference to himself. It is difficult to perceive how much help can be drawn from this quite tentative and highly controversial, possibly courageous, possibly foolhardy, argument for preserving a shell of diversity jurisdiction, but only in sharply restricted form. Nowhere is there mention or direct discussion of Jaftex. But among the several proposals for limiting diversity jurisdiction, including the drastic one of denying it to a person in any district in a state of which he is a citizen, id. \u00a7 1302(a), p. 9, is one for a statute which rather ambiguously denies \u201cbinding effect\u201d upon any party beyond that which the local state law \u201cprescribes\u201d in a like action brought in its courts of general jurisdiction, id. \u00a7 1303, p. 11, and see pp. 54-56. (Query: Is this intended to do anything more than restate the original Erie doctrine, without the later procedural glosses added by cases such as this?) One suspects, in these days of increasing racial tension, that Congress will long hesitate before sharply limiting access to the federal courts as thus urged. Incidentally, as pointed out in id. p. 56, n. 15, the enactment of these statutes will call for a \u201cre-examination\u201d \u2014 i. e., repeal \u2014 of the just adopted amendments to F.R. 4(e) and (f) discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b284-5\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1693 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\u201cExcept <em>as </em>otherwise provided by Act of Congress, no person shall be arrested in one district for trial in another in any civil action in a district court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\">. These provisions seem to have received a mixed reception. See, e. g., Carrington, The Modern Utility of Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 303 (1962); Abraham, Constitutional Limitations upon the Territorial Scope of Service of Federal Process, 32 F.R.D. 83; Elliott &amp; Green, Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction in the Federal Courts: The Proposed Amendments to Rule 4, 48 Iowa L.Rev. 300 (1963).

The majority opinion appears to find great difficulty in how to treat removed cases. 'This issue is not before us and no definitive ruling is necessary, but I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>do not see the difficulty or any attempt by two circuit judges to overrule <em>sub silentio </em>a decision of the Supreme Court, as well as one by Judge Learned Hand\u2014 conce.dedly \u201cno mean feat,\u201d were it ever to happen.

Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949), look toward application of^ state standards as to amenability to suit^; at least in diversity cases such as this. I also agree that it is desirable that the\\ District Judge, experienced in Vermont Law, pass upon the Vermont law issue in the first instance, and that he should dispose first of the issues of jurisdiction and venue before considering whether a claim has been stated on which relief may be granted, all on the present complaint and affidavits or such amplification as he may see fit to allow,</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"Ad1\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-3\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"azd-dedup-0\">I concur in the result reached by the majority of my colleagues. I join in the vacation of the order of the court below so that it will be clear that the learned district judge consider the questions of jurisdiction and of venue. I share with Judge Smith the belief that Vermont has constitutional power to give its courts jurisdiction over this claim, and I am of the opinion that such jurisdiction would have been asserted here if the case had been brought in a Vermont state court,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
