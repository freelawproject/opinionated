McAfee, of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, New York City, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b984-9\">Before LUMBARD, Chief Judge, and HAYS and MARSHALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b984-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">In this stockholder\u2019s suit to set aside the results of the 1963 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting of the Columbia Broadcasting System, plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings, and in support of her motion, filed an unsworn \u201cmemorandum\u201d containing allegations of fraud and misconduct by appellees and their counsel. On defendants\u2019 motion, the district court ordered plaintiff to show cause why this document should not be stricken from the files as a wilful abuse of process and why the complaint should not be dismissed, and the plaintiff held in contempt. In addition, the court ordered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-12\">\u201c[T]hat plaintiff, her agents, advisers, experts, employees and all other persons or entities acting for or on behalf of plaintiff or with her knowledge and consent be, and the same hereby are enjoined and restrained until the entry of a final order on this motion from in any way publishing, disseminating, publicizing or otherwise promulgating to any person or entity all or any portion of the document * * * or any of the matters contained therein, and communicating with any person or entity with respect thereto, except that nothing herein shall prevent plaintiff from serving and filing any affidavits and briefs as set forth below and, in connection therewith, from retaining any attorney duly admitted to practice and, in connection therewith, making to him any disclosures in respect of such document or the matters therein contained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"apt-dedup-1\">Plaintiff appeals from so much of the order as we have quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">Appellee urges that the order is a temporary restraining order, Fed.R. Civ.P. 65(b), and therefore not appealable. Grant v. United States, 282 F.2d 165 (2d Cir., 1960). We hold that the order is in the nature of a preliminary injunction, and therefore appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (1). See Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. Flight Engineers\u2019 Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, 306 F.2d 840, 843 (2d Cir., 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">Insofar as the order enjoins appellant from \u201cin any way publishing, disseminating, publicizing or otherwise promulgating to any person or entity all or any portion of the document\u201d, we hold that, in view of the nature of the document, the order was properly issued under the inherent \u201cequitable powers of courts of law over their own process, to prevent abuses, oppression, and injustice.\u201d Gumbel v. Pitkin, 124 U.S. 131, 144, 8 S.Ct. 379, 383-384, 31 L.Ed. 374 (1888); see, 1 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 0.60[6] (2d ed. 1961); cf. Pueblo de Taos v. Archuleta, 64 F.2d 807, 813 (10th Cir., 1933); Rudnicki v. McCormack, 210 F.Supp. 905, 908-912 (D.R.I.1962), appeal dismissed, Rudnicki v. Cox, 372 U.S. 226, 83 S.Ct. 679, 9 L.Ed.2d 714 (1963); Deem v. Aero Mayflower Transit Co., 24 F.R.D. 16 (S.D.Cal.1959); Pollack v. Aspbury, 14 F.R.D. 454 (S.D.N.Y.1953), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>cert. denied, 348 U.S. 903, 75 S.Ct. 228, 99 L.Ed. 709 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">However, the order also enjoins appellant from communicating with any person with regard to any \u201cmatters contained\u201d in the memorandum. This part of the order is repugnant to the First Amendment to the Constitution, Crosby v. Bradstreet Co., 312 F.2d 483 (2d Cir., 1963); cf. Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931), and to historic principles of equity. American Malting Co. v. Keitel, 209 F. 351 (2d Cir., 1913); Kuhn v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., 29 F.Supp. 800 (S.D.N.Y.1939). The following must therefore be stricken from the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-6\">\u201cor any of the matters contained therein, and communicating with any person or entity with respect thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
