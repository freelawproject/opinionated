Williamson, an employee of Moses-Ecco, and his wife. They alleged that, as a result of the negligence of Roscoe-Ajax in failing properly to install and maintain certain guard rails, Williamson fell five and one-half stories and sustained serious injuries. Roscoe-Ajax promptly filed the present third-party complaint under Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure against Moses-Ecco and Detwiler for all sums which might be adjudged against Roscoe-Ajax in the main action.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The claim against Moses-Ecco was based upon an indemnification provision in the subcontract which we describe later. The claim against Detwiler for indemnification or contribution was based on an allegation that Williamson\u2019s injuries were caused solely by the negligence of Detwiler or jointly by Detwiler and Roscoe-Ajax.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Two jury trials of the main action were commenced. In the first, after the jury had returned a verdict of $120,000 against Roscoe-Ajax, the trial judge declared a mistrial because of prejudicial remarks in plaintiffs\u2019 closing argument to the jury. Hence, the third-party complaint was not reached. At the second trial, and near its completion, plaintiffs and defendant agreed to a settlement of the main action under which a consent judgment of $45,000 was entered in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">Thereafter, in a trial of the third-party action, without a jury, the court entered judgment in favor of Roscoe-Ajax against Moses-Ecco for $45,000 plus costs and expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending against plaintiffs\u2019 claim; and it dismissed the third-party complaint against Detwiler. These consolidated appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\"> Moses-Ecco\u2019s main contention is that the indemnification provision of the subcontract lacks the positiveness which the law requires to indemnify Roscoe-Ajax for its own affirmative negligence. That provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-15\">\u201cThe Subcontractor [Moses-Ecco] agrees in the performance of this contract * <em>* * </em>that he will at all times indemnify and save harmless the Owner and the Contractor [Roscoe-Ajax] against any loss, because of injury or damage to persons or property arising or resulting from the performance of this contract, including any and all loss, cost, damage or expense which the Owner and/or Contractor may sustain or in- \u25a0 cur on account of any claim, demand or suit made or brought against them or either of them by or on behalf of any employee of ,[Moses-Ecco] * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">Losses incurred by Roscoe-Ajax through its own negligence are not specifically included. And Moses-Ecco urges here, as it did below, that no intention to include such losses \u201cis otherwise clearly and unequivocally revealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">We accept the principle that where, as here, the agreement does not specifically refer to losses incurred by the indem-nitee\u2019s own negligence, the intent to cover such losses must otherwise plainly appear from the agreement. Maiatico v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., 109 U.S.App.D.C. 310, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>287 F.2d 349 (1961). \u201cNo particular form or words are needed but the intent to waive negligence must be clear.\u201d Maiatico v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., supra; and see General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp., Ltd., v. Smith &amp; Oby Co., 272 F.2d 581, 77 A.L.R.2d 1134 (6th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The District Court concluded that the language of the indemnification agreement in the present case was so broad and sweeping as to plainly reveal an intent to encompass losses incurred in whole or in part by the negligence of the indemnitee. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied upon Chesapeake Beach R. Co. v. Hupp Automatic Mail Exchange Co., 48 App.D.C. 123 (1918); Princemont Construction Corp. v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 131 A.2d 877 (D.C.Mun.Ct.App.1947); and Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Robertson, 214 F.2d 746 (4th Cir. 1954) (citing cases). We think the view of the District Court is correct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">It is difficult to conceive of any phraseology broader than Moses-Ecco\u2019s agreement to indemnify Roscoe-Ajax against \u201cany and all loss, cost, damage, or expense * * * on account of any claim, demand or suit * * * by or on behalf of any employee of [Moses-Ecco] * Since the parties specified that \u201call\u201d losses on \u201cany\u201d claims included those of Moses-Ecco\u2019s employees, we think further specification would be superfluous and ritualistic. Moreover, it would appear that no valid claim by an employee of Moses-Ecco could arise against Roscoe-Ajax except through Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s own negligence. Consequently to exclude losses caused by Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s negligence would deprive that part of the clause which refers to the claims by employees of Moses-Ecco against Roscoe-Ajax of virtually the only meaning it can possibly have. See Rice v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 202 F.2d 861 (2d Cir. 1953); cf. Farrell v. Eastern Bridge &amp; Structural Co., 291 Mass. 323, 197 N.E. 68 (1935)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">An additional argument advanced by Moses-Ecco is that in the claim over for indemnification, Roscoe-Ajax had the burden of proving that it had suffered an \u201cactual liability,\u201d and that since the issue of Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s liability to plaintiffs was not adjudicated in either the main action or the third-party action, indemnification will not lie for the payment in settlement of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. This position is apparently taken on the view that a settlement may not be deemed to reflect an \u201cactual liability\u201d and that they are somehow mutually exclusive. Support for this view is rested on the fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>lowing language of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\u201cA claim for indemnity * * * requires that an actual liability be sustained by the indemnitee, and if he settles a claim without a determination of the rights in question, he bears the risk of proving an actual liability in the action over for indemnity.\u201d [The Toledo, 122 F.2d 255, 257 (2d Cir.), cert. denied Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. v. The Toledo, 314 U.S. 689, 62 S.Ct. 302, 86 L.Ed. 551 (1941).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We think, however, that this must be read to mean only that, if an indemnitor challenges a settlement as imprudent, the indemnitee must justify it as prudent. This meaning is supported by a very recent decision of the Second Circuit recognizing that recovery by an in-demnitee is not precluded simply because he settled the main claim rather than litigate it to final judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">\u201c[W]hen * * * the shipowner defendant [indemnitee] settles before judgment with the longshoreman plaintiff the stevedore [indem-nitor] still may be liable over to the shipowner on the stevedore\u2019s contractual obligation of indemnification. [Cites omitted.] A contrary result that would require the pursuit of the action to a judgment would conflict with the policy, which pervades all areas of the law, of encouraging settlement wherever it is possible. In cases in which the main action has been so settled, it is of course incumbent upon the court which entertains the claim for indemnity to determine before requiring the stevedore to indemnify the shipowner whether it was reasonable for the shipowner to have entered into the settlement.\u201d [Paliaga v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., 301 F.2d 403, 409-410 (2d Cir. 1962) (Citing cases.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">And this accords with Justice Holmes statement that \u201ca sum paid in the prudent settlement of a suit is paid under the compulsion of the suit as truly as if it were paid upon execution.\u201d St. Louis Dressed Beef &amp; Provision Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 201 U.S. 173, 182, 26 S.Ct. 400, 50 L.Ed. 712 (1906). Moreover, the parties did not contract to exclude indemnification for settlement. On the contrary they included indemnification for loss <em>\u201con account of any claim demand or suit </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.) This clearly encompasses settlements and is not limited to litigated judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">It follows that Roscoe-Ajax did not lose its contract right to indemnification simply because it settled plaintiffs\u2019 claim. And in the trial of the claim over for indemnification, there was no need for an adjudication of Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s liability to plaintiffs because the issue before the trial judge was whether Roscoe-Ajax was reasonable and prudent in settling, not whether it had been negligent and was therefore legally liable to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">Although Moses-Ecco says in one breath that \u201cthe reasonableness of the settlement is not in dispute * * * \u201d it says in the next breath that indemnification will not lie because Roscoe-Ajax abandoned certain defenses to plaintiffs\u2019 claim. We lay aside this apparent inconsistency and discuss the merits of the later statement. The main defense to which Moses-Ecco refers is that plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive remedy was to seek benefits under the District of Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, D.C.Code \u00a7 36-501 et seq. (1961),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that Roscoe-Ajax was not a \u201cthird person\u201d within the meaning of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 904, 905, 933 (Supp. III, 1962), against whom plaintiffs could maintain a common-law action for damages. It appears, however, that this court has never decided whether a general contractor is a \u201cthird person\u201d who can be sued at common law by an employee of a subcon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>tractor whose employees are covered by the District of Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act; that question has been subject to differing resolutions in other jurisdictions with similar statutes. See Jonathan Woodner Co. v. Mather, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 234, 210 F.2d 868, cert. denied, 348 U.S. 824, 75 S.Ct. 39, 99 L.Ed. 650 (1954); Smith v. John B. Kelly, Inc., 107 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 275 F.2d 169 (1960) (concurring opinion of Washington, J.); and authorities cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Thus, it may be said that plaintiffs\u2019 claim rested on a question of law open and debatable in this jurisdiction. Ordinarily a settlement between the parties in such cases is motivated by a mutual desire to avoid the expense and risks of litigation. There is no allegation that a different motive prevailed here. In these circumstances a settlement payment, made when the law was uncertain, cannot be successfully attacked on the basis of any subsequent resolution of the uncertainty. Otherwise the public policy of encouraging settlements<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would be seriously undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Finally, Moses-Ecco asserts that the court below erred in allowing attorneys\u2019 fees as part of Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s recovery. It is of course true that attorneys\u2019 fees may not be taxed to either party unless provided for either by law or by agreement between the parties. D.C.Code \u00a7 11-1501 (1961); Rosden v. Leuthold, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 89, 274 F.2d 747 (1960). We think that the agreement of Moses-Ecco to indemnify Roscoe-Ajax for \u201cany and all loss, cost, damage or expense\u201d clearly includes attorneys\u2019 fees. Cf. General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp., Ltd. v. Smith &amp; Oby Co., supra; B &amp; G Electric Company v. G. E. Bass &amp; Company, 252 F.2d 698 (5th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">. Maiatico v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., supra, is not to the contrary. There the issue was whether the landlord\u2019s covenant to repair fire damages promptly and at his own expense constituted a waiver by the landlord of his claim against the tenant for fire damages caused by the tenant\u2019s negligence. Our holding that the covenant did not spell out an intent to exculpate the tenant from the legal consequences of his own negligence turned lai\u2019gely upon considerations peculiar to the relationship of landlord-tenant, and particularly upon the fact that \u201c[t]he parties were not contracting with respect to any subject except the matter of who was to take the steps necessary to render the leased premises usable [after a fire].\u201d In the present case the parties were contracting with specific reference to indemnification and hence the issue is whether exculpation is spelled out in an indemnification clause. Though governed by the same general principles of law, tkis is quite different from the issue whether exculpation is spelled out in a covenant to repair.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\">. Moses-Ecco relies heavily on Batson-Cook Co. v. Industrial Steel Erectors, 257 F.2d 410 (5th Cir. 1958), wherein the court construed a broad indemnification clause not to include recovery for losses caused by the general contractor-indemnitee\u2019s own negligence. But the clause in that case did not contain specific reference to claims brought by employees of the subcontractor-indemnitor and as the court pointed out, there were many situations other than negligence of the indemnitee to which the clause might apply. 257 F.2d at 413-414.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">To the extent that the Batson-Cook case may appear to require the use of special legal terms such as \u201cfault,\u201d \u201cnegligence\u201d or \u201cliability,\u201d we decline to follow it.

We do not reach Roseoe-Ajax\u2019s appeal from the judgment in favor of Detwiler since Roscoe-Ajax has advised us that it wishes to pursue that appeal only if we reverse its judgment against Moses-Ecco.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b736-9\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-Re\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">The Williamsons\u2019 suit, which Roscoe-Ajax settled during the progress of the second trial, was based on the alleged sole, independent negligence of the latter. The majority hold \u2014 erroneously, I think \u2014that Moses-Ecco had indemnified Roscoe-Ajax against loss caused by its own negligence. But that mistaken conclusion does not require or justify the award of indemnity against Moses-Ecco, as Roscoe-Ajax did not claim or prove that its negligence produced Williamson\u2019s injuries, but steadfastly denied guilt of negligence. Nor was its negligence judicially found, either in the main or the indemnity action. In those circumstances, it must be concluded, I think, that Roscoe-Ajax settled voluntarily, without any legal compulsion whatever and that it is not entitled to indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">I shall therefore first discuss Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s plain failure to show entitlement to indemnity even under the erroneous holding that it was protected from liability arising from its own negligence. Later in this dissent, I shall demonstrate, at least to my own satisfaction, that the contract did not indemnify Roscoe-Ajax against loss occasioned by its own negligence and that therefore it could not recover under the indemnity agreement, even if Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s negligence had been shown or judicially found.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">On November 24, 1958, Roscoe-Ajax Corporation, the general contractor for the construction of an addition to the Shoreham Hotel, engaged Moses-Ecco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Company as subcontractor for the conCrete work. While construction was in progress, George W. Williamson, a laborer employed by Moses-Ecco, fell about five and one-half stories down an open chimney shaft to the concrete floor of the basement, and suffered severe permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"AWWc\">On June 22, 1959, Williamson and his wife sued Roscoe-Ajax, charging it with negligent installation and maintenance of the railing on the landing above the fifth floor from which Williamson fell. Roseoe-Ajax filed a third-party complaint against Moses-Ecco seeking indemnification for all sums which might be adjudged against it, based on the following provision of the subcontract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZfT\">\u201c7. The Subcontractor agrees in the performance of this contract to observe and comply with all laws, ordinances and regulations of all constituted authorities relating to the manner of doing the work under this contract or to the materials supplied therein, and shall also provide and maintain the necessary protection to his employees, other employees, and the public; that he will at all times indemnify and save harmless the Owner and the Contractor against any loss, because of injury or damage to persons or property arising or resulting from the performance of this contract, including any and all loss, cost, damage or expense which the Owner and/or Contractor may sustain or incur on account of any claim, demand or suit made or brought against them or either of them by or on behalf of any employee of the Subcontractor, or by or on behalf of any person injured by the Subcontractor, his servants, agents or employees, or in case of any claim being made or action instituted for any act or omission of the Subcontractor resulting in injury or damage to persons or property, and a proper and sufficient amount of the contract price may be retained by the Contractor as his indemnity pending the determinasettlement or adjustment of any suc c aim or sul^</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aa8-dedup-0\">Roscoe-Ajax also made one Detwiler, Moses-Ecco\u2019s superintendent, a third-party defendant, alleging his negligence caused the accident. Thereafter, Roscoe-Ajax filed an answer to the complaint in which it denied negligence,</p>\n<p id=\"ahg-dedup-0\">The first trial of tbe Wmiamsons&gt; case against Roscoe-Ajax ended October 18, 1961, with a jury verdict in their favor in the total sum of $120,000. But, because of improper argument to the jury, the trial judge declared a mistrial, as a result of which the third-party action was not then tried,</p>\n<p id=\"adp-dedup-0\">The Will\u00edamsons&gt; Buit ag.ainst Roscoe. Ajax came on for trial a second time on December 5, 1961. At the conclusion of the p]aintiffs&gt; evidence, Roscoe-Ajax moved foP a directed verdict on the grounds (a) that the plaintiffs&gt; exclusive remedy was under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of March 4, 1927,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which has been made applicable to the District of Columbia,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (b) <em>that a prima facie case of negligence had not been made out. </em>The court reserved rulings on these points and Roscoe-Ajax began its presentation 0f evidence, during the course of which a settlement was reached pursuant to which a consent judgment was entered against Roscoe-Ajax in the amount of $45,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>After an interval following the settlement, the third-party action came on for hearing on December 18, 1961. The general contract between the Shoreham Hotel and Roscoe-Ajax and the subcontract between Roscoe-Ajax and Moses-Ecco were received in evidence. In addition, a certificate from an insurance company that certain policies held by Moses-Ecco covered the Shoreham job, and a section of the District of Columbia Safety Standards, Rules and Regulations in regard to construction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were introduced by Roscoe-Ajax. There was no other evidence. Its attorney asked to be allowed a fee of $5,000 from Mioses-Ecco.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The case was under advisement until February 12, 1962, when the District Court dismissed the third-party complaint as to Detwiler and awarded to Roscoe-Ajax judgment against Moses-Ecco for the sum of $46,033.67 plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Moses-Ecco appeals from this judgment and Roscoe-Ajax appeals from the dismissal of the third-party complaint against Detwiler.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">I observe from the paragraph of the subcontract heretofore quoted that Moses-Ecco agreed to \u201cat all times indemnify and save harmless the Owner [Shoreham Hotel] and the Contractor [Roscoe-Ajax] against any loss, because of injury or damage to persons or property arising or resulting from the performance of this contract * * The substance of this promise is to pay a loss which Shoreham or Roscoe-Ajax had been compelled to pay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Obviously, Moses-Ecco did not agree to repay a gratuity but only that which was paid under compulsion. St. Louis Dressed Beef &amp; Provision Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 201 U.S. 173, 182, 26 S.Ct. 400, 50 L.Ed. 712 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">I agree with the Second Circuit\u2019s statement in The Toledo, 122 F.2d 255, 257, cert. denied Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. v. The Toledo, 314 U.S. 689, 62 S.Ct. 302, 86 L.Ed. 551 (1941):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-14\">* * a claim for indemnity, however, requires that an actual liability be sustained by the indem-nitee, and if he settles a claim without a determination of the rights in question, he bears the risk of proving an actual liability in the action over for indemnity. [Cases cited.] * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">Here, in settling with Williamson without its actionable negligence having been first judicially determined, Roscoe-Ajax took the risk of proving actual liability on its part as the basis of the right to indemnity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">There had been no judicial determination of liability in the main action, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>there was no evidence of negligence at the trial of the third-party proceeding. So the only proof of its negligence which Roscoe-Ajax could point to in support of its claim to indemnity was such evidence to that effect as was introduced by the Williamsons at the trial of the main action; as will appear hereinafter, Roscoe-Ajax admits it could not rely upon that evidence in the trial of the third-party suit against Moses-Ecco, and maintains that a judicial holding in the main action that it was negligent, had one been made, would not have been <em>res judicata </em>in the action against Moses-Ecco.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Moreover, at the conclusion of the Wil-liamsons\u2019 evidence, Roscoe-Ajax had moved for a directed verdict, claiming its negligence had not been shown, and the trial court was in such doubt that it reserved its ruling on the motion. Then, during the presentation of its own evidence, while the trial judge still had under advisement its motion for a directed verdict for failure of proof of negligence, and when it was still denying negligence, Roscoe-Ajax settled for $45,-000. And in its brief on this appeal, protesting its innocence and asserting the settlement \u201cshould not be construed as an admission of negligence by it,\u201d Roscoe-Ajax said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201cThere Has Been No Judicial Determination That Plaintiff\u2019s Injuries Were The Result of The Negligence of Roscoe-Ajax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201cRoscoe-Ajax emphatically denied that it was negligent as alleged in the complaint. The claims of the plaintiff were vigorously defended through one trial and until near the end of the second trial. The evidence on how the injury occurred was sharply conflicting. Indeed, the Trial Judge indicated some doubt as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence by taking under advisement defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">\u201cThe settlement of plaintiff\u2019s claims by Roscoe-Ajax after renewing its demand upon Moses-Ecco to assume the defense as required by the provisions of the subcontract, should not be construed as an admission of negligence by it. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">Thus, although its negligence was not found as a fact in the principal action and was neither alleged nor proved in the third-party proceeding, and although it insisted it was not negligent, Roscoe-Ajax seeks indemnity for settling a suit based on its negligence, and at the same time contends the settlement should not be construed as an admission of negligence. This amounts to a claim of indemnity for a voluntary payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Curiously enough, Roscoe-Ajax complains in its brief that \u201cMoses-Ecco did not introduce any evidence of the negligence of Roscoe-Ajax at the trial on the third-party complaint.\u201d It would have been passing strange if Moses-Ecco had done so even if it could have done it, for that would have amounted to supplying, to its own detriment, the insufficiency of the proof in Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s third-party action against it. It was incumbent upon Roscoe-Ajax to introduce or to point to evidence of its own negligence in order to show it acted under compulsion in settling with the Williamsons. Instead of introducing such evidence, or even trying to rely on the Williamsons\u2019 proof, Roscoe-Ajax argues to the contrary. I quote the following from its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">\u201c * * * Assuming that the trial judge could make a finding of negligence on the part of Roscoe-Ajax from the evidence presented in the trial on the complaint * * * the memorandum opinion of the trial judge contains no such finding. Even in the presence of an assumption or finding that Roscoe-Ajax was negligent in the trial on the complaint, such an assumption or finding would not be <em>res judicata </em>and binding upon the parties in the trial on the third-party complaint. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">These statements seem to be a clear admission by the appellee that the trial court erred in holding Moses-Ecco liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>for indemnity. To recapitulate: Roscoe-Ajax did nothing at the trial of the third-party action to carry the burden of showing its own negligence in order to show the settlement was made under compulsion ; and, as shown in the above quotation, it agrees that in the third-party action against Moses-Ecco it could not rely on the Williamsons\u2019 evidence of its negligence which was adduced at the main trial. Anyway, as heretofore pointed out, Roscoe-Ajax stoutly insisted that evidence was insufficient, especially in view of the fact that the trial judge never did deny its motion for a directed verdict on that ground. In these circumstances, I am constrained to conclude that nothing in the record indicates the settlement was anything more than a voluntary and gratuitous payment. To hold that Moses-Ecco must indemnify Roscoe-Ajax for loss due to the latter\u2019s negligence when that negligence has not been shown is just as illogical as to hold that an insurance company must pay a claim for fire loss before it has been shown that a fire actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In attempting to avoid the effect of the Second Circuit\u2019s The Toledo case,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from which I have heretofore cited the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">\u201c * * * A ciaim <em>for </em>indemnity, however, requires that an actual liability be sustained by the indemnitee, and if he settles a claim without a determination of the rights in question, he bears the risk of proving an actual liability in the action over for indemnity. [Cases cited.] * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APY\">the majority say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201c * * * We think, however, that this must be read to mean only that, if an indemnitor challenges a settlement as imprudent, the indemnitee must justify it as prudent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In support of this statement, the majority quote from the St. Louis Dressed Beef case<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this excerpt: \u201c* * * [A] sum paid in the prudent settlement of a suit is paid under the compulsion of the suit as truly as if it were paid upon execution.\u201d Here is where I think the majority are confused. They seem to think and hold that in an action over for indemnity to recover a sum paid in the settlement of a suit, the only question is whether the sum paid was \u201cprudent\u201d in the sense of whether it was a reasonable amount in relation to the injuries suffered and the damages demanded by the original plaintiff. Indeed, the excerpt from the Dressed Beef opinion, standing alone, might be thought to support that view; but, as I have already pointed out, the facts of that case show that the indemnitee was legally liable to the injured person \u2014 the Eighth Circuit had certified to the Supreme Court that the indemnitee was negligent \u2014 so the only question was whether the settlement was \u201cprudent\u201d in amount. But here, as I have emphasized already, there was no showing whatever that Roscoe-Ajax was negligent and so legally liable to the William-sons. So, in the language of The Toledo, case, the indemnitee here bore \u201cthe risk of proving an actual liability in the action over for indemnity.\u201d Roscoe-Ajax not only failed to do this, but instead disclaimed actual liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Hence, their failure to appreciate the full meaning of the term \u201cprudent settlement\u201d has led the majority into confused thinking. Their opinion indicates, I repeat, that the only consideration entitled to weight is whether the amount paid in settlement was reasonable in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and his demands. They fail to realize that no matter how reasonable a settlement may be in that respect, it is not a \u201cprudent\u201d settlement for which the indemnitee is entitled to recover from the indemnitor <em>unless the in-demnitee was obliged to pay it because of potential liability arising from its negligence. </em>Thus, the majority are in effect saying the indemnity agreement does <em>more </em>than protect Roscoe-Ajax against its own negligence; they are saying it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>actually indemnifies Roscoe-Ajax against <em>allegations </em>of negligence, frivolous or \u25a0otherwise. To impute such an intent to Moses-Ecco from the terms of the agreement is, to say the least, unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">As illustrative of the majority\u2019s misconception in this regard, I note that they accuse Moses-Ecco of being inconsistent in denying liability for indemnity and at the same time saying \u201cthe reasonableness of the settlement is not in dispute \u25a0* * But Moses-Ecco was only saying that $45,000 was a reasonable amount to pay in settlement if \u2014 and only if\u2014 Roscoe-Ajax had been negligent and so was legally liable to pay damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Even under its theory that Roscoe-Ajax -was indemnified against its own negligence, I think that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the court should .accept Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s contention that it was in no way responsible for Williamson\u2019s injuries, and should hold that therefore the indemnity agreement could not be invoked; this would necessitate reversal and remand with directions to enter judgment in favor of Moses-Ecco.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Alternately, again assuming that Roscoe-Ajax was indemnified against its own negligence, I think the majority could logically reverse the judgment awarding indemnity, and remand the case for a new trial at which evidence would be heard and a finding made as to whether Roscoe-Ajax was negligent and so settled under legal compulsion. This course would give Roscoe-Ajax another opportunity to make out a case for indemnity, and would give Moses-Ecco a chance to cross-examine and to introduce countervailing evidence. Such procedure would avoid the present strained affirmance which requires Moses-Ecco to reimburse Roscoe-Ajax for what seems to me to have been a voluntary and gratuitous settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The foregoing discussion is based on the assumption that the indemnity agreement was intended to and does protect Roscoe-Ajax from the consequences of its own negligence, and in my opinion the discussion is necessary only if the indemnifying language is so construed. As I have said, my brethren are of the view that Moses-Ecco agreed to indemnify Roscoe-Ajax for loss incurred through its own negligence. I disagree. In my opinion, the indemnifying language of the subcontract does not provide <em>in express terms </em>that indemnity must be paid for a loss sustained by Roscoe-Ajax through its own negligence, and that therefore the latter was not entitled to indemnity, even had its actionable negligence been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">It is a general rule that an indemnity agreement does not protect the indem-nitee from the consequences of his own negligence unless its language expressly provides for such indemnity. The intent to provide it must clearly and unequivocally appear, and it is held that words of general import are not enough. This general principle, which as far as I know is followed by practically all jurisdictions where the question has arisen, was stated in Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Mayor and Bd. of Aldermen <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">\u201cIt is well settled that a contract of indemnity will not be construed to indemnify the indemnitee against losses resulting to him through his own negligent acts, where such intention is not expressed in unequivocal terms. [Cases cited.] * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">The Fifth Circuit also held, in Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Paulk,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that indemnity agreements are strictly construed against him who claims to be an indemnitee, and further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-12\">\u201c * * * This is particularly true where the result would be to indemnify against one\u2019s own negligence, and it will not be so construed unless such obligation is expressed in unequivocal terms. [Cases cited.] * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">Among the many other cases to the same effect is City of Boston v. Boston Edison Company.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There the City of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Boston had been found liable to property-owners for negligence in failing to act promptly and effectively when it received notice that an unusual flow of city water was occurring near a place where a break in the city water main was later discovered. Boston Edison had installed, many years before, a steam main near the water main. On the theory that the steam main caused the break in the water main, the City sought indemnity from Boston Edison under an ordinance providing that any person maintaining a structure under a street</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">\u201c * * * \u2018shall do so only on condition that such maintenance shall be considered as an agreement on his part with the city to keep the same and the covers thereof in good repair and condition at all times during his ownership and to indemnify and save harmless the city against any and all damages, costs, expenses, or compensation which it may sustain or be required to pay, by reason of such excavation or structure being under or in the street, or being out of repair during his ownership * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The <em>City\u2019s </em>cross-complaint, based on the indemnity provision of the ordinance, was dismissed because the District Court held that provision could not be construed as intended to save the City harmless from the consequences of its own subsequent independent negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In upholding the dismissal, the First Circuit adopted as relevant (260 F.2d at 880) the following language in Laskowski v. Manning<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to the effect that a contract of indemnity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201c * * * \u2018will not be considered as indemnifying one against his own negligence, or that of his employees, unless its express language requires it. Such an intent must unequivocally appear, and words of general import are not sufficient. It is not to be assumed in the absence of clear stipulation that a contract is to be construed as creating a result so far reaching, and involving consequences which may be so hazardous and momentous.\u2019 * * * \u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKN\">After this quotation, the First Circuit added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">\u201c * * * Especially now, in view of the unassailable finding of the jury in its special verdict to the effect that this subsequent action, or inaction, by the city employees amounted to \u2018wanton or reckless conduct\u2019, it is even more difficult to suppose that this so-called agreement of indemnity was intended to relieve the City of the consequences of such a serious gradation of fault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">On the basis of these cases and many other authorities of identical import, I conclude the indemnity agreement here involved does not protect Roscoe-Ajax from the consequences of its own independent negligence, because it does not expressly, clearly and unequivocally provide for such protection; in fact, it does not so provide even in general terms which, as I have shown, would not be enough. An examination of the agreement for indemnity reveals not a word indicating an intention on the part of the parties to require the indemnitor to save the indemnitee harmless from loss due to its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">In reaching this conclusion I have not overlooked Chesapeake Beach R. Co. v. Hupp Automatic Mail Exchange Co., 48 App.D.C. 123, 128-129 (1918), which may be thought to depart from the general rule, but which I think is an exception due to the particular facts involved. In the Chesapeake case this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atu-dedup-0\">\u201cIf we admit that an indemnitor is not liable for the negligence of the indemnitee except where it is expressly provided that it should be, that would not aid the position of the Hupp company and its surety, because as we construe the contract before us it in effect expressly provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>for injuries flowing from negligence. Loss might come to the Chesapeake company through its own negligence, as well as otherwise. The presence on or near the track of the Hupp company\u2019s employees, and of others, such as Gilmore, brought there by its invitation, necessarily increased the chances of accident for which the Chesapeake company might be responsible. It was natural that the latter should desire to protect itself against loss on this account, even where it was caused by the negligence of its own employees. If, as contended, it was the intention of the parties to the contract that it should be limited to \u2018liability for accidents for which the Hupp company\u2019s operations were responsible,\u2019 it would have been easy to have said so instead of using the all-embracing language which we have been considering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Hupp was not engaged by the railroad company to aid in accomplishing its purpose, but was merely a tenant of railroad premises whose employees by their presence there increased the possibility of personal injury by the railroad\u2019s operation of its trains. It was against this added hazard, said the court, which the railroad company required indemnity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The indemnity agreement was a part of the consideration paid for the use of the premises. Its only purpose was to protect the railroad company from loss because of injury to Hupp\u2019s employees and invitees through the railroad\u2019s negligence; it was meaningless unless so construed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">This case is quite different. Moses-Ecco was not a tenant whose employees might by their presence add more hazard to Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s operations. It was engaged to do a part of the general work, and to some extent its employees were bound to use facilities furnished by Roscoe-Ajax. It was alleged that one of these facilities was defective, through the sole negligence of Roscoe-Ajax, and caused the injury. To apply the ruling of the Chesapeake case to this situation would be to extend its doctrine beyond the facts with which it dealt, and would be contrary to the general rule which is followed in an overwhelming majority of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">I agree with the majority that under our workmen\u2019s compensation statute a general contractor is suable as a \u201cthird person\u201d by an employee of a subcontractor. Continental Casualty Co. v. Thorden Line, 186 F.2d 992, 996 (4th Cir. 1951). Consequently, I too reject the argument that Williamson\u2019s remedy under that statute precluded him from suing Roscoe-Ajax. I also think the third-party complaint against Detwiler was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">In sum, the majority err in two respects; first, in construing the contract as indemnifying Roscoe-Ajax against its own negligence; and second, in affirming an award of indemnity under that construction when the indemnitee\u2019s negligence was not claimed, proved or judicially found. I must dissent from the majority\u2019s action in holding Moses-Ecco liable as indemnitor in such circumstances.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-39\">. 44 Stat. 1424, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ABbs\">. 45 Stat. 600, \u00a7 36-501, D.C.Code (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AW4\">. Before agreeing to the consent judgment, Roscoe-Ajax called upon Moses-Bceo to admit liability under the subcontract.

Assuming for the discussion, without conceding, that the indemnity agreement protected an indemnitee from the consequences of its own independent negligence. This point will be considered later in this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-10\">. The fact that the settlement was reached before the conclusion of the trial does not militate against Roscoe-Ajax\u2019s right to indemnity, for the Supreme Court has said, \u201c[A] sum paid in the prudent settlement of a suit is paid under the compulsion of the suit as truly as if it were paid upon execution.\u201d St. Louis Dressed Beef &amp; Provision Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 201 U.S. at 182, 26 S.Ct. at <em>404. </em>In that case, the settlement was made before the trial began. But the negligence of the indemnitee was unequivocally stated as a fact by the Eighth Circuit in certifying the legal questions which the Supreme Court was answering. It is thus clear that the statement just quoted was made by the Supreme Court with the knowledge that the indemnitee had been negligent, and was predicated on that fact. Thus the St. Louis Dressed Beef case does not relieve an indemnitee who settled when his negligence had not been established from proving his legal liability in an action to recover from the indemnitor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">. 122 F.2d 255, 257, cert. denied Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. v.
