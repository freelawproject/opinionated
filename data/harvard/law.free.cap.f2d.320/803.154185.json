See note 1 supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">. If defense counsel had conducted such an investigation and found _ nothing to support appellant\u2019s story, we would not expect this to appear in the record. The same, however, cannot be said in refezence to St. Elizabeths Hospital or the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b849-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b849-24\">After a trial by jury, appellant was convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon and assault with intent to kill, and was sentenced to three to nine years imprisonment. His appeal centers about the trial court\u2019s instruction relating to his defense of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-25\">Appellant presents \u201cno objection * * to the basic statements of the court in its charge on sanity.\u201d He objects only to the \u201cright and wrong gloss\u201d the court introduced into the instructions when it illustrated its correct definition of product. The pertinent portion of the charge reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-26\">\u201cAs an example of this causal connection or relation, if a person at the time of the commission of a crime is so deranged mentally that he cannot distinguish between right and wrong, or, being able to tell right from wrong, he is unable by virtue of his mental derangement to control his actions, then his act is the product of his mental derangement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-27\">In McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847, 851 (1962), we said \u201cthe jury should be told that a mental disease or defect includes any abnormal condition of the mind which substantially aifects mental or emotional processes and substantially impairs behavior controls.\u201d We said, too, that \u201cthe jury may be instructed, provided there is testimony on the point, that capacity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>or lack thereof, to distinguish right from wrong and ability to refrain from doing a wrong or unlawful act may be considered in determining whether there is a relationship between the mental disease and the act charged. It should be remembered, however, that these considerations are not to be regarded in themselves as independently controlling or alternative tests of mental responsibility in this Circuit. They are factors which a jury may take into account in deciding whether the act charged was a product of mental disease or mental defect.\u201d Id. at 851-852.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">It is true that the record here reveals no testimony directly bearing on appellant\u2019s ability to distinguish right from wrong. But we cannot say that, in the circumstances of this case and in the absence of objection to the instruction at trial, the court\u2019s charge was infected with plain error. See Rules 30 and 52(b), F.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Appellant also complains about the following instruction given by the trial court on the weight to be accorded expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-6\">\u201cOn the issue of insanity there was called in this case a psychiatrist, a person who, by profession, is known as an expert in his particular field, in other words, a doctor specializing in psychiatry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">\u201cA person who, by education, study, or experience, has become an expert in any art or science or profession, and who is called as a witness, may give his opinion as to any such matter in which he is versed, and which is material to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-8\">\u201cSuch witnesses are referred to as expert witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-9\">\u201cYou should consider the testimony of the expert and weigh the reasons, if any, given for his opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-10\">\u201cYou are not, however, bound by such opinion. You may give to his opinion such a weight as you deem it entitled to receive, and you may reject expert testimony if, in your judgment, the reasons for that opinion are unsound.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">The psychiatrist referred to was called by the Government and he relied, for the most part, on the opinions, reports and tests of others. Appellant says that under our decision in Jenkins v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 300, 307 F.2d 637 (1962), the jury must be cautioned that such reliance is a factor in weighing such testimony. But it was not requested and we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s failure to so inform the jury constitutes plain error in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other claims and find no error requiring reversal. The conviction must therefore be</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b850-15\">BAZELON, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A7K\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">I concur fully in the reasoning and conclusions of the court in regard to the claims raised by the parties. My reading of the record, however, reveals a situation which merits consideration although not brought to our attention by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">On August 25, 1961, about one month after appellant was indicted herein for cutting his estranged wife\u2019s throat, he filed a pro se motion for a mental examination. He alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-18\">\u201cFor the past several years I have been under medical care for epilepsy and a severe case of syphilis. No one knows whether I actually suffer from brain damage as a result of paresis, as I have never had the money to pay for such extensive tests * * *. I have no memory [of assaulting my wife with a butcher knife]; but I frequently \u201cblack out\u201d and have no memory of what I do. I love my wife and four children and cannot imagine attacking my wife * * *. The jail keeps me on sedatives and tranquilizers to reduce the epileptic attacks * *. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Could I please have a medical and mental examination [and get treatment at St. Elizabeths].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAyn\">On September 1, 1961, counsel for appellant filed a similar motion alleging that \u201cdefendant appears of faulty memory with distinctly impaired ability to concentrate and suffers from recurrent headaches * * * and chronic alcoholism * * *. That defendant complains of \u2018black out\u2019 periods of indeterminate length * * *. That a psychiatric evaluation of defendant by the Legal Psychiatric Service, associated with this Court, on or about July 14,1959, tends to confirm the above while also reporting subnormal intelligence.\u201d On the same day the trial court ordered defendant committed to St. Elizabeths for a mental examination pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301. The superintendent of St. Eliza-beths reported to the court on November 29, 1961 that defendant \u201cis mentally competent to understand the nature of the proceedings against him and consult properly with counsel in his own defense,\u201d and that \u201cno evidence of mental disease existing at the present time nor on or about\u201d the date of the alleged crime was found.</p>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">At trial defendant testified in his own behalf. His testimony included the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVr6\">\u201cQ. Prior to that time, Mr. Simpson, to your knowledge, did you ever blackout?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aal-dedup-0\">\u201cA. I have quite a few times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arm-dedup-0\">\u201cQ. How often would you blackout?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agp-dedup-1\">\u201cA. Well, see, that is kind of hard to tell. It depends on the conditions and the pressure. In the summer time sometimes I could fall out quite often and in the winter, depending on how I have been taking care in the winter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acw-dedup-0\">\u201cQ. How do you know you blacked out, Mr. Simpson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ax_-dedup-0\">\u201cA. Sometime I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqAt\">*\u00bb***#\u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1d\">\u201cQ. And did there come a time when you were arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQbh\">\u201cA. Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At_\">\u201cQ. And how long after this were you arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHHF\">\u201cA. It was two months later, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acy0\">\u201cQ. And at that time did you tell the police everything you knew about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVF7\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember telling them too much about it because I had a terrible attack of this at the time of my arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aho\">\u201cQ. What, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7lQ\">\u201cA. I had a \u2014 I fell out at the time. I don\u2019t remember telling them too much. I don\u2019t really know what he asked me at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ark-dedup-0\">\u201cQ. You stated that you have blackout spells. Do you know how long you have had those ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM7a\">\u201cA. Well, from, I think \u201954 or \u201955. I was working at Lake Bar-croft, Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2r\">\u201cQ. No. At the time this all happened on April 12 of last year, were you employed, sir? Were you working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIOs\">\u201cA. Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXC-\">\u201cQ. Where were you working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adn-dedup-1\">\u201cA.

I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ade-dedup-1\">\u201cQ. And when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjDp\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know the exact time. I had a couple of accidents right behind each other because of these same procedures. I had one of those spells and ran into the back of a man\u2019s car and that was a couple of years ago. I don\u2019t know the exact date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqn-dedup-0\">\u201cQ. How many accidents have you had since 1954 or 1955?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"atz-dedup-0\">\u201cA. Oh, I don\u2019t know. Just two I know of, two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>\u201cQ. In any of them were you seriously injured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-4\">\u201cA. No, I don\u2019t drive that fast because I understand that I have them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">\u201cThe Court: Do you still have your permit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">\u201cThe Witness : No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-9\">\u201cThe Court [Out of the hearing of the jury]: Do you want to say anything about the permit being revoked ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">\u201cMr. Kay [Defense Counsel]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-11\">\u201cThe Court: I won\u2019t go into it then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-14\">\u201cQ. Why didn\u2019t you come back to Washington where you job was and your family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-16\">\u201cA. I was sick. At the time I got to New York I was sick. I had to go to the doctor immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-17\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-18\">\u201cA. They were treating me for the symptoms and these spells and heart trouble at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-19\">\u201cQ. What was the name of the doctor ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-33\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know the exact name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-34\">\u201cQ. What hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-35\">\u201cA. It wasn\u2019t a hospital. It was a private doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-36\">\u201cQ. What was the address ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-37\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know the \u2014 it was Red Banks, New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-38\">\u201cQ. Had you ever gone to a doctor down here for these spells?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-39\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-40\">\u201cQ. What doctor did you go to down here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-41\">\u201cA. Casualty Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-42\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-43\">\u201cQ. Do you know of any piece of written document anywhere that would attest to the fact that you maintained that you had these blackout spells over the past four or five years ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-G\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayv-dedup-0\">\u201cQ. Where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7_\">\u201cA. At the time I was arrested in two places, in Virginia and in the District and I suffered with these spells and a number of people had seen me actually have these spells and at the time I didn\u2019t even know I had them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-23\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-24\">\u201cA. * * * These spells come from overheated, over strained. My type of work is awful hard work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-26\">\u201cQ. Were you over heated the morning you cut your wife\u2019s throat ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-27\">\u201cA. I couldn\u2019t say at that time because I was carrying an awful strain for my children. You see your little children crying for you and locked in the house some place and you can\u2019t do nothing for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-28\">\u201cQ. Did you see them crying for you that particular morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-29\">\u201cA. I certainly did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-30\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-31\">\u201cQ. Did you collapse on the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-32\">\u201cA. A lot of times that I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-44\">\u201cThe Court: The question was, did you collapse at this time, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-45\">\u201cThe Witness : I did later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-46\">\u201cBy Mr. Murphy :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-47\">\u201cQ. Did you fall unconscious on the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-48\">\u201cA. I did at the lunch room. I fell completely out at the lunch room. I fell on the truck there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-49\">\u201cQ. This was before you came back to find out that the police were going to shoot you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-50\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right, before I come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-51\">\u201cQ. Did you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-52\">\u201cA. Someone thought that I was dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>\u201cQ. Who thought you were dead? Name some of the persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">\u201cA. Well, I don\u2019t actually know all of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">\u201cQ. Just tell us some of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201cA. Well, there was Ella B. I don\u2019t know the last names. He works for Terrell Construction Company. I don\u2019t know the last names because I really don\u2019t have no reason to ask them their last names.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The Government introduced testimony by Dr. Morris N. Platkin, Supervising Psychiatrist of the Maximum Security Division of St. Elizabeths Hospital. He testified that he had seen defendant at a medical staff conference and that it was the consensus of this conference that he was \u201cwithout mental disorder.\u201d On cross examination he indicated that a variety of tests had been conducted to determine whether defendant was suffering from \u201cepilepsy equivalent\u201d and that they did not indicate that he was.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He explained epilepsy equivalent in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-9\">\u201cIn certain types of patients instead of having the conventional epilepsy seizure which most people have heard about, people falling down and losing control of their bowels and bladder, in certain types of individuals they have periods when they become extremely disturbed. They don\u2019t fall down but they become extremely disturbed, very aggressive, very violent and perhaps destructive. This might last for five minutes and it might last for ten minutes or fifteen minutes. They come on rather abruptly and maybe over a period of a minute and they disappear in pretty much the same way and the patient is completely unaware of such an episode, completely unaware of what happened in that period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">When asked what methods are used by psychiatrists to determine epileptic equivalent, the doctor replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-13\">\u201cOne of the most important, of course, is the history. Almost invariably when an individual presents himself with this kind of problem he has a history of such episodes in the past and the history, of course, has to be confirmed by relatives, neighbors, friends, doctors who have examined him or other agencies or institutions or other witnesses of such episodes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">He proceeded to state that, although an electroencephalogram may sometimes be useful in detecting this disease, \u201cit is possible that it might not reflect it\u201d especially if its source was \u201cdeep seated in the brain or if it was between seizures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">The doctor was then asked whether epileptic equivalent was difficult to diagnose. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-16\">\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so. If they are well documented and if there had been several episodes and the description is given and they are fairly accurate, there is confirmatory evidence, they are pretty reliable but in the absence of that, you either have to make an assumption that it might be such an episode or wait until further development and keep the individual under close observation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a9r-dedup-0\">Later in his testimony he reiterated this theme as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-17\">\u201cOne [episode], certainly would not be an adequate basis for making such a diagnosis because in a period of five or ten or fifteen minutes when a person becomes extremely disturbed and assaultive and destructive, could occur on the basis of anything. An individual could be drunk, he can be irritated, toxic and he can be angry about something and it could occur for numerous reasons but when there are series of such episodes and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>basis for them and other factors ruled out, when all of these are ruled out, then there is strong presumptive evidence that he is suffering from an epileptic equivalent. One can never be absolutely one hundred per cent certain unless there is a long recorded history, unless these occurred many times and reliable witnesses have seen them and perhaps you have confirmatory evidence * * * or a well recorded history * * *, and in the absence of anything like that, the best you can do is make a presumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">It is clear from these statements and similar ones throughout the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony that no trustworthy conclusion regarding the presence or absence of \u201cepileptic equivalent\u201d could be reached, in the context of this case, without a thorough-going investigation to determine whether defendant had, as he claimed, a history of blackouts with loss of memory. There is nothing in the record, however, indicating whether any such investigation was ever conducted on behalf of this indigent defendant of \u201cborderline intelligence,\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>either by court-appointed counsel, by St. Elizabeths Hospital, or by the Government.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not know, for example, whether the 1959 report of the Legal Psychiatric Services, which purportedly confirmed defendant\u2019s claims, was ever examined; whether there was a search for accident or permit revocation reports to confirm defendant\u2019s claim that he had blacked out while driving and had run into a number of cars; whether the records of the construction company in Lake Barcroft, Virginia, contains any reference to blackouts; whether the records of Casualty Hospital contain any reference to blackouts; whether there are arrest records in Virginia or the District which contain references, as defendant claims they do, to the fact that a number of people had seen him have these spells; or whether any effort was made to locate Ella B., who allegedly works for the Terrell Construction Company and witnessed a spell on the day of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Since the interests of justice plainly required some such investigation, and since the record provides no adequate assurance that one was conducted,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I cannot vote to affirm the conviction. I would remand the case for a determination whether there was an investigation. If there was not, one should be ordered. And if such an investigation discloses evidence of a history of blackouts, a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\">. The tests revealed, <em>inter alia, </em>borderline intelligence, \u201csome evidence of emotional inability [sic] and some very, very questionable evidence that there might be some organic brain changes.\u201d The diagnosis therefore \u201cwas not that there was no epileptic equivalent\u201d but rather \u201cthat it was within normal limits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b854-11\">.
