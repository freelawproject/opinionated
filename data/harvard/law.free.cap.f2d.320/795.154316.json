In re Eleven Ten Broadcasting Corp., 32 F.C.C. 706, 22 R.R. 699. By orders of July 24, 1962, the Commission denied the licensee\u2019s petition for reconsideration, as well as petitions for reconsideration and rehearing filed by two Southern California churches pursuant to \u00a7 405 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 75 Stat. 421 (1961), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 (Supp. IV, 1963). 33 F.C.C. 92, 22 R.R. 702n. Eleven Ten and the churches appeal under \u00a7 402(b) of the Act, 66 Stat. 718 (1952), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-25\">The events leading to denial of KRLA\u2019s renewal application may be summarized as follows: On October 22, 1958, Eleven Ten applied for Commission consent to the assignment to it of the broadcast license and construction permit (for increased power) of Station KXLA (later changed to KRLA), Pasadena, California. On the strength of various representations as to programming and other mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>ters, the Commission approved the assignment, and Eleven Ten assumed control. Thereafter KRLA filed an application for renewal of license, as prescribed by 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.34. On July 5, 1960, the Commission, finding that \u201cno questions exist as to the qualifications of the applicant\u201d except as to four factual issues,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> designated KRLA\u2019s application for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Pursuant to the designation order, evidence was received on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-5\">1. [W]hether, in light of its operations since it acquired Station KRLA, the licensee\u2019s program proposals contained in its application for Commission consent to assignment of the license of Station KRLA were made in good faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-6\">2. [W]hether, in light of the manner in which the \u201cFind Perry Allen\u201d contest was conducted by Station KRLA in and about September, 1959, the licensee operated said station for improper purposes contrary to the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-7\">3. [W]hether the station\u2019s program logs for the week of October 18-24, 1959, were altered with the intent and purpose of deceiving the Commission; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">4. [W]hether, since the date of assignment of license of Station KRLA * * * to the licensee, Jack K. Cooke, a Canadian citizen, has exercised control with respect to the operations of said station contrary to the provisions of Section 310 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the Commission\u2019s rules and policies promulgated thereunder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">The examiners found that KRLA\u2019s proposals were made in good faith, that conduct of the \u201cFind Perry Allen\u201d contest (and a similar \u201cGolden Key\u201d contest) resulted in the use of licensed facilities for improper purposes contrary to the public interest, and that the station\u2019s program logs were altered by KRLA\u2019s general manager in order to deceive the Commission. The examiners recommended a short-term renewal of KRLA\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">The Commission, reweighing the evidence, found that KRLA\u2019s program proposals had not been made in good faith and that alteration of the station\u2019s program logs should be imputed to Donald Cooke, the owner of KRLA. The Commission refused to consider alleged \u201cmeritorious programming efforts by KRLA <em>after </em>the Commission had made it clear to the licensee that renewal of its license was in doubt\u201d as being an unreliable measure of Eleven Ten as a licensee. 33 F.C.C. at -, 22 R.R. at 702t.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\"> KRLA contends that the Commission relied on matters \u201coutside the specific issues under which the hearing was held,\u201d thereby depriving it of a fair and full hearing as required by statute and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. We read the Commission\u2019s decision as founded on the \u201cconclusions that Donald Cooke is guilty of efforts to mislead the Commission\u201d and that his willingness to deceive the Commission warrants denial of KRLA\u2019s renewal application. The facts marshalled in support of the Commission\u2019s ultimate factual conclusion are fairly encompassed within the first and third issues and constitute substantial evidence of record in support of that conclusion. The Commission\u2019s disqualification of Eleven Ten is within the discretion committed by Congress to the Commission. Federal Communications Comm. v. WOKO, Inc., 329 U.S. 223, 227-229, 67 S.Ct. 213, 91 L.Ed. 204 (1946) ; Hall v. Federal Communications Comm. 99 U.S.App.D.C. 86, 94-96, 237 F.2d 567, 575-577 (1956); Charles P. B. Pinson, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, 116 U.S.App.D.C. -, 321 F.2d 372 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Appellants <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contend that the Commission erred in failing to make findings as to KRLA\u2019s public service programming and to consider the public service rendered by KRLA in determining whether or not KRLA\u2019s license should be renewed. The Commission need not consider the public service rendered by a station where the licensee is disqualified by its attempts to deceive the Commission. Federal Communications Comm. v. WOKO, Inc., supra; Independent Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Comm., 89 U.S.App.D.C. 396, 193 F.2d 900 (1951), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 837, 73 S.Ct. 14, 97 L.Ed. 652 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The decision of the Commission will be</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\">. A fifth issue merely directed the examiner \u201cto determine, in light of the evidence adduced pursuant to the foregoing issues, whether a grant of the above-entitled applications would serve the public interest, convenience or necessity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-21\">. The alien control issue was resolved in favor of KRLA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b843-15\">. Since the two appeals have been consolidated and since the churches\u2019 appeal presents no additional issues for our decision, we do not think it necessary to decide whether or not the churches have standing by reason of KRI/A\u2019s broadcasting their Sunday services without charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
