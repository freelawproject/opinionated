All of these shipments were transported between points solely within the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">All of these were transported on government bills of lading. This form of bill of lading contained, among other things, a section for the description of the articles transported. The printed instructions given on the bill of lading relative to such description were \u201cUse carriers\u2019 classification for tariff description if possible, otherwise a clear nontechnical description.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">During the period in question, appellee had filed rates with appellant as a party to the T. A. L. Loretz U. S. Government Rate Quotation No. 1 (Loretz Quotation). This quotation is limited to shipments for the United States Government and is prepared in the form of a motor carrier tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The Loretz Quotation incorporates by reference within its provisions \u201cWestern Classification No. 75.\u201d This document constitutes a compilation of most known commodities and the classification (i. e., First Class, Second Class, etc.) into which each commodity has been placed. The Western Classification No. 75 is published as a part of the Consolidated Freight Classification No. 20. The Western Classification also sets forth various rules concerning tariff applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Appellant cites as error that portion of the district court\u2019s Finding II applicable to Items 5, 6, 7, 8a, 9 and 10; also, that portion of Finding III applicable to Items 11 and 11a; and, all of Conclusion of Law IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">Findings II and III state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-15\">\u201cII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-16\">\u201cWith reference to Items 4, 4a, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8a, 9 and 10, as listed in Column A of the attached Appendix, the rate charged in the Bill of Lading was agreed on by the United States through its Transportation Officer acting in the course and within the scope of his official duty and authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-18\">\u201cIII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-19\">\u201cWith reference to Items 11, 11a and 17, as listed in the attached Appendix, the Bill of Lading on its face demonstrated a request for exclusive use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-20\">Conclusion of Law IY states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-21\">\u201cWhere intra-state freight is transported by a non-certificated carrier, which does not have a published tariff, a price posted on the Bill of Lading by the United States is a valid offer which if accepted becomes contractually binding on the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-22\">The shipments in question fall into three different categories, which are herein described as Groups I, II and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-23\">GROUP I FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b239-24\">The first group, consisting of five shipments (Items 5, 6, 7, 9, 10), involves alleged overcharges resulting from an alleged misdescription of the commodity transported. These shipments all involved the same commodity, the same point of origin, Camp Irwin, California, and the same point of destination, Her-long, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Appellee argues that the commodity transported consisted of pieces of brass that had been compressed together into rectangular bales and which were being sent to Herlong to be remelted. Appellant maintains that the brass articles that were compressed together into bales were expended cartridge cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The description placed by appellant\u2019s agents on the bills of lading covering these shipments is the same in each instance. It reads: \u201cSCRAP NOIBN [not otherwise indexed by name], HAYING USE FOR RESMELTING, NMFC #11 [National Motor Freight Classification No. 11] ITEM #13850.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The appropriate item in the Western Classification (which is the applicable classification, since it is the one incorporated into the Loretz Quotation) is Item No. 6435 and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">\u201c6435 Scrap, noibn (scraps or waste pieces or bent, broken, crushed or worn out articles or used wire, having value for remelting purposes only), loose (LCL only if weighing each 50 lbs. or over) or in packages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The scrap brass item in both the Western Classification and the National Motor Freight Classification was classified as fifth class; the applicable fifth class rate from Camp Irwin to Herlong during this period of time as set forth in the Loretz Quotation was ninety-seven cents per hundred weight. This is the rate that appellee assessed. There is no controversy that if the article was properly described on the bill of lading as scrap brass the ninety-seven cent rate is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">During this period of time there was set forth in the Loretz Quotation a commodity rate of seventy cents per hundred weight from Camp Irwin to Herlong on the commodity \u201ccartridge cases, empty, returned.\u201d Appellant maintains that the commodity transported should have been described as \u201ccartridge cases, empty, returned\u201d and rated at the seventy cent rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The district court held that appellee had correctly described this group of shipments, and that the charges made therefor were proper, as indicated in Finding II and Conclusion IV set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">GROUP II FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The second group of shipments (Items 8 and 8a) consist of shipments of explosives (i. e., detonating fuses) with other commodities. The weights of the individual components of these shipments are shown on the respective bills of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">There was set forth in typewritten form on the bills of lading, in that portion allotted to commodity description, not only the description of the commodities transported, but also the statement: \u201cRate $ .68 cwt. minimum weight 20,000 lbs. truckload.\u201d The bills of lading also contained the statement: \u201cWaiver to move by truck granted in accordance with ICC Reg. OP-5 Change 11.\u201d These bills of lading were prepared and signed by appellant\u2019s agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">Appellee charged for each entire shipment at the higher rate applicable to one of the articles, i. e., $ .68 cwt. Appellant contends that the charge should have been made in accordance with the rate applicable to each portion of the shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">The district court held for appellee on this group of shipments, as also indicated in Finding II and Conclusion IV set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">GROUP III FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">The third group of shipments, consisting of two shipments (Items 11 and 11a), are in issue because on these shipments certain specified units of equipment were ordered by appellant and furnished to it by the appellee. In one shipment some five units of equipment were ordered and furnished, and in the other three units of equipment were ordered and furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">On the bill of lading of one shipment, typed in with the commodity description, was the following statement: \u201cFurnished: * * * 5 Trucks 71,450# Cube 4562\u201d, and, typed in with the commodity description on the bill of lading of the other shipment was the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201cFURNISHED 1 SET 20 FOOT DOUBLES CU. CAP. 2 35' SEMI CU. CAP. /2798' 19,920 LBS. 700' 2449' 14,940 LBS 19 \u2014 49,800 529' (EACH).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Appellee contended that these notations were sufficient to constitute an order by the appellant for exclusive use of the equipment furnished and that the equipment was chargeable on the basis of certain minimum rates. Appellant contends that the bills of lading were not properly annotated to evidence exclusive use by the appellant and that appellee was precluded from applying fixed minimum rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The district court, as indicated in Finding III, found that the bills of lading on their face \u201cdemonstrated a request for exclusive use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The major issues on this appeal relate to these three differing categories of shipments; but before these may be dealt with, two preliminary issues must be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The first is whether or not appellant could bring an action for restitution under Section 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940. Appellee contends that since this section is \u201climited to carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act * * * \u201d and since the \u201cnine shipments which are involved in this appeal are all intrastate shipments having been transported between points solely within the State of California * * * \u201d, appellee, \u201cin performing such transportation, was not subject to the Interstate Commerce Act,\u201d and was not, therefore, subject to Section 322, Section 322 being \u201climited to interstate shipments.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief, p. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Section 322 of the Transportation Act -of 1940, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 66, states, in part: \u201cPayment for transportation of the United States mail and of persons or property for or on behalf of the United States by any <em>common </em>carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The important phrase in Section 322 is \u201csubject to the Interstate Commerce Act.\u201d The Loretz Quotation was filed with the United States pursuant to the authority of Section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 22. Appellee, on page three of its brief, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">\u201cLikewise during the period in question appellee had filed rates with appellant as a party to the T. A. L. Loretz U. S. Government Rate Quotation No. 1 (Loretz Quotation). This quotation is limited to shipments for the United States Government and is prepared in the form of a motor carrier tariff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">By becoming a party to the Loretz Quotation, appellee must be considered to be within the meaning of the Section 322 phrase \u201ccommon carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act.\u201d Appellee, having voluntarily become bound as a carrier \u201csubject to the Interstate Commerce Act,\u201d cannot now claim it is not so bound. We hold he has waived any claim he is excluded under Section 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">The second preliminary issue is whether appellee had the burden of proving in the district court the correctness of its charges, or appellant had the burden of establishing overcharges. In a case interpreting Section 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940, the United States Supreme Court held that the carrier, who was suing the United States Government to recover an amount deducted by the Government from a bill for transportation services rendered six years after the alleged overcharge by the carrier, was entitled to recover only if it satisfied its burden of proving that the earlier charges were computed at lawful and authorized rates. United States v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 355 U.S. 253, 78 S.Ct. 212, 2 L.Ed.2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">The only difference between the cited case and the instant case is that in the latter the United States Government is suing instead of the carrier. If the Government\u2019s statutory protection against overcharges is to continue undiminished, this difference cannot be held sufficient to shift the burden of proof. The Government, in instituting the action, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>be in no more favorable position than the carrier, when it sued the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">GROUP I: CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Appellant contends that a carrier\u2019s charge must be based on the rate applicable to the article actually shipped, and not to the article as described on the bill of lading; that the bill of lading description is not conclusive as to the true nature of the goods;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the true description of a shipment governs the rating;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that, therefore, the charge on Items 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 should have been that applicable to empty cartridge shells, \u201cthe article actually shipped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Rule 2 of the Consolidated Classification, applicable here by reason of Item 15 of the Loretz Quotation, states, in part: \u201c* * * When found to be incorrectly described, freight charges must be collected according to proper description.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">What was the article actually shipped? Appellee Jess E. Francis testified that he saw three to five of the shipments and that those that he saw contained compressed \u201cscrap brass\u201d in bales or bundles; but, that at that time he did not know whether it was cartridges that had been compressed. (Record, pp. 60, 61, 72, 73.) James L. Callan, an employee of the Transportation Division, General Accounting Office, testified that he was told by the \u201cman that shipped\u201d the items in question that it was \u201cshells.\u201d (Record, p. 112.) Mr. Callan, referring to the items in question, further stated that a truck carrying these items was \u201cgoing for resmelting as soon as it gets to its destination whether it is light or bulky.\u201d Also, he said: \u201c * * * This, in general, is scrap \u2014 you could call it that since there is no item in the classification \u2014 \u25a0 none for empty cartridge shells \u2014 used, expended \u2014 -there is nothing in the classification that covers everything. If you don\u2019t have something to cover it you put it in that item.\u201d (Record, pp. 113-114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The basic question is one of fact: were the items in question returned cartridge cases, or were they compacted cartridge cases?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">Based on the testimony set forth above, the finding by the district court that the items in question were compacted cartridge cases, which is implicit in Finding II when read in the light of the record, cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">When wornout metal articles are reduced to other than their original form for remelting purposes and shipped for remelting, they are properly described, classified and rated for transportation rate purposes as scrap metal, rather than being classified and rated as the original article itself. Scrap Tin Plate Between Minnesota and Illinois, 256 I.C.C. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">GROUP II: CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"age-dedup-0\">Appellant contends that the district court erred in allowing charges on Items 8 and 8a to be figured on the application to the entire shipment of the rate applicable to the higher-rated article.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">Item 90 of the Loretz Quotation provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-16\">\u201c * * * when two or more commodities are included in the same shipment and separate weights thereof are furnished or obtained, charges will be computed at the separate rates in this Quotation applicable to such commodities in straight shipments of the combined weight of the mixed shipment * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">Appellant supports this contention with the proposition that the carrier\u2019s tariff along with the bill of lading make up the contract of carriage, and that the-parties cannot agree in the bill of lading or elsewhere to a departure from the tariff. Appellant refers to cases such as Davis V. Henderson, 266 U.S. 92, 45 S.Ct. 24, 69 L.Ed. 182. In that case, the Court held that a tariff rule, approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission (providing that orders for cars given the carrier\u2019s local agent must be in writing) cannot be waived by the carrier through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the agent\u2019s acceptance of oral notice from the shipper. The Davis case involved a private shipper; it did not involve a situation where the shipper was the United States Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Appellee maintains that appellee and appellant can lawfully contract for the transportation of explosives with other articles at rates other than those set forth in appellee\u2019s government rate quotation, and that there is substantial evidence in the instant case to support the district court\u2019s finding that appellant and appellee agreed upon the rates set forth in the bills of lading for such shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In Public Utilities Commission of California v. United States, 355 U.S. 534, 78 S.Ct. 446, 2 L.Ed.2d 470, the Court considered a statute enacted by the State of California which would have made contingent upon the Commission\u2019s prior approval continuation of the Federal Government\u2019s practice of negotiating with common carriers special rates for the shipment of government property within the state. The United States had sued in a federal court for a declaratory judgment declaring the state statute unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited carriers from transporting government property at rates other than those approved by the Commission. The Court held that when Congress authorizes its procurement agents to negotiate rates, a state may not require that those rates be approved by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The Supreme Court pointed to certain government regulations and indicated that these sanction the policy of \u201cnegotiating rates for shipment of federal property and entrust the procurement officers with the discretion to determine when existing rates will be accepted and when negotiation for lower rates will be undertaken.\u201d Id. at 542-543, 78 S.Ct. at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Section 22(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 22(1), exempts transportation for the United States from the rate provisions of that Act; it states, in part: \u201cNothing in this chapter shall prevent the carriage * * * of property free or at reduced rates for the United States * *</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Section 22(2) of this Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 22(2), states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">\u201cAll quotations or tenders of rates, fares or charges under paragraph (1) of this section for the transportation, storage, or handling of property or the transportation of persons free or at reduced rates for the United States Government, or any agency or department thereof, including quotations or tenders for retroactive application whether negotiated or renegotiated after the services have been performed, shall be in writing or confirmed in writing and a copy or copies thereof shall be submitted to the Commission by the carrier or carriers offering such tenders or quotations in the manner specified by the Commission * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">In the instant case, appellee charged for each entire shipment at the higher rate applicable to one of the articles, i. e., $ .68 cwt. No tender or quotation of rates was specifically submitted for Items 8 and 8a under the provisions of Section 22(2). Appellee points to no other statute or regulation under which the facts might disclose a negotiation for the applicable rate had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">Appellee\u2019s evidence to support its contention that a new and different contract with the government was entered into is the fact that the bill of lading had two statements on it in addition to the description of the commodities transported: \u201cRate $ .68 cwt. minimum weight 20,000 lbs. truckload,\u201d and, \u201cWaiver to move by truck granted in accordance with ICC Reg. OP-5 Change 11.\u201d Ap-pellee suggests that this latter statement indicated that the government originally contemplated sending the shipment by rail, that the mixed shipment rule of the railroads provides that where there is a mixed shipment the highest commodity rate prevails, and, that \u201cUndoubtedly this was the reason that the government offered to pay on the basis of the rate of the highest rated commodity contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>therein, with respect to these two shipments.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief, p. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"Acp\">Finding II states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201cWith reference to Items * * * 8, 8a * * *, the rate charged in the Bill of Lading was agreed on by the United States through its Transportation Officer acting in the course and within the scope of his official duty and authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Was the rate really \u201cagreed on\u201d here? There is little testimony in the record relating to Items 8 and 8a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Based on this sparse testimony, it cannot be said that any rate was \u201cagreed on.\u201d We hold that portion of Finding II that refers to Items 8 and 8a is, therefore, clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Also, because of this, Conclusion of Law IV must be held to be error. Even were we to assume this Conclusion had support, it would still raise questions of considerable importance. The result of concluding that \u201ca price posted on the Bill of Lading by the United States is a valid offer which if accepted becomes contractually binding on the United States\u201d would be that once the Government posts a price on a bill of lading, the carrier having subsequently performed and alleging thereafter that it had accepted the government\u2019s offer, the government could not successfully prevail against the carrier for overcharges except under. one of the defenses to the contract. In determining whether or not agreement on rates had been reached, the notation posted on the bill of lading should only be considered evidence on the question of whether or not there was an offer and an acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">We note that both Public Utilities Commission of California v. United States, supra, and Section 22(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act concern negotiation of rates that are <em>lower </em>than existing rates as found in rate quotations. Here, appellee, by the proposition it is attempting to promote, attempts to have this court sanction its receipt of rates <em>higher </em>than existing rates for motor carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">GROUP III: CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">Finally, with reference to Items 11 and 11a, appellant contends that the district court erred in holding that a notation on a bill of lading of the equipment ordered and furnished is an appropriate annotation of a request for exclusive use of the equipment furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">Item 135 of the Loretz Quotation provided that the shipper could request ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>elusive use of the carrier\u2019s equipment, but, if it did so, the shipper was subject to a minimum charge for the equipment based upon its size. Item 135 further provided that \u201cBills of lading shall be appropriately annotated to evidence exclusive use of carrier\u2019s equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJL\">James L. Callan, the government employee referred to above, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">\u201cThe term \u2018exclusive use\u2019 is a very well defined word of art in transportation, in motor carriers, and I have never seen a shipment \u2014 carriers don\u2019t even claim it, they don\u2019t describe the word \u2018exclusive use request\u2019 on it. The fact they were furnished, that does not say they were requested. They have on there the rate \u2014 83%^\u2014they would have put it there, \u2018exclusive use of vehicle requested,\u2019 there is where they would have put it. It is just like a rail shipment \u2014 they put down the size car furnished and the number of the car. That does mean it is exclusive use of the car.\u201d (Record, pp. 123-124.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">A tariff publishing agent for motor carriers called by appellee, John L. Beeler, referring to Item 11, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cDown in the body, or under the description. It does not state it exactly that way, but it does state that the Government does want furnished one set of 20-foot doubles, which is forty feet; two 35-foot Semis\u2014 cubic feet so and so; that the carrier then did furnish this equipment. Now, whether or not that constitutes a request [for exclusive use] within the meaning of the annotation, I am not prepared to say, but it seems to, to me * * * I have seen a good many bills of lading and they are annotated in different ways. This is the ease of an unusual one. * * * \u201d (Record, pp. 87-88.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Based on this testimony, while some questions exist, it cannot be said that the finding of the district court with reference to Items 11 and 11a, that the bill of lading on its face demonstrated a request for exclusive use; is clearly erroneous. '</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Based on the above considerations, we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to Items 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 11a, and reverse with respect to Items 8 and 8a, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\">.

Well, I had a note to the effect \u2014 \u25a0 Yes, that is true, your Honor, but there is also a further point. Apparently the shipment was originally to go by rail but there is a waiver on the bill of lading to show that they granted a waiver to move it by truck. In other words, the Government changed the routing and wanted it to go by truck. That is in item \u20188\u2019 \u2014 it is on the bill of lading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-21\">\u201cQ. The rate specified on the face of the bill of lading is 680 per hundred weight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-22\">\u201cA. Yes, because it was waived from rail to truck movement \u2014 apparently they understood it. That is my point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-23\">\u201cQ. The evidence so far is that the Government prepared this bill of lading and put on 680, minimum weight 20,000 pounds. I assume you are bound by it unless the officer acting acted unlawfully in doing it.\u201d (Record, p. 86.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-24\">And, James L. Callan, Transportation Division, General Accounting Office, testified that he felt that there was \u201cdefinitely\u201d an overpayment by the Government on Items 8 and 8a.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
