But we note that the trial judge erred in developing the fact \u2014 with the prosecution commendably not encouraging him to do so \u2014 that defendant at the time of his apprehension was found to have in his possession an automobile driver\u2019s license bearing a name other than his own. Were the trial before a jury, or were the evidence of guilt less strong, we would feel obliged to reverse, since the driver\u2019s license had nothing to do with the case on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-25\">. Defendant, now the appellant, was a juvenile. The Juvenile Court had waived jurisdiction to the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
