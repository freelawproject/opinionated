Appellants allege as error aiso the district court\u2019s granting of a 60 day- extension to defendant within which to plead or answer and the overruling of her motion for production of documents, Appellees contend that the district court was correct in dismissing the complaint for iack of jurisdiction and that in any event, the suit must fail because of appellants\u2019 failure to join an indispensable Party&gt; namely&gt;the Veterans\u2019 Administra^\u00b01-</p>\n<p id=\"AP6\"> The threshold question is whether the court has jurisdiction to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>view the decisions of the Veterans\u2019 Administrator. \u201cIt is * * * well settled * * * that the Federal District Courts have only such jurisdiction as the Congress may give them.\u201d Commers v. United States, 66 F.Supp. 943 (D.C.Mont. 1946), citing Lockerty v. Phillips, 319 U.S. 182, 63 S.Ct. 1019, 87 L.Ed. 1339 (1942). Congress may create rights in individuals against itself and establish special tribunals aside from the courts, to administer and enforce the rights created. As the Supreme Court said in United States v. Babcock, 250 U.S. 328, 331, 39 S.Ct. 464, 63 L.Ed. 1011, 1012 (1918), \u201c[T]he United States, when it* creates rights in individuals against itself, is under no obligation to provide a remedy through the courts.\u201d It may limit the individual to administrative remedies. Tutun v. United States, 270 U.S. 568, 576, 46 S.Ct. 425, 465, 70 L.Ed. 738, 741 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Appellants contend that jurisdiction is founded upon 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009 which grants judicial review of administrative actions generally \u201c[e]xcept so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review * * Title 38 U.S.C.A., under which appellants claim benefits, at \u00a7 211 (a) provides that \u201cthe decisions of the [Veterans\u2019] Administrator on any question of law or fact concerning a claim for benefits or payments under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Appellants contend that the Administrator is bound to follow the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, (Act of June 11, 1946, 60 Stat. 238, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq.) and, apparently, that despite the fact that the \u201cdecisions\u201d may not be reviewed, the conformity, or lack thereof, to the Administrative Procedure Act may be examined by the court. Is the Veterans\u2019 Administrator, in making his decisions, bound to conform to the provisions of the said Act? We think not. Section 5 of the Act (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1004), captioned \u201cAdjudication\u201d provides that \u201cIn every ease of adjudications <em>required by statute to be determined on-the record after opportunity for un-agency hearing, except </em>* * \u25a0 (Exception not here material) (Emphasis' added) the agency shall afford the parties an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with Section 7 (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1006) which provides, in part, that \u201c[e] very party shall have the right * * to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. * * * \u201d Section 5 thus clearly limits its applicability to adjudications \u201crequired by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d This is not such a case, because title 38 U.S.C.A. under which appellants proceed makes no such requirement. On the contrary, \u00a7 210(c) of that title provides that \u201cThe Administrator has authority to make all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration and are consistent therewith, including regulations with respect to the nature and extent of proofs and evidence and the method of taking and furnishing them in order to establish the right to benefits under such laws, the forms of application by claimants under such laws, the methods of making investigations and medical examinations, and the manner and form of adjudications and awards\u201d and section 102(a) (1) provides' that \u201cDependency of a parent * * * shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Administrator\u201d thus leaving to the Veterans\u2019 Administrator discretion in selecting the procedure to be followed in reaching his decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\"> This court in Ford v. United States, 230 F.2d 533 (5 Cir. 1956), and Acker v. United States, 226 F.2d 575 (5 Cir. 1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 1008, 76 S.Ct. 674, 100 L.Ed. 870 (1955), held that a decision by the Administrator was not reviewable by the courts. In Ford, 230 F.2d at pages 533 and 534 the court said \u201cThe assertion, now made on the appeal, that it was likewise an effort to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>view the correctness of the Administrator\u2019s action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq., fares no better since Section 10, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009, specifically excepts administrative actions when the \u2018(1) statutes preclude judicial review * * *.\u2019 While the Congressional intention to preclude judicial review of administrative action must be clearly and positively reflected, Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 73 S.Ct. 603, 97 L.Ed. 972, cf. Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591, 99 L.Ed. 868, and Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 75 S.Ct. 757, 99 L.Ed. 1107, that standard is met here both by the intrinsic nature of this as an act of pure gratuity from the sovereign\u2019s grace, Acker v. United States, supra, and the categorical declaration that, except for certain specified matters for which a judicial remedy is created, the Administrator\u2019s decision on all questions of law or fact concerning a claim for benefits or payments under any act administered by the Veterans Administration shall be final, conclusive and beyond the power of any court to review. 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11 a-2, Brasier v. United States, 8 Cir., 223 F.2d 762, and see Federal Power Commission v. Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 348 U.S. 492, 499, 500, 75 S.Ct. 467, 99 L.Ed. 583, 592.\u201d While Ford was dealing specifically with 38 U.S.C.A. (1952 ed.) 11a-2, precursor to the present section (38 U.S.C.A. 1958 ed. \u00a7 211(a)), the finality provisions of the two sections are the same in meaning. To the same effect are the following cases: Sinlao v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 271 F.2d 846 (1959); Cook v. Higley, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 180, 238 F.2d 41 (1956); Magnus v. United States, 234 F.2d 673 (7th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 1006, 77 S.Ct. 569, 1 L.Ed.2d 551 (1957); Longernecker v. Higley, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 144, 229 F.2d 27 (1955); Di Silvestro v. United States Veterans\u2019 Administration, 228 F.2d 516 (2nd. Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 1009, 76 S.Ct. 654, 100 L.Ed. 870 (1955); Cyrus v. United States, 226 F.2d 416 (1st Cir. 1955); Brasier v. United States, 223 F.2d 762 (8th Cir. 1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 913, 76 S.Ct. 196, 100 L.Ed. 800 (1955); United States v. Houston, 216 F.2d 440 (6th Cir. 1954); Hahn v. Gray, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 188, 203 F.2d 625 (1953); United States ex rel. Farmer v. Thompson, 203 F.2d 947 (4th Cir. 1953), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 973, 77 S.Ct. 366, 1 L.Ed.2d 326 (1957); Commers v. United States, 159 F.2d 248 (9th Cir. 1947), cert. denied, 331 U.S. 807, 67 S.Ct. 1189, 91 L.Ed. 1828 (1946); Van Horne v. Hines, 74 App.D.C. 214, 122 F.2d 207 (1941); Peyton v. United States, 100 F.Supp. 823, 120 Ct.Cl. 722 (1951), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 909, 72 S.Ct. 639, 96 L.Ed. 1326 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In Acker, supra, 226 F.2d page 578, this court said \u201cit [must be] borne in mind that, as so well and clearly pointed out in Lynch v. United States, 292 U.S. 571, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L.Ed. 1434, the United States may not be sued without its consent and that such consent must be expressed and not implied * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In Hahn v. Gray, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 188, 203 F.2d 625, 626 (1953) the court said \u201cIt was the purpose of that statute (38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 lla-2) to remove the possibility of judicial relief even if the action of the Administrator was arbitrary and capricious. Lynch v. United States, 1934, 292 U.S. 571, 587, 54 S.Ct. 840, 847, 78 L.Ed. 1434.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In Van Horne v. Hines, 74 App.D.C. 214, 122 F.2d 207 (1941), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 689, 62 S.Ct. 360, 86 L.Ed. 552 (1941), rehearing denied, 314 U.S. 717, 62 S.Ct. 478, 86 L.Ed. 570 (1942), plaintiff sought judicial review of the Veterans\u2019 Administrator\u2019s decision reached without prior notice <em>and </em>hearing, reaffirming its previous decision, likewise reached without prior notice and hearing, terminating plaintiff\u2019s veteran benefit compensation on the ground that the plaintiff had made false statements in connection therewith, even though, subsequent to the original decision but prior to the reaffirmance he had been tried and acquitted of the offense by a United States Court. The court there based its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>decision upon the ground that the predecessor of 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 211(a) deprived the court of jurisdiction. There, plaintiff was not even allowed to present evidence on behalf of his claim. Here, appellants at least were afforded and accepted the opportunity to present evidence to the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We hold that the district court committed no error in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and, this being true, we need not reach or decide the other questions raised on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The order of the district court dismissing the complaint is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"AVy\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
