The defendant also was charged in part B of the information with being a persistent dangerous felony offender under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53U-40.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appeal was originally brought to our Supreme Court and was transferred to this court. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to grant him a probable cause hearing with respect to the offenses charged pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments, and General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a (a). The defendant argues that because he was charged with various felony offenses and also with being a persistent dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>felony offender on the basis of prior sexual assault convictions in 1983 and 1973, he was exposed to a potential life sentence. The defendant contends that <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>176 Conn. 270, 407 A.2d 955 (1978), which the parties agree is controlling, was incorrectly decided by our Supreme Court. In <em>Lewis, </em>although the court determined that the state was required to obtain a grand jury indictment under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the defendant could not be sentenced as a persistent dangerous felony offender, the court ruled that that jurisdictional defect did not affect the conviction on the substantive offense and ordered the dismissal of the second part of the information. Id., 273. Here, the defendant argues that the state\u2019s failure to conduct a probable cause hearing deprived the court of jurisdiction over the substantive offenses. The defendant recognizes that we are bound by the decisions of our Supreme Court and are not in a position to \u201creconsider\u201d the decision in <em>Lewis. </em>See <em>Boretti </em>v. <em>Panacea Co., </em>67 Conn. App. 223, 231, 786 A.2d 1164 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 918, 791 A.2d 565 (2002).
