On appeal, the defendant claims that a new trial should be ordered because he was denied due process and a fair trial by a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct that pervaded the trial. In support of this claim, the defendant asserts that a mistrial should have been declared because the prosecutor improperly (1) disclosed prejudicial matters to the jury through his questioning of the defendant in violation of the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine and (2) introduced facts not in evidence during his closing argument to appeal to the passions of the jury. Although we agree with the defendant that some of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper, we conclude that the misconduct was not so prejudicial as to clearly deprive him of a fair trial. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In early 1997, the defendant sold two bulletproof vests, or the components thereof, to the victim, Glaister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Gopie. Subsequently, the victim attempted, on many occasions, to return one of the vests for a refund. On the evening of May 18, 1997, the victim and his cousin, Andrew Mitchell, drove to Circular Avenue in Waterbury and parked on the street near a friend\u2019s home. The victim, coincidentally, parked directly outside the home of the defendant\u2019s half-sister, Crystal Bolton. Sometime earlier that day, the defendant and his girlfriend had driven to Circular Avenue to visit Bolton. As the defendant left Bolton\u2019s home and as the victim approached his friend\u2019s home, the two men encountered each other. The victim then confronted the defendant about the desired refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">From that point, the confrontation escalated into a fistfight, in which the victim was the apparent victor. After the fight ended, the defendant retrieved a loaded .38 caliber revolver from his car. The defendant then shot at the victim twice. The victim ran, fell to the ground shortly thereafter and was found by police lying face down with a single gunshot wound in the middle of his lower back. The victim told an officer that the defendant had shot him. Subsequently, the police arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Following a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of two counts of assault in the first degree and one count of attempt to commit murder. As a result, he was sentenced to eighteen years for each count, to run concurrently, for a total effective sentence of eighteen years of incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be provided as relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Our standard of review concerning claims of prosecutorial misconduct is well settled. \u201c[T]o deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial . . . the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cIn determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial we must view the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial. ... In examining the prosecutor\u2019s argument we must distinguish between those comments whose effects may be removed by appropriate instructions . . . and those which are flagrant and therefore deny the accused a fair trial. . . . The defendant bears the burden of proving that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper in that they were prejudicial and deprived him of a fair trial. . . . In determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>67 Conn. App. 249, 266-67, 786 A.2d 1189 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 918, 791 A.2d 566 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">We also note that \u201c[p]rosecutorial misconduct can occur in the course of closing argument.\u201d Id., 266. \u201c[I]n addressing the jury, [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Inherent in this latitude is the freedom to argue reasonable inferences based on the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Conde, </em>67 Conn. App. 474, 501, 787 A.2d 571 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 927, 793 A.2d 251 (2002). Nevertheless, \u201cin fulfilling his duties, the prosecutor must confine the arguments to the evidence in the record. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony that is not the subject of proper closing argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Heeding these principles, we are further mindful that \u201c[i]n determining whether this claim of prosecutorial misconduct deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial, we must first decide whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were, in fact, improper, and, if so, whether they substantially prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>54 Conn. App. 26, 43-44, 734 A.2d 1012, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 903, 738 A.2d 1092 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The defendant first claims that, in violation of a court order, the prosecutor prejudicially revealed to the jury that the defendant was a convicted felon. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this issue. Before the trial commenced, the defendant filed several motions in limine, one of which sought to bar the state from offering evidence of the defendant\u2019s 1990 conviction of possession of narcotics. Regarding that motion, the court ruled that the state could mention only that \u201cthe defendant was convicted of an unspecified crime carrying a penalty of more than one year at a certain place and time . . . .\u201d The court specified, however, that it would \u201cnot allow direct evidence or testimony of the fact that it was for a narcotics conviction nine and a half years ago.\u201d On October 19, 1999, the second day of the trial, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>reiterated and clarified its ruling on the motion shortly before the defendant testified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the defendant, \u201cAnd you\u2019re a convicted felon, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Upon hearing this question, defense counsel immediately objected, the jury was excused and defense counsel then made an oral motion for a mistrial. Defense counsel argued that the prosecutor\u2019s question blatantly ignored the court\u2019s ruling regarding the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction by not conforming to the language specified by the court in its ruling. See footnote 1. The court overruled the objection and denied the motion for a mistrial. The court noted that the intent of the controlling case law and, therefore, the court\u2019s ruling was not meant to protect the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>dant from the use of the term \u201cfelony\u201d but was instead meant \u201cto keep out narcotics rather than a felony.\u201d The court further stated: \u201cCall it a conviction for more than one year; call it a felony, to me, it\u2019s consistent. I apologize to counsel for making it sound like a quote. I didn\u2019t intend to keep the concept of a felony out, just narcotics and that was the expressed prayer for relief . . . .\u201d When the trial resumed, the prosecutor asked the defendant twice more whether he was a convicted felon, to which the defendant replied in the affirmative. Similarly, in his closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the defendant as a convicted felon four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In its initial ruling regarding the introduction of evidence of the conviction and in its later summation of that ruling, the court relied on <em>State </em>v. Geyer, 194 Conn. 1, 480 A.2d 489 (1984). In <em>Geyer, </em>the defendant sought, through a motion in limine, to keep his prior convictions out of evidence because they were highly prejudicial in light of the fact that he was on trial for a narcotics offense identical to one of his prior convictions. Id., 3-4. The trial court denied the motion in large part but noted that it would deal with the scope of the prosecutor\u2019s questions about certain convictions as they arose. Consequently, the defendant testified about his convictions during his direct testimony, and the prosecutor pursued them on cross-examination as well without alerting the court as he had promised. Id., 4-5. Our Supreme Court agreed with the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s ruling was improper and ordered a new trial. In doing so, our Supreme Court noted that \u201cthe prudent course for a trial court faced with a decision whether to admit as evidence of credibility prior convictions for crimes that do not directly reflect on credibility is to allow the state to mention that the defendant was convicted of an unspecified crime or crimes carrying a penalty of more than one year, at a certain time and place. The defendant\u2019s character, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>which the jury might draw an inference of dishonesty, would thus be sufficiently impugned without the extraordinary prejudice that sometimes follows when the prior crime is specifically named.\u201d Id., 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Although the prosecutor in the present case may have appeared initially to skirt the court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine and the language used in <em>Geyer, </em>we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s question regarding the defendant\u2019s prior conviction and his later references to it were not improper. We first note that the prosecutor did not specifically name the offense underlying the prior conviction, in accordance with the thrust of the court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. Although the court used the language in <em>Geyer </em>twice as the template that the prosecutor should have employed for his question, the court later explained that its ruling was meant only to prevent the prosecutor from identifying specifically the narcotics offense underlying the prior conviction. The ruling was not intended to shelter the defendant from the use of the term \u201cfelony.\u201d Further, the court adequately addressed any potential prejudice to the defendant through its instruction to the jury to use the prior conviction only to weigh the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony. See footnote 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s stringent reliance on <em>Geyer </em>is misplaced. In Geyer, our Supreme Court did not rule that the use of the words \u201cfelony\u201d or \u201cfelonies\u201d was inappropriate when referring to a defendant\u2019s prior convictions for such offenses. In fact, our Supreme Court in <em>Geyer </em>agreed with the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court \u201cshould have permitted the state to mention only that he had been convicted of unspecified <em>felonies </em>on those occasions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 5. Additionally, in this case the defendant was not threatened by the same kind of prejudice as that overshadowing the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Geyer, </em>who was on trial for the same offense as that underlying one of his prior convictions. Id., 14-15. Instead, the prosecutor here properly challenged the credibility of the defendant by questioning him about his prior conviction, although the prosecutor\u2019s question could have been phrased more prudently in light of the court\u2019s ruling and the language suggested in <em>Geyer. </em>We conclude, therefore, that this aspect of the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The defendant also asserts that the prosecutor improperly referred to facts not in evidence during his closing argument to appeal to the passions of the jury and, thereby, prejudiced the jury against the defendant. We agree that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper but conclude that the comments did not substantially prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history bear on this claim. First, in an apparent attempt to counteract defense counsel\u2019s closing argument concerning the victim\u2019s trustworthiness,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the prosecutor downplayed the victim\u2019s own arrest record in New York by calling it a \u201cminor thing\u201d that \u201ccertainly wasn\u2019t a felony.\u201d The court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections to the prosecutor\u2019s statements on the ground that no evidence had been presented at trial concerning the nature of the charges related to the victim\u2019s arrest in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Finally, the prosecutor referred to the actions of Bolton in the wake of the shooting. The prosecutor stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>during his closing argument: \u201cCrystal Bolton held [the victim\u2019s] head as he was lying there bleeding. The defendant\u2019s sister, she knew who shot Glaister Gopie.\u201d The court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection to these comments as well. Undaunted by the court\u2019s ruling, the prosecutor again stated that Bolton \u201cknew who shot Glaister [Gopie].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, defense counsel again made an oral motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s various closing comments. The court denied the motion but indicated that it would give the jury curative instructions related to the comments,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>accordingly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Our review of the trial transcript reveals that the defendant asserts correctly that neither the severity of the victim\u2019s New York arrest nor the full extent of Bolton\u2019s actions in relation to the victim were explored. We are mindful, however, that \u201c[scrutiny of a challenged remark made during closing arguments to the jury . . . does not occur in a vacuum; an appellate court examines such remarks in light of the entire trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>66 Conn. App. 238, 248, 784 A.2d 387, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 943, 786 A.2d 431 (2001). Moreover, we recognize that \u201c[i]f every remark made by counsel outside of the testimony were ground for a reversal, comparatively few verdicts would stand, since in the ardor of advocacy, and in the excitement of trial, even the most experienced counsel are occasionally carried away by this temptation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chasse, </em>51 Conn. App. 345, 360, 721 A.2d 1212 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 960, 723 A.2d 816 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Examining the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the victim\u2019s arrest under the factors set out in part I of this opinion, we conclude that they were improper but were not substantially prejudicial to the defendant in the context of the trial as a whole. To a certain extent, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was invited by defense counsel\u2019s closing argument because defense counsel used the arrest to undermine the victim\u2019s credibility. As such, the severity of the misconduct was diluted, and we note that the remarks concerning the arrest were limited to two comments made at virtually the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>same point in time. Further, while the victim\u2019s credibility was a critical issue in this case, the court adopted curative measures through its jury instruction strong enough to counter the misconduct appropriately, and we find no indication that the jury disregarded the court\u2019s instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>61 Conn. App. 763, 773, 765 A.2d 1240, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 901, 772 A.2d 599 (2001). Further, considering the strength of the state\u2019s case, we cannot conclude that the remarks were substantially prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Similarly, although we are more disturbed and dismayed by the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning Bolton\u2019s actions, we conclude that they were not so prejudicial in the context of the entire trial as to deny the defendant due process and a fair trial. Mitchell testified that Bolton came around a comer and was in some way lying with the victim after the shooting. No testimony was offered, however, to support the prosecutor\u2019s comment that Bolton actually cradled the head of the victim as he lay bleeding on the ground. Because prosecutors, even with the generous latitude afforded to them during closing argument, may not appeal to the passions or prejudices of a jury, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks here were clearly improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Conde, </em>supra, 67 Conn. App. 501; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>supra, 66 Conn. App. 247. As a result, we are compelled to remind the prosecutor that \u201c[wjhile the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or even to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider. . . . We have cautioned repeatedly that a prosecutor should avoid arguments which are calculated to influence the passions or prejudices of the jury, or which would have the effect of diverting the jury\u2019s attention from their duty to decide the case on the evidence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cWhen presenting closing arguments, as in all facets of a criminal trial, the prosecutor, as a representative of the state, has a duty of fairness that exceeds that of other advocates. [A] prosecutor is not an ordinary advocate. His [or her] duty is to see that justice is done and to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce prejudice and wrongful decisions by the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>supra, 66 Conn. App. 247. The prosecutor here appeared ready to shelve this solemn duty in favor of lesser gains. Notwithstanding this criticism, the remarks concerning Bolton\u2019s actions occurred only during closing arguments and were not central to the critical issues in this case. Further, the court gave a curative instruction to the jury, and, again, in light of the strength of the state\u2019s case, we cannot conclude that the remarks infected the trial with such unfairness as to deprive the defendant of due process. The defendant has, therefore, failed to shoulder his burden of proving that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct, while improper, was substantially prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> The trial transcript reveals the following relevant colloquy concerning the court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine, which addressed the introduction into evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The only . . . other thing, Judge, is I just want to revisit this so there\u2019s no mistake ... on my part or by the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s part.

To that end, defense counsel discussed how it was shown during the trial that, in fact, the victim had a prior arrest record in New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> Our review of the trial transcripts reveals four main references to Bolton, who did not testify at the trial. First, the police officer who first arrived at the scene of the shooting testified that Bolton was one of two people he interviewed there and that she did not see the shooting. Second, the defendant testified that he was visiting Bolton on the day of the shooting and that Bolton was his half-sister. Third, Mitchell, who was also at the scene of the shooting, testified that following the shooting \u201ca girl, Crystal Bolton, came down and she was like, \u2018Oh, Glaister. Glaister,\u2019 and I went over to call [the victim\u2019s] mother.\u201d Mitchell further testified that when the police arrived, \u201cCrystal was lying there with [the victim].\u201d Finally, the victim testified that after he was shot, Bolton \u201ccame around the comer and [his friend] came around the comer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> The trial transcript reveals in relevant part the substance of the court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201cThe Court: While I agree that there were comments that I think were gratuitous and require some curative instruction, I don\u2019t feel that they rose to the level of misconduct that would deprive this defendant of a fair trial and . . .

That\u2019s the attorneys\u2019 slant on what they feel the evidence produced or what it showed, and they have a right to summarize, but you have to remember, that\u2019s from their own perspective and to do it appropriately, they have to refer only to the evidence and testimony that [has] been offered through the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">\u201cNow, in this particular case, in the closing argument, you may have heard comments that were made which were not testimony of the witnesses, and there were a couple of examples that I want to bring to your attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">\u201cThere was a closing argument made that the victim had a matter in New York State, a prosecution or an arrest. While you may have heard in closing argument that it wasn\u2019t a major matter, it was a minor matter, the fact is there was no evidence or testimony . . . about that, just the fact of the arrest in New York. That\u2019s all you heard, and if that\u2019s your recollection, that\u2019s what you should recall, regardless of what counsel may have said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-13\">\u201cThere was also a comment made about what a particular person at the scene of the crime may have done or seen, and that is Crystal Bolton. Crystal Bolton is not a witness in this case. There was testimony about what she was seen to do, for example, attend to the victim when he was on the ground, but there was no evidence or testimony about her personal thoughts or her observations or any knowledge that she might have had. It was a very dispatched testimony about what she was seen to be doing, so I want to bring to your attention that there was no testimony by Crystal Bolton in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-14\">\u201cThose are just examples of where the court would normally . . . say, \u2018Forget what the attorneys said. Remember what you heard.\u2019 And that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do here. What they said, whether it was their opinions or their recollections, that doesn\u2019t control. Your recollections control ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-15\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-16\">\u201cThe fact that a witness in this case\u2014either state or defendant\u2019s witness\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>may have admitted that he has been convicted of a crime is only admissible on the question of the credibility of the witness, that is, the weight you will give his testimony. A witness\u2019 criminal record or admission of facts of stealing or lying or cheating bears only on his credibility. It\u2019s your duty to determine whether this witness is to be believed wholly or partly or not at all. You may consider his prior conviction . . . and give such weight to those facts as you decide is fair and reasonable in determining the credibility of this witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
