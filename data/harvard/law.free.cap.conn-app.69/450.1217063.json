(Suburban), appeal from the judgment of the trial court awarding $10,633.36 in withheld wages and penalties to five former employees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the defendants and awarding $7500 in attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff commissioner of labor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>defendants claim that the court improperly (1) held that the parties had not agreed to a policy authorizing up to a 50 percent \u201cback charge\u201d reduction in commissions earned by the claimants, (2) held that two of the individual claimants were entitled to withheld commissions for merely having obtained a buyer or listing, respectively, (3) failed to estop two of the individual claimants from repudiating the existence of the 50 percent \u201cback charge\u201d policy and (4) awarded the plaintiff double damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-72.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary to our disposition of the defendants\u2019 appeal. Wall is a licensed real estate broker and is the owner and operator of Suburban, a real estate firm in Wethersfield. Between February 2,1995, and May 16,1997, five former employees of Suburban filed complaints with the labor department, alleging that they had not been paid for all hours worked and that wages in the form of commissions had been withheld from them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The labor department, after reviewing the defendants\u2019 records, determined that a total of $10,612.25 in wages had been withheld from the five claimants in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-71b and 31-71c. Demand for payment was made on the defendants, but they failed to tender payment. On March 30, 1999, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>plaintiff brought an action for unpaid wages and compensation on behalf of the five claimants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">On April 5, 2000, the damages portion of the trial commenced,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the court heard testimony over four days on the issues of the amount, if any, of unpaid compensation due each of the claimants, interest on that sum, and whether the plaintiff could prevail on his claim for double damages and attorney\u2019s fees, as provided for in \u00a7 31-72. The testimony centered on the particulars of the individual real estate transactions on which the claimants\u2019 claims were based, detailing the nature of the work performed by the various participants, as well as the method by which employees were compensated for their work.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The court found that the evidence established that Suburban enforced a \u201cticket policy\u201d under which agents could negotiate with another agent to cover for them for the purpose of performing a particular, discrete task. Among the types of activities for which a ticket might be assessed were attendance at a preclosing inspection or at the closing itself. Those tickets would result in a charge of between $50 and $100, deducted from the commission due that agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Wall also testified that Suburban enforced a \u201cback charge\u201d policy under which an agent who abandoned a transaction, or who could not otherwise follow a sale through to closing, would have 50 percent of the commission due automatically deducted. That half of the commission deducted as a \u201cback charge\u201d would be given to the agent who completed the sale. According to Wall, a back charge would be assessed when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>work performed by another agent to effectuate a closing was more significant than the discrete, isolated tasks compensated according to the ticket policy. The court concluded that the evidence did not support a finding that Suburban had such a back charge policy in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff and awarded double damages in the amount of $10,633.36, interest on each commission due calculated at the rate of 1 percent per month and attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $7500 as well as costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The defendants\u2019 first claim on appeal is that the court improperly held that the parties had not agreed to a system of compensation authorizing up to a 50 percent \u201cback charge\u201d reduction in commissions owed to the claimants. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The defendants\u2019 claim challenges a factual finding of the court and, accordingly, our review is limited. \u201cThe factual findings of a [trial referee] on any issue are reversible only if they are clearly erroneous. ... [A reviewing court] cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Post <em>Road, Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lexington Development Group, Inc., </em>54 Conn. App. 534, 540, 736 A.2d 923 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">In its memorandum of decision, the court stated: \u201c[T]his court finds the so called [back charge] policy was applied so erratically as not to be a policy at all. Sometimes Suburban deducted less than 50 percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>an agent\u2019s commission when he or she left the employ before a transaction was completed . . . sometimes Suburban deducted more than the 50 percent of the commission to which an agent was entitled . . . and sometimes Suburban deducted the entire commission .... Obviously, the practice was at the whim of Mary Lou Wall, and she deducted any portion of the commission she chose without any itemization or explanation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Each of the claimants testified that they were never informed of Suburban\u2019s so-called \u201cback charge\u201d policy. Although other former employees testified that the policy was discussed at staff meetings, the court, as the finder of fact, was free to adopt either version of the events. Moreover, the evidence presented at trial supports a finding that the deductions that Suburban charged against an agent\u2019s commission followed no hard and fast rule. Reviewing the transactions that are the subject of this action reveals that Suburban, allegedly pursuant to its back charge policy, assessed charges against agents\u2019 commissions ranging from 57 percent to 100 percent, and in at least one instance imposed a ticket in lieu of a back charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Claimant Andrew C. Benko was the listing agent for 88 Oakdale Street in Wethersfield. The parties agreed that that agent\u2019s share of the total commission generated was $1150. Of that amount, Suburban retained $500 and paid Benko $650. With respect to another transaction, the sale of 4 Brentwood in Windsor, Wall testified that although a 50 percent back charge would have been appropriate pursuant to Suburban\u2019s alleged policy, Benko was assessed a ticket for $250.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Claimant Steven M. Alexander was the selling agent for 222 West Main Street in Plainville. He secured a contract of sale for the property on January 22, 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and left Suburban\u2019s employ on February 6, 1997. Wall testified that to bring the transaction to a close, the financing on the property had to be changed and that she had to get a commitment from the seller to repair various problems with the plumbing. Wall testified that the change in the property\u2019s financing resulted in an additional $300 charge, which the agency paid. Although Wall claimed to have assessed the standard 50 percent back charge against Alexander\u2019s commission on the transaction, the claimant received only $300 out of a total commission of $1200. Wall testified that she deducted an additional $300 from Alexander\u2019s commission to compensate the agency for its costs in correcting what she characterized as Alexander\u2019s failure to do his job. In the case of two other claimants, Alexis R. DeRubertis and Anita D. Flore, Suburban withheld the entire commission due them on particular sales.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The court concluded that \u201cthere was no fixed policy at all, but rather the agreement between Suburban and its employees applied to the effect that Suburban was entitled to retain a reasonable portion of an agent\u2019s commission share to cover the costs of closing properties that were the subject of contracts of sale entered into prior to an agent leaving but not settled until after he or she left.\u201d Because the evidence presented at trial supports the court\u2019s conclusion, we cannot say that its conclusion was clearly erroneous. Therefore, that conclusion must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly held that two of the claimants, DeRubertis and Fiore, were entitled to commissions for merely having obtained a buyer and listing, respectively. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The controversy between the parties essentially relates to the point at which an agent has performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>sufficient work toward effectuating a sale that she is entitled to share in the commission on the closing of that sale. That presents the court with a question of fact, and \u201cthe court\u2019s conclusion must stand unless it is contrary to or unsupported by the facts, or is in conflict with logic or reason, or violates the applicable rules of law.\u201d <em>Pitt </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>149 Conn. 351, 356, 179 A.2d 626 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The two transactions at issue with respect to the defendants\u2019 claim are the sale of 9 Rosewood Lane, Bloomfield (DeRubertis), and 29 Robin Brook Drive, Newington (Fiore). Neither DeRubertis nor Fiore received any commission from the respective sales of those properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The buyer of 9 Rosewood Lane was a referral brought into the office by DeRubertis. DeRubertis testified that she spent a significant amount of time showing the client properties in Bloomfield, writing contracts for various properties that the client was interested in, including the contract for 9 Rosewood Lane, and generally developing a rapport with the client. DeRubertis also testified on cross-examination that although Suburban\u2019s agents were not paid directly for any of those disparate tasks, payment for such tasks was wrapped into the commission earned at the time of closing on a property. It is undisputed that the buyer closed on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Wall testified that although DeRubertis had negotiated the original contract for the sale of the property, the entire contract had to be renegotiated and that consequently, the deal negotiated by DeRubertis effectively ceased to exist, and the closing reflected an entirely new deal in which DeRubertis had no part. Despite Wall\u2019s assertions regarding the extent of the alterations to the contract necessary to close the deal, those subsequent changes simply were noted on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>contract originally prepared by DeRubertis; no new document was drafted. Wall also testified that subsequent to the claimant\u2019s departure, she was required to visit the property for inspections between four and six times. Wall could not, however, recall the specific purpose of those visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The court was free to evaluate the testimony of the witnesses as to the extent of additional work required to close the sale and the reasonableness of any apportionment of the commission. On the basis of the testimony presented at trial, we can not conclude that the court\u2019s finding that DeRubertis should have received some compensation for her efforts was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Fiore listed 29 Robin Brook Drive on May 4, 1994. The contract for the property was signed on September 1, 1994, and Fiore left Suburban on September 7, 1994. Fiore testified that the listing agent\u2019s primary responsibility subsequent to obtaining the listing was to conduct open houses at the property. Once an offer on the property was made, the buyer\u2019s agents would be responsible for conducting inspections and arranging for financing. At that point, the listing agent\u2019s primary tasks simply were to monitor the process to ensure that it was moving forward and to attend the closing to receive the commission check.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Wall\u2019s testimony indicated that a more significant amount of work was necessary to close on the property following Flore\u2019s departure. She testified that among other tasks that needed to be completed, it was necessary for her to renegotiate the sales price because it would not have been possible for the buyers to get financing under the deal as structured.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Regardless of the actual effort necessary to effectuate the sale of the property following Flore\u2019s departure, the evidence supported the court\u2019s finding that Flore was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>entitled to some commission by virtue of being the listing agent. Indeed, Suburban actually had paid the claimant some commission on two other transactions for which she had acted as the listing agent and which closed after she had left the defendants\u2019 employ. Just as she had in those other transactions, DeRubertis had obtained a contract for the sale of 29 Robin Brook Drive prior to leaving Suburban. One of the defendants\u2019 own witnesses testified that once a property closed, an agent would be entitled to at least some commission for merely having obtained the listing. That position is supported by the express terms of the employment contract itself. The employment agreement states that an agent earns a commission for the listing of a property once that property is sold and that if such closing occurs after the agent has left the agency, then the agency may retain an amount reasonable given the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The court\u2019s findings were derived from the evidence presented at trial, and that evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion that Fiore was entitled to at least some commission on the particular sale. Accordingly, we find that the court\u2019s conclusion in that regard was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly failed to estop two of the individual claimants, Frederick S. Grilli and Alexander, from challenging the 50 percent \u201cback charge\u201d policy. The defendants base that claim on allegations that the claimants had personally benefited from the \u201cback charge\u201d policy that they now repudiate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Whether the party claiming estoppel has proved the necessary elements to establish an estoppel involve questions of fact that we review under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>218 Conn. 681, 699, 590 A.2d 957 (1991). To successfully assert an estoppel defense based on the ratification of a contract by the acceptance of the benefits of that contract, the terms of the contract must be established. See <em>Sawmill Brook Racing Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Realty Advisors, Inc., </em>39 Conn. App. 444, 450, 664 A.2d 819 (1995). Although agreement to a compensation arrangement may be inferred by looking to the conduct of the parties, we cannot say that in the case before us, the parties\u2019 conduct supports the conclusion that the claimants had ratified the alleged \u201cback charge\u201d policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The claimants\u2019 claims are consistent with their testimony regarding the manner in which commissions were divided within the office, both generally and with respect to the individual transactions on which the defendants base their estoppel defense. The claimants do not dispute that in the specific instances cited by the defendants, they received 50 percent of another agent\u2019s commission as a result of their efforts in bringing a property to close. They do dispute, however, that such division was pursuant to an established \u201cback charge\u201d policy as opposed to a general practice of apportioning commissions \u201creasonably\u201d between the participating agents on an ad hoc basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Without having first established the necessary factual predicates that the defendants themselves were operating in accordance with the alleged \u201cback charge\u201d policy and that the claimants actually were informed that they were being compensated pursuant to such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>policy, the defendants cannot successfully assert an estoppel against the claimants on the basis of the ratification of an agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendants have failed to satisfy their burden of establishing the existence of the elements essential to an estoppel and that the court\u2019s failure to find an estoppel in favor of them was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The defendants\u2019 fourth and final claim is that the court improperly awarded double damages and attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 31-72 provides for the discretionary award of double damages and attorney\u2019s fees in unpaid wage cases. Our case law has established that such an award is appropriate where there is evidence of bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 454, 470, 704 A.2d 222 (1997); <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>219 Conn. 217, 229, 592 A.2d 931 (1991). The defendants argue that the court cannot make a finding of bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness where the amount of commission due to an employee at the time of that employee\u2019s termination was not clearly identifiable because of a disagreement between the parties as to the method of computing such compensation. In support of their argument, the defendants cite <em>NYCONN Dala Systems </em>v. <em>Cottrell, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven at Meriden, Docket Nos. CV950242202, CV950247574 (January 17, 1996), and <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Saliva Diagnostic Systems, Inc., </em>52 F. Sup. 2d 333 (D. Conn. 1999).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the finding of the court with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>to the defendants\u2019 conduct is a question of fact, whether such a finding is precluded where the evidence establishes a bona fide disagreement between the parties about the method of compensation presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Each of the cases cited by the defendants is distinguishable from the case at bar because neither one involved a situation in which the employer arbitrarily enforced the very policy that it claimed governed employee compensation. Moreover, the <em>Hardy </em>court did not conclude that it could not have found that the employer had acted in bad faith, arbitrarily or unreasonably. Rather, it simply declined to make such a finding independently in light of the plaintiffs failure to request a jury interrogatory on the issue and the existence of a bona fide dispute between the parties as to whether the plaintiff was actually entitled to the wages awarded. <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Saliva Diagnostic Systems, Inc., </em>supra, 52 F. Sup. 2d 340-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In contrast to the cases cited by the defendants, the court here found that the defendants\u2019 withholding in fact had been motivated not by a good faith belief that they were acting in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement, but rather by mere whim and caprice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court\u2019s finding that Wall\u2019s deductions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>withholdings were arbitrary was supported by the testimony presented at trial. Given that factual finding by the court, we conclude that the award of double damages was a reasonable exercise of the court\u2019s discretion pursuant to \u00a7 31-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-12\"> The five claimants involved with the present action are Andrew C.

The defendants make the same claim with respect to Alexander on the basis of his acceptance of 50 percent of the commission due on a transaction abandoned by another Suburban agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>and assigned to him by Wall. Wail testified that those cases were assigned to the respective claimants with specific reference to the alleged \u201cback charge\u201d policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\"> We note that although Superior Court opinions are not binding on us, they may be persuasive. <em>L &amp; R Realty </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>46 Conn.

It applied its own purported 50 percent back charge policy erratically and arbitrarily, and it made deductions from [the] claimants\u2019 commissions without justification. Moreover, it gave no details of the deductions made. In several instances, it exaggerated the amount of work Suburban did after a claimant left. In other instances, the deductions had no relationship to the amount of work done by Suburban. In still other cases, it denied a commission entirely. The court finds that Suburban deliberately deprived the claimants [of] a fair share of the commissions due them and persistently acted in bad faith. Thus, the court concludes that the claimants are entitled to twice the amount of the commissions due them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
