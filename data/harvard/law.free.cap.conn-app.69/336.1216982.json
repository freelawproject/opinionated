The defendant, Robert W. Spillane, originally appealed to this court from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of larceny in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his original appeal, the defendant claimed that \u201cthe trial court improperly (1) denied his motion for acquittal at the end of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, (2) denied his motion for acquittal at the conclusion of all of the evidence, (3) omitted from its final jury instructions the definition of \u2018to deprive\u2019 or \u2018to appropriate\u2019 as set out in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thus failed to instruct the jury about all of the necessary elements of larceny, (4) denied his motion to strike the testimony of the complaining witness, Webster Lewis, (5) refused to instruct the jury concerning the destruction of certain police tapes and (6) refused to give a missing witness instruction for the state\u2019s failure to call the wife of the complaining witness to testify. He also claim [ed] for the first time on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s \u2018improper\u2019 argument deprived him of his due process right to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>fair trial under the United States and Connecticut constitutions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>54 Conn. App. 201, 203, 737 A.2d 479 (1999), rev\u2019d, 255 Conn. 746, 770 A.2d 898 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We determined that the trial court improperly omitted the definition of the term \u201cappropriate\u201d set forth in \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (4) (B) from its instruction to the jury on the elements of larceny, and that it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instruction and, therefore, we ordered a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 218-20. On November 2, 1999, our Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issues: (1) \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding appropriate were constitutionally inadequate?\u201d and (2) \u201cIf the answer to the first question is yes, was the error harmful?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>251 Conn. 914, 740 A.2d 866 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The Supreme Court agreed that the trial court should have defined for the jury the term \u201cappropriate,\u201d but it found the improper instruction to have been harmless and therefore it reversed our judgment and remanded the case to us with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining grounds for appeal, i.e., (1) \u201cwhether the trial court improperly refused to give a missing witness instruction for the state\u2019s failure to call the wife of the complaining witness to testify\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper argument deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the United States and Connecticut constitutions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The relevant facts underlying the defendant\u2019s conviction, as the jury reasonably could have found them, were set out in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision as follows. \u201cThe defendant operated Walnut Street Services, Inc., a towing company in Hartford. Walnut Street Services, Inc., was authorized by various area businesses, including Mechanics\u2019 Savings Bank on Farmington Avenue in Hartford, to tow unauthorized vehicles from their lots during nonbusiness hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u201cAround midnight, on April 27, 1996, Webster Lewis parked his car on the street in front of Mechanics\u2019 Savings Bank and entered the apartment of his girlfriend, Andrea Gudealm. When Lewis exited the building, he discovered his car was missing. Gudealm called the police from a nearby pay telephone, and the police gave her the telephone numbers of several tow companies. Upon calling the tow companies, Gudealm located Lewis\u2019 car at Walnut Street Services, Inc. The following afternoon, Lewis proceeded to Walnut Street Services, Inc., and paid the defendant\u2019s wife, Cheryl Spillane, $148 to retrieve his vehicle. Lewis found his glove compartment open, papers scattered around the car and tools missing from the back of the car. Lewis then called the police, and larceny charges were brought against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u201cThe defendant was tried on two counts of larceny in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-124 for the wrongful taking of Lewis\u2019 car and his tools respectively, as well as on one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53-21, as amended by No. 95-142, \u00a7 1, of the 1995 Public Acts and one count of reckless endangerment in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64 for an incident that occurred on October 1, 1996. At the close of the state\u2019s case, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal of the charge of larceny in the third degree with respect to the tools, and the trial continued on the remaining charges of larceny in the third degree stemming from the taking of Lewis\u2019 vehicle on April 27, 1996, as well as risk of injury to a child and reckless endangerment in the second degree, both stemming from the October 1, 1996 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u201cMuch of the trial testimony addressed where Lewis\u2019 car had been parked when it was towed. If it had been parked in the Mechanics\u2019 Savings Bank parking lot, Walnut Street Services, Inc., rightfully towed the vehicle. If, however, it had been parked on the street, as the state claimed, then Walnut Street Services, Inc., wrongfully towed the vehicle. In accordance with Lewis\u2019 testimony, the jury found the tow to have been wrongful and, on March 20, 1997, found the defendant guilty of larceny in the third degree. The defendant was found not guilty of the charges of reckless endangerment in the second degree and risk of injury to a child. The defendant was sentenced on May 2, 1997, to a two year suspended sentence and three years probation. He was also ordered to pay Lewis restitution in the amount of $200, participate in an anger management program, and donate $1000 to the Hartford police department outreach program.\u201d Id., 749-51. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that pursuant to <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960), overruled in part, <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>250 Conn. 722, 737 A.2d 442 (1999) (en banc), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1170, 120 S. Ct. 1195, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1099 (2000), the trial court improperly refused to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>a missing witness instruction for the state\u2019s failure to call the wife of the complaining witness to testify. The state argues that the defendant\u2019s claim was not properly preserved and that the court did not abuse its discretion \u201cbecause the witness was not one the state would \u2018naturally\u2019 have called.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The defendant failed to raise this claim at trial. Furthermore, in seeking our review of this claim, the defendant fails to request review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIt is well established that generally this court will not review claims that were not properly preserved in the trial court. ... A defendant may prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial, however, if the defendant satisfies the four part standard set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding </em>[supra, 239-40],\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnett, 53 </em>Conn. App. 581, 598, 734 A.2d 991, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 918, 738 A.2d 659 (1999). \u201cWhere a defendant fails to seek review of an unpreserved claim under either <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine, this court will not examine such a claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Abraham, </em>64 Conn. App. 384, 404 n.18, 780 A.2d 223, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 917, 782 A.2d 1246 (2001). We therefore decline to review this claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial under the United States and Connecticut constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The defendant raises his claim for the first time on appeal. Furthermore, in seeking our review of his claim, the defendant fails to request review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, or the plain error doctrine. We reiterate that \u201c[w]here a defendant fails to seek review of an unpreserved claim under either <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine, this court will not examine such a claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Abraham, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 404 n.18. We therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Even if we were to review the defendant\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim, we would conclude that it lacks merit because the defendant has failed to show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. In its closing argument, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>argued that the defendant\u2019s motive for committing larceny was money and that possession of Lewis\u2019 vehicle represented money to the defendant. It argued that the fundamental issue for the jury to decide was whether the defendant towed Lewis\u2019 vehicle wrongfully from the street or lawfully from the parking lot. The state further argued that the defendant essentially had a license to steal and that it was \u201calmost the perfect crime\u201d because the defendant could collect cars off the street and receive money from the owners who, like Lewis, just wanted to get their cars back and were unaware that Walnut Street Services, Inc., lacked the authority to tow such cars from the street. The state also observed that Lewis had no motive to cause the defendant\u2019s arrest and that he merely wanted his car and tools returned. In its rebuttal argument, the state argued that the jury should not \u201clet this defendant get away with what he did on April 27, 1996, when he made Webster Lewis buy back his own car . . . .\u201d The defendant did not object to any of these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Prosecutorial misconduct can occur in the course of closing argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 768-69, 670 A.2d 276 (1996). \u201c[T]o deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial . . . the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chasse, </em>51 Conn. App. 345, 355, 721 A.2d 1212 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 960, 723 A.2d 816 (1999). \u201cA prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 545, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). Nor should a prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>cutor \u201cinject extraneous issues into the case that divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence.\u201d Id., 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201c[T]o determine whether claims of prosecutorial misconduct amounted to a denial of due process, we must decide whether the challenged remarks were improper, and, if so, whether they caused substantial prejudice to the defendant. ... In conducting our analysis, we focus on several factors: (1) the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) the frequency of the conduct; (4) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case; (5) the strength of the curative instructions adopted; and (6) the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Garrett, 42 Conn. App. 507, 515, 681 A.2d 362, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 928, 929, 683 A.2d 398 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In his appellate brief, the defendant claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing in her summation that the jury \u201cshould convict him of a crime with which he was not charged,\u201d i.e., extortion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> thus injecting an extraneous issue designed to divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the relevant evidence. Specifically, the defendant argues that the prosecutor \u201cnever claimed that the evidence established that [he] was guilty of third degree larceny . . . in regard to Mr. Lewis\u2019 car, but, instead, asked the jury to find him guilty of stealing the money Mr. Lewis paid to obtain the release of his car.\u201d He further argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the prosecutor improperly \u201casked the jury to find that the defendant\u2019s intention was to deprive Mr. Lewis of his car <em>temporarily, </em>in order to extract an illegal payment from him for its release.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In its appellate brief, the state responds that there was no permanency requirement in the form of larceny at issue and that its summation accurately reflected the \u201cappropriation\u201d form of larceny rather than the \u201cextortion form.\u201d We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In its decision, the Supreme Court noted that the \u201cintent to deprive\u201d aspect of larceny was not at issue because the defendant was charged with the \u201cintent to appropriate,\u201d which requires an intent to dispose of property for the benefit of oneself or a third person. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 753-54. It also stated that \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (4) (B) \u201ccontains no permanency element.\u201d Id., 761. Therefore, insofar as the defendant asserts a \u201cpermanency\u201d argument, it is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In his reply brief, the defendant argues for the first time that the prosecutor improperly argued that he was guilty of criminal trover in the second degree,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a crime he was not charged with committing. He goes on to state that his argument \u201cmust be viewed in the context of [his] basic argument that the definition of larceny relied on by the state, i.e., to dispose of property for the benefit of oneself or a third person . . . does not constitute larceny under the Connecticut [General] Statutes.\u201d According to the defendant, this is because \u201csuch a return of property to the owner is not a \u2018disposal\u2019 of it under \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (4) (B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Although the defendant raises this claim in the prosecutorial misconduct context, he essentially is making a sufficiency of the evidence claim with respect to the meaning of \u201cintent to appropriate\u201d under \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (4) (B). The defendant cannot persuade us to revisit the sufficiency issue because our Supreme Court already has found that there was sufficient evidence for the defendant\u2019s conviction of larceny in the third degree. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>257 Conn. 750, 760, 778 A.2d 101 (2001). Moreover, we will not ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s express rejection of the defendant\u2019s argument with respect to the \u201cintent to appropriate\u201d provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In noting that \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (4) (B) has no permanency requirement, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he state did not claim that the defendant intended to keep the vehicle, but rather that the vehicle was improperly towed so that the defendant\u2019s company could collect the $148 benefit.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 761. In addition, after determining that the fundamental issue was \u201cwhether the defendant towed Lewis\u2019 car wrongfully from the street or lawfully from the parking lot,\u201d the court stated that \u201cthe wrongfulness of the tow was disputed, not whether the defendant disposed of the vehicle for a $148 benefit. The defendant did not contest the evidence that he towed the vehicle; indeed, the defendant\u2019s own witnesses corroborated that fact. Similarly, the defendant did not contest the fact that Walnut Street Services, Inc., collected a $148 fee for the return of the vehicle.\u201d Id., 758. Finally, in reconsidering the defendant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim, the Supreme Court specifically stated that the jury \u201creasonably could have found that the defendant towed the vehicle in order to obtain the $148 benefit.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Thus, it is fair to say that the Supreme Court has stated more than once that disposing of the vehicle for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>a $148 benefit was sufficient to satisfy the element of intent \u201cto dispose of the property for the benefit of oneself or a third person\u201d under \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (4) (B). The Supreme Court, therefore, has indicated that the state\u2019s theory of the case fully corresponded to the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Likewise, we continue to adhere to the view expressed in our earlier opinion that the state\u2019s summation was consonant with the \u201cintent to appropriate\u201d theory of larceny. Indeed, in determining which subsection of larceny was at issue, we stated that the prosecution proceeded under the \u201cappropriation\u201d form and that \u201cdefense counsel did not then or thereafter at trial take issue with the state\u2019s theory on the first count. He did not claim surprise but proceeded to go forward with his own case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 213. We further pointed out that \u201c[d]uring its argument to the jury, the state argued that the defendant, in towing the Lewis car, was motivated by the money that would be obtained by towing the car and then charging the owner money to get the car back.\u201d Id. We therefore believe that in claiming that \u201cneither the Appellate Court nor the Supreme Court engaged in any discussion of what the legislature meant by the use of [the] language [to dispose of the property for the benefit of oneself or a third person],\u201d the defendant misreads the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We conclude that there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s argument in her summation urged the jury to \u201cconvict him of a crime with which he was not charged.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant has failed to show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper. In so concluding, we observe that the defendant cites no authority for claiming prosecutorial misconduct on that basis. We also note that in its final instructions to the jury, the trial court stated that it was the court\u2019s function, not counsel\u2019s, to explain to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>jury the applicable law and that what it says in that regard is binding on the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore must presume that the jury knew the applicable law and convicted the defendant on that basis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 403, 631 A.2d 238 (1993) (\u201c[j]urors are presumed to have followed the instructions of the court as to the law in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the third degree when he commits larceny, as defined in section 53a-119, and: (1) The property consists of a motor vehicle, the value of which is five thousand dollars or less . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 provides in relevant part: \u201cA person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (4) provides in relevant part: \u201cTo \u2018appropriate\u2019 property of another to oneself or a third person means . . .

The defendant argues that by remanding the \u201cmissing witness\u201d issue (o this court, the Supreme Court \u201cimplicitly determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>[State </em>v.] <em>Malave </em>[supra, 250 Conn. 722] only had prospective application.\u201d In <em>Malave, </em>our Supreme Court abandoned, in criminal cases, the <em>Secondino </em>rule, also known as the missing witness rule, which sanctioned, under certain circumstances, a jury instruction that an adverse inference may be drawn from the failure of a party to produce a witness. Id., 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Although our Supreme Court to date has not addressed whether <em>Malave </em>applies retroactively, we have held on several occasions that <em>Malave </em>does apply retroactively. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>67 Conn. App. 120, 123, 786 A.2d 1116 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 926, 793 A.2d 252 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>56 Conn. App. 529, 533, 745 A.2d 191 (2000). Moreover, when our Supreme Court intends for a decision to apply prospectively only, it knows how to say so clearly. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>250 Conn. 466, 475-76, 736 A.2d 125 (1999) (\u201cwe . . . direct our trial courts to refrain from using the [jury instruction at issue in that case] in the future\u201d). Therefore, absent a determination by the Supreme Court to the contrary, we conclude that the <em>Malave </em>decision applies retroactively to this case. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s \u201cmissing witness\u201d claim lacks merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 (5) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person obtains property by extortion when he compels or induces another person to deliver such property to himself or a third person by means of instilling in him a fear that, if the property is not so delivered, the actor or another will: (A) Cause physical ipjury to some person in the future; or (B) cause damage to property; or (C) engage in other conduct constituting a crime ... or \u00a9 inflict any other harm which would not benefit the actor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-126b (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal trover in the second degree when, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so, he uses the personal property of another without the consent of such owner, and such use results in damage to or diminishes the value of such properly or subjects such owner to economic loss, fine or other penalty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> The trial court instructed the jury on the applicable law in relevant part as follows: \u201cOur statute defines larceny as follows: Aperson commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself ... he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds the property from an owner. Each of the following elements must be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt. First, that the defendant wrongfully took, obtained or withheld property from an owner. And second, that at the time the defendant obtained the properly, he intended to appropriate that property to himself or a third person. . . . The state must prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that first, [the defendant] wrongfully took, obtained or withheld property from the owner and at the time he did that, he intended to appropriate the same to himself or a third person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> In his supplemental brief, the defendant also argues that the trial court overlooked \u00a7 53a-119 (8) and therefore plain error review is necessary. We disagree. Section 53a-119 (8) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of larceny by receiving stolen property if he receives, retains or disposes of stolen property knowing that it has probably been stolen or believing that it has probably been stolen, unless the property is received, retained or disposed of with purpose to restore it to the owner. . . .\u201d The problem with the defendant\u2019s argument here is that \u00a7 53a-119 (8) does not require that the property be disposed of \u201cfor the benefit of oneself or a third person\u201d as does \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (4) (B), and, therefore, it is not applicable. Accordingly, the trial court did not overlook an applicable statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The defendant\u2019s other remaining arguments are also without merit. His reference to the definition of \u201cconversion\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) provides him no support because in the present case we are concerned with the proper construction of a statute, not a common-law term. Likewise, the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>95 Conn. 34, 110 A. 461 (1920), is inapposite because that case concerned a definition of larceny that was superseded by the enactment of the Penal Code in 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
