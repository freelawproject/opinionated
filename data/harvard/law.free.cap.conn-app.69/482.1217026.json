On May 19, 1999, the defendant was operating a bus en route between Boston and New York. Officer Richard Vaientukonis stopped the bus on Interstate 95 in Westport. Vaientukonis inspected the bus, and reviewed the registration and operating authority. The bus was registered in Delaware and had Delaware license plates. The United States Department of Transportation operating authority depicted on the side of the bus was 652814. Vaientukonis issued a citation on May 19, 1999, to the defendant for failure to register a motor vehicle in Connecticut in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-12 (a). At trial, however, the state proceeded under \u00a7 14-12a. See part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">On August 18,1999, the court, <em>Robaina, </em>J., conducted a hearing regarding the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure and examination whereby the defendant requested numerous documents from the state. The court granted the motion in part, including the request for disclosure of witnesses and documents. On November 3, 1999,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial began before the court, <em>Mia\u00f1o, J. </em>The court found the defendant guilty of failure to register a commercial motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 14~12a and imposed a $300 fine. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The defendant filed a motion to remove the case to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and filed the requisite notice with this court on January 11, 2002, merely three days prior to oral argument in this court. On January 17, 2002, the state filed a motion for a summary remand with the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446 to which the defendant responded on March 11, 2002. After finding that no federal question was implicated in this case, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the District Court granted the state\u2019s motion. This court, therefore, has jurisdiction to decide this matter. We now proceed to the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The defendant, appearing pro se, first claims that the court improperly permitted the state to conduct a trial on an entirely new charge introduced midtrial. Specifically, he argues that because the summons cited \u00a7 14-12 (a), rather than \u00a7 14-12a, he was not timely apprised of the charge against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Before we reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, it is important to review the procedural history of this case. In the original summons, the defendant was charged with failure to register a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 14-12 (a). On direct examination, the state\u2019s first witness, Vaientukonis, testified regarding the registration of the vehicle and the information that he obtained during the stop. During cross-examination of Vaientukonis, the defendant posited the following: \u201cYou appear to cite [\u00a7 14-12 (a)], but when looking at the statute book, there\u2019s another statute, which is \u00a7 14-12a without parentheses. Are we to assume that you intended \u00a7 14-12 (a)? That\u2019s what the ticket said. That\u2019s not clear in my mind.\u201d After a brief discussion with the court regarding notice and the court\u2019s acquiescence that the defendant should have been charged with \u00a7 14-12a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant continued his cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>of Valentukonis. Subsequently, the defendant began to question Valentukonis regarding the differences between \u00a7 14-12 (a) and \u00a7 14-12a. The court, however, interjected that the state was proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 14-12a and, therefore, any differences between the statutes were irrelevant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant then questioned Valentukonis regarding whether the vehicle was a commercial motor vehicle. The state\u2019s only other wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ness, inspector Robert B. Woods of the department of motor vehicles, testified that the vehicle was garaged most frequently in Connecticut. During the direct examination of Woods, the court halted the proceedings and continued the case to a later date. See part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">When the proceedings resumed, the defendant extensively cross-examined Woods regarding where the bus was garaged and whether he had conclusive proof that the bus found in the garage was the same vehicle stopped by Valentukonis. In addition, the defendant proffered photographs of the garage where Woods testified he found the vehicle garaged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the state rested, the defendant called his only witness, Francisco Rodriquez, a driver for New Britain Transportation, to testify regarding the department of motor vehicles\u2019 requirements for registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u201cDue process requires that a criminal defendant be given notice of the specific charge against him and an opportunity to defend against that charge. . . . Where a defendant is prejudiced by being charged with a substantially different crime after the commencement of trial, his due process rights are violated.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>247 Conn. 662, 681, 725 A.2d 316 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Section 14-12 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o motor vehicle shall be operated or towed on any highway, <em>except as otherwise expressly provided, </em>unless it is registered with the commissioner [of motor vehicles] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section \u00a7 14-12a (a) specifically governs the registration of commercial motor vehicles and requires the registration of a commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>vehicle if it is most frequently garaged in this state or if it most frequently travels in and out of the state in the normal course of its operations. \u201cWhere there are two provisions in a statute, one of which is general and designed to apply to cases generally, and the other is particular and relates to only one case or subject within the scope of a general provision, then the particular provision must prevail . . . and be treated as an exception to the general provision.\u201d <em>Budkofsky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor </em>Vehicles, 177 Conn. 588, 592, 419 A.2d 333 (1979). \u201c[Section] 14-12a is the controlling provision relating to the registration of commercial motor vehicles, notwithstanding the general registration requirement set forth in \u00a7 14-12 (a).\u201d Id., 593. Because \u00a7 14-12 (a) applies to the registration of motor vehicles generally and \u00a7 14-12a applies to the registration of commercial motor vehicles specifically, the defendant was not tried for an offense substantially different from the one with which he was originally charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Furthermore, the court may permit the prosecuting authority to amend the information and to charge a defendant with a different offense for good cause shown, even after trial has begun.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 36-18.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 624 [now \u00a7 36-18] is primarily a notice provision. Its purpose is to ensure that the defendant has adequate notice of the charges against which he must defend. ... It is the defendant\u2019s burden to provide a specific showing of prejudice resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the state\u2019s delay in providing notice of the charge against which [he] must defend.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>53 Conn. App. 606, 620, 733 A.2d 273 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In the present case, the state neglected to amend the information formally after the defendant had elicited the discrepancy between the ticket citation and the arresting officer\u2019s testimony as to the charge. Both parties proceeded on the basis of \u00a7 14-12a, and the court rendered judgment on that basis. The purpose of Practice Book \u00a7 36-18 is to put the defendant on notice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 620. It is clear from our review of the record, transcripts and exhibits that the defendant had actual notice of the offense with which he was charged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although we do not condone the state\u2019s failure to file a substitute information, to require it to do so in this case would be to exalt form over substance. See, e.g., <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 462-63, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990) (remanding for further proceedings where complaint varied from proof at trial and both parties fully litigated case on merits), on remand, 24 Conn. App. 377, 588 A.2d 656 (1991), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 222 Conn. 233, 610 A.2d 574 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Beliveau, </em>52 Conn. App. 475, 480, 727 A.2d 737 (where court fails to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1, but factual findings, legal conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>found in unsigned transcript, defect technical, claims reviewable), cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 235 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">If the court allows an amendment to the information to conform to the evidence, the decision of the court allowing the state to amend the information will be reversed only on a showing of an abuse of discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 620. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s discretion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 624 [now \u00a7 36-18] is limited only by the requirement that no additional or different offense may be charged in and no substantive rights of the defendant may be prejudiced by an amended information.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>supra, 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The defendant now argues that because the court allowed the state to proceed under \u00a7 14-12a, rather than \u00a7 14-12 (a), he was prejudiced. Specifically, the defendant claims that because he was not apprised of the charges against him, he was forced to \u201cattempt to mount a defense \u2018on the fly.\u2019 \u201d \u201cIn determining whether the defendant\u2019s rights were prejudiced, this court considers the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether the defendant was surprised by the changes and whether the defense was hampered. ... A bare assertion of prejudice is not sufficient to support a claim of prejudice. . . . The defendant must provide a specific showing of prejudice in order to establish that he was denied the right of due process of law . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The defendant has provided this court with nothing more than a bare assertion that he was prejudiced. Although he maintained throughout trial that he had no knowledge that the state would proceed under \u00a7 14-12a, it was the defendant who brought the mistake to the court\u2019s attention during his cross-examination of Valentukonis. The defendant questioned the very first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>witness regarding whether the vehicle was a \u201ccommercial motor vehicle,\u201d a term that does not appear in \u00a7 14-12 (a). In addition, some time prior to December 6, 1999, when trial resumed after a continuance that had been granted, the defendant obtained photographs of the garage that was the subject of Woods\u2019 testimony and used the photographs to cross-examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances involved, we cannot conclude that the defendant was surprised or that the defense was hampered. The defendant has failed to meet his burden to prove that he was prejudiced by the amendment, and, therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The defendant next argues that the state\u2019s enforcement of \u00a7 14-12a is an enforcement of a regulation specifically prohibited by federal law. Although it is difficult to ascertain exactly the argument that the defendant has presented to us,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in essence, he claims that the state is preempted from regulating charter bus services by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501 (Sup. 11995).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We decline, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>however, to review his claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u201c[I]t is the established policy of the Connecticut courts to be solicitous of pro se litigants and when it does not interfere with the rights of other parties to construe the rules of practice liberally in favor of the pro se party. . . . Although we allow pro se litigants some latitude, the right of self-representation provides no attendant license not to comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Macricostas </em>v. <em>Kovacs, </em>67 Conn. App. 130, 133, 787 A.2d 64 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The defendant has not presented this court with any legal authority or analysis beyond an assertion that \u00a7 14-12 (a) or \u00a7 14-12a is preempted by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501 (Sup. 11995). \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . We will not review claims absent law and analysis.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>67 Conn. App. 25, 27 n.2, 787 A.2d 43 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly permitted witnesses to testify and admitted into evidence documents, neither of which were disclosed to him prior to trial. Specifically, he argues that because the state did not comply with the court\u2019s disclosure order, the court should have prohibited the witnesses from testifying and refused to admit documents into evidence. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 40-5<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> gives broad discretion to the trial judge to fashion an appropriate remedy for noncompliance with discovery. . . . Generally, [t]he primary purpose of a sanction for violation of a discovery order is to ensure that the defendant\u2019s rights are protected, not to exact punishment on the state for its allegedly improper conduct. As we have indicated, the formulation of an appropriate sanction is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. ... In determining what sanction is appropriate for failure to comply with court ordered discovery, the trial court should consider the reason why disclosure was not made, the extent of prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>continuance, and any other relevant circumstances. . . . Suppression of relevant, material and otherwise admissible evidence is a severe sanction which should not be invoked lightly.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Respass, </em>256 Conn. 164, 186, 770 A.2d 471, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1002, 122 S. Ct. 478, 151 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The following additional procedural history is relevant to our resolution of these issues. On August 18, 1999, the court, <em>Robaina, J., </em>heard argument regarding the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure and examination. The defendant requested that the state disclose, inter alia, the \u201cnames and addresses of all witnesses whom the prosecuting authority intends to call at trial,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny and all . . . papers, photographs and/or documents . . . intended for use by the prosecuting authority as evidence at the Defendant\u2019s trial or which are material to preparation of the defense.\u201d The court granted the motion as to the list of witnesses, but denied the motion as to the latter request. At no time did the state comply with the court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On November 3, 1999, the court, <em>Miano, J., </em>began to hear evidence regarding this matter. When the court asked the defendant if he was ready to proceed, the defendant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The court first heard the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, but the defendant could not specify what information he wanted to have suppressed. Thereafter, the court informed the defendant that the burden was on him to object to the evidence presented and to state the grounds on which he was objecting. When the state called its first witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Valentukonis, the defendant objected.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court overruled the objection and allowed the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Thereafter, the state called Woods to testify. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to that witness as well and allowed the testimony. During the state\u2019s direct examination of Woods, the state proffered the defendant\u2019s application for a United States Department of Transportation number (application). The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the document and ordered a continuance for two weeks.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ber 6, 1999, after an additional continuance, the defendant\u2019s trial resumed. Again, the state proffered the application through Woods\u2019 testimony and the defendant objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Previously, during the hiatus on November 9, 1999, the defendant attempted to obtain the clerk\u2019s file, but was denied access. On November 10, 1999, the defendant filed a motion for compliance, but the court never received the motion. During the trial, on December 6, 1999, attorney Michael Dannehy of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>office testified that the defendant had come to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to retrieve documents from the file, but he was unaware that the defendant was entitled to review the entire file. Dannehy also testified that he offered to forward the documents via facsimile transmission, but the defendant never provided a facsimile telephone number. The defendant declined to testify regarding the matter. The court then took a thirty minute recess to enable the defendant to review the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The defendant claims that the court should have barred the testimony and refused to admit into evidence the documents because the state was in direct violation of a previous court order.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court did, however, sanction the state for noncompliance with the disclosure order. First, the court continued the matter for almost one month for the defendant to obtain the records, which were in the clerk\u2019s file. The court also recessed when it was informed that the defendant had not yet been given the documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Although we recognize that the use of an open file policy is not a substitute for disclosure; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 453 n.19, 758 A.2d 824 (2000); the defendant was not prejudiced by the nondisclosure. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Respass, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 186. The defendant was fully prepared to cross-examine both of the state\u2019s witnesses and offered his own witness to support his defense. See part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Although the state\u2019s failure to disclose the previously mentioned information is inexcusable, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by electing to continue the matter and, later, by ordering a recess rather than by precluding the testimony and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for failure to register a motor vehicle in Connecticut. Specifically, he argues that the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that (1) the subject vehicle was most frequently garaged in Connecticut, (2) the defendant was the owner-operator of the vehicle and (3) the subject vehicle was a \u201ccommercial motor vehicle.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Each of the defendant\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence is founded on the court\u2019s factual findings. Therefore, the proper standard of review is whether, on the basis of the evidence, the court\u2019s finding that the defendant was the owner-operator of a commercial motor vehicle that was garaged most frequently in Connecticut was clearly erroneous. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Trot-man, </em>68 Conn. App. 437, 441, 791 A.2d 700 (2002). \u201c[A] court\u2019s finding of fact is clearly erroneous and its conclusions drawn from that finding lack sufficiency when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Furthermore, when a defendant is tried to the court, \u201cthe trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. . . . Where there is conflicting evidence . . . we do not retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. . . . The probative force of conflict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ing evidence is for the trier to determine.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The defendant was convicted of failure to register a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 14-12a. To prove its case, the state had to first prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the vehicle was eligible for commercial registration as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, the state had to prove that the vehicle either is most frequently garaged in Connecticut or most frequently leaves from and returns to one or more points within this state in the normal course of operations. In the case of an \u201cowner-operator,\u201d registration is required only if the \u201cowner-operator\u201d is engaged in activities directly related to physical movement of the vehicle. Therefore, the state must also prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was the \u201cowner-operator\u201d of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The defendant first challenges the court\u2019s finding that the vehicle was garaged most frequently in Connecticut. He claims that the \u201cstate attempted to advance this claim based upon two elements: (1) a bus of the company had been seen irregularly at Tweed-New Haven Airport, and (2) a bus of the company had been seen precisely once located at a local bus yard.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim. Woods testified that while he was investigating various complaints that the vehicle was operating in Connecticut, but not registered in Connecticut, he located the vehicle parked at a garage in East Haven on May 6, 1999. In addition, Woods testified that he interviewed various witnesses at Tweed-New Haven Airport who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>had seen the bus at the airport in the past few years. A Flying Dutchman Motorcoaches brochure (brochure) representing that the company is \u201cbased at Tweed-New Haven Field\u201d and serves airlines in Connecticut also was admitted into evidence. The brochure directs inquiries to 300 Main Street, P.O. Box 120282, East Haven, Connecticut, and provides a Connecticut telephone number. In addition, a letter written on Flying Dutchman Motorcoaches\u2019 letterhead and bearing the same address as the brochure, from Jan Van Eck<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to the United States Department of Transportation was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">After finding the state\u2019s witnesses to be credible, the court concluded \u201cfrom the facts proven and the reasonable and logical inferences to be drawn from those facts that the state has proven that the subject motor vehicle was \u2018most frequently\u2019 housed/garaged in the state of Connecticut for the last several years up to and including the day of the stop of the vehicle on May 19, 1999.\u201d On the basis of the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The defendant next argues that the court improperly found that he was the owner-operator of the bus. The defendant argues that because the state did not offer a document of ownership or the registration of the vehicle, there was no evidence that he was the owner. Furthermore, he argues that in a separate proceeding, the court made a conclusive finding that he was not the owner of the vehicle.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s claims. Valentukonis testified that United States Department of Transportation number 652814 was depicted on the side of the vehicle. On the basis of that number, Valentukonis testified that the main office of operation registered with the federal government was Jan Van Eck, doing business as \u201cFlying Dutchman Motorcoaches,\u201d 300 Main Street, East Haven, Connecticut. In addition, a \u201cMotor Carrier Identification Report\u201d (report) completed by Jan Van Eck and containing the same information was admitted into evidence. The report was sent to the Federal Highway Administration office in Glastonbury via facsimile transmission to a Connecticut telephone facsimile number. The vehicle was, however, registered in Delaware and had Delaware license plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The court found that \u201cthe defendant, based on all the evidence, including but not limited to state\u2019s exhibit one,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> had the legal authority to register the vehicle. Accordingly, the state has proven that the defendant is an \u2018owner\u2019 under the statute.\u201d The defendant argues that the state did not prove that he was the owner because no documentation specifically proving ownership, i.e., certificate of title or registration, was offered into evidence. An owner is \u201cany person holding title to a motor vehicle, or <em>having the legal right to register the same, </em>including purchasers under conditional bills of sale . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (a) (56).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The defendant has offered no law or analysis supporting his claim that the court improperly made the factual finding, from the evidence presented, that he was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>person \u201chaving the legal right to register\u201d the vehicle. Again, we are mindful that the defendant has exercised his right to represent himself in this matter, and we are mindful of this court\u2019s policy to give latitude in such cases. The right to self-representation, however, does not give a pro se litigant free rein to ignore our rules of practice. See <em>Macricostas </em>v. <em>Kovacs, </em>supra, 67 Conn. App. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The defendant next argues that the court improperly found that the vehicle was a \u201ccommercial motor vehicle.\u201d Specifically, he argues that because there was no credible evidence before the court that the vehicle weighed more than 26,001 pounds, the state did not prove both that the vehicle weighed more than 26,001 pounds and was designed to transport sixteen or more passengers within the meaning of \u00a7 14-1 (a) (11).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Although the court did analyze whether the vehicle was a \u201ccommercial motor vehicle,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the proper inquiry was whether the vehicle was \u201celigible for commercial registration as defined in section 14-1.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>mindful [however] of our authority to affirm a judgment of a trial court on a dispositive alternate ground for which there is support in the trial court record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>67 Conn. App. 634, 639, 789 A.2d 496 (2002); see also <em>Hoskins </em>v. <em>Titan Value Equities Group, Inc., </em>252 Conn. 789, 794, 749 A.2d 1144 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12), a vehicle is eligible for commercial registration if it is designed or used to transport persons in connection with any business enterprise. The court made the factual finding that \u201cthe subject vehicle was equipped and designed to transport sixteen or more passengers, including the driver.\u201d Therefore, there is support in the record that the vehicle was designed and equipped to transport persons. Furthermore, it was undisputed that the vehicle was used to transport passengers for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion that the subject vehicle was equipped and designed to transport persons. In addition, it was undisputed that the vehicle was used in connection with a business enterprise. Accordingly, we conclude that the state proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the vehicle was eligible for commercial registration as defined in \u00a7 14-1 and that it was not registered in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-12a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any motor vehicle eligible for commercial registration as defined in section 14-1, unless exempted under the provisions of section 14-34, shall be registered in this state if: (1) It is most frequently garaged in this state, or, if not garaged at any fixed location, most frequently leaves from and returns to one or more points within this state in the normal course of operations.

During cross-examination of Valentukonis, the defendant attempted to argue that <em>Budkofsky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 588, is analogous and controls this case. He argued that because the owner of an unregistered Mack truck in <em>Budkofsky, </em>having been charged with violating General Statutes \u00a7 14-12 (a), was found not to be in violation of \u00a7 14-12a, the defendant in this case also was not in violation of \u00a7 14-12a. Regardless of whether that argument was appropriate during the examination of a witness, it is enlightening.

It appears that the court treated Herman Van Eck as Jan Van Eck throughout the proceedings. The defendant has presented nothing to this court, in his brief or during oral argument, disputing that identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> In furtherance of Ms claim, the defendant argues that the court improperly found that only one of the criteria for which General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (a) (11) provides must be proven by the state because there is \u201cno disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 [in the statute]. There is merely a colon.\u201d That claim is without merit because \u00a7 14-1 (a) (11) clearly contains the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between subsection (B) and subsection (C). Therefore, the state had the burden to prove either one or the other. The defendant does not dispute the court\u2019s finding that the vehicle was designed to transport sixteen or more passengers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> A \u201ccommercial motor vehicle\u201d is \u201ca vehicle designed or used to transport passengers or property . . . which (A) has a gross vehicle weight rating of twenty-six thousand and one pounds or more; (B) is designed to transport sixteen or more passengers, including the driver . . .
