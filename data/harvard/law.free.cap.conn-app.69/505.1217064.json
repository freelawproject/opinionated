On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to provide the jury with a definition of the term \u201cdrug dependency\u201d in its instructions to the jury, thereby committing plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The defendant did not testify at trial but advanced alternative theories of defense, one of which was that he had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that he was a drug-dependent person as contemplated by \u00a7 21a-278 (b). The court, in its final instructions to the jury, defined the essential elements of the crime of sale of cocaine by a person who is not drug-dependent and the defendant\u2019s burden of proving drug dependency by a preponderance of the evidence. The instruction also defined what such a burden meant. The court further instructed that if the jury found \u201cthat the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of the offense, and the defendant has failed to prove drug dependency by a preponderance of the evidence, you shall find the defendant guilty. If you unanimously find that the state has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the offense, or that the defendant has proven drug dependency by a preponderance of the evidence, you shall find the defendant not guilty of a violation of [the statute].\u201d The court also instructed the jury that if it found the defendant not guilty under \u00a7 21a-278 (b), it could consider the lesser offense under General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-277 (a). The trial court never defined \u201cdrug dependency\u201d either by reading the statutory definition or by providing a diagnostic definition. See General Statutes \u00a7 2la-240 (18) and (19).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">This appeal is controlled by <em>State </em>v. Marrero, 66 Conn. App. 709, 785 A.2d 1198 (2001). We hold that the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury as to drug dependency in accordance with the term\u2019s statutory definition or otherwise constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-12\"> The defendant admits that this claim is unpreserved and, during oral argument, withdrew his claim of review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), conceding that the error claimed was nonconstitutional in dimension. We review the claim under the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
