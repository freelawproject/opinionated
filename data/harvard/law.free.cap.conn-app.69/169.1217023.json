App. 187, 793 A.2d 1204 (2002), Tadeo Polanco, one of two codefendants, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of possession of cocaine with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> possession of cocaine with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a school in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and interfering with a search in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-33d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of the cocaine charges and, therefore, the court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal, and (2) the court improperly admitted into evidence a computer generated map showing that the location where he and the cocaine had been seized was within 1500 feet of a school. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On March 29, 2000, the state charged the defendant, by substitute information, as follows: count one, possession of cocaine with intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (a); count two, possession of cocaine with intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (a); count three, possession of cocaine with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a school in violation of \u00a7 21a-278a (b); count four, possession of cocaine with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a school in violation of \u00a7 21a-278a (b); and count five, interfering with a search in violation of \u00a7 54-33d. The defendant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the five charges and elected a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">On the basis of the evidence admitted during the defendant\u2019s trial, the jury reasonably could have found the facts that follow. On June 4,1999, at approximately noon, Robert Cizauskas and Stephen Hunt, officers in the Waterbury police department, traveled in an unmarked police vehicle to the vicinity of 133 Hillside Avenue, Waterbury. Upon arriving, Cizauskas and Hunt began conducting \u201cpreraid surveillance\u201d in preparation for the execution of a search warrant, the scope of which included 133 Hillside Avenue, apartment 2A. At approximately 12:45 p.m., the officers saw the defendant and his codefendant, Herman Diaz, exit the build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ing. The defendant was carrying a black plastic bag, and Diaz was carrying a light colored plastic bag. The two men walked across the street and entered a parked, tan Oldsmobile. A few minutes later, the defendant and Diaz exited the Oldsmobile, crossed the street and returned to the building. Neither was carrying either of the plastic bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Fifteen minutes later, the Waterbury police officers who had been assigned to execute the warrant arrived at the scene. Two of them, Lawrence Smith and Robert Jones, entered the building and located apartment 2A. Smith knocked on the front door and announced, \u201cPolice with search warrant.\u201d Smith and Jones both heard noises and voices emanating from the apartment, but no one answered the door. Smith knocked and announced his presence again, but still no one answered. Finally, Jones, using force, gained entry to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Immediately upon entering the apartment, Jones saw the defendant running directly at him and heard him yelling, \u201cPolicia, policia!\u201d The defendant collided with Jones and grabbed Jones\u2019 vest. Both fell to the floor and began wrestling. Moments later, Jones subdued and handcuffed the defendant. Smith, who had begun conducting a protective sweep of the apartment, saw Diaz running from the front bedroom. Smith detained him. No one else was found in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The police then searched the apartment, which was sparsely furnished and contained few personal belongings. In the front bedroom, Jones removed one of the ceiling panels, revealing eight plastic bags wrapped in paper towels. Each plastic bag contained crack cocaine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While searching the closet in the middle bedroom, Smith discovered $580 in the pocket of a coat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Timothy Kluntz, a Waterbury police detective, searched the kitchen. There, he discovered a metal pot containing cocaine residue and several other items commonly associated with the production of crack cocaine, including a box of plastic bags, two opened boxes of baking soda, paper towels and a strainer. In a cluster on the kitchen counter, Kluntz found Diaz\u2019s social security card, Diaz\u2019s alien registration card and a sheet of paper listing certain drug sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The officers then searched the defendant and Diaz. On each of them, the officers found a key that fit the door to the apartment. The officers did not find any items commonly associated with the use of cocaine in the apartment or on the person of either the defendant or Diaz. Afterward, the officers transported the defendant and Diaz to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The state brought counts two and four against the defendant in response to the crack cocaine that the police had discovered in the ceiling of the apartment. The state brought the first and third counts against the defendant in response to allegations by the police that they later discovered crack and powder cocaine in the tan Oldsmobile parked across the street from the apartment. The fifth count was brought in response to the collision and scuffle that the defendant had caused with Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">On April 12, 2000, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to counts two, four and five, but remained deadlocked on counts one and three. The court declared a mistrial on counts one and three, accepted the verdict on counts two, four and five, and rendered judgment accordingly. The defendant later was sentenced to a total effective term of twenty-four years imprisonment. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be presented as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on the cocaine charges and, therefore, the court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Specifically, the defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he had possessed the crack cocaine that was seized from the apartment. In furtherance of that argument, the defendant claims that the evidence provides greater support for the conclusion that Diaz exclusively possessed the apartment and the cocaine, and that the defendant was an innocent, confused bystander.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. ... As we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 224-25, 733 A.2d 156 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u201cIn order to prove illegal possession of a narcotic substance, it is necessary to establish that the defendant knew the character of the substance, knew of its presence and exercised dominion and control over it. . . . Where, as here, the cocaine was not found on the defendant\u2019s person, the state must proceed on the theory of constructive possession, that is, possession without direct physical contact. . . . One factor that may be considered in determining whether a defendant is in constructive possession of narcotics is whether he is in possession of the premises where the narcotics are found. . . . Where the defendant is not in exclusive possession of the premises where the narcotics are found, it may not be inferred that [the defendant] knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control of them, unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In the present case, the state did not claim that the defendant was in exclusive possession of the apartment where the crack cocaine was found. Consequently, the jury could not have reasonably concluded that the defendant had constructively possessed the crack cocaine, namely, that he had known of its presence and had control over it, \u201cunless there [were] other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We conclude that there were other incriminating circumstances from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant had constructively possessed the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">During the trial, the state called Domingo Toro, the superintendent of the apartment building, as a witness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Toro testified as follows. In the month preceding the raid, Diaz leased the apartment and paid $800 for rent and a security deposit. After Diaz moved in, Toro visited Diaz in the apartment and saw that it still was unfurnished except for a little table and a television. Thereafter, he lent Diaz a couch and later observed the defendant help Diaz move that couch into the apartment. Afterward, Diaz informed him that he and the defendant were friends and that the defendant, too, would be living in the apartment. The state also called Kluntz and Cizauskas. Kluntz testified that while searching the defendant, he found and seized a key from the defendant\u2019s person, and that key fit the door to the apartment. Cizauskas testified as follows. While surveilling the apartment in preparation for the search, he saw the defendant and Diaz leave the apartment and return to it. Furthermore, the state presented police testimony indicating that the apartment contained two mattresses, one in each bedroom. When the foregoing evidence is construed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, it establishes that the defendant shared possession of the apartment with Diaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The state presented the following evidence linking the defendant to the crack cocaine found in the apartment. Prior to gaining entry into the apartment, Smith knocked and announced twice, each time yelling, \u201cPolice with a search warrant!\u201d Jones heard noises and voices emanating from the apartment, but no one answered the door. After gaining entry by using force, Jones immediately saw the defendant running directly at him and heard him yelling, \u201cPolicia, policia!\u201d The defendant collided with him and grabbed his vest.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">After securing the apartment, the police searched it thoroughly. No one other than the defendant and Diaz were found in the apartment, which was sparsely furnished and contained few personal belongings. On the kitchen counter, Kluntz found and seized plastic bags, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>open boxes of baking soda, paper towels, a strainer, a sheet of paper listing drug sales and a metal pot containing cocaine residue. In the ceiling of the front bedroom, Jones discovered $8000 worth of crack cocaine packaged in eight plastic bags, which, in turn, were wrapped in paper towels. While searching the closet in the middle bedroom, Smith discovered $580 in the pocket of a coat. To access either of the bedrooms, one first had to pass through the kitchen. Michael Gugliotti, a sergeant in the Waterbury police department, testified that the items found on the kitchen counter were \u201cconsistent with an individual that would convert a powder cocaine into crack cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">When the foregoing evidence is construed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, it supports the following factual findings. The apartment primarily was used to produce and store crack cocaine. Powder cocaine was converted to crack cocaine in the kitchen, and that crack cocaine then was stored in the ceiling of the front bedroom. The proceeds from the sales of the crack cocaine generally were kept in a coat, which was stored in the closet of the middle bedroom. When the defendant yelled, \u201cPolicia, polic\u00eda,\u201d and charged at Jones, he was attempting to prevent him and other police officers from searching the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Those findings establish the existence of additional incriminating circumstances that buttress an inference that the defendant knew of, and had control over, the crack cocaine. The evidence was adequate to support a finding that the defendant had constructively possessed the crack cocaine. Thus, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction on the cocaine charges and that the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Next, the defendant claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence a computer generated map showing that the distance between the apartment at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>133 Hillside Avenue and the nearest school was less than 1500 feet. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly admitted the map under the business records exception to the hearsay rule because (1) the sole witness through whom the state had attempted to lay an adequate foundation (a) did not prepare the map and (b) lacked sufficient knowledge concerning the technology that had been used to generate the map, and (2) the state had failed to establish that the technology that had been used, namely, a global positioning satellite system, an aerial photography system and a computer program, was reliable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The following additional procedural history is relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. During its case-in-chief, the state offered, as a full exhibit, a computer generated map showing that the distance between the apartment at 133 Hillside Avenue and the nearest school was less than 1500 feet. Recognizing that the map was hearsay, the state requested that the court admit the map pursuant to either the business records or public records exception to the hearsay rule. The defendant and Diaz each raised several objections in response. The following objections were raised: (1) the requirements for admission under the business records exception had not been satisfied; (2) the state had not laid an adequate foundation \u201cas to the accuracy of the map and where the information on the map comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>from\u201d; (3) during its offer of proof, the state failed to establish that the technology that had been used to generate the map was rehable; and (4) the map had been prepared by the city of Waterbury for purposes of litigation and, therefore, could not be admitted under the public records exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The court overruled those objections and admitted the map into evidence under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. In so doing, the court stated: \u201c[T]his map is being offered by the state for the sole purpose of presenting evidence to support the state\u2019s contention that 133 Hillside Avenue, apartment 2A, is within 1500 feet of a school district, in particular to the Driggs School. This exhibit is admitted solely for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The record discloses that the state, during its offer of proof, presented evidence in response to the objections raised by the defendant and Diaz. Specifically, the state called Steven Santovasi, a geographic information systems technician, as a witness. Santovasi testified as follows. He was employed by the city of Waterbury bureau of engineering for sixteen years. His daily responsibilities included maintaining maps of Waterbury for use by various municipal departments and administering a system \u201cthat contain[ed] the locations of everything within the city.\u201d In response to a request by the office of the state\u2019s attorney, he prepared a map of Waterbury for the present case showing Driggs School, a radius of 1500 feet around that school and 133 Hillside Avenue. He identified state\u2019s exhibit eighteen as the map he had produced pursuant to that request, and stated that it fairly and accurately represented the area as it appeared on June 4,1999, and that he had prepared it approximately one month before trial in the regular course of his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Santovasi generated the map using the computer system he administered. He did not simply \u201cprint it out.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Due to Waterbury\u2019s large area, the computerized map consists of 799 small maps (grids) that are stored in a digital library. Those grids can be assembled in various ways. Santovasi assembled state\u2019s exhibit eighteen using several contiguous grids that corresponded to the area in which the state had expressed interest. After assembling the grids, he \u201ccreated a circle 1500 feet around the center point of the school.\u201d He blackened the school and generated a rectangle around 133 Llillside Avenue. The map merely shows a relative distance, as it does not indicate the specific distance between Driggs School and 133 Hillside Avenue. The map was generated using data relied on by Waterbury for utility information, zone information and soil information.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The underlying system that was used to produce the map included control points that had been established throughout Waterbuiy, the location of which had been identified accurately through the use of global positioning satellites. Aerial photographs were then taken and a method known as triangulation was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">We now set forth the legal principles that govern our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim that the map failed to qualify for admission under the business records exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u201cA trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference and will be overturned only if a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion is shown and the defendant shows that the ruling caused substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 804 n.23, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998). An appellate tribunal is required to make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling. Id., citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 801, 709 A.2d 522 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\u201cTo be admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule, a trial court judge must find that the record satisfies each of the three conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>set forth in. . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-180.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court must determine, before concluding that it is admissible, that the record was made in the regular course of business, that it was the regular course of such business to make such a record, and that it was made at the time of the act described in the report, or within a reasonable time thereafter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ... In applying the business records exception, the statute [\u00a7 52-180] should be liberally interpreted. ... In part, this is because the statute recognizes the inherent trustworthiness of documents created for business rather than litigation purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Calcano </em>v. <em>Calcano, </em>257 Conn. 230, 240-41, 777 A.2d 633 (2001); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cOnce these criteria have been met by the party seeking to introduce the record, however, it does not necessarily follow that the record itself is generally admissible, nor does it mean that everything in it is required to be admitted into evidence. . . . [T]he information contained in the report must be based on the entrant\u2019s own observation or on information of others whose business duty it was to transmit it to the entrant. ... If the information does not have such a basis, it adds another level of hearsay to the report which necessitates a separate exception to the hearsay rule in order to justify its admission.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Berger, supra, 249 Conn. 231; see Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-4 commentary. That requirement aids in ensuring that exhibits admitted under the business records exception satisfy a minimum threshold of reliability. See <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>179 Conn. 349, 358, 426 A.2d 305 (1979). Nevertheless, an exhibit admitted under the business records exception is not presumed to be accurate, and its credibility remains a question for the trier of fact. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In the present case, two of the three arguments advanced by the defendant on appeal actually relate more directly to the legal principles that control the admissibility of computer generated exhibits. The defendant challenges the admission of the computer generated map on three grounds: (1) the witness, Santovasi, did not prepare the map himself, (2) Santovasi lacked sufficient knowledge concerning the technology that had been used to generate the map and (3) the state failed to establish that the technology that had been used was reliable. The second and third grounds implicate the manner in which our courts are confronting the increased prevalence of computer generated exhibits in the courtroom. Cf. id., 357-61; <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>55 Conn. App. 369, 376,</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>739 A.2d 301, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 927, 742 A.2d 362 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Computer generated exhibits present \u201cstructural questions of reliability that transcend the reliability of the underlying information that is entered into the computer.\u201d <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 358. To accommodate that heightened concern, a court is not permitted to admit a computer generated exhibit into evidence unless the proffering party also (1) presents a witness whose knowledge of computers is sufficient to enable direct and cross-examination concerning the process used to generate the exhibit and (2) lays a foundation, through that witness, sufficient to support a finding that the process and equipment involved in generating the exhibit were adequate for that purpose. See id., <em>359-60) Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 376 (in addition to satisfying requirements of business records exception, party proffering computer record must establish that basic elements of computer system are reliable). With that two part test in mind also, we now address the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The defendant first claims that Santovasi did not prepare the map himself. To the contrary, the evidence indicates that he, in fact, generated the map using data maintained by the city of Waterbury in its computers. In <em>River Dock &amp; Pile, Inc. </em>v. O <em>&amp; G Industries, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 787, 794, 595 A.2d 839 (1991), our Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe witness whose testimony provides the foundation for the admission of a business record must testify to the three statutory requirements, but it is not necessary that the record sought to be admitted was made by that witness or even that the witness have been employed by the business at the time the record was made.\u201d Thus, Santovasi did not even have to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>pare the map to be eligible to provide the foundation for its admission into evidence under the business records exception. See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (b); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The defendant next argues that Santovasi, the sole witness through whom the state had attempted to lay a proper foundation, lacked sufficient knowledge concerning the technology that had been used to generate the map.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In addressing a similar challenge, our Supreme Court provided the following additional guidance for use when considering whether a witness had sufficient knowledge of computers to be capable of affording a threshold degree of reliability to an exhibit that had been computer generated: \u201cWhat is crucial is not the witness\u2019 job description but rather his knowledgeability about the basic elements that afford reliability to computer printouts. . . . The witness must be a person who is familiar- with computerized records not only as a user but also as someone with some working acquaintance with the methods by which such records are made.\u201d (Citation omitted.) American <em>Oil Co. </em>v. Valenti, supra, 179 Conn. 360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The record in the present case discloses that Santovasi was thoroughly familiar with computer generated maps and had considerable working knowledge of the methods used to generate them. Santovasi also was well acquainted with the technology involved in collecting and compiling the data a computer uses when generating a map. He therefore had knowledge sufficient to allow for meaningful direct and cross-examination concerning computer generated maps. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Santovasi was capable of affording a threshold degree of reliability to the map <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and, accordingly, reject the defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that the state, in attempting to lay a proper foundation, failed to establish that the technology that had been used to generate the map, namely, a global positioning satellite system, an aerial photography system and a computer program, was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The record discloses that Santovasi testified that the map fairly and accurately depicted the section of Waterbury at issue as that section had appeared on June 4, 1999. Santovasi testified also that the control points on which the city\u2019s computer system relied had been identified accurately through the use of global positioning satellites. That testimony, together with Santovasi\u2019s detailed description of the city\u2019s computer system, which he himself administered, gave rise to an inference that the hardware and software used to generate the map were not only adequate for that purpose but also had been designed for that purpose. Thus, through Santovasi, the state succeeded in laying a foundation sufficient to support a finding that the process and equipment involved in generating the map were adequate for that purpose. More specific testimony concerning the underlying technology was unnecessary, and any remaining doubt as to the reliability of that technology went to the weight to be given the map, not its admissibility. Therefore, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the map into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances containing an aggregate weight of one ounce ormore of heroin, methadone or cocaine or an aggregate weight of one-half gram or more of cocaine in a free-base form or a substance containing five milligrams or more of lysergic acid diethylamide, except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not, at the time of such action, a drug-dependent person, shall be imprisoned for a minimum term of not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and, a maximum term of life imprisonment. . .\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who violates section 21a-277 or 21a-278 by manufacturing, distributing, selling, prescribing, dispensing, compounding, transporting with the intent to sell or dispense, possessing with the intent to sell or dispense, offering, giving or administering to another person any controlled substance in or on, or within one thousand five hundred feet of, the real property comprising a public or private elementary or secondary school, a public housing project or a licensed child day care center, as defined in section 19a-77, that is identified as a child day care center by a sign posted in a conspicuous place shall be imprisoned for a term of three years, which shall not be suspended and shall be in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for violation of section 21a-277 or 21a-278.
