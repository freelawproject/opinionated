Said Mix does not agree to take only such as may be at his option, but all and any that he does take will be at the appraisement of William Douglass, of Middletown, and Sylvester Colburn, of Birmingham ; if said Douglass and Colburn cannot agree upon the appraisement of any of the articles, they are to select the third person and he shall agree with them in price of said property. If the property that said Mix does take is not sufficient to pay his claims, and others that he does assume, then he is to take as much of said property as will make up the amount, after collecting what claims he chooses for work that has been done under the mortgages, besides the claim of G. W. Phipps &amp; Co., and James Clark, both of New Haven. It is further agreed that the said Harvey shall give up all right, title and interest to said shop, and shall cease to work only at the option of said Mix, and to remove all and every kind of articles that will not belong to said Mix, but said Mix shall accommodate said Harvey, and use his best endeavors to have all transactions between said parties fair and honorable, and that all settlement between said Harvey and Mix shall be settled without any delay. Mix agrees to take the blacksmith shop and tools therein, all the machines, tools in use, foundry tools and fixtures.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">It was not denied that an inventory was taken, pursuant to said agreement, and by the appraisers therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>named, of the property then in the hands of said Mix as aforesaid, which inventory amounted in the aggregate to the sum of $10,836.53, that said Mix thereupon charged himself and credited said firm on his books with the amount of said inventory ; that said firm of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., discontinued business, and were discharged by said Mix and ceased to labor for him, or have anything to do with said property, and said Mix assumed, and had the entire possession and control of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">The plaintiff' claimed to have proved that this agreement, of December 10th, 1851, was ancillary to the prior instrument of September 1st, and designed to be in furtherance of the objects of said original instrument, and was solely to provide for the continued possession of said property by the defendant, with the same rights and the same obligations as were imposed upon all the grantees, by the aforesaid instrument of Sept. 1st; that nothing was done, under or by virtue of said agreement, to change, or in any way affect the possession of said property by the defendant, as it continued to be ever since he received it from Peck &amp; Harrison as aforesaid, and that the defendant, in fact, continued in possession of said property, under said instrument of Sept. 1st, 1851, until after the 8th day of May, 1852, when he was copied in the original suit of the plaintiff-against Harvey, Need-ham, Root &amp; Co., which was denied by the defendant, who claimed to have proved that the same had been applied in payment of the indebtedness of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., to the defendant, prior to the 8th day of May, 1852. But it was admitted that on the 16th day of March, 1852, the grantees, in said instrument of Sept. 1st, other than the defendant, namely, John Bromham, Lewis B. Judson, and Peck, and Harrison, executed and delivered to the defendant, an assignment of all their interest as mortgagees in the property conveyed to them by Harvey, Needham &amp; Co. And the defendant claimed to have proved that the consideration for said assignment to the defendant, was the assumption by him of the debts therein mentioned, which debts were, in the case of John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Bromham, the same as that described in the condition of the instrument of Sept. 1st, 1851; and in the case of Lewis B. Judson for the amount, (about $213) due to him by Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., at the time of the execution of the instrument of Sept. 1st., and the balance for cash advanced, and materials furnished, by said Judson in the prosecution of the work, since said 1st of September; and, in the case of Peck &amp; Harrison, for the amount of the balance due them upon their account with said property in their agency as aforesaid ; and these debts, the defendant claimed to have proved, he did, in fact, upon the delivery of said assignment to him, assume, by giving his notes to said Bromham, Judson and Peck and Harrison, at three and four months, for the amount of their respective claims as aforesaid, which notes were subsequently, and on maturity, paid by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">The defendant further claimed to have proved,thatthe value of the property which came into his hands as aforesaid, and which, or the avails of such portion thereof as had been disposed of, remained in his hands, and which he claimed had all been applied in part payment only of his indebtedness aforesaid, when he was copied in the writ of the plaintiff against said Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., as aforesaid, was less than the amount of the claims held by him as aforesaid, and that after charging himself with said property and avails, and crediting himself with all his individual claims against the same, including his charges for cash and materials advanced in the prosecution of the work under the instrument of Sept. 1st, 1851, and the debts assumed by him as aforesaid, at the time he was copied, there was left a balance, in his favor, of $31.31.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">It was admitted that the plaintiff was a creditor of said Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., at the time of their execution of the instrument of Sept. 1st, on account of services as a workman in their establishment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">Thereupon the plaintiff claimed that the court should charge the jury that, if they found the facts as the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>claimed them to have been proved as aforesaid, said instrument of the 1st of September, 1851, was fraudulent in law, and utterly void as to creditors, and that it was so. 1. By the original act against fraudulent conveyances, and 2. By the additional act of 1828. And that if they found the instrument of 10th Dec., 1851, to have been ancillary to the instrument of Sept. 1st, 1851 aforesaid, and in furtherance of the same, that it would not relieve the said instrument, of Sept. 1st, 1851, from its original infirmity and illegality\u2014 and that if any of the property, assigned to the defendant by the instrument of Sept. 1st, 1851, over and beyond what had been covered by prior mortgages, was in the hands of the defendant on the day when he was copied in the original suit, that such property was holden to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s judgment recovered against said Harvey, Need-ham, Root &amp; Co., on which judgment the present <em>scire facias </em>against the defendant was founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">And the plaintiff further claimed that the court should charge the jury, that such would be the case, though they should also find that the defendant, prior to his having been copied as aforesaid, had advanced money and materials in the prosecution of the business authorized by said instrument of Sept. 1st, and had assumed debts due by said Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., as aforesaid, to an amount, including his own claims against said firm, greater than the value of the property received by him, under said instrument of Sept. 1st.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">But the defendant claimed if the jury should find that the aforesaid claims of the defendant and of said Bromham, Judson, and Peck, and Harrison, respectively against said estate, were <em>bona fide </em>claims, and that he had assumed the payment of them, and applied the property in payment thereof, and that they amounted in the aggregate to more than the property in his hands, as aforesaid, when he was copied by the plaintiff, that no part of the property, so held by him, was liable to respond to the plaintiff, but that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>a right to apply the same upon such indebtedness, in discharge thereof, to the extent of its value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\">And the defendant further claimed, that [said instrument of Sept. 1st, 1851, and said instrument of Dec. 10th, were good and valid instruments, not only as between the parties, but as against the creditors of the said firm of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., and that the court should charge the jury, pursuant to his claims as aforesaid, if the jury should find that the same were made without any fraudulent intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">The court thereupon charged the jury that said instrument of the 1st of September, 1851, if made by Harvey, Need-ham &amp; Co., with a view to their insolvency, and while in failing circumstances, was void as against creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">And in respect to the other claims of the parties, the court submitted to the jury the questions, whether there was any fraud, in fact; whether the defendant Mix obtained or retained possession of the property, with any fraudulent intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., or whether he so obtained, and retained, possession under the agreements of Sept. 1st, and Dec. 10th, in good faith, and for the purposes therein specified; and also the question whether the \u25a0 agreement of Dec. 10th was the act of the firm and binding on them; and thereupon charged them further as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">For the purposes of this case, I instruct you that if you shall find that there was no fraud in fact, and that the defendant, on the 8th day of May, 1852, when the copy was left in service, had in his possession no other property than such as he has admitted by his account, and had prior to that time, under and pursuant to the trust deed of Sept. 1st, 1851, or the ancillary agreement of Dec. 10, 1851, (if you shall find the last agreement to be the act of the firm,) paid expenses incurred, and debts due from said firm thereby provided for, to an amount, which, including the <em>bona fide </em>claims of the defendant against said firm, equalled the property, or avails of property, received from them under said agreement then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>in his hands, he is not liable, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action, and your verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">The plaintiff, upon the trial, offered to prove that when the defendant was copied in the original suit by him against Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., the defendant had in his hands, concealed so that the same could not be attached, property belonging to Hosea B. Harvey, one of the said co-partnership of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co.; but to this the defendant objected, upon the ground that the defendant was not described, either in the original process, or in the <em>scire facias </em>as the debtor of said Hosea B. Harvey, or as having his goods or effects in his hands, but was only described both in the original process and in the <em>scire facias, </em>as the debtor of the copartnership of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., and as having in his hands the goods or effects of said copartnership. And the court sustained the objection and excluded the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">The jury, having rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-7\"><em>R. 1. Sf G. R. Ingersoll, </em>in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-8\"><em>First, </em>As against the plaintiff, a creditor of Harvey, Need-ham, Root &amp; Co., at the time of its execution, the instrument of September 21, 1851, was fraudulent and utterly void, and the parties to it could derive no special benefit from its provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-9\">I. It was thus fraudulent and utterly void, by force of the statute of 1828, relating to fraudulent conveyances. Rev. Stat., 507.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-10\">It appears upon its face to have been executed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-11\">1. By a party \u201c in failing circumstances with a view to insolvency.\u201d 2. And not for the benefit of \u201c all their creditors, in proportion to their respective claims,\u201d and 3. For the purpose of creating \u201c a trust\u201d for a portion of their creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The four vendees are jointly constituted trustees, not only to pay certain debts of <em>\u201c </em>individuals other than the vendees,\u201d as attaching creditors, workmen and others, whose claims \u201c said vendees may deem it prudent and proper to settle,\u201d but they are also made, jointly, trustees for each other severally, in the order specified; a species of trust which has recently been under review in this court, and distinctly decided to be in violation of the statute of 1828. <em>Goodell </em>v. Williams, 21 Conn. R., 419.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-5\">II. This infirmity of the instrument is not relieved by the condition attached to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-6\">1. The statute has, in view, indirect as well as direct conveyances. The object, sought to be accomplished, is looked after, irrespective of the forms employed to conceal it. Beers, <em>Ex'r </em>v. Lyon, 21 Conn. R., 605. Now the purpose of this instrument was unquestionably to create the fraudulent trust already pointed out. Possession of the property was taken and its avails for a time appropriated in strict pursuance of the powers raising the trust. The parties never treated it otherwise than as a trust instrument; and the defendant, at the time he was copied, assumed it to be such, by charging the property, in his account with it, with the debt paid, and expenses incurred by himself and his co-grantees, in carrying out the trust provisions \u00f3f the instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-7\">2. But there is nothing in this condition to prevent the full operation of the trust. The bill of sale was to become void, on the debts to the four vendees being paid. But these debts, by its provisions, were not to be paid until after the other trusts had been executed. The condition was not to operate until after all the creditors, provided for, had been paid. Then the trust powers weie to determine, in order that the surplus property, if any remained, might return to the assignors. In <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>10 Conn. R., 280, a case relied on by the other side to show that a mortgage is not a conveyance, it was distinctly decided that the mortgage, then in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>did not raise a trust. Had a trust been found, it can hardly be doubted, from C. J. Daggett\u2019s opinion, that the instrument would have been held <em>\u201c </em>utterly void.\u201d Upon any other principle the statute is rendered practically nugatory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-5\">III. But independently of the statute of 1828, this instrument is fraudulent and void, as against the plaintiff-, being \u201c calculated to hinder, delay and defraud creditors.\u201d Act against fraudulent conveyances, Rev. Stat., 570. <em>Pettibone </em>v. Stevens, 15 Conn. R., 24. 1. It vests in the trustees a sweeping authority, <em>\u201c </em>to pay from time to time in the process of settling up our affairs such just claims, not hereinbefore mentioned, of other persons against us, as said vendees may deem it prudent and proper to settle.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-6\">An unlimited discretion is thus given to the trustees to pay, or to refuse to pay, such of the creditors here mentioned, as they may please. They have not only the power to \u201c hinder\u201d and \u201c delay,\u201d but wholly to refuse. An assignment, reserving to the debtor himself the right of determining which of his creditors his trustee should pay, would manifestly be invalid. Can he then confer such a power upon his assignee ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-7\">2. But the trustees are also authorized \u201c to sell and dispose of, as they may see fit, all the articles herein conveyed.\u201d Within the scope of this authority the trustees could sell the assigned estate on credit. But a sale on credit, by a trustee, is regarded, in judgment of law, as such a \u201c hindrance\u201d and \u201c delay\u201d to creditors, that an assignment conferring upon a trustee such an authority is, upon this principle, invalid. <em>Nicholson </em>v. Leavitt, 2 Selden, 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-8\">Secondly, The instrument of Dec. 10,1851, was merely subservient to\u2014in aid of\u2014the original fraudulent trust. It was, in the language of the court below, \u201c ancillary\u201d to that of Sept. 1st, 1851. Its basis, being therefore fraudulent and void as against creditors, the whole must be of the same character. <em>Merrill </em>v. Meacham, 5 Day R., 341. The court, in the charge to the jury, very properly assumed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>property was received and held by the defendant, \u201c under said agreement\u201d of Sept. 1st, 1851. Indeed, that portion of the property, being cash received from the debts and <em>dioses </em>in action, belonging to the firm at the time of their assignment, was not comprised within the provisions of this instrument of Dec. 10th, and, of course, only affected by the instrument of Sept. 1st. But in any event, the court should have charged the jury, whether the legal effect of this instrument was binding on the partnership, or not. Instead of that, it was left as a question of fact for the jury, to \u201c find the last agreement to be the act of the firm.\u201d Each partner may undoubtedly, in the partnership name, dispose of the partnership property, for all purposes within the scope and objects of the partnership, and in the course of its trade and business. Sto. Part. \u00a7 90, 101. 1 Sw. Dig., 338.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-5\"><em>Thirdly, </em>The court charged the jury, that notwithstanding the instrument of Sept. 1st, 1851, was fraudulent and utterly void as against creditors, still, if the ' defendant, as trustee, had, before he was factorized, paid debts, provided for by that instrument, and expenses incurred in carrying out the trust, to an amount which, together with his own debt against the firm, equalled the property then in his hands, the property would not be liable to the plaintiff\u2019s attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">Upon this principle, the execution of a fraudulent trust cures its original infirmity, and nothing is in the way of an insolvent debtor\u2019s placing his property in the hands of a favorite trustee, for the benefit of such creditors as that trustee \u201c may deem it proper or prudent\u201d to pay, but the risk of its being discovered before the object is accomplished. The great objects of this statute, which are to provide a responsible trustee, who shall manage the trust under the eyes of the creditors, and to appropriate the trust property for the equal benefit of all the creditors, are thus entirely frustrated. The case in hand affords an illustration of the evil.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-7\">Decisions may be cited, protecting the trustee under a fraudulent conveyance, where he has, in good faith, appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ated the proceeds of the assigned property, in payment of outside creditors, without notice of the fraud, upon the principle it would seem, that the party has repented of the fraudulent purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\">But where the trustee himself seeks, as against an innocent creditor, to charge the property in his hands with not only the debts he has paid, and expenses he has incurred in the execution of the fraudulent trust, but also with the payment in full of himself and his co-trustees, principals in the fraudulent conveyance, there is no repenting of the fraudulent purpose. It is indeed accomplishing the very thing which the statutes and the common law say shall not be accomplished. Creditors have been \u201c hindered\u201d and \u201c delayed,\u201d and their debts \u201c avoided.\u201d <em>Pettibone </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>15 Conn. R., 24. <em>Crowninshield </em>v. <em>Kittridge, </em>7 Met., 520. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>2 Pick., 129. <em>Riggs </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>2 John. Ch. R., 582.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-6\">The plaintiff should have been allowed to prove that the defendant, at the time he was copied in the original suit, had in his hands the property of Hosea B. Harvey, one of the copartnership debtors. The name of each member of the copartnership having been set forth in the original writ, the private estate of such member was liable to be attached by the officers, though the suit was against the copartnership. Rev. Stat., 56. Although the judgment was rendered against the copartners, the execution, issued thereon, could have been \u00a1evied upon the individual property of the copartners, they having all been particularly named in the declaration. Rev. Stat., 113. If, therefore, the individual property of Harvey had not been concealed by the defendant, it could have been attached and applied to the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment. And when the copy of the writ, authorizing the attachment of this property, was left with the defendant, \u201c and therein averring that the said James T. Mix had con-concealed in his hands the goods, effects and estate of the said defendants, so that they could not be come at to be attached,\u201d it was sufficient notice to him that all the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>which, by his concealment, he had prevented the officer from attaching in that suit, against the said defendant, would be required of him to satisfy the final judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-5\">A debt, due to one member of a copartnership, cannot, it is admitted, be secured in a suit against the copartnership, where the person, owing it, is described in the factorizing process, as the debtor of all the copartners. 22 Conn. R., 248. But a \u201c debt\u201d is not attachable by the general law. It can only be sequestered in this peculiar manner. The factorizing process itself must therefore distinctly describe it, and by that description it is attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">In the case of goods, the garnishee is simply made the custodian of them, until they shall be \u201c exposed\u201d to the officer, to be proceeded against under the general law. They are supposed to be concealed in his hands, so that actual possession cannot be taken of them by the officer. And the object of the copy, left with him by the officer, is to make him the agent of the law, to hold possession for the officer of all the goods and effects in his hands, which are liable to attachment upon the original writ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-7\"><em>Baldwin </em>and Blackman, against the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-8\">1. The instrument of December 10th, 1851, under which Mix became the absolute purchaser and took possession, in his own right, of the property in question, was a valid instrument, not only as between the parties, but as against the creditors of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., to convey a perfect title to all the property mentioned in the same, to Mix the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-9\">2. All the property of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., conveyed by these instruments, and which came into the hands of Mix, the defendant, under the same, having been <em>bona fide </em>applied, in part payment, only, of the <em>bona fide </em>claims of Mix against this firm, and such as he had assumed and paid, prior to the 8th day of May, 1852, when the copy upon the original process was left in service, Mix was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>longer the trustee or debtor, of the original defendants, because he had nothing then in his hands belonging to them. <em>Sanford </em>v. Wheeler, 13 Conn. R.,167. <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>4 New Hamp., 476. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Goodwin, &amp;c., </em>12 Mass.

By the finding of the jury, Mix, the defendant, has accounted for all the property of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., which had come into his hands, prior to the service of the trustee process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-6\">4. Neither the instrument of September 1,1851, nor that of December 10,1851, nor both together, are affected by the statute of 1828, nor by the original act against fraudulent conveyances. A mortgage is not a trust. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>10 Conn. R., 280. The consideration of the deed of September, 1851, was the indebtedness of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., to the grantees. The case of <em>Goodell, et ux, </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>21 Conn. R., was an absolute deed, without any condition to be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-7\">5. The defendant, being described only as the debtor of the firm of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., in the original process, and in the <em>scire facias, </em>and not being described in either, as the debtor of Hosea B. Harvey, or' as having his goods or effects in his hands, evidence to prove that the defendant had the goods, or effects, of said Harvey in his hands, at the time of the service of the original process, was inadmissible in a suit charging him as the debtor of the firm. <em>McBride, Sheldon, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>The Protection Ins. Co., </em>22 Conn. R., 257-8.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b430-8\">Ellsworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar4\">Several questions are made in this case, which we shall not comment upon at length, as there is one, which in our view of the case, is decisive. The assignment of the 1st of September 1851, undoubtedly, is open to very serious objections, growing out of the general law of fraudulent conveyances, as well as the law of 1828. The liberty granted to the assignees, to dispose of the property as-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>signed, \u201c as they saw fit,\u201d and \u201c pay such other debts besides those named in the assignment, as the assignees may deem it prudent and proper to settle,\u201d are provisions which clothe the trustees with extraordinary and exceptionable powers, which, almost of necessity, hinder and delay creditors in collecting their debts. 3 Kernan, 218. But the most obvious objection to the assignment is, that it is in trust for creditors, and not made for their common, and equal benefit. Such a defect makes the assignment utterly illegal and void. To meet this objection, it is said that the assignment is a mortgage, and therefore a good conveyance according to the case of <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>10 Conn. R., 280. But the doctrine of that case does not go to this extent; and that decision would not have been made as it was, if the court had not held, according to their view of the deed, that it was not a deed in trust, but merely a conditional, and <em>bona fide </em>conveyance; and even in this conclusion to which the court came, some have thought that the court mistook the law and essentially impaired the value of the statute of 1828; but be that as it may, the present assignment was one, avowedly in trust, and not being for the equal benefit of all the assignor\u2019s creditors, is of no force or validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">But the defendant insists that afterward, on the 10th day of December, 1851, he bought the property in question, and thereby, and before he was copied as the debtor of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., acquired a new and perfect title to it, and so, on the 21st of September, 1852, the day he was copied, he had nothing in his hands which belonged to Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., nor owed them anything for what he had received from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The true character of this purchase by the defendant is the chief question in the cause, and the ground upon which the defendant mainly rests his defence. If the sale was a good one, the defence is complete; if not, there is no defence on the merits, and the defendant is liable to the plaintiff. The plaintiff denies the supposed sale, and if made in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and in form, he denies the consideration pretended, and further he insists, that the sale, if made, was not made by-Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., but by one of the partners, in his own name, and that no one of the assignees could acquire a good title by a subsequent purchase against any of the creditors of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co. The defendant takes issue upon all these questions of fact and of law. Under the charge of the court, the jury have found, that there was a <em>bona fide </em>sale to him in December, 1851, as claimed by the defendant; that he paid for the goods at their valuation, $10,836.53, which money was applied to cancel the debts of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., and that although the business was done by Harvey, it was done for the benefit of the company, and that throughout the entire proceedings, there was no unfairness or fraud. We do not see any thing wrong in the charge of the court, on these questions. Certainly one partner could sell the partnership property for the purpose of paying company debts, and the form of the sale, whether in the company name, or in the name of the remaining and active partner, could not be material, if the sale was intended to be, and was in fact for the benefit of the company, as the jury have found it was. The company could sell their property in December, notwithstanding their ineffectual assignment of September previous; but if no sale had been made, and the title of the property had remained in Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., under the defective assignment, until the defendant had been served with the copying process, the defendant doubtless would now be liable as holding their property. Before the defendant was copied, could he not have re-delivered the property to Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co,? could they not have sold it to whomsoever they pleased ? could they not have given to purchasers, or creditors, good and valid orders for its avails upon the assignees ? and if so, why could not the defendant, a <em>bona fide </em>creditor, become a purchaser of it, or apply it, under the directions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the representative of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., in payment and satisfaction of company debts ?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">An assignment, which is defective and void because of some technical informality, is not of course an obstacle to the assignee\u2019s appropriating the property, before he is copied, in payment of the assignor\u2019s creditors, according to the directions given in the assignment, and such payments would be a good accounting, whoever might afterward sue the assignee, for the property. And this principle, we think, is quite sufficient to uphold this defence, which in its essential particulars, does not vary from that case; and the idea put forth, on the argument, that the principle does not apply where the assignment was not <em>bona fide, </em>but was <em>mala fide, </em>(if any such distinction there be,) is not material to the present case, for the jury have found, there was no moral wrong or evil intent, in making the assignment of September, 1851. If this be so,!.! we ask, why could not the defendant make an outright purchase of the property, and thereby acquire a new and good title, if he conducted fairly, and paid for the property, a good and adequate consideration ? Nor can we perceive, if the assignment was conceded to be fraudulent in fact, why such an assignee could not abandon the assignment of a creditor, and take a new title for his good debt. In <em>Sanford &amp; al </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>13 Conn. R., 165, and <em>Weedon </em>v. <em>Hawes, </em>10 Conn. R., 50, this court held, that a mortgage-deed, given to secure good debts and bad debts, was not entirely void, if the mortgage was not made with an actual intent to defraud, or delay, creditors; much more must it be true, in such a case, that a new and unexceptionable deed for the payment of the good debts will be sustained, if the property does not exceed their amount. In <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>and his <em>Trustee, </em>12 Mass., 142, the trustee, who had received property under a suspicious assignment, was copied by a creditor of the assignor, after he had applied the avails of the property, which had been in his hands, according to the directions of Goodwin, the assignor, and he was held not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>liable. The defendant set up this application of the money as his defence, and it was sustained. Parker, Ch. J., says; \u201c under this declaration the defendant cannot be charged as the trustee of Goodwin, notwithstanding the original transaction between them. In this process, the condition of the parties, at the time of the service, must be looked at, and although previously to that time, the person, summoned as trustee, may have received the property of the debtor' under circumstances which would render him liable, yet if he has since discharged himself of all trust, by delivering back to the debtor the property received, in such manner that it may be attached by his creditors, or if he has paid the proceeds to <em>bona fide </em>creditors of the principal, in satisfaction of their just demands, so that, at the time of service of the writ, he truly has nothing in his hands, he cannot be subjected to a judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The defendant, being copied only as the debtor of Harvey, Needham, Root &amp; Co., in the factorizing process, and so sued in the <em>scire facias, </em>and not as the debtor of Hosea B. ' Harvey, evidence that he was the debtor of Harvey, or had Harvey\u2019s goods in his hands, was inadmissible, as was decided in <em>McBride, Sheldon &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>The Pro. Ins. Company, </em>22 Conn.
