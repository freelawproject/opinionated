Story against the Norwich and Worcester Railroad Company and John T. Cahill. At the term of the superior court, holden in January, 1854, the cause was referred to a committee, whose report embraced substantially the following facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-11\">In the year 1843, Miner C. Story, the plaintiff, made four contracts with the said Norwich and Worcester Railroad Company, for building the entire extension railroad of said company, from the city of Norwich to its termination at Allyn\u2019s Point, and for constructing for said company a wharf at said Allyn\u2019s Point. One of said contracts embraced the work to be done on, and materials to be furnished for, a certain portion of said extension road, designated in said contracts, and known as section numbers four and five. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Said Story, by said contracts, was to receive from said company, for the work to be done, and materials to be furnished for said section four, $9,751, and for the work to be done, and materials to be furnished for said section five, $6,969; or for the whole work and materials on said sections, $16,720. Said work and materials were to be paid for in monthly payments, as the work progressed, to the extent of four-fifths of the monthly estimates made of the same, by the engineer of said company, and the balance upon the completion of said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">After making said contract for sections four and five, John T. Cahill, one of the defendants, made a contract with Story, by which Cahill agreed to perform the whole work, and furnish all the materials, on said sections four and five, which said Story was bound to perform and furnish, by his last-mentioned contract with said railroad company, and was to receive therefor from said Story, the sum which Story was to receive from the railroad company, for the same work, namely, the sum of $16,720, and payable in the same manner as the said Story was to receive the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">Said Story gave said Cahill an order on said railroad company, to pay directly to Cahill, from time to time, whatever might become due said Story for the work and materials on sections four and five, on his contract with the company, which order said company refused to accept or to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">The firm of Fuller &amp; Broad afterward contracted with Cahill to perform that part of the work on sections four and five, which consisted of pile-bridging, and to furnish the materials therefor, for the price of $3.75 per lineal foot, which pile-bridging was included in Cahill\u2019s contract with Story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-8\">All the work that was performed, and materials that were furnished in the construction and building of sections four and five, under said contract, was performed and furnished as follows, namely: said Cahill performed and furnished all except the <em>pile-bridging,\\ </em>and said Fuller &amp; Broad performed the work, and furnished the materials for the pile-bridging.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Said Story made other contracts with sundry other persons for the performance of various other portions of the ' work, and furnishing the materials for which he had contracted on said extension road, and among others with John O\u2019Halloran, Stephen H. Cole, and with said Fuller &amp; Broad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">Said Story, and his said sub-contractors, performed a large amount of work and furnished a large amount of materials under their several contracts, and claimed that they had each performed and fulfilled their various contracts for the work and materials'on said extension road, so as to entitle Story to receive his pay therefor, from the railroad company, under his contracts with said company, and each of said sub-contractors to receive from Story their pay under their several contracts with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">Said Story, Cahill, O\u2019Halloran, Cole, and Fuller &amp; Broad, each claimed that, in addition to the!work done, and materials furnished by them, under their several contracts and sub-contracts,-upon said extension road, they had each done much more work, and furnished more materials than said contracts required them to perform, in consequence of changes made and required by said railroad company in the work upon said extension road, and for which they were severally entitled to receive pay from the railroad company as for extra work and materials, beyond the amount required to be done under their several contracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">After Story and his several sub-contractors had ceased to work on said extension road, controversies arose as to whether the contracts, between Story and the railroad company, had been fully performed, and also whether extra work had been done, and extra materials furnished, for which the company were liable; the company claiming that said contracts had not been performed, that they were not liable for any extra work or materials, either to Story or to said subcontractors, and that the company had expended large sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>of money in finishing the said contracts, which sums were chargeable to Story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">As between Story and Cahill, in relation to the work on sections four and five, the question arose whether Cahill had fully performed the contract, between them ; and like questions arose between Story and the other sub-contractors, in relation to the work done and materials furnished by them under their several sub-contracts with Story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">Said O\u2019Halloran, on the 10th day of November, 1843, brought his action of book debt against said Story, by process of foreign attachment, to the county court for New London county, and trusteed said railroad company as the debtors of Story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-7\">At the June term of said court in 1844, judgment was rendered in said action in favor of O\u2019Halloran, for twenty-two hundred dollars damages, and seven dollars, eighty-seven cents, costs of suit. O\u2019Halloran, on the 31st day of October, 1844, brought a <em>scire facias </em>against said railroad company to the county court for New London county, to collect his said judgment against said Story, which <em>scire facias </em>was continued in said court until the November term thereof in 1848, and was then withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-8\">Said O\u2019Halloran brought his action of book debt against said railroad company, on the 23d day of August, 1844, to the superior court for New London county, for extra work done and extra materials furnished upon said extension road, which last-mentioned action was continued in said superior court until the March term thereof in 1846, and was then withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-9\">Said Cahill, on the 18th day of November, 1843, brought his action of book debt against said Story to the county court for New London county, by process of foreign attachment, and caused the writ in said action to be served upon the said railroad company as the debtors of said Story, and said action was appealed by said Story to the superior court for said county, and auditors were appointed therein, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>time fixed for the hearing, when it was proposed by said Cahill to said Story, that Story should permit judgment to be taken at once against him in said action, for the purpose of facilitating the bringing of a <em>scire facias </em>upon such judgment against said railroad company, and of more speedily obtaining a judgment against said railroad company on. such <em>scire </em>facias, and of obtaining a determination of the question, whether the contracts with said railroad company had been fulfilled by Story and his sub-contractors, so as to entitle Story to receive any further pay from said railroad company therefor, and said sub-contractors to receive any further pay from Story. It was thereupon agreed between Story and Cahill,-that Cahill might take a judgment in said action against Story, for whatever amount Cahill might claim to be due to him from Story, with the understanding and stipulation that Cahill should enforce and collect the same only out of what might be due to Story from said railroad company, and to the extent only of the amount which should be found due to Story, from the railroad company, for that portion of Story\u2019s contracts which had been performed by Cahill, under his sub-contract with\u2019 Story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">The following writing, expressing a part of the aforesaid arrangement, was thereupon executed by Cahill and Story, on the day of its date :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">\u201c Norwich, April 1,1846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7\">\u201c It is hereby agreed between Miner C.

Story, one dollar, in consideration of which I hereby agree not to make any claim or demand agains.t him individually on a judgment in my favor against him, on which the Norwich and Worcester Railroad Company are copied by me in foreign attachment as debtors of said Story, reserving to myself the right to proceed against said company in <em>scire </em>facias, to recover said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">\u201cJohn T. Cahill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">Story was thereupon admitted as a witness in behalf of Cahill, and among other things he testified that he had no interest, directly or indirectly, in the judgment of Cahill against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">In the course of the trial of said <em>scire facias, </em>the railroad company sought to make use of the aforesaid <em>scire facias </em>brought by O\u2019Halloran against them, which was then pending, and was held by some third person in trust for said company, and was under their control,, for the purpose of postponing, or in some way prejudicing said claim of Cahill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-10\">Sundry informalities in the proceedings, both in the <em>scire facias </em>of O\u2019Halloran, and in the original suit of Cahill against Story, were claimed by the respective parties to have been discovered. A suspension of said trial was allowed by the court for the purpos\u00e9 of enabling the parties to negotiate terms of settlement, or of submission to arbitration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-11\">During said suspension, and before a submission to arbitration was agreed upon, an assignment was executed, and delivered by said Story to said Cahill, dated September 15, 1848, of all the money, which was due, or might be due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>him, from said railroad company, for labor and materials furnished for said extension road, and said assignment directed said company to pay over the same \u25a0 to Cahill, and in default of such payment, empowered Cahill to sue for the same. Said assignment was executed, in consequence of the apprehension,' occasioned by said claim of said railroad company, of an informality in the. proceedings, in said original suit of Cahill against Story, which it was feared might postpone the lien of Cahill upon the amount due from said company to Story, or otherwise prejudice Cahill\u2019s claim upon the company, and for the sole purpose of giving to said judgment of Cahill against Story, the same priority of lien as it would have, if no such informality existed, and upon the understanding and agreement that it should have no other, or greater <em>effect, </em>than <em>to </em>give <em>to </em>Cahill his priority of lien in the collection of his' judgment against Story, from said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">Before the time for which the suspension of said trial was allowed, had expired, the terms of a submission to arbitration of their respective claims were agreed upon by the parties to said <em>scire facias, </em>on trial, and by Story and several of his sub-contractors; and a writing of submission was.thereupon drawn up, and was then executed by such of the parties as-were present, and was-subsequently executed by the remaining parties thereto, and-said <em>scire facias </em>of Cahill was continued to the next term of the. court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">It Was agreed by said submission, that the legal priorities of said parties should be preserved, and if anything should be found to be due by said company to said Story, that said parties should be entitled to receive the same in the order of their several attachments. And that the amount found due by said arbitrators, should be the rule of damages -in said several suits, and said. auditors should award as to the amount due, by any of the parties signing said submission, to any other . of said parties, and finally adjust and settle all questions between them or any of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The time, within which said award was to be made, was extended to the first day of June, 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">The arbitrators, named in said submission, afterward met all the parties thereto, and heard them all, with their evidence and counsel, in relation to all the matters so submitted to them. At the conclusion of said hearing, when all the parties to said submission were present, either personally or by counsel, the arbitrators inquired of the various parties before them, whether it was understood by them that the arbitrators were to go back of the judgment in favor of Cahill against Story, and of the aforesaid assignment from Story to Cahill, or whether the amount, found due to said Story from said company, was to be allowed to Cahill to the extent of his judgment and assignment, and by virtue of them. The counsel of Cahill thereupon at first claimed that the amount found due to Story, should be allowed by the arbitrators to Cahill. Said Story thereupon claimed that it was not to be so allowed, but that the arbitrators were to go back of the judgment and assignment, and were to allow to Cahill only what they should find due to Cahill, and that the rest should be allowed to him, Story. All parties then assented to said claim of Story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">Jn consequence of said assent and understanding of said parties, the arbitrators, in making up their award on said submission, went back of the judgment and assignment, and determined the respective rights of the several parties to the moneys which were due from the railroad company to Story, irrespective of the judgment and assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">Said arbitrators made and published their award in writing, on the 16th day of May, 1849, and all the parties thereto were fully informed of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">On the 26th of May, 1849, Story paid said arbitrators the full amount of their fees, and of the costs and expenses of the arbitration, as allowed and taxed by the arbitrators, namely, the sum of two hundred-and seventy-eight dollars, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>thirty-one cents, no part of which sum has ever been repaid to Story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">After making and publishing said award, Cahill set up the claim that he was entitled, by virtue of said assignment, to receive for his own use, of said company, the moneys directed in said award to be paid to Story, and demanded of the company, that the same should be paid to him, and claimed that he was authorized by the assignment to execute a valid discharge for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">Said railroad company knew that Story denied the right of Cahill to said moneys, or to execute a valid discharge for the same, and that he claimed that the same should be paid to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\">Said company did not use reasonable care and diligence in ascertaining the respective rights of Cahill, and of Story, to said moneys so awarded to Story; and through want of such care and diligence, thinking that Cahill might have a right to receive the moneys, directed by said award to be paid to Story, did offer to Cahill to pay to him the moneys, awarded both to him and to Story, if he would indemnify and save harmless said company from all loss or damage, which the company might sustain by reason of such payment, and would secure such payment in the bonds of the company at their par value, then of the market value of sixty-seven cents on the dollar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-8\">Cahill agreed so to indemnify the company, and to receive payment in the manner proposed, and said company, relying on the indemnity so agreed to be given, delivered to Cahill seventeen bonds of said company, of different denominations, of the par value in all of nine thousand dollars, and also four hundred and thirty-eight dollars, sixty-five cents, in cash, which bonds and cash, Cahill then received, in full satisfaction of the moneys, directed in the award to be paid by the railroad company to him and to Story, and of one-half of the fees of the arbitrators, which by the award were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>directed to be paid to Story, and did thereupon execute and deliver to the company the following writing:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">\u201c In consideration of nine thousand, four hundred and thirty-eight dollars, sixty five cents, received of the Norwich and \"Worcester Railroad Company, by their treasurer, G.

All the real and personal property of said railroad company, was at this time encumbered with mortgages; and the company had no means of meeting their liabilities except by issuing their bonds; and it was usual for the company for a considerable period of time before and after this settlement with Cahill, to settle all claims against them,-except for current expenses, by issuing and delivering their bonds, payable at a distant period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-7\">Said Cahill and said company, after the aforesaid settlement, cooperated in endeavoring to prevent Story from obtaining a judgment in his action against the company, then pending before the superior court for New London county.

No decree should pass against the railroad com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>pany.

It is negatived by the finding of the court. 3. The facts as found show no negligence. 4. The mistake arose from the acts of Story, as detailed in the report, and their equity is at least equal to his.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-5\">Stores, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsM\">Our view of the facts of this case obviates the necessity of examining many matters of law, which relate to the agreement between the parties, and which, although much discussed, originated solely in different interpretations of the committee\u2019s report. If the transactions of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad Company, and the sub-contractor, Cahill, amount to a combination on their part to prevent the execution of an award, founded on a submission to which they, with the plaintiff and others, were parties, it is not denied that a court of equity should interpose to protect the rights, which such a combination is designed to defeat: first, because equity will prevent the consummation of frauds, and secondly, will enforce specific remedies, of which one party, contrary to justice and good conscience, seeks to deprive another. \u25a0 It is on these principles, that we recognize the plaintiff\u2019s right to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">By an award, confessedly valid, a large sum is adjudged to be due to the plaintiff from the railroad company, who are ordered to pay it, on demand, together with the legal costs of a suit at law, then pending for its recovery. In case of default, the award authorizes the plaintiff to procure the entering up of judgment, in the suit for the debt so ascertained, and for costs. Although an action at law might have been brought upon this award, a more summary and less expensive remedy was provided by the arbitrators, and to the specific execution of this remedy the plaintiff had an incontestable right. It is this right which the railroad company and Cahill conspired to defeat. It is this right, which the plaintiff now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>seeks, in a court of equity, to enforce, by soliciting an equivalent remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In the suit just referred to, the plaintiff, instead of being permitted to enter up judgment against the railroad company, was nonsuited, against his will and without his knowledge. This was done through the cooperation' of the company and Cahill, the latter claiming to be the assignee of the plaintiff, and assuming to discharge the claim on which the plaintiff\u2019s suit was founded. The circumstances, attending the transaction, impress this cooperation with the character of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">An assignment had been executed by the plaintiff to Cahill, of the claim against the company, and an authority to prosecute the suit, already instituted to recover this claim, had been given to the assignee. But this assignment, as appears by the award, was only made t\u00f3 enable Cahill to apply the necessary portion of the avails of the suit to the payment of his own claim against the plaintiff, and to secure priority to Cahill\u2019s judgment-lien upon the moneys which were due from the railroad company to the plaintiff, and which had been factorized, not only by Cahill, but by other creditors of the plaintiff. The balance of the debt, due from the company, was expressly agreed to be the plaintiff\u2019s property, notwithstanding the assignment, and was consequently awarded to him, in his own right, by the arbitrators. In ascertaining this balance, the arbitrators went behind Cahill\u2019s judgment against the plaintiff', which was taken out by agreement for a larger sum than was really due, and also behind the assignment, which was in terms absolute and unlimited. But this was not only in conformity with the real equity of the case, and understanding of the parties, but, in pursuance of an express authority to the arbitrators, to which all the parties to the submission gave oral, or tacit, assent. For the arbitrators, at the close of the hearing, were requested to apportion between Cahill and the plaintiff, according to the real indebtedness of the latter to the former, what should be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>due from the company to the plaintiff. The award was published, and all parties had knowledge of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">At this stage of the transaction which we are reviewing, Cahill receives, and the company pays, in bonds which commanded in market sixty-seven cents on the dollar, the entire debt of the company to the plaintiff, including the sum expressly awarded to the latter in his own right; Cahill discharging the company from all liability to the plaintiff, and agreeing to indemnify against him, and against any right of his, growing out of the award. These facts sufficiently establish the complicity of both parties to this proceeding, in a purpose to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s recovery of the sum awarded to him; both knowing, that the assignment, under which they professed to act, had b\u00e9en determined to be limited in its intent and operation; that Cahill was incompetent to give a valid discharge of the plaintiff\u2019s entire demand; that the suit of the plaintiff against the company, had been, by the arbitrators, ordered to be controlled solely by him and for his peculiar benefit, and that any discontinuance of it, except with his concurrence, would be unjust to him and tend to defeat his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Although the committee, in their somewhat vague report, do not expressly find a fraudulent intent to accompany the acts of Cahill and the company, in discharging the plaintiff\u2019s claim and procuring the nonsuit, or even the manner in which the nonsuit was obtained, yet they do not exonerate these parties from an inference, which is unavoidably made from the facts disclosed. We have no hesitation in deciding that they prove a case of fraudulent combination, not merely to withhold from the plaintiff, the amount which was awarded to him, but also to deprive him of the cheap and effectual remedy, which was provided for him by the award, for the purpose of insuring the recovery of his claim. We have as little hesitation in deciding, as matter of law, that what amounts to fraud is a legal conclusion, to be derived or inferred by courts from established facts. Fraud, indeed, as known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>to equity jurisprudence, \u201c properly includes all acts, omissions and concealments, by which an undue and unconscientious advantage is taken of another.\u201d Sto. Eq. Jur., \u00a7 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Many frauds are properly cognizable by courts of law, and it by no means follows, that the mere existence of fraud in a transaction, will bring it either within the independent or concurrent jurisdiction of courts of chancery. It is also true, that the fact that a wrong complained of is the result of confederacy and combination, will not, in all cases and alone, give jurisdiction of the injury to a court of equity. There must be something special in a case of confederacy, to make it a reliable ground of equity jurisdiction. Sto. Eq. PL, \u00a7 30. But where several individuals have confederated together to perpetrate a fraud, and a court of chancery, by the exercise of its ordinary functions, can protect a party from the consummation of the fraudulent design, this should be a clear case for the interposition of preventive justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Moreover, it is well settled, that, if an award provides a party to it with a specific remedy, appropriate to the subject-matter, equity will enforce the specific execution of the award, as readily as it would the performance of an agreement. If the award should merely direct the payment of money, chancery would not be invoked to aid the remedy ; but, if an act is required to be done in specie, the award will be made effectuaj by a decree. <em>Hall </em>v. Hardy, 3 P. Williams, 187. It would seem to follow clearly, that where a fraudulent combination exists, for the purpose of rendering a specific remedy, provided by an award, inoperative or impracticable, the case is, in many aspects, a proper subject of equity-jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">It only remains to add, that a court of chancery, having once assumed jurisdiction of a matter, will provide the promptest and most effectual remedy which the case requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We therefore advise the superior court to order and decree, that the defendants shall pay to the plaintiff the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>awarded to him, with interest thereon, and one-half of the costs of his suit against the railroad company, as ascertained by the award, and that the defendant, Cahill, shall pay to the plaintiff that part of the residue of such costs, which, by the award, he was directed to pay, and that execution be issued accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In this opinion the other judges, Waite and Hinman, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
