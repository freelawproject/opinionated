He admitted that he had pleaded guilty on November 9, 1938, and paid a fine of $100.00; also that he had pleaded guilty on December 22, 1938, and paid a fine of $200.00, but the proof is silent as to the nature of the offenses to which he had pleaded guilty. It is incumbent upon the State to allege and prove the convictions prior to the commission of the offense for which the accused is being tried in order to apply the enhanced penalty. Arbuckle v. State, 105 S. W. (2d) 219, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">This case also fails because the admissions do not show that the offenses were of a like nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">For the reasons pointed out, the cause is reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
