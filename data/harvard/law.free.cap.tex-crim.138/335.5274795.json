Texas P. C. The penalty applicable is set forth in Art. 666-41, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., the minimum penalty being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>$100. The trial court gave the penalty prescribed in Art. 667-26, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., in which the minimum penalty is fixed at $25. In charging the provisions of the article last mentioned the court fell into error, and appellant\u2019s exception to the charge should have been sustained. However, it is not every misstatement of the penalty that will work a reversal of the judgment. In the present case it is observed that the fine assessed against appellant, was $250, which was an amount between the minimum fine and the maximum fine prescribed in Art. 666-41, supra. Under the circumstances, we are constrained to hold that the erroneous charge of the court relative to the penalty did not injure the rights of the appellant. Sulak v. State, 40 S. W.
