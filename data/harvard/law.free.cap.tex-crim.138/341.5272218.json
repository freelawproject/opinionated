The State.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b365-6\">No. 20622.</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AZJ\">Delivered December 6, 1939.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b365-7\">Rehearing Denied January 31, 1940.</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-18\">The opinion states the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-19\"><em>Grady Hazelwood, </em>of Amarillo, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-20\"><em>Lloyd W.

That issue was properly submitted and the jury\u2019s verdict is contrary to the appellant\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>We are asked to reverse the case on the argument of the prosecuting attorney. It is admitted in the appellant\u2019s brief, and we think the admission is warranted, that no one of the statements made by the prosecuting attorney, taken alone, would justify a reversal of the case. It is contended, however, that all of the arguments complained of, considered together, present reversible error. Conceding that such may be the case, still in the case at bar the statements of the prosecuting attorney, even if they were considered to be of an inflammatory nature, did not bear that relationship to the issue of insanity which would, in the least, be calculated to influence the minds of the jury on that particular issue. Only one statement complained of related to insanity, and this bill is so qualified as to make the statement proper. If they had any effect, it would have been reflected in a more severe penalty. To the contrary, we find that the jury returned the lowest penalty which they were permitted to assess under the court\u2019s charge. In the case before us, even if it should be conceded that the statements of the District Attorney were out of the record and inflammatory, it appears perfectly clear that they did not influence the jury in returning their verdict and would, therefore, be considered harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b366-7\">GRAVES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Appellant again complains because of the remarks of the district attorney in his argument to the jury, and also takes issue with some of the statements in our original opinion herein. He takes issue with the opinion wherein it states that: \u201cIt is admitted in the appellant\u2019s brief, and we think the admission is* warranted, that no one of the statements made by the prosecuting attorney, taken alone, would justify a reversal of the case. It is contended, however, that all of the arguments complained of, considered together, present reversible error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Appellant contends that probably such a conclusion might be drawn from his argument relative to bills Nos. I, II and VII, but when taken together with his other bills, he renews his contention that same evidence serious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Appellant\u2019s bill No. Ill, as qualified by the court, seems to have been an argument invited by the prior argument of appellant\u2019s attorney. We are not in accord with appellant\u2019s contention that same necessarily referred to appellant\u2019s witness Dr. Swindell.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Bill of exceptions No. V complains because of the following argument of the district attorney: \u201cFellows like this one (referring to the defendant) who is a fraud, a cheat and a thief, and he got money that did not belong to him, and probably has been practicing upon it for years.\u201d The facts show that appellant did get money by means of what the State contended was a finished piece of forgery, hard to detect, doubtless evidencing experience in copying the signature of others, so the State claimed, appellant\u2019s main objection going to the use of the word \u201cthief.\u201d We must confess there seems to us to be very little difference between obtaining a person\u2019s money by a fraudulent taking and a forged instrument, knowing the same to be forged. We do not think this is a reversible matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Appellant\u2019s bill of exceptions No. VI is concerned with the abstract statement made by the district attorney that \u201cLying, cheating and stealing all go hand in hand.\u201d This is possibly a matter of opinion alone, but the State claimed that there was in evidence certain statements that were unreasonable, contradictory and unbelievable which appellant claimed showed a condition of insanity, but which the State claimed were pure fabrications. We see no serious error evidenced by such a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">We do not mean to hold herein that an error committed in the trial of a case is always cured by the fact that the jury awarded the accused the minimum penalty. We do mean to hold, however, that we see no error of a serious nature evidenced by appellant\u2019s bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The question of appellant\u2019s sanity was properly presented to the jury under appropriate instructions, and their finding against him is supported by the State\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
