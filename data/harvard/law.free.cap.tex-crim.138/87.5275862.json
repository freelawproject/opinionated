Complaint is made that, under the facts of this case, the witness was an accomplice and that appellant could not be convicted on his uncorroborated testimony. This question has been before this court recently in several cases. It has been thoroughly considered and decided adversely to the contention of the appellant. See Stevens v. State, 110 S. W. (2d) 906, and cases there cited; also Carpenter v. State, No. 20,572, (not yet reported). (Reported in this volume) Art. 666, 23a, subdivision 8, P. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-18\">No reversible error being shown in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
