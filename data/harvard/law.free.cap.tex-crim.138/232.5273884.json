It was his version that the truck driver purchased it in wet territory and had brought it to the back of appellant\u2019s restaurant for Dock Kyle; that he permitted the beer to remain on his premises merely as an accommodation to Kyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The court charged the jury, in part, as follows: \u201cIn this connection, you are further instructed that under the law when one stands charged with the offense of possessing liquor for the purpose of sale, the possession by the defendant of more than one quart of such liquor is prima facie evidence of guilt.\u201d This charge was properly and timely excepted to by the appellant. The exception was well taken. The complaint and information charged the possession of beer for the purpose of sale. Subdivision (b), Art. 667-25, Vernon\u2019s Texas P. C., provides: \u201cPossession by any person in any dry area of beer in any quantity exceeding twenty-four (24) bottles having a capacity of twelve (12) ounces each shall be prima facie evidence of possession for the purpose of sale in a dry area.\u201d Manifestly, the charge given by the court was not warranted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Upon another trial the court should submit appellant\u2019s affirmative defense as presented in his requested instruction No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
