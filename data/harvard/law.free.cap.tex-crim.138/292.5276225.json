C. P. By a supplemental transcript now before us there is shown a \u201cdocket entry\u201d by the trial judge stating that notice of appeal was given, but it does not appear that such order was carried into the court\u2019s minutes. It has been held many times that the docket entry is not a \u201crecord\u201d entry as required by Art. 827. See 4 Tex. Jur., Sec. 123, p. 172, and cases there cited; also Lenox v. State, 55 Tex. Cr. R. 259, 116 S. W. 816; Haynie v. State, 92 Tex. Cr. R. 45, 241 S. W. 478; Bryson v. State, 20 S. W. (2d) 1047; Thackerson v. State, 26 S. W.

The jury found appellant guilty of the offense of passing as true a forged instrument. The verdict fails to follow the charge in the indictment and the charge of the court, in that it finds appellant \u2022 guilty of an offense not set forth in the indictment. Under the circumstances we are constrained to order a reversal of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
