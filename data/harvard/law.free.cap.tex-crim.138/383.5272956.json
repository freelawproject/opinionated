Appellant did not testify upon the trial and introduced no evidence in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The only bill of exception found in the record is that complaining of the action of the court in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to quash the complaint and information upon the ground that same are insufficient to charge any offense. The particular objection which the appellant makes is not pointed out and we have been unable to discover what he has in mind. The bill points out no error, and we are unable to discover any error from the record requiring a reversal of the case, for which reason it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
