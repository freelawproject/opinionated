According to the testimony of the officers, appellant admitted that the whisky belonged to her. Appellant did not testify but introduced her son who said that \u201cthe house where the liquor was found was the home of the defendant and himself.\u201d He also testified that other people lived in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">The evidence is deemed sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">If it should be conceded that the search of appellant\u2019s residence was illegal, it is observed that appellant\u2019s son gave testimony showing the presence of the whisky in said residence. Under the circumstances, reversible error is not presented. At all events, the bills of exception in which complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>is made of the search are insufficient, in that they embrace no statements verifying the truth of appellant\u2019s objections. A mere statement of a ground of objection in a bill of exception is not a certificate of the judge that the facts which form the basis of the objection are true; it merely shows that such an objection was made.
