She had traveled by train from her home in Louisiana to Beaumont. After leaving the train she entered the automobile of appellant, who was a taxi-cab driver. She directed the appellant to drive her to the home of her sister, which was at 2778 Magnolia Avenue in the City of Beaumont. Obeying her instructions, appellant drove in the direction of her sister\u2019s home, but on arriving there failed to stop. He insisted that prosecutrix remain in the car for the purpose of accompanying him on a ride. She insisted that he leave her at her sister\u2019s home. Refusing to obey her request, appellant drove onto a country road. He finally stopped his car and requested that prosecutrix kiss him. About that time a car passed and appellant got back under the steering wheel, saying, \u201cWhen that car passes don\u2019t you dare get out.\u201d She attempted to jump out of the car but appellant caught her by the arm and held her \u201cso tight\u201d that she was unable to free herself. At this juncture we quote from the testimony of prosecutrix: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance \u2014 he was too strong \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>more I kicked and tried to get loose from him the tighter he would hold me. So he said \u2018Don\u2019t act that way \u2014 I am not going to do anything but kiss you.\u2019-* * * He said \u2018Don\u2019t you want to?\u2019 I said, \u2018Kiss you?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, don\u2019t you want to?\u2019 He never did tell me what he wanted to do. He said, \u2018You can lie right down in the seat and we will use a rubber.\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, my mother would kill me.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Your mother wouldn\u2019t know it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Prosecutrix testified further: \u201cHe put his hands on me from my knees up. He put his hands under my dress and felt my privates. He didn\u2019t actually attack me only with his hands. * * * He put his hands under my dress and he also felt of my breast. I was trying to fight him and keep him off of me all the time, but I couldn\u2019t, because he was too strong and I couldn\u2019t shove him off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Finally prosecutrix managed to free herself from appellant and hailed a passing car. The lady who was driving this car testified that just as she passed appellant\u2019s car prosecutrix screamed; that she took prosecutrix into her car; that she was crying, and was very nervous and white; that she told the witness what had occurred; that witness took the number of appellant\u2019s car; that later appellant brought prosecutrix\u2019s suit case to witness\u2019 car, saying that he had made \u201ca mistake about this little girl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Testifying in his own behalf, appellant admitted that he asked prosecutrix to have sexual relations with him. It was his version that she had voluntarily gone riding with him and had advised him that he might come to see her that night. It was appellant\u2019s further version that he had in no manner assaulted prosecutrix. He denied that he made the statement attributed to him by the witness who took prosecutrix into her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the judgment of conviction. We are unable to reach the conclusion that the proof is not sufficient to show an assault by appellant with the present intent to have sexual intercourse with prosecutrix. See Douglas v. State, 132 Tex. Cr. R. 258, and Hightower v. State, 65 Tex, Cr. R. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b530-5\">GRAVES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Appellant complains because the original opinion fails to make mention of his 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th assignments of error as set forth in his brief. All these assignments relate to the court\u2019s charge and alleged errors therein. We note that appellant filed no objections nor exceptions to the court\u2019s charge at the time of the trial, but seemed to have been content therewith at such time. In\u201d order for it to be incumbent upon us to consider these assignments of error relative to the court\u2019s charge, they should have been based upon some objections thereto made at the proper time. None are found in the record, and we therefore do not feel impelled to write upon such assignments set forth for the first time in the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Appellant does complain of the evidence, however, and says that same is insufficient to show the age of the prosecutrix to have been under eighteen years. He quotes from numerous decisions laying down the cardinal doctrine that \u201cIf, in a criminal trial, there be evidence which presents an issue favorable to the defendant, the trial court should not disregard it.\u201d Burkhard v. State, 18 Texas Crim. App. 599. Again: \u201cThe theory of the State, and that of defendant, if supported by any evidence, should be presented in a charge by which these theories are clearly made prominent to the jury\u201d\u2019 Davis v. State, 10 Texas Crim. App. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">We have no controversy about the above rule with appellant. The only difficulty we do have is that there was no issue made relative to this young lady\u2019s age. She said she was sixteen years of age, and was not even cross-examined on that statement. The appellant, when he brought the grip to the lady\u2019s car, told the lady, who picked up the prosecutrix after she had gotten out of appellant\u2019s car, that \u201che made a mistake about this little girl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Mrs. Callahan, who picked the little girl up and took her to town, was passing appellant\u2019s car and heard somebody screaming, and said \u201cStop, there is a little girl screaming.\u201d Appellant took the stand and nowhere in his testimony does he say or intimate that prosecutrix\u2019s age was other than what she said. There must first be an issue before the court would be required to charge thereon. We think this case was properly decided in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
