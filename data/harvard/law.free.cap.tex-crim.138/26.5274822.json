H. H. Cudd, a chemist of the Texas Liquor Control Board, testified that the liquor in question contained 3.53 per cent of alcohol by weight. He said: \u201cI did not drink any of the liquid I analyzed because it was not drinkable.\u201d Garrett Hawkins, Deputy District Supervisor of the Texas Liquor Control Board, who participated in the search and seizure, said: \u201cI did not drink any of the liquid. It did not look fit to drink.\u201d To the same effect was the testimony of W. C. Anderson, a witness for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-17\">It was alleged in the information and complaint that the liquor the officers discovered in appellant\u2019s home was an \u201cAlcoholic Beverage.\u201d Art. 666-3a, Vernon\u2019s P. C. of the State of Texas, Annotated, reads in part as follows: \u201c \u2018Alcoholic Beverage\u2019 shall mean alcohol and any beverage containing more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>one-half of one per cent of alcohol by volume which is capable of use for beverage purposes, either alone or when diluted.\u201d It is observed that the testimony was to the effect that the liquor in question was not drinkable. Lexicographers define \u201cdrinkable\u201d as follows: \u201cCapable of being drunk; fit to drink.\u201d If the liquid in question was not drinkable it was not an alcoholic beverage as that term is defined in the statute. Hence the averment in the indictment that such liquid was an alcoholic beverage had no support in the evidence. It follows that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examinel by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
