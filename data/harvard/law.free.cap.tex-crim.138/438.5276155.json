Robertson v. State, 178 S. W. Rep. 1191, and authorities there cited; also see Art. 666-23a, Vernon\u2019s Penal Code, Vol. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Appellant also contends that the State should have alleged and proven the successive steps bringing about the dry status of the county. The information alleged such facts, and proper proof was made thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Bill of exceptions No. 5 is in question and answer form, and there is no certificate of the trial judge showing the necessity for the same to be thus drawn. We therefore are unable to consider the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Other bills of exception claim misconduct on the part of the jury. They are qualified, however, by the court, and as qualified and shown by the testimony of the jurors, if the things complained of occurred it was after the verdict had been reached and agreed upon, and we can see no reason for disturbing such verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">It also appears in some of the bills of exceptions that there was a typographical error made in the spelling of some of the words in the information, such as the word \u201calcohilic\u201d and the word \u201cdecalring\u201d. However immediately after the word \u201calcohilic\u201d we find the allegation \u201ccontaining alcohol in excess of four per cent by weight,\u201d and the word \u201cdecalring\u201d is but a transposition of the letters a and 1. It is plain from the context what the typist meant, and we see no error of importance therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>We find no error in the record, after having considered all the bills of exceptions, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b464-3\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b464-4\">CHRISTIAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In his motion for rehearing appellant insists that his bill of exception No. 5 should be considered notwithstanding it is in question and answer form. If the bill should be considered it is observed that it is concerned with the impeachment of a witness for appellant who was questioned upon his cross-examination relative to having been convicted on a charge of possessing intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale. There is nothing in the bill of exception to show that the witness gave testimony material to appellant\u2019s defense. If the question propounded to him by the district attorney was improper, in the absence of a showing that the witness gave material testimony in behalf of appellant, we would not be warranted in holding the error reversible. McMurray v. State, 45 S. W. (2d) 607. In Widener v. State, 5 S. W. (2d) 138, we said: \u201cBy bills of exception Nos. 1 and 2, appellant complains of the misconduct of the county attorney in improperly impeaching one of his witnesses. While appellant\u2019s bills show that the method of impeachment was improper, they contain no statement of facts showing the materiality of the testimony of the impeached witness. We do not know from said bills what testimony the witness gave. If his testimony was immaterial, his improper impeachment would not have been harmful to appellant. Miller v. State, 67 Tex. Cr. R. 654, 150 S. W. 635; Holmes v. State, 68 Tex. Cr. R. 17, 150 S. W. 926. The bills of exception being insufficient in the respect mentioned, reversible error is not made to appear.\u201d See also Ewing v. State, 49 S. W. (2d) 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We disclaim any intention of holding that the bill of exception was improperly dealt with in the original opinion herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
