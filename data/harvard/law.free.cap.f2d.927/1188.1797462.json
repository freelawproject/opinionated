The district court sentenced appellant to a 57-month prison term to run concurrently for both counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court arrived at this sentence by increasing appellant\u2019s offense level by 18 points pursuant to \u00a7 2K1.4(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant challenges that ruling and the district court\u2019s inclusion in his criminal history category of a prior eight-month sentence imposed by military court for being absent without leave (\u201cAWOL\u201d). We affirm the district court s sentencing determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-16\">A. <em>The Military Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQje\">Section 4A1.2(g) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \u201c[sjentences resulting from military offenses are counted [for purposes of criminal history] if imposed by a general or special court martial. Sentences imposed by a summary court martial or Article 15 proceeding are not counted.\u201d Although conceding that his military sentence was imposed by a general or special court martial, appellant argues that this sentence should not have been counted in his criminal history because AWOL has no civilian counterpart. In other words, appellant presents the novel argument that inclusion of a military sentence imposed for going AWOL is inconsistent with the purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 criminal history provisions because AWOL is a uniquely military offense not relevant to a defendant\u2019s danger to the community or likelihood of recidivism. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines Ch. 4, Part A introductory commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-17\">Although this argument has some superficial appeal, we reject it as unsupported by the Sentencing Guidelines. Initially, we note that the plain meaning of \u00a7 4A1.2(g) is that <em>all </em>military sentences imposed by general or special court martial are includable in the criminal history calculation. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines lists a series of relatively minor offenses that are counted under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although military AWOL is not among those listed, \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) provides that offenses \u201csimilar\u201d to those that are listed are counted under the same circumstances. We find that a military AWOL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190-1194\">*1190-1194</page-number>sentence is similar to the listed civilian offenses of \u201c[c]ontempt of court\u201d and \u201c[hindering or failure to obey a police officer.\u201d These offenses similarly involve a disregard for lawful authority. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s calculation of appellant\u2019s criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-3\">B. <em>The Offense Level Increase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">Section 2K1.4(b)(1) provided, at the time that appellant was sentenced, for an increase of 18 offense levels on an arson conviction \u201c[i]f the defendant knowingly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Appellant argues that the district court erred by applying this guideline. Instead, appellant asserts that the district court should have applied \u00a7 2K1.4(b)(5), which provided for only a four-level increase where the defendant \u201cendangered the safety of another person.\u201d Even if he recklessly endangered the safety of another, appellant suggests alternatively, only a 14-level increase was warranted under \u00a7 2K1.4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">We will not disturb the district court\u2019s factual findings as to the extent of the danger to others caused by appellant\u2019s actions unless clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1206 n. 5 (11th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 1816, 108 L.Ed.2d 946 (1990); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). The district court found that appellant set the fire with multiple points of origin, that surrounding businesses were at considerable risk, and that the firemen who eventually fought the blaze were substantially endangered. The district court also noted that one of the firemen was in fact slightly injured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the presentence report noted that there was an inhabited apartment complex a mere 35 feet from the building set ablaze by appellant. The district court made these findings and the ultimate finding that appellant knowingly created a risk of death or serious bodily injury despite appellant\u2019s testimony that he had carefully set the fire so as to avoid creating such a risk. Appellant\u2019s renewal of this argument on appeal where we have no opportunity to gauge his credibility is not persuasive. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witness_\u201d). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s <em>18-level </em>increase of appellant\u2019s offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">. Appellant was also sentenced to three years supervised release to follow his incarceration and ordered to pay $60,000 in restitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1279-13\">.

The \"substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury\u201d contemplated by the Guidelines includes the risk to firefighters. <em>See United States v.
