'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-6\">A-\u00d3n a motion for-judgment non-obstante veredicto, under the Act of April 22, 1905, P. L. 286, Weand, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s husband was killed at a'grade crossing by defendant\u2019s engine, and her suit.is to recover damages. The accident occurred in the daytime. No witness introduced, by plaintiff witnessed the occurrence and the case, so far as she was concerned, went to the jury, upon the presumption that the deceased had stopped,\u2019 looked and' listened, and was free from contributory negligence. Plaintiff contended that no proper notice of the approaching train had been given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-8\">The evidence of defendant\u2019s witnesses, if believed, established the fact that proper notice of the approach of the train had been given, and that the. deceased when crossing the tracks was not looking; and that the horse apparently was walking slowly without a driver. The' jury, however, found against the defendant on the contradictory testimony as to the blowing of the whistle, and the testimony of the engineer and fireman as to how the deceased made the crossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-9\">Defendant\u2019s request for binding instructions was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-10\">The motion is for a new trial, and for judgment non obstante under the Act of April 22, 1905, P. L.-286.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-11\">This act was approved after the verdict, but we are treating the case as if it applied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-12\">The contention of defendant is, that the legal presumption that the deceased stopped, looked and listened, is met by the evidence showing at what distance he could have seen the approaching train, and if he had looked immediately before going upon the track, or, when some- distance - from it, he must have seen itj and that this, fact rebuts the-'presumption'in his favor. The deceased!-w-as struck when about-in-the'-middle-of--the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tracks. In Patterson v. Pittsburg, etc., Railway Co., 210 Pa.. 47, it was said: \u201c In an action against a railroad company to; recover damages for death at a grade crossing, the presumption, is that the deceased did his duty to \u2018 stop, look and listen \u2019 before driving on the tracks. Whether that presumption is rebutted is for the jury, unless the evidence to the contrary is clear, positive, credible and either uncontradicted, or so indisputable in weight and amount, as to justify the court in holding that a verdict against it must be set aside as a matter of law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-4\">Uuder this ruling should the court have sustained the defendant\u2019s request for binding instructions ? Does the evidence show such an unobstructed view as that the conclusion must inevitably follow that deceased did not do his duty?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\">From the measurements as given by defendant\u2019s witness, it appears that at the distance of fifteen feet from the track, where the \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d post is placed, the deceased, if he had looked, could have seen 320 feet, and at twelve feet from the track, he could have seen 400 feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\">The train was going at the rate of twenty to twenty-five miles an hour. It is evident that if he had not stopped at either point with the engine visible, he was guilty of negligence. But even if he could see The distance named, but no engine, was in view and no whistle blown, it does not follow that he might not still have been struck. If he saw no train and heard no\u2019 whistle, he had the right to proceed, and we must accept the finding of the jury that no whistle was sounded at the proper place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-7\">There was no testimony as to the character of the horse or of the speed when approaching close to the track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-8\">In Schwarz v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 211 Pa. 625, our Supreme Court said: \u201c In an action for death at a grade crossing, for the court to assume, in attempting to show by mechanical calculations, the contributory negligence of deceased, that the train was moving at a speed of forty miles per hour, and the wagon at a speed of two miles per hour if the evidence was disputed, was error.\u201d \u2022 ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\">The counsel for defendant has attempted to convince us by the relative speed of the train and the vehicle that the deceased must have seen the train if he had looked at the proper point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>and time. All this was submitted to the jury for their consideration in two trials, both of which resulted in verdicts for the plaintiff, under charges highly favorable to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-4\">In Schwarz v. R. R. Co., 211 Pa. 625, it was further said :\u25a0 \u201c When a'person crossing a railroad can only see a train approaching for 585 feet if he stops at the proper place, the railroad company should regulate the- speed of its trains so as to make it possible for a driver to cross in safety if he has stopped, looked and listened at the proper place.\u2019\u2019 This ruling would seem applicable to this case and answer the argument of defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\">In Cromley v. Penna. R. R. Co., 208 Pa. 445, it was said: It cannot be said that the driver saw the train or should have seen it, because it may have come into view in the 500 feet to which his line of vision was at first limited, after he had looked and started to cross.\u201d This ruling required the case to go to the jury. \u201cThe statement in the opinion in Carroll v. Penna. R. R. Co., 12 W. N. C. 348, that plaintiff\u2019s testimony should have been disregarded by the court because it stood alone, and was positively contradicted by the testimony of five wholly disinterested and unimpeached witnesses who had equally good opportunities of observation, has not since been approved and it cannot be on principle, because it overlooks the well-defined distinction between the province of the court and that of the jury: \u201d Cromley v. Penna. R. R. Co., 211 Pa. 429.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">We are therefore of the opinion that the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and for a new trial upon the questions of law raised must be overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-8\">It is also complained that the damages awarded are excessive. Deceased and plaintiff were about the same age, sixty-eight. His earning power was very limited and would naturally decrease with advancing years. The jury evidently capitalized the amount to which they thought the widow and family were entitled. If we assume that Mr. Kreamer would have lived ten years and allowing to his family $200 per year, $1,600 would be all, if not more, that they could lawfully claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-9\">And now, September 4, 1905, motion for judgment n. o. v. is overruled, and upon plaintiff filing a remittitur within ten days for all over $1,600 and costs, a new trial is refused. Otherwise a new trial is granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-3\"><em>Montgomery Evans, </em>with him <em>John M. Dettra, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2z\">The evidence of contributory negligence was such that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury: Penna. R. R. Co. v. Beale, 73 Pa. 504; Kinter v. Penna. R. R. Co., 204 Pa. 497; Blotz v. R. R. Co., 212 Pa. 154; Gangawer v. R. R. Co., 168 Pa. 265; Corcoran v. R. R. Co., 203 Pa. 380; Holden v. R. R.
