Burd and Thomas Jefferson Hunt, their heirs and assigns, for the uses and trusts, intents and purposes following; that is to say, .... To take, collect and receive the rents, issues and profits of my house No. 1628 South street, my three houses on the East side of Brooke court, and of my house at the Northeast corner of Brooke Court and Bedford street and after paying all taxes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>expenses and repairs, to hand ov\u00e9r the net rents, issues and profits unto my daughter Emeline during all the term of her natural life, and upon her death to assign, transfer, convey and assure the said several premises unto such of her children as may then be living, share and share alike; and in default of any such child or children then living, then and in that case to transfer and convey the said several premises unto my daughter Sarah Jane.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">Emeline had a child living at testator\u2019s death. The daughter, Sarah Jane, died in 1879, before the child of Emeline.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The life tenant, a widow of sixty-six, being still living and childless, the substituted trustee under the will petitioned the orphans\u2019 court under the Price act for leave to sell the trust property at private sale. This petition was joined in by the life tenant and her brother, who were brother and sister of the whole blood of Sarah Jane, and her only heirs at law \u2014 the position taken by the trustee being that the interest of Sarah Jane had so vested during her lifetime as to be transmissible to her heirs at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">The appellants, the only heirs at law of the residuary devisee under James Brooke\u2019s will, and half-sister and half-brother of Emeline and John S. Brooke, claimed to have a standing to resist the petition on the ground that, Sarah Jane, the alternative remainderman, having died during the lifetime of Emeline\u2019s child, never took any interest at all, and consequently could transmit none: and that Emeline\u2019s child having died before her mother, had never fulfilled the condition of survival under which she was to take; and that the remainder thus falling became part of the testator\u2019s residuary estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">Penrose, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">It must, perhaps, be conceded that the remainder to the testator\u2019s daughter Sarah was and is, technically contingent, since it will not take effect if his daughter Emeline, the cestui que trust for life, \u2014 a childless widow, sixty-six years old, \u2014shall leave a child or issue living at her death, in which case the fee is to go to them ; and yet if the life estate of Emeline had been followed by a remainder to her appointees by will, and in default of appointment to Sarah, the latter would have taken a vested remainder subject to be divested: Doe v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Martin, 4 Term Rep. 89 ; 4 Kent, 204, 824; though it is clear that the actual contingency of the remainder would have been much greater than in the case as it is and the tendency of modern decision is in favor of holding interests, which in ancient days would have been regarded as contingent, vested, subject to be divested: Hawkins on Wills, 223, 240-242.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">But the distinction in the present instance is of little importance, since the chief difference between a vested remainder and one that is contingent is that the latter may be destroyed by determination of the particular estate before the happening of the contingency (and even this cannot be where, as here, the life estate is held by trustees), while a vested remainder would simply be' accelerated; and unless the contingency is one which affects the capacity to take, a contingent remainder or other contingent interest is transmissible, even though not, in the technical sense, vested : Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 118; and hence it will pass in case of death before the happening of the event upon which it is dependent, to the heirs or devisees of the remainderman so dying: Bassett v. Hawk, 118 Pa. 94; Chess\u2019s Appeal, 87 Pa. 362. Upon this subject the law is thus stated by Chancellor Kent: \u201cIt is well settled that all contingent interests of inheritance .... where the person who is to take is certain, are transmissible by descent and are devisable and assignable. If the person be not ascertained, they are not then possibilities coupled with \u2022an interest, and they cannot be either devised or descend, at the common law. Contingent and executory, as well as vested interests, pass to the real and personal representatives, according to the nature of the interest, and entitle the representatives to them when the contingency happens : \u201d 4 Kent, 262, 511.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">It is immaterial, therefore, in this case that Sarah died in the lifetime of Emeline, the cestui que trust for life. She left no issue, and, as she died intestate, her estate in remainder passed, under the express provisions of the intestate laws, to her surviving brother and sister of the whole blood, to the exclusion of the brother and sister of the half blood; and it is also immaterial that the sister of the whole blood is cestui que trust for life, and the remainder cannot take effect until her own death: Stewart\u2019s Estate, 147 Pa. 383, 389; Deginther\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 337.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>It is true that words of inheritance are wanting in the devise in remainder to Sarah; but as the Act of April 8, 1833, sec. 9, P. L. 249, Purd. 2103, declares that the \u201c whole estate shall pass,\u201d notwithstanding the omission, in the absence of evidence of contrary intention, this also is immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">Practically, therefore, the cestui que trust for life and her brother of whole blood are the only persons having an interest in the estate, and the trust may be terminated and the estate sold at their instance: Culbertson\u2019s Appeal, 76 Pa. 145 ; Sharp-less\u2019s Estate, 151 Pa. 214.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">* * * *****</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">As the brother and sister of the half blood, as we think, have no interest in the property which is the subject of the petition, they have no right to oppose the sale asked for by the cestui que trust for life and the actual owners of the estate in remainder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the (decree authorizing the sale.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-9\"><em>Sidney E.

Repr. 1014.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-10\">These appellants have an interest in this property which qualifies them to object to this petition for a sale because if Emeline Powell die childless, there will be no person named in the will of James Brooke in whom the remainder is vested or can vest, and the lapsed reversion therefore vests in the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>siduary devisee, the testator\u2019s widow, Eleanor Brooke, whose only heirs at law are these appellants: Mitcheson\u2019s Estate, 6 Pa.
