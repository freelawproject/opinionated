Said corporation is formed for the purpose of storing, transporting and furnishing of water with the right to take rivulets and land and erect reservoirs for holding water for manufacturing and other purposes and for the creation, establishing, furnishing, transmission and using of water power therefrom and of acquiring all the rights, powers and privileges conferred upon corporations for said purposes as described in the eighteenth paragraph of the second section of the said act of April 29, 1874, and the supplements thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">The plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction filing in support thereof an affidavit of George Hantz which was in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">\u201c That he is a resident of Connellsville township, Fayette county, and familiar with the location of the property of Frank Peifly, therein located, and knows of the trespass and threatening encroachment thereon, of the Mountain Water Supply Company, and that the said company, by its agents and employees, has entered upon said tract of land and cut down and are cutting down locust, oak, maple and other kinds of trees thereon and injuring and destroying the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">\u201c That the said company threatens to place thereon, large pipes and also to dig, excavate and tear up the soil and prepare trenches to place said pipes therein and is about to take possession and appropriate a portion of said land for said pipe line, without any authority, as he is advised and believes.

Bells Run R. R. Co., 212 Pa. 491.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-4\">The office of a preliminary injunction is to maintain the existing status until the merits of the controversy can be fully heard and determined: Fredericks v.
