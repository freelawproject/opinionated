We conclude that the government had promised that such information would not be used to increase the defendant\u2019s punishment. Consequently, that material should not have been factored into the sentence. Whether counsel\u2019s inaction at sentencing constitutes ineffective assistance requires a hearing. Accordingly, we will remand for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-21\">Defendant John Baird pleaded guilty to a Hobbs Act robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951; conspiracy to violate civil rights, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 241; and obstruction of justice. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1503. These charges grew out of the defendant\u2019s misconduct as an officer in the Philadelphia Police Department. After he became aware that he was under investigation, defendant cooperated extensively with federal authorities in exposing corruption in the department. A more comprehensive re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>view of the facts underlying this case may be found in the defendant\u2019s direct appeal. <em>United States v. Baird, </em>109 F.3d 856 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">At sentencing, despite the fact that the prosecution had filed a section 5K1.1 motion recommending a downward departure, the court departed upwards from the guideline range of 87-108 months to 156 months. The sentence reached was based, in part, on conduct underlying counts that had been dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain, as well as on information provided by defendant as he had agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">At the sentencing hearing, counsel argued that the defendant\u2019s own statements had unfairly resulted in a higher guideline calculation, but she did not clearly challenge the use of that material. Neither did she object on the basis of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8, which generally immunizes from sentencing the consideration of self-incriminating information provided pursuant to an. applicable cooperation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">On direct appeal, defendant contended that the District Court erred at sentencing by considering activity underlying the dismissed counts. We affirmed, concluding that such conduct could support the upward departure. <em>Baird, </em>109 F.3d at 863. As a result of post-sentencing assistance, the defendant\u2019s sentence was later reduced to 126 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Defendant then filed the present motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, asserting that his trial counsel had been ineffective by failing to challenge the adverse use of information that, he argued, was immunized by his cooperation agreement and section 1B1.8. The District Court denied the motion, noting that in the early stages of his cooperation, defendant had attempted to falsely exculpate a fellow officer. Although the cooperation agreement \u201cwould have kept all his self-incriminating statements out [so] they could not have been used against him,\u201d the court concluded that the defendant\u2019s attempts to shield a co-conspirator \u201cbreached the deal\u201d and \u201crendered it null.\u201d Accordingly, reasoned the District Court, section lB1.8(a) was never triggered because the defendant\u2019s \u201cown actions ... caused the agreement to self-destruct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">In this appeal, defendant renews his contention that the government promised that the self-incriminating material he disclosed would not be used for sentencing purposes. The government counters that it made no such commitment, and in the alternative, contends that defendant breached any purported agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">To prevail in his contention that counsel was ineffective, defendant must show both deficiency in performance and prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 700, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The \u201cdeficiency\u201d step asks whether counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d viewed as of the time it occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also United States v. Gray, </em>878 F.2d 702, 711 (3d Cir.1989). The \u201cprejudice\u201d prerequisite asks whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1083 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">As a threshold matter, the court must determine whether. the underlying claim was meritorious. <em>United States v. Mannino, </em>212 F.3d 835, 839-40 (3d Cir.2000). The underlying facts are reviewed for clear error, and are subject to .independent judgment \u201con whether the facts thus found constitute constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Weatherwax, </em>77 F.3d 1425, 1430-31 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">An understanding of the defendant\u2019s section 2255 motion requires a review of the proceedings leading up to his sentencing. In early December 1994, having learned that he was about to be indicted for conspiracy to violate civil rights, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>dant offered to cooperate with the government. Unrepresented by counsel, he signed a brief note prepared by an assistant United States Attorney indicating that \u201cno statements made by you, or other information provided by you during the \u2018off-the-record\u2019 proffer, will be used directly against you in any criminal case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Two days later, on December 9, 1994, and still unrepresented, he signed a more formal letter drafted by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office. The letter acknowledged the defendant\u2019s desire to cooperate and stated that the earlier \u201coff-the-record\u201d note no longer applied and \u201c[f]rom now on,\u201d information furnished was \u201con the record, and could be admitted against you in the future if you failed to plead guilty\u201d to a Hobbs Act robbery and a conspiracy to violate civil rights. The letter also noted that cooperation could result in a governmental motion for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In the month following, defendant fabricated evidence to exculpate a co-conspirator, Thomas G. DeGovanni. On January 28, 1995, defendant admitted this deception, and later aided the government in obtaining evidence incriminating DeGovan-ni. There is no evidence or suggestion that defendant took further steps to improperly exculpate himself or others, or to minimize his role in the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">At some point not disclosed by the record, defendant retained counsel. On February 28, 1995, a multi-count indictment was returned against defendant, DeGovan-ni, and others. In addition to the two offenses enumerated in the December 9 letter, the indictment included four other charges against defendant, including a count for obstruction of justice stemming from his attempted cover-up of DeGovanni.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">With defendant now represented, the parties entered into a more detailed, formal plea agreement on March 30, 1995. Defendant agreed to cooperate by disclosing information and testifying if necessary. He also agreed that if he committed any additional crimes, the government could avoid the agreement. In due course, defendant pleaded guilty to counts alleging violations of the Hobbs Act, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. A presentence report was prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">In moving for a downward departure at sentencing, the assistant United States Attorney stated that defendant had \u201cdemonstrated a remarkable degree of both candor and recall.\u201d Moreover, declared the prosecutor, it was \u201cdifficult to conceive that a similarly situated defendant could provide a more substantial level of cooperation in the development of an historical case of police corruption.\u201d The sentencing judge was nevertheless struck by the extraordinary disruption of the criminal justice system caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct, and decided to depart upward. Acknowledging the government\u2019s section 5K1.1 motion, the judge stated that he was giving an \u201cimplicit\u201d downward departure in that he \u201cwould be hitting [defendant] harder ... were it not for the cooperation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">In its response to the section 2255 motion in the District Court, the government conceded that the defendant\u2019s \u201csentencing guideline calculation and [the District Court\u2019s] determination to depart upward were based upon matters which included in large part information obtained directly from [defendant].\u201d The presentence report recites in considerable detail numerous instances in which defendant and his co-conspirators \u201cparticipated in illegal searches of individuals and property, made illegal entries into premises, made illegal detentions, used unwarranted force and threat of force against detainees and stole money and property .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The probation officer relied on these incidents in recommending upward departures, stating that the defendant\u2019s actions had significantly disrupted governmental functions, had led to the imprisonment of many individuals in violation of their civil rights, and had caused many convictions to be overturned. The government alluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>to such matters in its sentencing memorandum, stating that \u201cthe District Attorney\u2019s Office was left in the unenviable position of having to concede the vacating of convictions of literally dozens of drug dealers.\u201d The memorandum noted the irony that the defendant\u2019s cooperation had widened the scope of culpable conduct before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The District Court considered such incidents in reaching its sentencing decision, finding that there had been \u201cmany significant disruptions of many Governmental functions,\u201d and that \u201cmany of these illicit searches\u201d were later overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, we held that evidence underlying dismissed counts was properly considered in the sentencing process. <em>Baird, </em>109 F.3d at 863. The question here is quite different and is based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8, a guideline provision that excludes certain information from a court\u2019s consideration of the sentence to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Traditionally, judges exercised wide discretion over the source and type of material used to determine punishment. <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). This broad authority was codified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3577, later renumbered as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661, which states that \u201c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d This language is quite broad and facially, would appear to bar redaction of information furnished by a cooperating defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, however, Congress subsequently established the United States Sentencing Commission and guideline system, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 991, 994(a)(1), and directed that certain factors not be included in sentencing calculations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 994(d), (e). It also directed that the Commission pay \u201cparticular attention\u201d to \u201cproviding certainty and fairness in sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 994\u00ae. Among those factors which were to be used to reduce a sentence, the statute listed \u201ca defendant\u2019s substantial assistance\u201d to the government. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 994(n). Guidelines section 1B1.8, which ensures that cooperating witnesses generally do not face increased sentences because of their cooperation, thus satisfies the mandate in section 994(n) that, where appropriate,, substantial assistance be rewarded by a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">As an additional phase of the sentencing legislation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b) provides that aggravating or mitigating factors not taken into account by the Sentencing Commission may be used in determining an appropriate sentence. <em>See also Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 200, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (noting that the sentencing court may not depart based \u201con a factor that the Commission has expressly rejected as an appropriate ground for departure\u201d). When read in conjunction with that provision, section 3661 is thus a \u201csafety net ..:. mak[ing] available for sentencing any relevant information not considered by the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Fairman, </em>947 F.2d 1479, 1482 (11th Cir.1991). As we stated in <em>United States v. Bruno, </em>897 F.2d 691, 695-96 (3d Cir.1990), the two \u201csections are to operate in harmony,\u201d and information of the type encompassed by section 3661 is subject to the limitations of section 3553(b). In short, reading section 3661 together with the other provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act, including the requirements specifically articulated by Congress, leads us to conclude that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8, while limiting the otherwise-comprehensive language of section 3661, is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">We turn then to the guideline at issue. Section lB1.8(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">Where a defendant agrees to cooperate with the government by providing infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>mation concerning unlawful activities of others, and as part of that cooperation agreement the government agrees that self-incriminating information provided pursuant to the agreement will not be used against the defendant, then such information shall not be used in determining the applicable guideline range, except to the extent provided in the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(a);</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">There are several caveats to the general rule. Immunity shall not apply \u201cin the event there is a breach of the cooperation agreement by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.8(b)(4). Other exceptions include information \u201cknown to the government pri- or to entering into the cooperation agreement,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.8(b)(l), and information used \u201cin determining whether, or to what extent, a downward departure from the guidelines is warranted ... under \u00a7 5K1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.8(b)(5). As a corollary, however, the Commission\u2019s policy is that self-incriminating information \u201cshall not be used to increase the defendant\u2019s sentence above the applicable guideline range by upward departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.8 applic. n. 1. The ban on the use of incriminatory evidence applies not only to government attorneys, but also to probation officers in the preparation of presentence reports. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.8 applic. n. 5; <em>see also United States v. Fant, </em>974 F.2d 559, 564 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Courts have set aside sentences based on incriminating information obtained from a defendant where there were explicit references to section 1B1.8 in the plea or cooperation agreements. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>146 F.3d 219, 220, 223 (4th Cir.1998). In other cases, the existence or scope of a cooperation agreement was at issue. At a minimum, the court must find an agreement that 1) defendant will cooperate \u201cby providing information concerning the unlawful activities of others\u201d; and 2) the government will not use the self-incriminating information provided thereto against defendant. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>985 F.2d 497, 499 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">A failure to be explicit or to cite to section IB 1.8 will not by itself vitiate a purported cooperation agreement. In <em>United States v. Shorteeth, </em>887 F.2d 253 (10th Cir.1989), the government had promised not to institute additional prosecutions based on information received from the defendant. The court concluded that this agreement embodied an implicit promise not to use that evidence in calculating the sentencing range, stating that \u201cthe language and spirit of <em>Guidelines </em>\u00a7 1B1.8 require the agreement to specifically mention the court\u2019s ability to consider defendant\u2019s disclosures during debriefing in calculating the appropriate sentencing range before the court may do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">But where an agreement does not embrace immunizing consequences, courts will not read them in. <em>See United States v. Ykema, </em>887 F.2d 697, 699 (6th Cir.1989) (concluding that mere promise that \u201cno additional charges\u201d would be brought did not preclude sentence based on drug quantity higher than that stipulated in plea agreement). <em>But cf. United States v. Kinsey, </em>917 F.2d 181, 184 (5th Cir.1990) (although promise not to prosecute did not appear to be ban on use of .self-incriminating material, court accepted the parties\u2019 mutual understanding that agreement incorporated such a promise).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Similarly, where a cooperation arrangement exists, but clearly limits the boundaries of immunity, courts are chary of expanding upon the parties\u2019 clear intentions. <em>See United States v. Fontana, 50 </em>F.3d 86, 87-88 (1st Cir.1995) (\u201csingle, limited[ ] promise\u201d of immunity for evidence of amount of counterfeit money did not extend to information on cohort\u2019s identity); <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>918 F.2d 1383, 1387 (8th Cir.1990) (despite assertion that higher drug quantity could not be considered under cooperation agreement, defendant voluntarily stipulated to higher amount in superseding plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Whether the government has violated a plea, or by analogy, a cooperation agreement, is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Huang, </em>178 F.3d 184, 187 (3d Cir.1999). Whether any such agreement exists is also a question of law with the underlying facts found by the District Court reviewed for clear error. <em>ATACS Corp. v. Trans World Comms., Inc., </em>155 F.3d 659, 665 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Although a cooperative plea agreement is not altogether the same as a commercial arrangement, civil contract law is - nevertheless an important and useful aid in interpretation. <em>Huang, </em>178 F.3d at 187-88 (citing <em>United States v. Khan, </em>920 F.2d 1100, 1105 (2d Cir.1990)); <em>see also United States v. Nolan-Cooper, </em>155 F.3d 221, 236 (3d Cir.1998) (plea agreements construed according to contract principles); <em>United States v. Isaac, </em>141 F.3d 477, 483 (3d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Moscahlaidis, </em>868 F.2d 1357, 1361 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The government may not rely upon a rigid and literal construction of the terms of a plea or cooperation agreement. <em>Nolan-Cooper, </em>155 F.3d at 236. Such agreements are unique and are to be construed in light of \u201cspecial due process concerns.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradbury, </em>189 F.3d 200, 206 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotes omitted). Courts must determine whether the government\u2019s conduct was' inconsistent with what was reasonably understood by defendant when entering the plea of guilt. <em>United States v. Badaracco, </em>954 F.2d 928, 939 (3d Cir.1992); <em>Bradbury, </em>189 F.3d at 206. In view of the government\u2019s tremendous bargaining power, we will strictly construe the text against it when it has drafted the agreement. <em>United States v. Padilla, </em>186 F.3d 136, 140 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">As is apparent <em>from </em>the text <em>of </em>guideline section lB1.8(a), there is a threshold inquiry of whether the government promised to immunize the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements. We thus begin with the letter of December 9, 1994. As noted earlier, it states that \u201c[f]rom now on, any statements, documents, tape recordings or other information which- you may provide is on the record, and could be admitted against you in the future if you failed to plead guilty to the offenses\u201d enumerated in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">That clause is the focal point of the dispute. Defendant reads it to mean that information garnered from his assistance could be used against him only if he failed to plead guilty to the offenses described in the letter. In his view, the phrase \u201cif you failed to plead guilty\u201d creates a condition precedent to the use of any incriminating information against him. The government, in contrast, takes the position that all information was \u201cfully on the record,\u201d and that the now-disputed statement. was merely a warning of the consequences of a failure to plead, and not a promise to immunize cooperation evidence upon entry of a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">We reject the government\u2019s reading. Construing ambiguity against the government, we conclude the agreement states that if defendant did plead guilty, the information would not be used \u201cagainst [him] in the future.\u201d We are persuaded that reasonable persons would understand the challenged clause t\u00f3 mean that incriminating information would not be admitted against defendant in any proceeding, including his own sentencing, if he pleaded guilty to the designated offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Having determined that an agreement exists, we must next consider whether defendant breached it, and if so, whether it remained in force. After the letter was signed, defendant attempted to shield his fellow officer DeGovanni. Nevertheless, even while attempting to aid DeGovanni, defendant was simultaneously providing information to incriminate other members of the police force.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">It seems clear that the effort to aid DeGovanni was at least a partial breach of that agreement and defendant does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>appear to contend otherwise. Upon learning of the defendant\u2019s duplicity, the government might have declared a breach of the agreement and either attempted to sever its relationship with defendant or to negotiate a new arrangement disavowing the earlier one. That, however, does not seem to have occurred. Instead, defendant agreed to plead to an additional count for obstruction of justice, but significantly, continued his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The next important development is the execution of the formal plea agreement on March 30, 1995. Paragraph 2(J) of that document has particular relevance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">Defendant agrees that if the government determines that the defendant ... has committed any federal, state or local crime between the date of this agreement and his sentencing, ... the agreement may be voided by the government and the defendant shall be subject to prosecution for any federal crime of which the government has knowledge including, but not limited to, perjury, obstruction of justice, and the substantive offenses arising from this investigation. This prosecution may be based upon any information provided by the defendant during the course of his cooperation, and this information may be used as evidence against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">This provision means that if defendant engaged in criminal conduct after signing the plea agreement, the government could use any information supplied by defendant against him. By negative implication, as in the instance of the December 9 letter, the government agreed as a general matter not to use to the defendant\u2019s detriment information obtained through the cooperation process. Thus, the plea agreement was consistent with the December 9 letter of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We note that paragraph 4(d) of the plea agreement indicates that the government could \u201cbring to the Court\u2019s attention all facts relevant to sentencing (including evidence relating to the character of the defendant).\u201d This provision, of course, begs the question of what facts are \u201crelevant\u201d to sentencing. By agreeing to immunize self-incriminating information, the government has limited the scope of information that may be considered at sentencing. We therefore do not understand this provision to provide an end-run around the cooperation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Reading the formal plea agreement against the government as the drafter, and in light of its acceptance of the plea to obstruction of justice as an apparent cure of the initial breach, we conclude that the government treated the December 9 agreement as remaining in effect. That conclusion is not altered by the plea agreement\u2019s integration clause, which states that \u201cno additional promises, agreements or conditions have been entered into other than those set forth in this document .... \u201d This obvious boilerplate does not contain language purporting to supersede the December 9 letter. Further, the two documents may be read consistently with one another. In light of these considerations and the special due process concerns in the criminal arena, the integration clause has no effect in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Having concluded that there has been a breach, an apparent cure, and a conceded continuation of the cooperation, we must determine whether the District Court was correct in declaring the agreement null and void. In contract law, the effect of a breach is a frequently litigated issue. The question is often whether the agreement is absolutely and automatically dissolved on the occurrence of an event, <em>i.e., </em>void, or whether one party\u2019s action gives the other the option to declare the agreement at an end, <em>ie., </em>voidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">As expressed by a recognized authority on contracts, \u201c[u]ntil the party who has the power of avoidance elects to exercise it, the contract remains intact. Moreover, even though one of the parties has the power of avoidance, he may extinguish that power by ratification of the contract.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>John E. Murray, Jr., <em>Murray on Contracts </em>\u00a7 17, at 31 (3d ed. 1990). On the other hand, \u201c \u2018[v]oid\u2019 contracts are not contracts at all\u201d and any promise therein is unenforceable. <em>Id. </em>at 32; <em>see also </em>Restatement of Contracts (Second) \u00a7 7 (1981); E. Allan Farnsworth, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 4.10, at 243-44 (3d ed. 1999); 1 Joseph M. Perillo, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1.6-1.7 (rev. ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Although the-District Court characterized the plea agreement as \u201cnull,\u201d it is clear that if there was a contract, it would be voidable, not void. Moreover, in the criminal context, if a breach is to be remedied by a subsequent agreement, the defendant should receive an adequate warning of the consequences. <em>Bradbury, </em>189 F.3d at 208. Failure to provide adequate notice of a breach would undercut one of the \u201c \u2018most important advantages\u2019 \u201d of section 1B1.8, that \u201c \u2018prosecutors can ... assure potential informants that their statements will in no way be used against, them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208 <em>(quoting Shorteeth, </em>887 F.2d at 257) (alteration in original). The record before us does not reveal any warning to defendant as to the consequences of his breach. Instead, the government continued to reap substantial benefits from his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In sum, construing the documents against the drafter, we conclude that the government agreed not to use information defendant provided against himself at sentencing. The government accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea to obstruction of justice as a satisfaction of the breach and did not attempt to avoid the December 9 agreement. It further appears that the government\u2019s performance in continuing the cooperation arrangement without any warning to defendant that its former promise no longer applied constituted a waiver of the breach. Consequently, the District Court erred in ruling that the cooperation agreement was a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">At this stage, defendant has laid the groundwork for a meritorious claim, but we caution that the record is not complete. Immunity does, not extend to material known to the government before it entered into the cooperation agreement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(b)(l); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>106 F.3d 1140, 1144 n. 5 (3d Cir.1997). Nor would it generally apply to disclosures made during the plea colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Also, information post-dating the agreement and obtained from independent sources is not barred. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>48 F.3d 876, 879 (5th Cir.1995). Information separately gleaned from co-defendants is also fair game, <em>United States v. Davis, </em>912 F.2d 1210, 1213 (10th Cir.1990), and the defendant\u2019s later corroboration does not remove the co-defendant\u2019s evidence from consideration. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>901 F.2d 842, 845 (10th Cir.1990). But the government may not evade U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(a) where the evidence was elicited solely as a result of, or prompted by, the defendant\u2019s cooperation. <em>Davis, </em>912 F.2d at 1213; <em>see also Gibson, </em>48 F.3d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The sources of the information utilized in the sentencing calculation in this case may only be resolved by a hearing on remand. <em>Bradbury, </em>189 F.3d at 208; <em>United States v. Amato, </em>46 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (2d Cir.1995); <em>Kinsey, </em>917 F.2d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">We also note that the record is insufficient to establish whether the conduct of trial counsel satisfies Strickland\u2019s deficiency requirement, <em>i.e., </em>that the representation fell below the competence of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As one facet of this inquiry, we point out that under <em>Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 138-39, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), a District Court must notify the parties in advance of sentencing if it intends to depart upwards on grounds not set out in the presentence report or the government\u2019s submission. <em>United States v. Barr, </em>963 F.2d 641, 655 (3d Cir.1992); see also <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>ed States v. Hecht, </em>212 F.3d 847, 848-49 (3d Cir.2000). The record before us does not indicate whether such notice was given, or if it was required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Because the record contains no evidence on the reasons underlying counsel\u2019s decision not to challenge the presentence report or sentence on section 1B1.8 grounds, a hearing is required on that point as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Defendant has presented a <em>prima facie </em>claim of prejudice, but that too must be fleshed out on remand. Defendant must show that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The determination of prejudice \u201cshould not depend on the idiosyncrasies of the particular decision-maker,\u201d and should instead \u201cproceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Whether the defendant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>claim can be rebutted by the government will have to be determined on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Accordingly, the order of the District Court will be reversed and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
