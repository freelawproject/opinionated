The offenses allegedly took place during the course of a large-scale disturbance which occurred outside the Penns Grove Y. M. C. A. involving a large group of young people. Defendant admits that he was caught up in the hysteria of the riot and grabbed a baseball bat which was immediately at hand, smashing it against an automobile and injuring its occupant. Defendant was 21 years old when the incident occurred, has neither an adult criminal nor juvenile record, apparently completed high school, has been regularly employed since his graduation, resides with his parents, claims to lead a normal law-abiding life and contends that the event in question was completely aberrational and out of character. He has made restitution for the property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">His application for admission to the program, supported by official documentation but without personal interview by the program administrators, resulted in his receipt of a form letter from the program coordinator denying him participation for the reason that \u201cYour offense, Atrocious Assault and Battery, involves violence against another person and diversion would deprecate the seriousness of your crime .(Guideline 3(i)(3).\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The form letter further advised him that pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>suant to Guideline <em>2 </em>he had the right to present additional \u201creasons, facts or materials which you feel would serve to justify your admission as an exception to the guidelines.\u201d Accordingly, his attorney wrote to the project coordinator reciting the facts we have herein indicated and noting the high esteem in which defendant was held by his employer and co-employees. The response to this letter was a second form letter, signed by the coordinator, approved by the prosecutor, and reading in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">The defendant named above has made an application for participation in the Salem County Pre-Trial Intervention Program pursuant to the provisions of Court Rule 3:28.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">It is the opinion of the coordinator that in accordance with the policy of the Court, the defendant is. ineligible for participation for the following reasons: Tour offense, Atrocious Assault and Battery, involves violence against another person and diversion would deprecate the seriousness of your crime. (Guideline 3-i-3) Pursuant to Guideline 2, the defendant was given an opportunity to present compelling reasons (see attached letter from attorney), however, it was the coordinator\u2019s opinion that the reasons given did not serve to justify admission as an exception to the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Defendant promptly applied for judicial review of his rejection, claiming that it represented a gross abuse of discretion on the part of the prosecutor. The concern, however, of the trial judge on the record before him was not whether the rejection was sustainable on the merits but rather that the judicial review function could not properly be exercised in view of the failure of both the prosecutor and the coordinator to have given an adequate statement of reasons for their ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>tion. It was the prosecutor\u2019s argument that it is neither his burden nor the coordinator\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">* * * to set forth the specific facts upon which he bases his denial, he is assumed to have reviewed the application and the nature of the defendant--the nature of the crime and his * * * amenability towards the rehabilitative process * * * and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the burden for him to have set forth that, I did in fact consider all these things. I know it\u2019s assumed he\u2019s supposed to consider those things and unless it can be shown that he did not consider those things and in other words that had he considered all those things his decision would have been arbitrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The prosecutor further contended that when the offense involved is one encompassed by Guideline 3(i)(3), his obligation to explain his reasons for rejection is met simply by citation of that guideline and the notation that compelling reasons were not presented, <em>i. e., </em>the precise procedure here followed. The judge disagreed, observing that the prosecutor has to \u201csatisfy the Court that some consideration was given to the alleged compelling reasons that were set forth and it wasn\u2019t done.\u201d In our view the judge was clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> No useful purpose can be here served by extensive review of either <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>71 <em>N. J. </em>85 (1976) <em>(Leonardos I) </em>or <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>360 (1977) <em>(.Leonardos II). </em>Suffice it to say that the Supreme Court clearly expressed its philosophy regarding diversionary programs, the social and personal utility of the rehabilitative emphasis on which they are based, the general operative techniques of diversion, and the constitutional necessity for a broad range of discretion in the prosecutor to consent or withhold consent to an applicant\u2019s participation therein. It is the last of these which defines the scope of judicial review of the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of discretion. That review is limited to a determination of whether the prosecutor acted in a manner so grossly arbitrary or capricious as to amount to \u201ca patent and gross abuse of his discretion.\u201d <em>Leonardos II, supra, 73 N. J. </em>at 382. Thus review is essentially analogous to the court\u2019s function in action in lieu of prerogative writs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>based on the record below. <em>Leonardis II, supra, </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>at 377, fn. 7. And see <em>State v. Litton, </em>155 <em>N. J. Super. </em>207 (App. Div. 1977); <em>State v. White, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>257 (Law Div. 1976). It is, of course, elementary that no matter how great a deference the court is obliged to accord the administrative determination which it is being called upon to review, it has no capacity to review at all unless there is some kind of reasonable factual record developed by the administrative agency and the agency has stated its reasons grounded in that record for its action. See, <em>e. g., In re Senior Appeals Examiners, </em>60 <em>N. J. </em>356 (1972); <em>Monks v. N. J. State Parole Board, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>238 (1971); <em>Reinauer Realty Corp. v. Paramus, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>406, 419 (1961); <em>In re Application of Union Community Bank, </em>144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>39, 47 (App. Div. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The proper operation of pretrial diversionary programs has always contemplated that rejected applicants will be furnished an adequate statement of reasons. See <em>Leonardis I, supra, </em>71 <em>N. J. </em>at 119. Guideline 8 expressly provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">The decisions and reasons therefor made by the * * * prosecutors and program directors in granting or denying defendants\u2019 applications for PTI enrollment * * * in all cases must be reduced to writing and disclosed to defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">And in Memorandum Re PTI, 99 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>Index Page 953 (1976), the Director of Criminal Practice, Administrative Office of the Courts, at the request of the Chief Justice, advised all Assignment Judges that \u201cEvery defendant must be presented with a statement of reasons for rejection by the program director, prosecutor or the court.\u201d And see <em>State v. White, supra, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 261 where the court noted that the reasons for rejection were made clear from the director\u2019s \u201cextensive and thorough report\u201d which exhibited \u201ccare and attention to all the material submitted.\u201d We note, moreover, that <em>State v. White, </em>involved, as here, a crime encompassed by Guideline 3(i)(3), but there the crime was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>murder. And <em>cf. State v. Litton, supra, </em>and the detailed statement of reasons there considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"> The point, of course, is that a purported statement of reasons which, as here, does no more than parrot, in purely conelusionary terms, the language of the Guidelines, is no statement at all. See, <em>e. g., Grundlehner v. Dangler, </em>29 <em>N. J. 256, </em>271 (1959). Defendant is not entitled as of right to admission in the program. He is, however, entitled to full and careful consideration of his application and to the assurance, which can only be provided by the statem\u00e9nt of reasons for rejection, that his application has nevertheless received such consideration. The perfunctory, conclusionary form letter here fails to meet that standard. We, therefore, concur with the conclusion of the trial judge that there is no way of telling, from this record, whether defendant\u2019s application was in fact fully and carefully considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We note, further, defendant\u2019s argument that his application could not have received full and fair consideration because he was never personally interviewed by the program administrators. We reject the contention that personal interviews must be conducted in every case. The Guidelines themselves do not so require. We do, however, suggest that personal interviews of the defendant or others may be helpful in questionable cases and can probably assist the program administrators in making their rehabilitatibility evaluation. Accordingly, they should give careful consideration in each case to whether or not interviews should be employed as part of their evaluative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Because of the deficiencies here, the trial judge directed defendant to reapply to the program and directed the program to reconsider the application. In our view, re-initiation of the application is not necessary. The same end can he more conveniently and expeditiously accomplished by the continuance of this matter by the trial court under appropriate terms which would (1) permit defendant to present such additional material as he now regards as appropriate, (2) enable the program coordinator to decide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>personal interviews would be helpful, and (3) to accord the coordinator or the prosecutor an opportunity to reconsider the application and to provide a statement of reasons directly and specifically responsive to the facts and circumstances of this case and this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The order appealed from is modified and we remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The Supreme Court Guidelines governing: pretrial intervention programs pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:28 were promulgated on September 8, 1976, and published in 99 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>Index Page 865 (1976). The relevant portion of Guideline 3 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Any defendant charged with crime is eligible for enrollment in a PTI program, but the nature of the offense is a factor to be considered in reviewing the application. If the crime was <em>* * * </em>deliberately committed with violence or threat of violence against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>another person * * * the defendant\u2019s application should generally be rejected. However, in such cases, the applicant shall have the opportunity to present to the program director, and through him to the prosecutor, any facts or materials demonstrating his amenability to the rehabilitative process, showing compelling reasons justifying his admission and establishing that a decision against enrollment would be arbitrary and unreasonable.
