Defendant subsequently entered pleas of guilty to all three counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">On the day fixed for sentencing the trial judge, over the objection of the prosecutor, merged the first and second counts of robbery \u201csince it was one criminal act in the true sense as we mean that,\u201d and sentenced defendant to a State Prison term of three to six years. A consecutive sentence of four to five years was imposed on the third count. Credit was given for the time defendant spent in custody while awaiting disposition of the charges. The sentences were sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>pended and defendant was placed on probation for a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The State thereupon filed in this court a motion for and was granted leave to appeal \u201cin lieu of prerogative writs\u201d to review the judgment of conviction insofar as it pertained to the merging of the first and second counts and the suspension of the sentence imposed on the third count. The contentions are that the merger was \u201cwithout legal justification\u201d and that the court had no \u201cstatutory authority to suspend the imposition of the term of imprisonment mandated by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-5.\u201d Although the asserted grounds of appeal are not within those enumerated in <em>R. </em>2:3-1(b), the State\u2019s theory is that the trial judge in each instance exceeded his authority, resulting in illegal sentences. See <em>State v. Sheppard, </em>125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>332, 335-336 (App. Div. 1973), certif. den. 64 <em>N. J. </em>318 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Addressing first the matter of the suspension of the sentence for the commission of the robberies while armed, we find no merit in the State\u2019s argument that since <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-5 prescribes additional punishment for armed criminals by imprisonment, in the ease of a first conviction, for not less than one nor more than ten years, the provision for a minimum term deprived the trial court of its power under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:168-1 to suspend that sentence. A trial judge may in the exercise of sound discretion make the separate sentence for being armed consecutive to the sentence for the crime, or concurrent thereto, or even suspend service of the separate sentence depending on the circumstances of the particular case. <em>State v. Jones, </em>66 <em>N. J. </em>563, 567 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">As for the merger of the two robbery counts, there is no doubt that the trial judge was mistaken in his concept that \u201cit was one criminal act in the true sense as we mean that.\u201d Where more than one person is robbed during the same holdup and each is relieved of his money or valuables, the culprit does not commit \u201ca single act\u201d which simultaneously, without more, affects several individuals. \u201cAt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the very least, putting aside the more subjective element of placing each of the victims in fear, the crime with which the defendant was charged in each indictment required the commission of a separate and independent act with respect to each victim, <em>i. e., </em>the forcible taking of the victim\u2019s property.\u201d <em>State v. Hoag, </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>496, 502 (1956), aff\u2019d 356 <em>U. S. </em>464, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>829, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 913 (1958). See also <em>State v. Ford, </em>92 <em>N. J. Super. </em>356, 361 (App. Div. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Defendant agrees with the foregoing, but contends, nonetheless, that the trial judge acted properly in imposing a single sentence \u201cnotwithstanding the fact that the crimes did not \u2018merge\u2019 in a legal sense.\u201d However, the cases on which he relies are inapposite, for they involve the well-settled proposition that if \u201can accused has committed only one <em>offense, </em>he cannot be punished as if for two [emphasis supplied].\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N. J. </em>69, 77 (1975). <em>Cf. State v. Moran, </em>73 <em>N. J, </em>79 (1977) ; <em>State v. Richardson, </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>82 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The further argument advanced by defendant is that the trial judge\u2019s failure to impose a sentence on the second robbery count was neither illegal nor beyond his jurisdictional powers \u201cbecause he clearly had the right to suspend the imposition of sentence on that count.\u201d The short answer is that the trial judge did nothing at all with respect to it other than to impose one sentence for both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In light of defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of guilt as to both robberies, coupled with the trial judge\u2019s clear error in merging the two counts, we see no element of unfairness to defendant, or infringement of any of his constitutional rights, in requiring that each count be dealt with separately with respect to the imposition of sentence. Accordingly, we remand the matter to the trial judge with direction to recall defendant for sentencing on the remaining robbery count.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing. In all other respects, the appeal is dismissed. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
