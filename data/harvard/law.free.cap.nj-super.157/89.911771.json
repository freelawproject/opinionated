J. S. A. </em>58 :1-26, of plans for construction of a sanitary landfill on portions of a 13.5-acre tract of land located along the Whippany Biver in East Hanover Township, Morris County.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">On or about November 15, 1974 plaintiff made application to the Council for a stream encroachment permit that would allow him to conduct a landfill operation on the aforementioned premises. A permit was denied by letter dated April 3, 1975. The denial was predicated on the fact that the pi-oposed landfill would result in fill being placed in an area that was prone to inundation by flood waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>- After receipt-of the letter denying the permit plaintiff made a timely request for a hearing which was granted. The hearing was held on July 30, 1975 before a member of the Council. Plaintiff presented a written statement and witnesses. East Hanover Township and the East Hanover Environmental Commission, participating as objectors at the hearing, also presented witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">On October 20, 1975 the hearing officer issued her \u201cReport of Hearing and Recommendations.\u201d She r\u00e9coinmended that plaintiff\u2019s application for a permit to use his property as a sanitary landfill operation be denied and, further, that fill be removed from certain areas theretofore filed by plaintiff without the Council\u2019s approval. Plaintiff filed exceptions and objections to the.report. The full Council adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions and recommendations , -and \u2022 advised plaintiff accordingly by letter dated January- 19, 1976. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The property which is the subject matter of this action is a.-13.5-acre tract-of land located on the northerly side of Klinger Road in the' Township of East .Hanover. A portion of the-property is bounded by the .Whippany River. The flood elevation of the property, based on historical data compiled by the State, is 176 feet. Portions of the property had previously been filled to' as high as elevation 176 feet, without the approval of the Council. Plaintiffs present application seeks permission to fill approximately 3.55 acres heretofore relatively free- -of fill -to elevation 176 feet. Approximately 36,500 cubic yards of material would be- required. The 3.-55 acres in question are presently below flood elevation 176 and would be almost entirely flooded during severe floods.-; ' , \u2022 ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u25a0 Evidence adduced during the hearing indicated that the proposed- filling by plaintiff, of the 3.55 acres in question would resulf in a decrease-in the flood retention capacity in the area of the subject property. In addition, there was evidence showing-that the fill-placed on the property was causing sediments, and-debris-to--enter-the Whippany River, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>which otherwise would not be there. The Council concluded that if additional -fill were allowed that condition would worsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The hearing officer in her \u201cBeport of Hearing and Becommendations\u201d found that in fact the additional filling of plaintiff\u2019s land, as proposed, would result in a loss in flood retention which although a small loss if only the subject property was considered, would cause a major problem if other properties in the area were filled in a similar manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Plaintiff argues that the Council has no power to prohibit the filling of his land with inert material.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">New Jersey\u2019s stream encroachment legislation is- set forth in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:1\u201426.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">No structure within the natural and ordinary high water mark of any stream shall be made by any * *\u2019 * private person or corporation without notice to the commission, and in no case without complying with such conditions as the commission may prescribe for preserving the channel and providing for the flow of water therein to safeguard the public against danger from waters impounded or affected by such structure, * <em>* </em>*.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>This statutory language requires the commission (now the Council) to undertake broad inquiry into all stream encroachment applications submitted to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Since plaintiff\u2019s landfill is arguably not a structure within the ordinary highwater mark of a stream and the Council\u2019s action is not designed to preserve the channel of a stream, he asks us to set aside the determination of the Council. We find merit in his argument, but not for the reasons he advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Speaking of predecessor laws creating the State Water Policy Commission, in <em>Jersey City v. State Water Policy </em>Comm\u2019n, 118 <em>N. J. L. </em>72 (E. &amp; A. 1936), Justice Heher stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">This statute is, on well settled principles, to be liberally construed to advance its beneficent policy. While the [State Water Policy Commission\u2019s] jurisdiction is special and limited, <em>it possesses such powers as by fair implication and intendment are incident to the authority expressly granted for the attainment of the general legislative policy, </em>[at 76; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The court construed the language of what is now <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:1\u201426 to empower the Commission to consider the contamination of water impounded or affected by structures in a stream, even though the statute does not speak of potability, since the supply of clean and wholesome water was an outstanding objective of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">. [2] While it is apparent from <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:1\u201426 and related statutes (see, <em>e. g., N. J. S. A. </em>58:1-11) that the Council is charged with flood prevention, we believe that more than incidental powers is required to justify the regulation of landfill not within the natural and ordinary high water marks of a stream under that statute. This conclusion is based not only upon our reading of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:1-26 and related provisions, but also upon the express grant of such power by the Legislature to the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:16A-55:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">(a) The department is authorized to adopt, amend and repeal, rules and regulations concerning the development and use of land. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>in any designated floodway which shall be designed to preserve its flood carrying capacity and to minimize the threat to the public safety, health and general welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">(b) Provision may be made by the department for the waiver, according to definite criteria, of strict compliance with the rules and regulations, where necessary to alleviate hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">If the Legislature had intended to grant that power by implication under <em>N. J. S. A. 58 </em>:1-26, <em>we </em>believe it to be unlikely that it would have enacted <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:16A-55. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:1-26 is concerned only with the effect of structures (and now, alterations) within the high water marks of a stream on the normal flow of water in that stream. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:16A\u201455, on the other hand, is clearly intended to provide a means of regulating the use of land in areas outside the high water marks of streams when the land has been designated a \u201cfloodway.\u201d See, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:16A-51(d). We disagree with the State\u2019s contention that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:1-26 also required the Commission, and now the Council, to take into account the effect the structure involved and similar structures may have on the flood capacity of the drainage basin as a whole. We express no opinion as to the effect, if any, the designation of the area as a \u201cfloodway\u201d pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>58:16A-50 <em>et seq. </em>might have had on this application since, as the Council admits, regulations promulgated pursuant to that law are inoperative here.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The Council also found that the <em>existing </em>landfill is a contributor of sediments and debris to the Whippany River, presumably because the material utilized could affect the river by changing the channel due to accretion of sediment on downstream banks or simply by the blocking effect of debris in the stream. We believe that an admittedly liberal but proper construction of <em>N. J. S. A. 58 :1-26 </em>permits control of landfill in this respect. That part of the landfill which contributes such sediment and debris may be viewed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u2018\u2018structure\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> -within the high water of the stream, and' to the extent'that' the existing landfill violates the statute or any <em>applicable </em>regulations thereunder, the Council may order removal or repair. The Council\u2019s findings, under review here, only apply to existing landfill. Whether any part of the proposed landfill will have any similar deleterious effects will have to be considered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In view of our disposition as set forth herein, we find it unnecessary to pass on the other arguments raised by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The determination of the Water Policy and Supply Council is reversed and the cause is. remanded to the Council for a consideration of the effect the proposed landfill would have on the Whippany River, and also any modifications to tlie existing and proposed landfill which might be effected to remedy that problem. At the hearing to be conducted, plaintiff should be afforded the opportunity to propose modifications that might alleviate the problem of sediment and,'debris with regard to both the existing and proposed landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">On December 14, 1972 New Jersey\u2019s flood hazard legislation became effective. <em>N. J. S.
