J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ASf\">The County of Hudson obtained a judgment against defendants in the Hudson County District Court for $818 for services rendered in November 1973 to Mrs. Hernandez at the Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Defendants appeal, contending they were entitled to free care because they were indigent when the services were rendered. When we rendered our decision on November 10, 1976 we did not decide whether defendants were indigent when the hospital services were rendered. Instead, we held they were obligated to pay because they did not assert their indigency when the services were rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The Supreme Court granted certification on February 1, 1977. 73 <em>N. J. </em>60 (1977). On December 6, 1977 it reversed and held that \u201cthe issues concerning the effect of the failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>to assert indigency at the time of hospital admission and waiver or estoppel with respect to a later claim of indigency are not relevant to the basic issue of indigency and the entitlement of an indigent person to hospital care without charge under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:9-26 * * *.\u201d 75 <em>N. J. </em>543. It remanded the matter to us to decide whether the trial judge had erred in determining that defendants were not indigent at the time the hospital services were rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital was owned and operated by the County of Hudson when' defendant Mrs. Hernandez gave birth to a child there. Ownership of the hospital has since been transferred to the City of Jersey City. At the time in question it was the only county maternity hospital in the State controlled by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:9-26, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">A maternity hospital established under section 30:9-24 of this Title shall be used exclusively for the care and treatment of persons in the county requiring the care and attention for which such hospital was intended whether such persons be indigent or non-indigent. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">As we noted in our earlier opinion, it is acknowledged by the litigants that the act necessarily implies that the hospital is not authorized to impose charges for services to indigents.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Unfortunately, unlike statutes dealing with other types of hospitals and a variety of services to indigents under varying situations, this statute does not define indigency or give any indication of how to determine who is entitled to free care. Left with no specific guidelines we are compelled to construe the term \u201cindigent\u201d having in min'd the legislative intent sought to be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Eeference to out-of-state cases dealing with similar statutes is helpful in disposing of the issue before us. In <em>Montana Deaconess Hosp. v. Lewis and Clark Cty., </em>149 <em>Mont. </em>206, 425 <em>P. </em>2d 316, 318 (1967), the Montana Supreme Court interpreted the term \u201cmedical indigency\u201d as describing \u201cthose persons unable to provide such necessities [as</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>medical care] for themselves by reason of age, infirmity or misfortune.\u201d In <em>St. Patrick Hosp. v. Powell Cty., </em>156 <em>Mont. </em>153, 477 <em>P. </em>2d 340 (1970), the sam\u00e9 court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">In construing our'-welfare statutes, we do, not understand the legislative, intent to be .that in-order for a person to.be an- \u201cindigent, person\u201d within the meaning .thereof, to receive medical assistance there must be a total lack of resources. Rather, we believe the legislative intent -was to include those persons who do not' have the present \u2022 or future hope of resources sufficient to pay for all the medical- and hospital services required in emergency instances; [47.7 P. 2d. 343]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Appellate Court of .Indiana, in <em>Parkview Memorial Hosp. v. DeKalb Cty., </em>134 <em>Ind. App. </em>689, 191 <em>N. E. </em>2d 116. (1963), defined the term \u201cindigent person\u201d to include \u201cthose, persons who did not have resources sufficient to pay for all the medical and hospital .services- required by the injury.\u201d 191 <em>N. E; </em>2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The Supreme Court of Vermont, in <em>Destitute of Bennington Cty. v. Henry W. Putnam Memorial Hosp., </em>125 <em>Vt. </em>289, 215 <em>A. </em>2d 134 (1965), rejected the argument that \u201cindigent\u201d was synonymous with \u201cdestitute.\u201d . \u201e . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had oq-. casion to interpret the words \u201cpauper\u201d and \u201ca person in need of public .assistance\u201d in <em>Massachusetts General Hosp. v. City of Revere, </em>346 Mass. 217, 191 <em>N. E. </em>2d 120. (1963). It said-that the .terms, included \u201ca patient who appears to be unable to avail -himself of his.assets,, if any, sufficiently rapidly to. meet necessary. hospital expenses in ordinary course.\u201d 191 <em>N. E. </em>2d at 123-124.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The California District Court of Appeals, provided another-definition. In <em>Madison v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>106 <em>Cal. </em>App. 2d 232, <em>234.P. </em>2d 995, 1002 (1951), hearing, den. 106 <em>Cal. </em>App. <em>2d 232, 236 P. </em>2d 141 (Sup. Ct. 1951), that court held that ,the expression \u201cunable - to pay for her,necessary care\u201d, used in the California statute meant \u201ca person who has-insufficient-.means.-to,, pay. .for.,his. maintenance; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>in a private hospital after providing for those who legally claim his support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">It is our view that the approach to the problem by the California courts squares with the intent of our Legislature in adopting <em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:9-24 and 30:9-26. And to avoid any misunderstanding, we hold that a person need not be impoverished or devoid of all assets to qualify as an indigent under, these statutes. See Annotation, \u201cDetermination of Indigency of Accused Entitling him to Appointment of Counsel,\u201d 51 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 1108 (1973); Ventantonio, \u201cEqual Justice Under the Law,\u201d 7 <em>Set on Hall L. Rev. </em>233 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">At the time Mrs. Hernandez was admitted to the hospital, her husband earned about $80 a week net. From this amount he had to pay $125 a month for rent, as well as all bills for food, gas, electricity, transportation and other necessities. Defendants had no savings or any other assets. Regardless of what test to determine indigency is used, it is crystal clear that these defendants did not have sufficient resources to pay for the care furnished for Mrs. Hernandez\u2019 stay at the hospital'. These defendants, therefore, were \u201cindigent\u201d within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:9-24 and 30:9-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The judgment below is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
