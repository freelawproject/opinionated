Originally, the Department sought to reduce her grant on the ground that the \u201cfather [of one of her children] Morris Taggart is living in your home thus causing a change in the eligible unit [per] 111.2 ASH * * The foregoing language is taken from the notice of November 12, 1976 which advised appellant of the proposed reduction and the reason therefor. Appellant responded with a request for a fair hearing on the issue raised and one was held on December 20. 1976. At the hearing the agency\u2019s proofs all related to the matter in issue, Morris Taggart\u2019s alleged residence with appellant and her children. They were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">(1) all of Taggart\u2019s mail is received at Ms. Shannon\u2019s home;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">(2) the utilities were billed in Taggart\u2019s name;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">(3) the lease upon Ms. Shannon\u2019s home was taken out in Taggart\u2019s name;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">(4) Taggart\u2019s driver\u2019s license and automobile registration listed Ms. Shannon\u2019s address as Taggart\u2019s;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">(5) a letter sent to Taggart\u2019s supposed East Orange address was returned with no forwarding address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">Appellant countered this evidence with an explanation that the utility bills were in Taggart\u2019s name because she had out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>standing and unpaid bills in her name; her address was on Taggart\u2019s automobile registration because insurance rates in Perth Amboy were lower than they were in East Orange where Taggart lived with his sister. Appellant testified that although Taggart visited her often, he did not live with her but with his sister from whom he rented a room. Although his residence with his sister was confirmed by one of appellant\u2019s friends, the hearing officer recommended that the reduction be confirmed, finding that Taggart did live with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In exceptions to the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions contained in a letter of January 21, 1977, other evidence was referred to, including letters from appellant\u2019s landlord and a rent receipt from Taggart\u2019s sister showing that he did rent a room from her. A letter from the East Orange Post Office also tended to demonstrate that Taggart lived in that municipality and not with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The Director of the New Jersey Division of Public Welfare concluded on the basis of all evidence submitted that Taggart did not live with appellant, nonetheless, in light of appellant\u2019s testimony during the hearing that \u201cMr. T. visits frequently, his child cannot be considered as deprived of parental care [and] support\u201d by reason of the \u201ccontinued absence\u201d of a parent \u201cin accord with the provisions of Public Assistance Manual 2533.\u201d Appellant\u2019s grant was, accordingly, reduced to \u201c$207 based on a household of three and an eligible unit of two persons [excluding Mr. T.\u2019s child].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Appellant raises several substantive points of argument, all of which, in our view, lack merit. First, appellant contends that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccontinued absence\u201d as excluding frequent visitation by a purportedly \u201cabsent\u201d parent raised an irrebuttable and improper presumption that the child is being supported by the visiting parent. In making this argument appellant discloses a fundamental misconception concerning the purpose and scope of the federally-funded AFDC assistance pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>gram. Although the financial need of a child is an essential condition to eligibility under the program, need alone is insufficient. The protection afforded by the AEDC program extends to children who are found to be in need of financial assistance and who, while living in New Jersey, have \u201cbeen deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>44:10-1(e). Hence, the program was designed to protect a clearly distinguishable group of children in need of financial assistance, those lacking a parent through death, physical or' mental incapacity or continued absence. See, <em>King v. Smith, </em>392 <em>U. S. </em>309, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>2128, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1118 (1968). This limitation on those eligible for benefits thereunder is emphasized by the deletion in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>44:10-1(c) (1) of a provision extending protection to a child living with both parents where the father is unemployed or the earnings of both parents are insufficient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Clearly, under the law pertinent to the present controversy, eligibility for benefits was determined not only by financial need but by the absence of a parent whether by reason of death, incapacity or continued absence, this latter condition independent of financial support being needed or provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Hence, the irrebuttable presumption of which appellant complains neither exists, nor was invoked, nor was involved. The agency did not presume that Taggart supported the child because he visited. It only determined that his visits negated one condition for eligibility under the AEDC program, continued absence. Had Taggart actually lived with appellant and his child, his unemployment would have precluded a contribution to the child\u2019s financial resources; the child would have been just as needy with Taggart living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>at home. Nonetheless, and under the clear wording of the act as it existed during the time pertinent to this appeal, appellant would have been ineligible because one parent was not continuously absent. Limiting the scope of the AEDC program to those coming within the terms of its protection, Congress envisioned that programs of \u201cwork relief\u201d and other programs affording financial assistance would alleviate the plight of those needy children not covered by the AEDC program. <em>King v. Smith, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"> Appellant\u2019s remaining substantive contentions, flowing from the above, are similarly without merit. Section 2533 of the <em>Public Assistance Manual, </em>the regulation defining \u201ccontinued absence,\u201d is almost identical in content to the federal regulation found in 45 <em>C. F. B. </em>\u00a7 233.90(c) (iii) and hence cannot realistically be viewed as in violation of federal law and the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Nor is the regulation invalid as undermining the jrablic policy of this State to foster parent-child relationships through visitation by the noncustodial parent. Although it may or may not have that effect in practice, such is not a ground for invalidation. Courts do not pass on the essential wisdom of legislative action. <em>Hudson County News Co. v. Sills, </em>41 <em>N. J. </em>220, 229 (1963); <em>Grand Union Co. v. Sills, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>390, 403 (1964). Nor does this regulation or the legislation it implements violate equal protection guarantees. As noted in <em>N. J. Chapt., Am. I. P. v. N. J. State Bd. of Prof. Planners, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>581 (1967) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">Equal protection is not denied because a regulatory statute might have gone farther than it did, or might have included some persons or classes of persons who were excluded. Regulatory need in a particular field may appear to the legislative mind in different dimensions and proportions; as more acute in one area than in another. Consequently the reform may proceed one step at a time, addressing itself to the aspect of the problem which seems the most pressing. The Legislature may feel that a sufficiently identifiable- group or class of people operating partly or wholly in the field under consideration and already subject to some regulation does not present the- sam\u00e9 problem as those seeking to practice in the field without having met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>any publicly imposed standards of competence. In short, equal protection does not demand immediate logical tidiness; nor is it violated because the legislation as enacted does not bring about the full reform or result intended to be produced. In an area of many competing pressures the constitution is satisfied if the Legislature, in responding to what it conceiyed to be living facts calling for regulation, did not disregard reasons in drawing its lines. That those lines might have been drawn more suitably in light of the whole problem is not a matter for judicial re-examination. Classification is a perennial and difficult problem, capable of no doctrinaire solution. Basically the solution resides in the legislative domain and the judiciary will not intrude unless the classes established for separate treatment represent invidious discrimination, that is, treatment which has no rational basis in relation to the specific objective of the regulatory legislation, [at 602]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Although we hold appellant\u2019s substantive arguments to be without merit, we nonetheless conclude that the notice and the hearing held pursuant thereto were deficient. The notice which resulted in the hearing advised appellant that her grant was being reduced because Taggart, the father of one of her children, was living with her. It was with respect to that issue, whether Taggart was living with her, that evidence was adduced both by the agency and by appellant. Indeed, the hearing concluded with the hearing officer finding that Taggart did live with her. It was only during the final administrative appellate process that a new issue emerged, whether Taggart visited her with sufficient frequency to deny eligibility on a finding there was not \u201ccontinued absence\u201d of a parent. That issue was resolved against appellant without evidence being purposefully adduced with respect to it or without hearing any argument thereon. In our view, fundamental fairness, as well as administrative rule PAM 6312 required that appellant be advised of the new issue under consideration, be afforded the opportunity of offering evidence thereon, and be permitted to direct argument to that point. Such opportunity was foreclosed because the issue emerged and was resolved without appellant\u2019s knowledge or participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>We, therefore, vacate the determination appealed from and remand to the Division with instructions to hold a hearing concerning the frequency and length of Taggart\u2019s visit to the Shannon household and concerning any other matter deemed relevant to a determination as to whether Taggart\u2019s absence from the Shannon household was \u201ccontinued\u201d within the meaning of PAM 2533. Resumption of payment of the difference between what appellant claims and what she has been receiving by way of the reduced grant shall await disposition of the hearing on remand and be in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the mandate of this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> After plaintiff filed her claim <em>N. J. S.
