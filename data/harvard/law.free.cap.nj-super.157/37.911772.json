A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AxG\">Defendant appeals his conviction .of rape <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:138-1), which allegedly was perpetrated on May 19, 1974. He contends that he is entitled to a re: versal of his conviction for two reasons. The first reason, he submits, is that the trial judge erroneously limited his cross-examination of the victim as to her prior unchaste acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>At the time of the trial the victim, who testified, was visibly pregnant. Defendant\u2019s attorney was permitted to interrogate her as to the fact she was unmarried and as to the name of the putative father of her unborn child. However the judge would not permit the attorney to question the victim as to particular sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"> Defendant asserts that, since his defense was based on the victim\u2019s alleged consent, he was thus foreclosed from showing that she was \u201cpromiscuous,\u201d a trait of character allegedly supporting his defense, because a jury could infer from that trait of immorality that the victim was more likely to have consented. We reject this contention. The law of our State at the time of the trial did not compei the admission of such testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The extent of cross-examination rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. He may exclude inquiry of a complaining witness in a prosecution on cross-examination as to sexual acts on other occasions with persons other than the defendant. \u201cBut cross-examination upon proper foundation has been permitted with respect to the complaining witness\u2019s general reputation for chastity, or lack of it, as bearing on the issue of consent in a rape case.\u201d <em>State v. Steele, </em>92 <em>N. J. Super. </em>498, 504 (App. Div. 1966). See also <em>State v. Raymond, </em>74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>434, 439 (App. Div. 1962), appeal dism\u2019d 39 <em>N. J. </em>241 (1963)<em>; State v. Rubertone, </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>285, 287 (E. &amp; A. 1916). Since defendant sought to show particular sexual acts, defendant\u2019s effort to show such conduct was properly rejected by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In any event, defendant\u2019s attorney argued to the jury that, from the victim\u2019s pregnancy and her unmarried state, she was \u201cpromiscuous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The second reason advanced by defendant for a reversal of his conviction is that the judge commenced to charge the jury on the last day of the trial in the absence of defendant\u2019s attorney. The judge was scheduled to charge the jury at 9:00 a.m. Neither defendant nor his attorney appeared at that time. At approximately 9 :30 a.m. defendant arrived and the judge commenced to instruct the jury. Defendant\u2019s attorney arrived during the delivery of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">When the judge completed his presentation of the charge the attorney apologized to the court for the delay, attributing it to traffic congestion. During the jury\u2019s deliberations the stenographic reporter. read to defendant\u2019s attorney that portion of the charge which he had not heard. He stated that he had no question (objections) to the charge itself. He conjectured that he was absent during about 18 minutes of the time when the charge was delivered. He then moved for a mistrial solely because \u201cit was highly prejudicial to my client in front of the jury.\u201d The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Fundamentally, defendant contends that the mere fact that his counsel was not in the courtroom during approximately 18 minutes while a portion of the court\u2019s charge was being delivered automatically entitles him to relief. He suggests that he was actually prejudiced because of something that the jury might have suspected from his attorney\u2019s absence, or that something unduly prejudicial may have occurred in the courtroom during that absence which defendant himself would not have detected. We are inclined to the belief that defendant\u2019s argument is more fanciful than real and is founded on impermissible conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We agree that a defendant has a constitutional right' to have counsel represent him at all stages of a criminal trial. <em>Gideon v. </em>Wainwright, 372 <em>U. S. </em>335, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>792, 9 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 799 (1963); <em>Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt et al., </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>281 (1971). But the court here did not exclude counsel. He failed to appear. We would have hoped that the judge would have inquired as to the cause of the delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>before commencing the charge without awaiting the presence of the attorney. We are not told whether the attorney had previously been tardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We have no doubt that there was no prejudicial infringement of defendant\u2019s right to counsel, for even \u201cconstitutional\u201d errors may be harmless. <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>325, 340 (1971). A somewhat similar occurrence was dealt with in <em>Commonwealth v. Ashe, </em>168 <em>Pa. Super. </em>267, 77 <em>A. </em>2d 684 (Super. Ct. 1951), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Presecan v. Claudy, </em>342 <em>U. S. </em>841, 72 <em>S. Ct. </em>70, 96 <em>L. Ed. </em>635 (1951), where the attorney for one of several defendants in a criminal case voluntarily absented himself during a portion of the court\u2019s charge. Defendant sought to reverse his conviction on several grounds, including said absence. The court denied relief to the defendant, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">There is no averment that relator suffered any harm by the action of his counsel or that counsel was not present at the conclusion of the charge of the court to take an exception or exceptions thereto. It is not averred that there was any unfairness in his trial or that the verdict and sentence were improper. Relator has not shown any circumstances which could be said to amount to a denial of due process. See Commonwealth ex rel. Master v. Baldi, 166 Pa. Super. 413, 418, 72 A. 2d 150. Relator\u2019s present attempt to be released on habeas corpus is without any merit or justification. [77 <em>A. </em>2d at 686]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\"><em>State v. LaPierre, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>156, 173 (1963), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Bisignano v. New Jersey, </em>374 <em>U. S. </em>852, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1920, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1073 (1963), held that a judge\u2019s interrogation of a juror in the absence of counsel for the purpose of ascertaining what was troubling the juror did not infringe on defendant\u2019s right to have counsel present.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Finding no prejudicial error in the proceedings, the conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"Axr\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> It will be noted that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:84A-32.1 as to evidence of a complaining witness\u2019s previous sexual conduct was not effective at the time of the alleged commission of the crime by defendant. It became effective on August 26, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
