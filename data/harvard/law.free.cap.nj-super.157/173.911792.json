A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AhB\">Plaintiff, a licensed real estate broker, sued for and recovered at the hands of a jury a judgment in the sum of $291,900 (later amended to $346,473.25 to reflect the addition of prejudgment interest) in this action predicated upon the theory that one or all of defendants tortiously interfered with its prospective advantage as a real estate broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Defendants named in the action, which was filed in January 1974, were Raymond E. Reitman, individually, and three corporations apparently controlled by him .(the Reitman defendants) ; Angelo Cali together with certain named individuals and a corporation controlled by them (the Cali defendants) ; and Dominick Alfieri, individually, and M. Alfieri Co., Inc., a corporation (Alfieri Co.), together with others (the Alfieri defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Each group of defendants answered plaintiff\u2019s complaint and crossclaimed for contribution and indemnification against the others. All defendants moved for summary judgment in their favor on the ground that they could not, as a matter of law, be responsible' for real estate brokerage commissions on the facts presented. On Pebruary 17, 1976 the judge entered an order granting summary judgment only for the Reitman defendants, thereby dismissing the complaint and all crossclaims against them with prejudice. Application for leave to appeal by the Alfieri and Cali defendants was denied by us. The case proceeded to trial against the Alfieri and Cali defendants' for eight days during the latter part of March and early part of April 1976. The jury returned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>stated verdict for plaintiff against the Alfieri defendants, only,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which verdict was molded to the sum of $291,900.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury\u2019s verdict exonerated the Cali defendants. The Alfieri defendants unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on the ground that the verdicts were against the weight of the evidence and for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>On June 28, 1976 the Alfieri defendants filed their notice of appeal from the judgment entered against them in favor of plaintiff and the judgment entered in favor of the Cali defendants, and from the summary judgment in favor of the Eeitman defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Plaintiff, as a licensed real estate broker, was at all times before and during the history of this litigation in the real estate business, specializing in industrial real estate brokerage, including factory sites, warehouse sites and industrial buildings. Before 1972 plaintiff had sold land to and for the Eeitman defendants both in Newark and Camden. These defendants operated a wholesale liquor business under two names \u2014 Galsworthy, Inc. and Eeitman Industries \u2014 and a real estate business under the name of Boekingham Eealty. The principal figure of the Eeitman defendants was defendant Baymond E. Eeitman. Plaintiff\u2019s representatives in the transactions leading to this litigation were Theodore E. Stein and Bernard Zimmel.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">For many years before 1968 the Eeitman defendants\u2019 headquarters, including their warehouse, were located on Frelinghuysen Avenue in Newark, in premises originally located for them by plaintiff. In 1968, wishing to expand, they gave plaintiff Blau an assignment to find a new location for them \u2014 either a new warehouse and office building or land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>upon which they could construct a new building. Although at first Reitman was \u2022 interested in relocating to Middlesex or northern Union County, by 1972 his interest was narrowed to the West Essex County area. Blau undertook to find suitable land within the perimeter of the West Essex County area drawn by Reitman on a map which Reitman gave to Stein and Zimmel. By the summer of 1972, after the inspection of numerous properties suggested by plaintiff, Reitman\u2019s interest focused on an approximately 44-aere unimproved tract of land identified as Essex-Passaic Industrial Park in West Caldwell, which had been among those suggested by Stein. Reitman asked Stein for more information on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Extensive investigation of the details of this property was conducted by plaintiff in the fall of 1972. The property was owned by Cali Well-Cald Associates, a partnership named as part of the Cali group of defendants. Negotiations looking toward a sale of all or part of the tract commenced in December 1972 between Angelo- Cali and \u201cIggy\u201d Seminara, both experienced builders and developers, as the active principals for the sellers, and Reitman and David Lowenstein, a vice-president of Galsworthy, Inc., for the Reitman defendants, as a result of plaintiff\u2019s bringing the parties together. Stein and Zimmel participated in these negotiations on behalf of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Initially Reitman, who acted for the Reitman defendants, was interested in buying 11 to 15 acres or in having Cali build the desired improvements and lease them back to Reitman with an option to purchase. Plaintiff arranged a meeting between Cali and Reitman on December 13, 1972. At this meeting Cali offered to sell the entire tract of approximately 40 acres, but the offer was rejected since the Reitman defendants were only interested in acquiring sufficient acreage to accommodate the construction of their proposed warehouse and offices. Cali quoted a price of $42,500 an acre net after commissions and told Stein that the price would be increased by whatever amount the broker was to be paid as commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>With the statute of frauds <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>25:1-9) in mind, on December <em>7, 1972 </em>Blau wrote a letter to Cali confirming the December 13, 1912 meeting, which letter in part stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">These people [Reitman defendants] have inspected the acreage which you own at the above captioned property and are interested in discussing the possibilities of acquiring a site suitable for a distribution center with an initial building of 150,000 sq. ft. and ultimate expansion to 200,000 sq. ft. They have inspected this site on several occasions with us and would now like to get together with you to see whether or not a satisfactory size piece can be purchased at a mutually agreeable price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">For the record, we wish to advise you that if you complete a sale of your property at the above address to the aforementioned company's [sic] or any individuals representing them, or to any company affiliated with said companys [sic], you will be obliged to pay us a commission equal to 10% of the purchase price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">While they are not primarily interested in having a building built to suit on a lease basis, in the event some such arrangement develops you will be obligated to pay us a commission equal to 5% of the total aggregate rental on the terms of any lease as well as any option, renewal, or extension periods as well as for the rental for any additional area constructed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">After that meeting Blau again wrote to Cali. Pertinently this letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">Mr. Ray Reitman and his associates advised us that they were very anxious to secure from you as soon as possible the various proposals and avenues for working up a deal that were explored and discussed at the meeting. We are anxious, therefore, for you to come up with proposals for the outright purchase of twelve t0' fifteen acres, the possible erection of a building built to suit using the specifications which were given to you by Mr. Reitman. Such a building would be built on the basis of a long-term lease with an option to buy. There are also the possibilities for the construction by you of a building on a suitable site which would be sold by you upon completion. The fourth possibility of course was the outright purchase of your entire property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">As per our previous letter of December 7, please be advised for the record that you will be obligated to pay us a commission equal to 10% of the selling price for any acreage sold to the above captioned companies, or any individuals representing it, or to any company affiliated with said companies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In the ease of a lease, you will be obligated to pay us a commission equal to 5% of the total aggregate rental for the term of the lease and any options, renewals, extensions or revisions thereof, as well as any additions which might be added to the building in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">In the ease of an outright sale of a building which you would construct, the commission would be equal to 5% of the total selling price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Reitman had not decided whether he wanted to purchase the land, wanted Cali to construct a building to lease to him or wanted to combine a short-term lease with an option to purchase. Therefore, on January 5, 1973, the Cali defendants submitted a number of proposals to Reitman in an effort to crystalize the purchaser\u2019s thoughts about the property. Cali prepared drawings of possible buildings which could be built on the property, and he provided alternative financial arrangements, such as sale of land, sale of land and buildings, lease with an option to buy, <em>etc. </em>Reitman remained indecisive as to how to pr ceed. On February 22 representatives of Cali, Reitman and Blau met at the office of David Mandelbaum, the attorney engaged by Reitman, to discuss the possible transaction. Although Reitman objected to Cali\u2019s price as being too high, that is, approximately $42,500 an acre net to the Cali defendants, some tentative agreement was reached for the Reitman defendants to purchase a portion of the Cali defendants\u2019 property. The transaction was to be solely a purchase of land, because Reitman planned at that time to undertake his own construction of the warehouse and office complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The total price that Reitman had orally agreed to pay for the land at the February 22 meeting was about $675,000, depending on the final number of acres multiplied by the gross $47,500 an acre price. This amount included a brokerage commission for Blau of $67,500. In addition, Reitman also agreed, as part of the brokerage commission in his purchase of the Cali property, to give Blau exclusive contracts to sell the two Reitman properties in Newark which would be vacated upon the move to West Caldwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Between February <em>22 </em>and March 1, 1973 Beitman had changed his mind as to purchasing the property and had decided on a long-term lease alternative. On or about March 1, 1973 David Mandelbaum, Beitman\u2019s attorney, went to Cali\u2019s home and informed him of this decision. Beitman then retained an architect to draw plans for the building that he wanted on the property and to get competitive bids indicating what the construction cost would be and what the rental price would be. Mandelbaum and Cali discussed these developments and agreed that Beitman could put the building up for competitive bids and that Cali would be included as one of the bidders, but also that Cali would be given the \u201clast look,\u201d or the opportunity to meet the other bids, so as to insure him the right to build. No binding agreement of any kind was executed between any of the Cali or the Beitman defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">By April 1, 1973 the architect\u2019s plan had been completed and forwarded to Cali and three independent builders, all prospective landlords, with a request for a per square foot rental figure on a long-term net lease to Beitman. All bidders were told to assume a purchase price for the land and to include a commission for Blau in the amount of $67,500. All bids were received by the third week in April 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In the meantime Beitman and Cali had jointly applied to the planning board of West Caldwell to obtain approval of Beitman\u2019s intended use of the property. Beitman and Seminara appeared before the board between March 12 and April 3, 1973 for this purpose, and use approval was granted on April 4, 1973. When the bids came in the Siegler Construction Company bid of $1.49 a square foot was the lowest. Cali\u2019s bid was $1.70 a square foot. A meeting between Beitman and Cali was scheduled for May 3, 1973 to review the bids, inasmuch as Cali had the \u201clast look.\u201d Suddenly, however, at the beginning of May the Cali-Beitman deal came to an abrupt halt; Blau and Beitman learned accidentally that Alfieri had acquired the subject land. Actually, Cali through Alfieri had entered into an agreement of sale with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>a nominee of Alfieri, Crest\u00f3n Realty, Inc., on April 18, 1973, subject to a contingency made dependent on what test borings would disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">It appears that Alfieri and Cali had met and discussed the property beginning in January or February 1973, and by March 16, 1973 they had reached a meeting of the minds that Alfieri would purchase the entire property from Cali for $44,696 an acre.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The purchase contract between Alfieri and Cali was kept secret from both Blau and Reitman. When Mandelbaum and Zimmel learned of the Alfieri purchase, Seminara at first denied that the property had been sold to Alfieri. On April 25, 1973, even after Cali had executed the contract for the sale of the property to Alfieri, Cali submitted a bid in his own name to build and lease to Reitman. This bid of $1.70 a square foot had been supplied to Cali by Alfieri.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">When plainitff and Reitman learned of the sale to Alfieri they cancelled a meeting scheduled with Cali for May 3, 1973. Mandelbaum then asked Alfieri to meet with Reitman and him at Reitman\u2019s office on May 4, 1973.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This meeting was attended by Reitman, Alfieri, Stein, Mandelbaum and Lowenstein. A long-term lease to Reitman was discussed. Alfieri refused to recognize plaintiff as a broker or to pay any commission, notwithstanding Reitman\u2019s contention that since Alfieri\u2019s bid and price with respect to the lease was that originally submitted by Cali and was to include a commission, it should be paid by Alfieri. Subsequently, a 20-year lease was negotiated between said Crest\u00f3n Associates and Galsworthy, Inc., one of the Reitman defendants, which did not provide for the payment of any commission. Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tional pertinent facts will be mentioned in conjunction with a discussion of the specific arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Unfortunately there was no pretrial conference in this fairly complicated case and, as a result, although extensive depositions and other discovery had taken place in advance of the trial, the issues and claims were not as well defined as they might otherwise have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">At oral argument counsel for the Alfieri defendants candidly conceded that the jury could have properly found a verdict against them on the thesis advanced by plaintiff. He asserted, however, that prejudicial errors committed by the trial judge so tainted the verdict that they are entitled to the relief sought. Before proceeding to a consideration of the alleged errors we need to refer to the nature of the tort for which plaintiff sought to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The law not only protects one from unjustifiable interference with one\u2019s contract by another but it also protects a person\u2019s interest in reasonable expectation of economic advantage. <em>Harris v. Perl, </em>41 <em>N. J. </em>455, 462 (1964); <em>Mayflower Industries v. Thor Corp., </em>15 <em>N. J. Super. </em>337, 339 (Ch. Div. 1951), aff\u2019d o. b. 9 <em>N. J. </em>605 (1952). One who unlawfully interferes with that interest will be held liable for the damage sustained by the victim of that interference. <em>Mayflower Industries v. Thor Corp., supra </em>at 339. Accordingly, the right to pursue the real estate brokerage business is one of the property rights or interests which the law protects against unlawful interference. <em>Louis Kamm, Inc. v. Flink, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>582 (E. &amp; A. 1934). If unlawful means are employed, such as fraud or intimidation, or if the means consist of acting without justifiable cause (malice) so that a person suffers injury to his business, he may secure redress for his damage. <em>McCue v. Deppert, </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>591 (App. Div. 1952). There must be proof not only of the unlawful, intentional interference with the prospect of reasonable expectation of economic advantage, but also proof that if there had been no interference there was a reasonable probability that the victim of the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ferenee would have received the anticipated <em>economic </em>benefits. <em>Myers v. Arcadio, Inc., </em>73 <em>N. J. Super. </em>493, 498 (App. Div. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">As stated in <em>Sustick v. Slatina, </em>48 <em>N. J. Super. </em>134 (App. Div. 1957) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">In this area of the law the use of such expressions as conspire, unlawful, malicious, etc., has been criticized as beclouding judgment and clear thinking in the formulation of rules of liability. See <em>Weinstein v. Clementsen, </em>20 <em>N. J. Super. </em>367, 371 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952). Yet a degree of generality in the criteria which will suffice to spell out liability in any given case of this kind is unavoidable. The essence of the cases in this field is that in adjudging whether what the defendant has done is actionable, <em>i. e., </em>not done in the exercise of an equal or superior right, the ultimate inquiry is whether the conduct was \u201cboth injurious and transgressive of generally accepted standards of common morality or of law.\u201d <em>Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove Memorial Park, </em>43 <em>N. J. Super. </em>244, 255 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). In other words, was the interference by defendant \u201csanctioned by the \u2018rules of the game.\u2019 \u201d 1 <em>Harper and James </em>[Torts], <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 6.11, <em>p. </em>510 [1956] <em>; cf. Trautwein v. Harbourt, </em>40 <em>N. J. Super. </em>247, 267, 268 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956). There can be no tighter test of liability in this area than that of the common conception of what is right and just dealing under the circumstances. Not only must defendants\u2019 motive and purpose be proper but so also must the means. <em>Louis Hamm, Inc., v. Flink, supra </em>(113 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>p. </em>589). [at 144]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Of course the law affords protection of a business entrepreneur only as against wrongful acts of third persons \u2014 not against fair and legitimate competition. <em>McCann v. Biss, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>301 (1974); <em>George F. Hewson Co. v. Hopper, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>525 (E. &amp; A. 1943); <em>Sustick v. Slatina, supra; Weinstein v. Clementsen, supra. </em>See also, <em>Ass\u2019n Group Life, Inc. v. Catholic War Veterans, </em>120 <em>N. J. Super. </em>85, 98 (App. Div. 1971), mod. 61 <em>N. J. </em>150 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">We are satisfied in the light of the foregoing that the trial judge properly submitted to the jury the issue of whether the Cali defendants or the Alfieri defendants, or both, unjustifiably interfered with plaintiff\u2019s reasonable expectation of compensation for its services as a broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Neither our own endeavors nor those of counsel have produced any case with a similar factual pattern. All of the successful brokerage commission tortious-interference cases in our own State follow a pattern whereby one of the parties to a sale has by fraud, deceit or subterfuge endeavored to escape payment of commissions on sales of real estate. The instant case presents a novel factual pattern. But each case must be decided upon individual facts. <em>Myers v. Arcadio, Inc., supra. </em>As stated by Judge Conford for the court in <em>Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove Memorial Park, </em>43 <em>N. J. Super. </em>244 (App. Div. 1957) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">* * * The novelty of a specific occasion for application of a principle in this field is no reason for according it a chilly reception. [Citation omitted.] What is called for is a reasonable accommodation within the framework of the remedial principle of claims for relief against behavior which is both injurious and transgressive of generally accepted standards of common morality or of law. [Citation omitted.] <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The very nature of the tort prohibits a \u201crule of thumb\u201d in every case. 1 <em>Harper and James, Law of Toris. </em>\u00a7 6.12 at 515 (1956). But where it appears to the judge as in this case, from sufficient facts and the legitimate inferences therefrom, that the elements of the tort may be present, including conduct which was both injurious and transgressive of generally accepted standards of common morality or of law, it is then for the jury or the fact finder to decide the issue. <em>Cf. Myers v. Arcadio, supra </em>73 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\"><em>Harris v. Perl, supra, </em>particularly supports our view. In that case plaintiff, a licensed real estate broker, sought damages from, among others, her prospective purchasers of a residential property, under the theory that the latter had tortiously interfered with plaintiff\u2019s reasonable expectation of economic advantage. In upholding recovery, the court determined that defendants did not observe the rules of \u201cfair play,\u201d because when they learned that Cronin, the owner, had transferred title to a bank during negotiations, said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u201cfair play would require a prospective purchaser to permit the broker to seek recognition by the owner, unenticed by the purchaser\u2019s offer to deal directly.\u201d (41 <em>N. J. </em>at 464).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In the instant case the contention that a broker takes his chances on whether his efforts result in the consummation of a sale or lease and that he \u201cwins some and loses some\u201d is beside the point. Nor is the contention that the Cali defendants and the Alfieri defendants, and in fact all the participants in the scene, were professionals a valid reason for a court\u2019s condoning sharp dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">What did the Alfieri defendants do to make them liable? The jury could have found that they procured the Cali defendants to continue to act as the owner of the land when in fact the latter no longer were the decision makers. Alfieri even decided the amount of rental under the lease (which included a commission) Cali was to have discussed with Reitman on May 3, 1973. They remained silent when they should have spoken. They permitted plaintiff as well as Reitman to perform as if the contemplated negotiations were progressing to a finality. They conspired to hold Reitman (and plaintiff) in limbo until they were ready to announce the new ownership and, in the meantime, to neutralize plaintiff from attempting to persuade its clients, the Reitman defendants, to look elsewhere for an appropriate site \u25a0 \u2014 \u2022 a site whose owner would pay commissions for plaintiff\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">As a professional developer Alfieri learned from Cali that plaintiff was the procuring broker and was to be paid by Cali. Since the Alfieri defendants bought with the expectation of Reitman\u2019s lease being consummated, they wanted no one to \u201crock the boat.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They realized that as time went on Reitman was becoming more anxious to finalize the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The fact that the Alfieri defendants stood to gain if they could avoid the payment of commissions is not relevant in this case. The motive of such a tortfeasor is relevant only to determine whether he acted out of sheer malice. If the alleged tortfeasor acted out of sheer malice, he will he liable on that account. If he acted out of a motivation to enhance his financial position \u2014 for profit, then it is necessary for recovery that his conduct must have been transgressive of generally accepted standards of morality, <em>i. r., </em>a violation of standards of \u201csocially acceptable conduct.\u201d 1 <em>Harper and James, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 6.11, at 511, 513-514; <em>Prosser on Torts, </em>at 978 (1964). The instant ease was submitted to the jury on the thesis that the Alfieri group sought to profit by their perfidy, so that recovery against them required a finding by the jury that their conduct violated the accepted standards of morality.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The tort is not founded on a <em>quantum meruit </em>or gwsi-eonlract thesis. Unjust enrichment of the tortfeasor is not an element of the tort. But such enrichment is a consideration not alone in connection with whether, as stated, a defendant\u2019s conduct was initiated out of sheer malice, hut also in determining whether the moral standards have been violated. In <em>Harris v. Perl, supra, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">And so here, when the Peris accepted plaintiff\u2019s services, it was with the obligation which all decent m.en would recognize, that they would not line their purse with the money value of those services. It is of no moment that Cronin was not the agent of the bank and hence plaintiff had no authorization from the record owner. That fact provided an opportunity for overreaching rather than a justification for it. As we pointed out above, the law protects not only contracts blit also the reasonable expectations of economic gain. In these circumstances fair play would require a prospective purchaser to permit the broker to seek recognition by the owner, unentieed by the purchaser\u2019s offer to deal directly. As we have already said, we have no doubt the bank would have dealt with plaintiff, but the Peris did not give her that opportunity. More than that, Perl lured plaintiff from stumbling upon the truth by deceitfully saying he would discuss the sale after the. Labor Bay weekend. [41 N. J. at 464]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>A jury could have deduced that when the attempt to hide the Alfieri defendants\u2019 interest until they were ready to disclose it was thwarted by the accidental discovery of a rig on the land, then Alfieri learned two things from the almost immediate call from Mandelbaum for a meeting \u2014 first, he could increase the rental to be charged by five cents a square foot and, second, Reitman\u2019s anxiety indicated he could even make the deal with Reitman without a payment of commission to Blau.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">There is one final observation on this point. If Cali had entered into the lease with Reitman before the title passed to the Alfieri defendants, there was no doubt that plaintiff was legally entitled to a commission. Yet under the circumstances it was plain that Alfieri was working toward. such a lease. However, instead of that, Alfieri\u2019s company (which had not yet acquired title to the land) continued with the negotiations on May 4, 1973 and thereafter, and executed the lease (escrowed until title to Crest\u00f3n Associates passed).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u25a0 We suspect that our dissenting colleague differs from our view as to the liability of the Alfieri group for several reasons which we deem to be incorrect. Eirst, her concept of the tort which is applicable here is overly restrictive. We acknowledge that this tort is not as well defined as some other torts \u2014 probably because recovery in part depends upon whether a jury may conceive that defendant has not acted \u201caccording to the rules of the game.\u201d But her approach appears to us to be too legalistic and founded upon the proposition that since she regarded Alfieri as a competitor of Reitman, his actions were not to be fettered by concepts of morality. But the law is to the contrary, as already noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Our colleague ignores a most important inference from the facts which the jury detected from the circumstances \u2014 Alfieri\u2019s conduct was dictated by the probability of Reitman\u2019s ultimate consummation of a lease and, with the passage of time, his increasing anxiety to relocate the site of his business operations. Instead of this theme she regards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>his actions in the cold legalistic light that Alfieri bought with no guarantee of (and her personal belief that it was irrespective of) Reitman\u2019s very obvious desire to enter into a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The facts permitted a jury to conclude that Alfieri knew almost from his original associations with Cali what Reitman was doing and planning, first, as to the purchase of the land and, second, as to entering into a lease. Also the jury could conclude that Alfieri\u2019s negotiations with Cali were either dictated by or were reactions to what he learned from Cali as to the course of Reitman\u2019s negotiations with Cali. As noted, Alfieri learned of the availability of the tract of land about the beginning of January. Not until after Reitman indicated his serious interest in negotiating a lease did Alfieri decide to buy the land on March 16, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">But when he did decide to buy he cautiously waited until April 18, over a month later, before entering into a written agreement \u2014 prior to which he had no obligation to purchase. Even after the agreement of sale from Cali to Alfieri was executed on April 18, 1973, Alfieri had for <em>21 </em>da3rs (to May 9, 1973) a right to withdraw from the agreement with impunity, on a claim that the soil tests were unsatisfactory for his purposes. Alfieri, both before and after April 18, 1973, using Cali as his negotiator, prepared the lease terms for the proposed lease with Reitman, including the amount of the rent, which purported to include plaintiff\u2019s commission. He intended to continue this charade to the point where the lease was about to be executed and then to announce his ownership and willingness to execute the lease \u2014 without payment of commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Contrary to our colleague\u2019s belief, which obviously differs from the legitimate inference that the jury drew, Alfieri was secretive all through this, and enlisted Cali\u2019s cooperation in his plan. There is no indication whose soil-testing rig was on the premises when accidentally discovered by Zimmel \u2014 but except for that fortuitous observation this fiction would have continued on until, as stated, Alfieri was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ready for the denouement. By that time Reitman would have been in a tight spot. Alfieri calculated that at that time Reitman would proceed even if it meant he paid the commissions himself, but in any event Alfieri, as a stranger to plaintiff, would not be responsible for commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">All through this playacting \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 as far back as January 1973 \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 plaintiff continued to act as broker and continued to expect to be compensated for its services. In effect, the jury deduced that in the totality of the circumstances Alfieri\u2019s conduct was not that of a competitor, it was that of a predator \u2014 that Alfieri\u2019s agreement to buy (first oral and then graphic) was not, as our colleague believes, the act of a fair competitor which terminated plaintiff\u2019s right to commissions, but was only an event in a master plan to achieve a, profitable lease without an obligation to pay plaintiff, whose work made it all possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">It may be rightfully assumed that ordinarily two land developers competing for the purchase of the same tract of land need not disclose their respective interests to each other. But in the instant case Alfieri and Reitman ceased being competitors for the same tract about the last week of February 1973, when Cali told Alfieri that Reitman no longer wanted to merely buy the land but wanted something entirely different \u2014 a long-term lease with options to purchase at different intervals.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u25a0 Our colleague is correct in saying that Alfieri had no assurance of Reitman\u2019s making a lease when he entered into the formal contract to buy the land on April 18, 1973 (with the release clause, as mentioned). But as stated in <em>Jersey City Printing Co. v. Cassidy, </em>63 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>759, 765 ,(Ch. 1902): <em>\u201cA </em>large part of what is most valuable in modern life seems to depend more or less directly upon \u2018probable expectancies.\u2019 * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\"><em>Harper and James, op. cit., </em>at 518, elaborated on this theme of competition (although, as stated, we do not regard Alfieri as being a competitor of Reitman). They said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The bounds of the privilege of competition may be described as limited by the actor\u2019s intention and by the character of the practices which he employs. Stated in other words, competition in trade, business or occupation affords a privilege to interfere with relations of prospective economic advantage (1) so long as the competitor\u2019s purpose is regarded as justifiable in the sense that it is within the limits of the accepted ethical code applicable to such transactions, and (2) so long as he does not resort to fraud or deception or other means which are regarded as \u201cunfair\u201d in the sense that they are outside the limits of current business mores.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Thus the trial judge, in recognition of these principles, as reiterated in the cited cases, <em>supra, </em>and particularly as quoted, supra, from <em>Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove Memorial Park, </em>told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">* * * The question to be decided is whether the defendants accepted the services of Blau and then surreptitiously took from Blau the product of its hard work by unjustly using or appropriating the information that it developed. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">* *\u2019 * In other words, was the interference by defendants sanctioned by the rules of the game in common morality?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Second, we conceive that our colleague has arrogated to herself the jury\u2019s function of drawing inferences from the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Onr dissenting colleague states that the record contained not the slightest suggestion that the price reflected the value of the lease. The brief answer is found in what has already been stated. The jury could infer that Alfieii\u2019s purchase was inspired and predicated upon the prospect of the lease. Tie even knew approximately what the lease rental would be by May 1, when he could still have withdrawn from the agreement of sale. So, while it may be true, as stated by her, that the price paid by Alfieri for the land did not reflect the value of the lease <em>per </em>se, a jury could have found that in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>larger sense the value of the lease did influence the purchase of the land by Alfieri.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Our colleague states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">As Cali stated, he lacked confidence that the Alfieri deal would he consummated and that is the reason he resisted advising Reliman to discontinue negotiations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">But the jury did not have to accept this as a reason. From what has been said herein, and from all the evidence, they could have inferred that the idea of secrecy was arranged between Alfieri and Cali for the purpose of Alfieri\u2019s obtaining the advantage of plaintiff\u2019s work as a broker without paying Blau any commission, and at the same time avoiding Blau\u2019s endeavoring to interest Reitman\u2019s becoming interested in another site.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">And Cali had nothing to gain from this secrecy apart from the legitimate reasons be gave for this conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">But contrary to this, the jury could infer that Cali wanted most desperately to .sell the land \u2014 that Alfieri\u2019s interest afforded a chance of selling all of it to Alfieri if Alfieri could rely on the probability of the proposed lease. Thus his gain in cooperating with Alfieri was to dispose of the whole tract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">The evidence disclosed no other land availabe for lease by Reitman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">This is not the sole or even a necessary conclusion. That fact, if true, was not known to Alfieri until after May 4, 1973 \u2014 after his interest was discovered. What has already been stated herein as reasonable inferences from the secrecy and secret participation of Alfieri evidences a segment of the total picture which was before the jury and which to them justifiably appeared to exhibit conduct within the concept of tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Third, our colleague\u2019s suggestion that plaintiff\u2019s loss came about as the result of Alfieri\u2019s purchase or agreement to purchase and that this was one of the not-unexpected consequences known to those engaged in the real estate brokerage business is too simplistic. It ignores all the remaining circumstances already mentioned. It ignores the probability that Alfieri capitalized on plaintiff\u2019s experience, work and efforts through a course of misleading actions as well as a course of concealment of his and his associate\u2019s motives \u2022 \u2014 \u25a0 not only as to plaintiff and Eeitinan, but also as to the Cali group, to whom representations were made or assurances given that commissions would be paid to plaintiff for its recognized work.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The principles extrapolated by our colleague from <em>Harris v. </em>Perl, supra, have been applied by us and we have found the liability of the Alfieri group in the light of them. In that case defendants Perl argued that plaintiff broker would not have received a commission even had they disclosed the transfer of title to the land. Chief Justice Weintraub stated, in rejecting that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">Defendants\u2019 point is unsound, liven under a brokerage contract carefully drawn from a sellers\u2019 point of view, the broker earns his commission when title is closed. Here that event occurred and hence plaintiff established the, final ingredient of her claim. What the Peris seek to do is to generate an uncertainty which but for their naked assertion would not be in the case. They ask that the Court accept their belief that under no circumstances would they have budged from the figure of $125,000. The claim of course is wholly hypothetical and even the Peris cannot really know how high they would have gone. <em>The question is whether a wrongdoer should he permitted to avoid real damages hy raising an issue made hypothetical hy his very wrong. We think he should not. </em>The same contention was rejected in <em>Johnson v. Gustafson, </em>201 <em>Minn. </em>620, 277 <em>N. W. 252, </em>255 (Sup. Ct. 1038) :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cIt seems to us that Clarity\u2019s assertion that he would not have paid more than he did ($5,700) in any event comes with poor grace. He was willing to and did concoct a fraudulent scheme. He procured the necessary assistance to bring about a result which, had it not been discovered, would have given him an advantage to the extent of the commission plaintiff was in common honesty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>entitled to receive. No man should be permitted to reap a profitable crop from seed of the kind here used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">[ 41 <em>N. J. </em>at 464-465; emphasis supplied ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We do not dwell here on the reasons why we believe the judge properly submitted the liability of the Cali defendants to the jury, because they were acquitted of liability. The propriety of the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the Cali defendants is discussed hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We turn now to the contentions of the Alfieri defendants. They first argue that the judge erred in submitting to the jury \u201cthe inconsistent demand set forth in the second count of the complaint because the plaintiff had made an election to proceed on the first count.\u201d This argument, in effect, subsumes the claim that the judge should have submitted to the jury only plaintiff\u2019s demand of $67,500 as the \u201cexpectation of economic advantage,\u201d instead of $291,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The first count of the two-count complaint filed by plaintiff included the assertion that during the Cali-Reitman negotiations it was agreed among plaintiff, the Cali defendants and the Reitman defendants that if Cali built the structures and executed a lease to Reitman, \u201cplaintiff would accept a commission of $67,500 based upon 10% of the sales price and not upon 5% of the gross rentals payable under the lease,\u201d provided that Reitman complied with an earlier promise to give to plaintiff the exclusive right to sell the Reitman defendants\u2019 properties in Newark when no longer required. The second count merely referentially repeated the allegations of the first count and alleged that upon the failure and refusal of the Cali defendants to pay the commission of $67,500 earned by plaintiff and the failure of the Reitman defendants to execute and deliver exclusive-agency agreements \u201cthe lease made between defendant Crest\u00f3n and the Reitman defendants * * * should be subject to commissions payable to the plaintiff equal to 5 per centum of the gross rentals for the term of that lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Our review ol the allegations of the complaint leads us to conclude that the argument of the parties as to the fair interpretation of the complaint is debatable. It cannot be said with confidence that plaintiff\u2019s expectation was limited to $67,500. The fact remains that defendants were placed on notice that plaintiff sought as damages 5% of the rentals to be paid under the lease negotiated between Crest\u00f3n Associates and Galsworthy, Inc. Defendants were aware of this demand for a long interval between the institution of the action in January 1974 and the first day of trial, March 30, 1976 \u2014 two years and three months \u2014 during which time extensive discovery proceedings were undertaken. Plaintiff\u2019s answers to interrogatories submitted to it were consistent with its maintenance of a claim for rental commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">It may be acknowledged that during the course of the trial defendants introduced evidence which challenged plaintiff\u2019s contention that rental commissions were reasonably in the contemplation of plaintiff. Por example, plaintiff\u2019s letter to Alfieri, dated the same date (May 4, 1973) that details of the long-term lease between Alfieri and Eeitman were tentatively agreed to at a meeting in Eeitman\u2019s office, states that \"you will be obliged to pay us for our brokerage services rendered, the sum of $67,500 as our fee in connection with this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">It may also be noted that in November 1974, about 11 months after plaintiff filed its complaint, it accepted the mentioned exclusives from the Eeitman defendants. However, other evidence may be said to militate against Alfieri\u2019s position on this point. Por example, Stein testified that he told Alfieri when he talked to him shortly after the May 4, 1973 meeting terminated that plaintiff would accept $67,500 \"just to get finished.\u201d The disputed testimony and inferences made the issue as to plaintiff\u2019s economic expectations eminently one for the jury under appropriate instructions. Such instructions were in fact given without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The Alfieri defendants assert that <em>Jersey City v. Hague. </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>584, 603 (1955); <em>Ajamian v. Schlanger, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>483, 490 (1954), <em>cert. </em>den. 348 <em>U. S. </em>835, 75 <em>S. Ct. </em>58, 99 <em>L. Ed. </em>659 (1954); <em>Spiotta v. Milkon, </em>70 <em>N. J. Super. </em>344, 350 (Ch. Div. 1951), aff\u2019d 77 <em>N. J. Super. </em>348 (App. Div. 1962), and <em>Young v. George C. Fuller Contracting Co., </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>554, 561-562 (Law Div. 1951), support their position that plaintiff was obliged to make an election once it knew the full 'facts. The requirement to make an election is generally grounded in principles of waiver or estoppel. <em>Republic of China v. Pong-Tsu Mow, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>139, 145-146 (1954). Unless a party may be prejudiced in either presenting or defending his case by reason of the failure of another party to make an election of any type, an election need not be made. There is no evidence that Alfieri was prejudiced by the alternative claims. Consistency in pleading is not required. <em>R. </em>4:5-6. Consistency in claims or demands is required only when the claims or demands cannot be reconciled. <em>Jersey City v. Hague, supra, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>at 604. The following statement from <em>Young v. George C. Fuller Contracting Co., </em>supra, 12 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 561, as quoted by our Supreme Court in <em>Jersey City v. Hague, supra, </em>is especially apt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">\u00ed\u00bb * * Hence it might aid justice, not to compel the party to gamble on the finding of the jury, but to submit his case to them alternatively or hypothetically. In other words, the party could submit to the court that, if fact A exists, then result (1) should follow, but if fact B exists, then result (2) should follow, this perchance in the form of a request for special verdict. [18 <em>N. J. </em>at 605]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">As stated, such submission was made to the jury in the instant case. There was no inconsistency in this case which would warrant the court to compel plaintiff to make an election. Moreover there was no basis for an estoppel against plaintiff\u2019s right to recover commissions on the rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Defendants next assert that the judge erred in permitting Stein to testify as to the standard brokerage commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>sion of 5% of gross rentals to be paid under leases. This objection was predicated upon plaintiff\u2019s failure to include Stein as an expert witness in answers to interrogatories. We cannot accept this proposition. Testimony of an expert is generally proscribed where the expert\u2019s name is not provided in response to an interrogatory asking the names of expert witnesses, or in a timely amendment thereof. <em>R. </em>4:17-7. However, in a number of circumstances the rule is relaxed. Most notably, where the failure to supply the name of a witness was not the result of a design to mislead, and the opposing party is not surprised nor prejudiced, the testimony is allowed. <em>Brown v. Mortimer, </em>100 <em>N. J. Super. </em>395 (App. Div. 1968). <em>Hillas v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>120 <em>N. J. Super. </em>105 (App. Div. 1972), certif. den. 62 <em>N. J. </em>83 (1972), is illustrative of the liberal relaxation of the rule with respect to opinion testimony. There, a factual witness named in answers to interrogatories was allowed to testify as an expert on the subject of elevators where pretrial depositions demonstrated his expertise, although his name had not been included in the answers to interrogatories as a proposed expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We are satisfied that defendants were neither surprised nor prejudiced by the testimony. It was consistent with plaintiff\u2019s contention that 5% was the standard. We agree with plaintiff that the argument underlying this point is premised on defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiff had elected to claim only commissions of $67,500 and is not premised on their being surprised. Thus, during argument before the trial judge defendants\u2019 attorney stated : \u201c* * * [B]ut I have an objection to Mr. Stein or any other witness * * * testifying to what the standard or norm in the industry may be with respect to commissions because that\u2019s not an issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Defendants also argue that the admission into evidence of a memorandum made by Seminara, one of the Cali defendants\u2019 principals, indicating that Alfieri recognized an obligation to pay commissions to plaintiff, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>prejudicial error. The disputed exhibit is a memorandum prepared by Seminara, relating a discussion that took place at the closing of the Cali-Alfieri sale on July 10, 1973. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">On Tuesday, July 10, 1973 at the closing between Cali Wellcald Associates and Crest\u00f3n Associates, which took place at the offices of Nuzzo &amp; Nuzzo, 780 Totowa Road, Totowa, New Jersey, the following statement was made by Dominick Alfieri in reference to the Blau and Galsworthy liquor building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">Mr. D. Alfieri stated that he was going to use the difference in money, between the acreage price we had sold the property to his company and the acreage price that Cali Wellcald had given the Galsworthy people, towards paying the commission that he thought would have to be paid to the Blau agency for the Galsworthy deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">People in attendance were: Mintz, Seymour Sperber, Ignatius E. Seminara, Edward Leshowitz, and Harvey Schultz.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Without objection by Alfieri\u2019s attorney, counsel for Blau read the memo to the jury as part of the deposition of Seminara. Over objection it was offered into evidence at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. Alfieri later testified about the memo, explaining that although he did not admit liability he knew there was going to be expensive litigation and therefore a settlement was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Ordinarily a statement by a party is permitted in evidence as an admission. <em>Evid. R. </em>63(7). On the other hand, offers of compromise are excluded. <em>Evid. R. </em>52. The subject statement was unrelated to settlement negotiations. Hone of plaintiff\u2019s representatives was even present. One of the underlying reasons for the exclusion of this type of evidence is the social policy favoring and encouraging amicable out-of-court settlements. <em>Rynar v. Lincoln Transit, Inc., </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>525 (E. &amp; A. 1943); <em>Evid. R. </em>52, Comment \u00a7 52-1 (a). Here the evidence served a valid purpose and was relevant for its probative effect upon plaintiff\u2019s contention that Alfieri had bought the land from Cali with Reitman\u2019s plaintiff-induced interest as a motivating factor. The statement attributed to Alfieri tended to undermine Alfieri\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>contention that in negotiating for the premises with Cali ho did not do so with a belief that he might be liable for commissions to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In any event, the evidence was not prejudicial. Alfieri testified about the memorandum, explaining that although he did not admit liability he knew that there was going to be expensive litigation and therefore a possible settlement was discussed among Cali, Seminara and Alfieri. We therefore find that this point lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Defendants next contend that the judge erroneously granted a summary judgment for the Eeitman defendants. Summary judgment must be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Even though the allegations of the pleadings may raise an issue of fact, if the other papers show that, in fact, there is no real material issue, then summary judgment should be granted. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank and, Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>67, 75 (1954). These standards govern decision of the motion in the first instance, as well as the decision on appeal. Since plaintiff has not appealed the summary judgment, we are concerned only with the dismissal of the Alfieri defendants\u2019 crossclaim against the Eeitman defendants. This crossclaim sought indemnity as well as contribution. There was not the slightest hint in the crossclaim that the Eeitman defendants\u2019 liability to the Alfieri defendants was posited upon an allegedly express promise to Alfieri by Eeitman through his attorney Mandelbaum that Eeitman would \u201cwork out\u201d the brokerage commission and that Alfieri\u2019s proposed rental notice should not include a broker\u2019s commission. Notwithstanding that depositions taken in preparation for the trial disclosed such an alleged promise, when the motion for summary judgment was submitted to the judge, Alfieri never submitted any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>materials or arguments to the judge on the point. Even after the judge\u2019s ruling the Alfieri defendants moved for a rehearing only as to the judge\u2019s denial of their own motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Now the Alfieri defendants assert that plaintiff\u2019s brief before the judge in connection with the motion referred to a portion of the depositions which mentioned the Mandelbaum promise. They also state that they sought leave to appeal from the judge\u2019s denial of their motion for summary-judgment and argued before the trial commenced that the judge\u2019s denial was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><em>R. </em>4:46-5 (a) requires an adverse party to respond to a motion for summary judgment by affidavits or otherwise, in order to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d He may not rely merely on the allegations of his pleadings. Nor may a defendant expect a judge, especially in a complex case wherein hundreds of pages of depositions and interrogatories have been filed, to assume, in the absence of a brief from that party, that the depositions or interrogatories may contain materials which militate against the position of the moving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u2022 We are constrained, however, to reverse the dismissal of the crossclaim as to indemnification notwithstanding the failure of the Alfieri defendants to alert the judge to the reasons for denying the motion to dismiss. Not only was the deposition testimony concerning Mandelbaum\u2019s solicitation of Alfieri to not increase the rent to accommodate plaintiff\u2019s commission brought to the judge\u2019s attention in plaintiff\u2019s brief, but the judge stated in his letter opinion that \u201c[a]n examination of the briefs and depositions would lead to the conclusion that no factual dispute presents itself for jury resolution.\u201d Such examination should have induced the judge to deny the motion to dismiss Alfieri\u2019s cross claim, in the light of the testimony and inferences arising therefrom. However, in reversing the judgment dismissing the crossclaim, we do not hold that this necessitates a new trial. The crossclaim may be tried independently following a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>trial conference. <em>Cf. Mickens v. Marascio, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>569, 574 (1971); <em>Harris v. </em>Perl, <em>supra </em>41 <em>N. J. </em>at 465-466.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">We will consider points II, III and VIII advanced by the Alfieri defendants together. These are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">II. The evidence presented to the jury is too uncertain, remote and vague to permit any judgment to be entered on the basis of the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">III. The verdict against the Alfieri defendants and exonerating the Cali defendants was so against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a clear miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">VIII. The verdict against the Alfieri defendants was so against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a clear miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">We disagree that the exoneration of the Cali defendants while holding the Alfieri defendants liable was so against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a miscarriage of justice. The evidence supported a finding that the Cali defendant acted properly. They had the right to sell their land. Eeitman could have had an option to purchase but refused it. Cali paid a commission to a broker on the sale to the Alfieri defendants. The Cali defendants told Alfieri of Eeitman\u2019s intention to enter into a lease and of plaintiff\u2019s services as a broker. The jury could have found that Cali, although acting in combination with Alfieri as already related, did not know that Alfieri intended to attempt to escape the payment of commissions to plaintiff; that the Cali defendants did not act tortiously toward plaintiff because they paid a commission to Mintz, and also that, all through their cooperation with Alfieri, Alfieri stated or led them to believe it was his group\u2019s intention to pay commissions to plaintiff. Accordingly, the jury could have reasonably determined, as it did, that the conduct of the Cali defendants did not constitute the tortious interference for which plaintiff sought damages against them. The Cali defendants were under no legal obligation to continue to deal with the Eeitman defendants, once having sold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>land to Alfieri \u2014 indeed, they had nothing to sell. Plaintiff\u2019s right to commissions did not accrue until Reitman executed the lease. This actually occurred after Cali had conveyed the land to Alfieri.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">That the Cali defendants may have derived a benefit as a result of Reitman\u2019s interest in the land (already discussed as being the triggering reason for the purchase by Alfieri defendants) alone is insufficient to support liability against the Cali defendants. The principles of tortious interference are somewhat amorphous. <em>Sustick v. Slatina and Myers v. Arcadio, Inc., supra. </em>See also, <em>McCann v. Biss </em>and <em>Harris v. Perl, supra. </em>We cannot disagree with the jury\u2019s determination that there was no transgression.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Eor the reasons earlier stated, we are satisfied that the judge properly submitted the question of the Alfieri defendants\u2019 liability to the jury. We do not agree that the verdict against them was so against the weight of the evidence-as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Alfieri further contends that the judge erred in failing to declare a mistrial by reason of an incident which occurred. Specifically, after the close of all the evidence counsel for the Cali defendants reported to the judge that he believed two jurors overheard Alfieri offer to settle the case with Stein in the corridor outside the courtroom. Subsequently the judge questioned both of these jurors on the record outside the presence of counsel. One of the jurors stated that she overheard nothing. The other stated that all he heard was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">MR. ALOIA: One said, \u201cWho\u2019s got the cards?\u201d And then the other one said \u2014 I don\u2019t know who it was \u2014 \u201cWell, it\u2019s a different story you\u2019re talking about now than you did the other day\u201d \u2014 not a different story but \u201cdifferent figure.\u201d That\u2019s all I heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">THE COURT: Do you know which one that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">MR. ALOIA: I think it was Stein got out of the booth or \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what the other man\u2019s name is \u2014 Zimmel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">MR. ALOIA: They were at the booth. Now, I don\u2019t know which one was in the booth and got out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">MR. ALOIA: And I think it was what\u2019s his name, Mr. Seminara?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">THE COURT: Seminara.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">MR. ALOIA: He\u2019s from the Cali group?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">THE COURT: Yes, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">MR. ALOIA: He was talking, and he said something about \u2014 I think it was him that said something about, \u201cIt\u2019s a different\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a different\u201d \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a different price now than you did the other day,\u201d or something to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">THE COURT: I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">MR. ALOIA: \u201cA different figure\u201d \u2014 not a price \u2014 \u201cDifferent figure,\u201d and that was all I heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">THE COURT: Did that mean anything to you one way or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">MR. ALOIA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">THE COURT: Will that affect your decision in this case one way or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-15\">MR. ALOIA: No. I thought maybe they were trying to settle it between them but it wouldn\u2019t affect anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-16\">THE COURT: \u00bb * * You didn\u2019t discuss this with any of the other jurors, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-19\">MR. ALOIA: I did tell it to them, what I just overheard, and I said, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re trying to settle the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-20\">THE COURT: But that\u2019s as far as it went?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-21\">MR. ALOIA: That\u2019s as far as I went with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">Thus it appears that none of the Alfieri defendants was a party to the conversation. In fact, it also appears that the juror never even heard the conversation which was reported by Cali\u2019s counsel to the court. It was an entirely different one. The judge reported the substance of the interview to the attorneys. Alfieri\u2019s counsel never moved for a mistrial. Instead, although expressing uncertainty about the prejudicial effect of the overheard conversation, he along with other counsel for the parties suggested what cautionary instructions should be given by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-23\">The judge commenced his charge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-24\">Now, members of the jury, at the outset I just want to comment on an incident that occurred yesterday morning. I was informed that one of the jurors overheard a discussion in the hallway yesterday morning between a couple of the parties or witnesses. While the en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tire context of the conversation was not heard by the juror, when I interrogated him he advised me that he gathered from the small part of the conversation that he heard that it concerned a possible settlement. Now, I looked into the incident and I found that the discussion did not concern a settlement, and whatever the nature of the conversation it was carried on in jest. Now, the juror and any other members of the jury who may have heard the discussion or who may have been told of the discussion should disregard it. By that I mean you should not consider or allow any aspect or inference of such conversation to influence your verdict one way or the other. As I said at the beginning of this case, your verdict must be based upon the evidence, that is, what you heard in the courtroom not what you might have heard said outside of the courtroom. So that please keep that in mind and expel it from your mind if any of you heard or any of you have any feeling that you may make any connotations from such a discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">What was stated was altogether consistent with the oral requests of various counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Alfieri\u2019s arguments on this point are frivolous in the light of what occurred. Eor example, now it is Contended that the judge should have interrogated all the jurors. That was not suggested to the trial judge by anyone. It is also contended that Alfieri was a party to the conversation \u201cbecause the attorney for Cali defendants overheard the offer. But counsel for Alfieri defendants told the trial judge,\u201d * * * and the inference I draw is that he [the juror] probably didn\u2019t hear anything about the first conversation that Mr. Puzzo [attorney for Cali defendants] mentioned but was talking about another conversation that occurred between different parties and a different subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The fundamental question in cases where irregularities involving jurors occur during a trial is: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\"><em>* * </em>* whether such matters could have a tendency to influence the jury in arriving at its verdict in a manner inconsistent with the legal proofs and the court\u2019s charge. If the irregular matter has that tendency on the face of it, a new trial should be granted without further inquiry as to its actual effect. The test is not whether the irregular matter actually influenced the result, but whether it had the capacity of doing so. * * <em>[Panko v. Flintkote, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>55, 61 (1951)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Notwithstanding the lack of a motion for a mistrial, we have carefully examined the record for the purpose of determining whether the judge committed plain error, <em>JR. </em>2: 10-2, in not declaring a mistrial. We have concluded that he did not. This conclusion is derived from the foregoing recital of the events following the report of the irregularity to the trial judge and also from the fact that none of the Alfieri defendants was shown to have been involved in the conversation. It will be recalled that Seminara, to the juror\u2019s knowledge, was affiliated with the Cali defendants, and yet the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Cali group. We summarize our overall review by stating that we do not believe that the alleged conversation reported by the juror coirld have had a tendency to influence the jury in arriving at its verdict in a manner inconsistent with the legal proofs and the judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The Alfieri defendants urge that the evidence presented to the jury was too uncertain, remote and vague to permit any judgment to be entered on the basis of the verdict. This argument proceeds upon the assumption, not that the overall evidence was insufficient, but that the verdict of \u201co% of gross rentals is a meaningless, indefinite and speculative conclusion\u201d because the 20-year lease contains three options to purchase which, upon the exercise of any one of the three by the lessee, could terminate the payment of rent and, in turn, commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The lease was an exhibit in the case. The jury had an opportunity to examine it. According to its terms Galsworthy, Inc., the tenant, was given options to purchase within 180 days after the tenth year of the term of the lease, within 180 days after the fifteenth year of the term of the lease or within 90 days after the nineteenth year of the term of the-lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The judge charged the jury on this point that their award \u201cmay be in the amount of the normal rate of commission, five percent of the gross rents, namely, a figure of $291,900.\u201d But he also told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>You may also consider, however, the options to buy which were given to Reitman, and this rental figure would be diminished to the exercise of such an option and thereby diminish the loss sustained by the plaintiff. Here again you must consider all of the testimony and evidence in arriving at your conclusions, so you will recall that that lease arrangement would provide that Reitman at the end of a certain period, five, ten, twenty years, as I understand, would have a right to purchase that property. Now, if they exercise that option in a minimum period of time or any period of time, that, of course, would reduce the total amount due under the lease and, therefore, the total percentages claimed by the plaintiffs in this connection. Now, that is, generally, the rule of law as applied to the compensatory damages in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The jury\u2019s verdict as announced by its forelady was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">Your Honor, we, the members of the jury, find for the plaintiff. The Blau Group should receive five per cent on the lease between Crest\u00f3n Associates and Galsworthy, Inc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">None of the attorneys objected to the portion of the charge as to damages on the grounds now mentioned. However, after the above verdict was announced and after a discussion of the verdict among the judge and counsel the jury was asked to clarify its verdict by whether \u201cyou mean five per cent of the gross rentals or not?\u201d and as against which or all defendants the verdict was returned. The jury retired for further deliberations. Upon its return the jury announced that its verdict was intended to be against the \u201cAlfieri Group\u201d for 5% of the gross rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">At a subsequent hearing for judgment <em>n. o. v., R. </em>4:40-2, or for a new trial, <em>R. </em>4:49-1, counsel for Alfieri suggested that because of the uncertainty of whether rent under the lease would be paid for the entire 20-year life of the lease, in view of the option features, the commission should be paid as the rental payments are received by the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Rejecting this suggestion, the judge mistakenly analogized the necessary speculation of a jury as to damages in ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>lions for negligently caused death or permanent injuries with the speculation in which he felt the jury could indulge in the instant case. There are obvious differences between these eases. Most importantly, the measure of damages in this case is circumscribed by the amount of the reasonably expected economic advantage \u2022\u2014 a much less speculative amount than permissible in the mentioned negligence cases. Here, the jury refused to award punitive damages, although the court submitted that option to it. The jury intended only to award compensatory damages. In actions for permanent injuries or death resulting from tortious conduct the defendants are entitled to have the recovery discounted to present value, \"a procedure [in a death case] which recognizes that the deceased would have had his income spread out over the remaining years of his working life, had he lived.\u201d <em>Tenore v. Nu Car Carriers, </em>67 <em>N. J. </em>466, 474 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The jury in the instant case knew' that 5% of the gross rentals over the 20-year term of the lease amounted to $291,900. The judge specifically told it so in his charge. Yet it significantly failed to return a verdict for that sum. We would infer that it intended that the judgment be molded so that plaintiff would receive what he conventionally was entitled to \u2014 commissions on the rental as it was paid by Galsworthy, Inc. and as it was received by Crest\u00f3n Associates. <em>Cf. Turon v. J. &amp; L. Const. Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>543 ,(1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Apart from this, plaintiff should not receive the full amount of commissions at the present time. If it did, it would be paid an excessive amount, since it would have the use of funds which ordinarily it would not receive or be entitled to receive except by installments over a long term. Additionally, there was no evidence before the jury whereby it could intelligently prognosticate whether or not any one of the options would be exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The instant case, so far as damages are concerned, greatly resembles an action of breach of contract for brokerage commissions. Consequently, we see no reason why for the sake of justice we should not apply that same rule here. We feel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>constrained to adopt the reasoning of the court in <em>City of Hampton, Virginia v. United States, </em>218 <em>F. </em>2d 401 (4 Cir. <em>1955), </em>wherein the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">* *\u2019 * Whatever be the rule with respect to other contracts, it is clear, under the authorities, that for breach of a contract for the payment of money in instalments, where the contract is unilateral or has become unilateral as the result of performance by the complaining party, the right of recovery is limited to the instalments due at the time of institution of suit. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Viglas, supra [297 U. S. 672, 56 <em>S. Ct. </em>615, 80 L. Ed. 971 (1936)] ; Roehm v. Horst, 178 <em>U. </em>S. 1, 18, 20 S. Ct. 780, 44 L.

Of course, the effect of a judgment for the past due instalments is to establish the liability of defendant under the contract, as fully as if this were done by declaratory judgment; and on the principle of res judicata this will facilitate recovery on other instalments as they fall due.

Thus, plaintiff will receive the commissions as they fall due.

Even more significantly, those acts or omissions of Alfieri which my colleagues characterize as tortious, or as permitting an inference that they were tortious, caused plaintiff no loss. I would therefore not only reverse but would enter judgment in Alfieri\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Presentation of my view, unfortunately, requires some factual development which, however, because of my announced conclusions as to how this case should have been decided, will be confined largely to undisputed factual material and only to those facts relevant to the legal analysis which follows. Those undisputed facts disclose that during the latter part of 1972 the Cali group of defendants, owners of an undeveloped 44 acres of industrial land in West Caldwell, decided to sell it and in pursuit of that endeavor dealt through at least two and perhaps more real estate brokers. Plaintiff, who came to them by way of the Reitman group, was one, and Alan Mintz, who introduced them to Alfieri, was another. Both Mintz and plaintiff clearly understood that they were not invested by Cali with an exclusive agency to sell but that Cali was at all times dealing with other brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Through plaintiff, Reitman became interested in purchasing only that portion of Cali\u2019s land necessary to accommodate a building for his business. Initial discussions took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>place in December 1972, as a result of which Cali, in writing, agreed with plaintiff for the payment of any commissions to plaintiff resulting from either a sale or lease of the land. Discussions between Reitman and Cali concerning sale, not a lease, of a portion of the land, with plaintiff officiating, continued until February 22, 1973 when an oral agreement was reached along those lines evidenced by a written agreement of sale, drafted by Cali at Reitman\u2019s request and sent to Reitman\u2019s attorney, David Mandelbaum. This contract was never executed because Reitman, having only then acquired another company, was short of the cash necessary. to consummate the transaction orally agreed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">While Cali\u2019s negotiations with Reitman were taking place, Alfieri, a-land developer, became interested in purchasing the entire tract of land through the efforts of another broker, Alan Mintz. The undisputed evidence is that Cali\u2019s negotiations with Alfieri commenced in January 1973, during the same period Reitman was negotiating for sale of a part of the land, with parallel negotiations for sale continuing thereafter between Alfieri-Cali \u25a0 and Reitman-Cali throughout January and February 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">As noted previously, although Reitman first arrived at an agreement with Cali, Reitman backed out for lack of cash. Cali, however, had never ceased negotiations with the Alfieri group despite his oral agreement with Reitman, and on March 16, 1973, after Reitman\u2019s repudiation of his prior oral agreement with Cali, orally agreed with the Alfieri group on a purchase of the entire tract at an agreed per acre price. It was this oral agreement which was finally embodied in the critical written contract of sale which was executed by Cali and Alfieri on April 18, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Although during January and February 1973 Cali was .negotiating with the Alfieri group through Mintz, and with the Reitman group through plaintiff Blau, Alfieri, Reitman and plaintiff remained strangers to each other, and if Alfieri knew of Reitman\u2019s interest in the land which he, Alfieri, was negotiating for, that was all he knew \u2014 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Reitman and plaintiff, Reitman\u2019s broker, were his competition for the land he wanted. Moreover, during that period of time Reitman was not negotiating for a lease of a building to be constructed on the land; that form of transaction had not been conceived until the first week in March 1973 when Reitman found himself in a financial position which precluded a purchase and allowed only a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The uncontradicted testimony of David Mandelbaum, Reitman\u2019s attorney, was that the idea of a lease for Reitman first emerged on some undetermined day during the first week in March 1973 when he and Reitman discussed the impossibility of Reitman\u2019s going through with the purchase agreement offered him and Mandelbaum suggested that Reitman approach Cali concerning the possibility of a lease. Hence, on March 16, 1973, when the Alfieri group orally agreed on their purchase, the Reitman lease was only a possibility to be investigated. The record thus permits no inference that Alfferi\u2019s interest in the land he had agreed to purchase was influenced in any way by the Reitman lease which was, at the time of Alfieri\u2019s oral agreement, a bare possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">When Alfieri orally agreed on the terms of a purchase of the entire tract, Cali was no more secure in that transaction than he was in the prior oral agreement reached with the Reitman group. In both cases the oral agreements were unenforceable, and the Cali group knew that. It is clearly inferable, therefore, that such was the reason Cali failed to advise Alfieri of his earlier agreement with Reitman, and failed to disclose to Reitman the fact of his later oral agreement with Alfieri. Indeed, after the oral Alfieri-Cali agreement of March 16, 1973, Cali continued negotiating the lease with the Reitman group, thus keeping all options alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Hence, following the Cali-Alfieri oral agreement of March 16, 1973, Reitman, unknowing of Cali\u2019s oral agreement with Alfieri, retained an architect to make drawings of a building suitable to Reitman\u2019s business needs which might later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>be the subject of a lease,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and applications were made by Cali on behalf of Reitman to the local planning board for the necessary municipal permits. This latter application occurred during the early part of April 1973 after the oral agreement with Alfieri but before execution of the written Alfieri-Cali contract on April 18, 1973. Once the drawings were received (on or about April 3, 1973), it was decided that bids from contractors would be solicited, with Cali retaining the right to submit a bid; that was done, also in Reitman\u2019s ignorance of Alfieri\u2019s unenforceable interest in the land prior to April 18, 1973. Such bids were solicited and received after the written Alfieri contract was executed, with Cali himself submitting a bid at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Several observations must be made concerning the foregoing undisputed facts. Alfieri\u2019s interest in the land was independent of any Reitman lease because, at the time that his interest in the land was first manifested, the idea of a lease had not even been conceived and, notwithstanding, Alfieri negotiated seriously for the purchase of the entire tract. Further, when on March 16, 1973 Alfieri orally agreed with Cali to the purchase, that agreement was also independent of any Reitman lease because at that time the lease was simply a possibility being investigated, its idea having been only conceived two weeks earlier. Before the time the architect was retained and bids from contractors solicited and received, Alfieri had orally agreed on the per acre price of the land he was to purchase, and the record contained not the slightest suggestion that the price reflected the value of the lease. Further, the written contract of April 18, 1973 reflected exactly the earlier agreed-to price and hence the written contract also did not reflect the value of the land enhanced by the lease. Moreover, Cali <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>did not cease negotiations with either party on the occasion of an unenforceable oral agreement, first with Reitman and then with Alfieri, desiring to keep all of his options open until he was confident that a fully enforceable agreement would be consummated and a disposition of the land a legal certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">I can discern no basis for an obligation upon Alfieri, certainly before April 18, 1973, to communicate with Reitman or plaintiff advice of his interest in the land simply because he may have known of Reitman\u2019s similar interest, and I do not read my colleagues\u2019 opinion as suggesting such an obligation. Rather, the obligation of disclosure, breach of which provides one aspect of Alfieri\u2019s found tortious conduct, arose, according to the court\u2019s opinion, on the execution of the April 18, 1973 contract. My colleagues seem to be taking the position that once that contract was executed, Alfieri was obliged to write Reitman or plaintiff a letter or telephone them, both total strangers with whom he had no legally recognizable relationship, to advise them of his purchase. Moreover, they must be suggesting that this obligation should have been promptly performed; compliance two weeks later would not be sufficient. I can discern no source for this obligation and no reason in public policy or fairness, or custom of fair dealing, for it. My colleagues cite to no authority, statutory or decisional, imposing such an obligation upon a successful purchaser of land to advise all others who may have evidenced some interest in the land of his purchase. Doubtless, such advice would have been a nice thing to give, but I question that it rose to the level of a legally imposed obligation for the breach of which substantial damages would be recoverable. Indeed, I suspect that most successful purchasers of land would be astonished to know of their obligation to notify all competing purchasers or lessees of the success of their negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Although my colleagues postulate secretive conduct on the part of Cali and Alfieri concerning the execution of the April 18, 1973 contract, I discern no such conduct apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>from the failure to telephone or write plaintiff or Reitman concerning it. Eor the undisputed fact is that Alfieri, not more than two weeks after execution of his contract of purchase, brought his equipment on the land, thus notifying all who wished to know of it that he had an interest therein. Indeed, it was from this conduct, which can hardly be characterized as secretive or clandestine, that plaintiff and Reitman learned of the April 18, 1973 contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">It\u2019s true that Alfieri did not bring his equipment on the land for the specific purpose of informing Reitman that the land was'his but rather for the purpose of dealing with the soil contingency clause of the contract which persisted for 21 days after its execution. Such conduct, nonetheless, clearly negates secrecy and evidences an unawareness by Alfieri of the obligation created by this court in its opinion to promptly advise unsuccessful negotiators that their further negotiations would be fruitless. Had Alfieri been aware of this recently created obligation, he could easily have complied therewith with no adverse consequences to him and no discernible benefits to either Reitman or the plaintiff. And this ineffectiveness of the prompt disclosure my colleagues seem to be demanding without authority is one of the bases for this dissenting opinion, the lack of causality between such conduct, secretiveness, and plaintiff\u2019s loss of its expected commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Cali\u2019s conduct after execution of the April 18, 1973 contract was undoubtedly secretive. It will be remembered from this court\u2019s opinion that Cali submitted a bid for construction of the building Reitman was thinking of leasing after execution of the Alfieri-Cali contract; clearly submission of such a bid should have been accompanied by disclosure of the Alfieri-Cali contract if Cali were to be viewed as candid. And Seminara, Cali\u2019s employee, denied the contract to Reit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>man and plaintiff after its execution, further evidencing lack of candor. It is one thing, however, to discern lack of candor and another to predicate substantial liability on such a foundation without any authority for so doing. Again, the only authority referred for this obligation of disclosure is some vague conception of what would have been the moral thing for Cali to do \u2014 not a solidly grounded legal obligation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The jury, however, in exonerating Cali from all liability clearly decline to view this conduct as significant. And, in fact, the record discloses good reason for Cali\u2019s conduct in this regard and on an undisputed basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">By his uncontradicted testimony, Cali negated any malicious component to this secretive conduct. As he testified, he was aware that his contract with Alfieri contained a soil contingency clause and that the contract was not therefore final as far as he was concerned. Alfieri might well have found the soil conditions unfavorable to his plans, and the contract would then have been at nought. Cali, desiring to dispose of this land, was using the pending Reitman negotiations as a fallback position in the event the Alfieri-Cali deal fell through by reason of unfavorable soil conditions. As Cali stated, he lacked confidence that the Alfieri deal would be consummated and that is the reason he resisted advising Reitman to discontinue negotiations. Such considerations are valid business reasons for his conduct, cannot be regarded as malicious and, more importantly to the problems here presented, caused plaintiff no loss whatever. Had he told them promptly, as this court seems to think he should have, plaintiff\u2019s loss of commissions would have been precisely the same, as it was. And Cali had nothing to gain from this secrecy apart from the legitimate reasons he gave for this conduct. In any event, as previously noted, the jury regarded this conduct as being of little moment since they exonerated Cali from all liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Moreover, there exists substantial doubt that secretiveness in negotiations, in the sense of concealing from competitors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the existence or progress of parallel negotiations, is regarded as the kind of conduct which will ground an action in tort, for interference with prospective business advantage. Prosser observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">In short, it is no tort to beat a business rival to prospective customers. Thus, in the absence of prohibition by statute, illegitimate means, or some other unlawful element, a defendant seeking to increase his own business may *' * * allow discounts or rebates, <em>enter, into- secret negotiations dehind the plaintiff\u2019s dack, </em>refuse to deal with him or threaten to discharge employees who do, or even refuse to deal with third parties unless they cease dealing with the plaintiff, all without incurring liability. [Prosser, <em>Torts </em>(4 ed. 1971), \u00a7 130, at 954-955; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Hence, to summarize to this point, Alfieri was under no obligation to impart to Reitman or plaintiff promptly after execution of the April 18, .1973 contract news of the success of his negotiations with Cali. He was not, in fact, secretive, since not more than two weeks after the contract he engaged in conduct negating secretiveness by bringing his equipment on the land he purchased, thus notifying the world and plaintiff of his recent purchase of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The other aspect of Alfieri\u2019s conduct which my colleagues characterize as tortious, or which they conclude a jury could have so characterized, was Alfieri\u2019s participation in designing' Cali\u2019s bid for construction of the building which Reitman was considering leasing, without disclosing that he had don\u00e9 so. My colleagues view this conduct as malicious. First, I' do not so view it and, secondly even if it could be so characterized, I fail to see how it deprived plaintiff of anything. Alfieri\u2019s participation in Cali\u2019s bid was after Alfieri signed'the contract and, as I will later point out more fully, it was that contract which marked the end of plaintiff\u2019s expectancy of economic benefit from its efforts on Reitman\u2019s behalf. How was plaintiff damaged by this conduct? My colleagues don\u2019t say except to suggest that perhaps, as part of the failure to disclose Alfieri\u2019s purchase of the land, it precluded plaintiff from inducing Reitman to reject the lease of Cali\u2019s now Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>fieri\u2019s, land in favor of a lease of other lands which could have produced commissions for plaintiff. I am not impressed. Damages were not assessed on the basis of another deal plaintiff could have engineered, but on the basis of a Cali-Keitman, or the Cali-Alfieri, lease. The evidence disclosed no other land available for lease by Beitman; rather, the undisputed evidence establishes just the reverse \u2014 that no other land suitable to Beitman\u2019s purposes was available. After Beitman discovered that Alfieri was the new owner of the land and that it would be from Alfieri that the building would have to be leased, Beitman testified that ho was most upset, was determined not to deal with Alfieri, and embarked upon what he termed a \u201crock-ribbed\u201d search for other alternative land sites for the building he wished to lease. No other land was found, and it was only after this unsuccessful two-three-week \u201crock-ribbed\u201d search that Beitman returned to Alfieri to negotiate a lease with him. The record suggests no land that went off the market during the two-week period between the Alfieri contract and the date the existence of that contract was discovered. Again, plaintiff lost nothing as a result of its delay in learning about the contract. Nothing in this record suggests that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">My colleagues\u2019 suggestion that perhaps the secretiveness, compounded of the failure to notify Beitman or plaintiff of Alfieri\u2019s contract or of the fact that Alfieri had designed the bid Cali submitted, was intended to place Beitman in a \u201ctight spot\u201d so that he (Beitman) would have been compelled to execute a lease, is nothing but sheer speculation which, even if true, does not spell out a case warranting imposition of liability. Nothing in the record suggests that Beitman was in an ever tightening spot as time went on. He had been negotiating with Cali from December 1972 without ever having made a binding commitment or advanced one penny of hard cash. How or why, or if he was becoming more desperate with the passage of each day, is not explained by the testimony in this case. Certainly, Beitman would have been as able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>search for alternative sites a few weeks later, as he did when he learned of Alfieri\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Moreover, if morals are to be considered, it seems to me that plaintiff, as Reitman\u2019s agent and fiduciary, was obligated to act in the best interests of his principal. The fact that Reitman\u2019s best interests might lie in leasing from Alfieri in a transaction which would yield plaintiff no commission provides a poor excuse to plaintiff to induce Reitman to relinquish a beneficial lease in favor of some lesser alternative simply for the purpose of obtaining commissions for plaintiff. In any event, such a theory of recovery was never pleaded, argued or charged to the jury, and was never even argued to this court on appeal. Nothing factually or legally suggests merit to this court\u2019s position in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Alfieri was charged with the tort of maliciously interfering with plaintiff\u2019s economic expectations; that was the theory upon which the ease was submitted to the jury and the theory upon which plaintiff\u2019s recovery was sought to be sustained on appeal. Its expectation of economic advantage was the contract for commissions from Cali contingent on a successful consummation of a transaction with respect to Cali\u2019s land. The contingency failed when Alfieri purchased the land in question. After that event, Cali could no longer sell the land or lease it to anyone, and plaintiff\u2019s expectancy of a commission with respect to such a transaction was at an end. Cali had a perfect right to sell the land to Alfieri and Alfieri had an equally perfect right to buy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">I cannot see how plaintiff\u2019s expectancy could have precluded Alfieri from purchasing this land, and my colleagues do not even suggest otherwise. Moreover, see <em>George F. Hewson Co. v. Hopper, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. 525 </em>(E. &amp; A. 1943). The Alfieri-Cali contract was not contingent upon execution of the Reitman lease, and the conduct of the parties to the contract negate that such was an unspoken contingency. Again, the undisputed evidence is that the soil contingency to the Alfieri-Cali contract was disposed of on May 8, 1973 by a letter addendum to the April 18, 1973 contract, pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>cisely during the period when Eeitman was declaring his determination not to lease from Alfieri and when he had embarked on the two-three-week search for alternative land sites. Notwithstanding Alfieri\u2019s knowledge of Beitman\u2019s declared determination not to deal with him, he (Alfieri) chose not to declare his contract with Cali at an end on the pretense of finding unfavorable soil conditions, but rather chose to settle that problem by agreement, thus rendering his obligation to Cali irrevocable. All of the evidence in the case, from the beginning of Alfieri\u2019s interest in the land through his oral agreement with Cali on March 16, 1973 to his written contract and settlement of the soil contingency clause, absolutely negates any notion that his purchase was in any way contingent on the successful consummation of the Eeitman lease. No jury could have found otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Plaintiff never acted on behalf of Alfieri; Alfieri never asked him to do so. Plaintiff did not introduce Eeitman to Alfieri; Eeitman approached Alfieri directly. Although it\u2019s undoubtedly true that plaintiff introduced Eeitman to the land when it was owned by Cali, plaintiff did so for Eeitman and then for Cali\u2019s benefit, not for Alfieri\u2019s. Although it is also undoubtedly true that Alfieri derived a benefit from plaintiff\u2019s activity in introducing Eeitman to the land, that fact does not convert Alfieri\u2019s refusal to pay commissions into a tort, at least in the absence of any consensual basis for such an obligation, implied in fact or law. The case was not pleaded or submitted to the jury on any theory akin to <em>quantum meruit </em>or <em>quasi </em>contract, probably because plaintiff realized that the essentials of such a recovery were absent from the case. In <em>Callano v. Oakwood Park Homes </em>Corp., 91 <em>N. J. Super. </em>105 (App. Div. 1966), defendant developer received the benefit of shrubs placed upon the land by plaintiff for another. A judgment for plaintiff was reversed despite the benefit received, because at the time plaintiff installed the shrubs it expected remuneration from another, not from defendant. As stated by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>They [plaintiffs] had no dealings with defendant, and did not expect remuneration from it when they provided the shrubbery. No issue of mistake on the part of plaintiffs is involved. Under the existing circumstances we believe it would be inequitable to hold defendant liable. * * * A plaintiff is not entitled to employ the legal fiction of <em>quasi-contract </em>to \u201csubstitute one promisor or debtor for another.\u201d [at 109-110]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">See also, <em>Gould v. Amer. Water Wks. Service Co., 52 N. J. </em>226 (1968); <em>Shapiro v. Solomon, </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>377, 383-384 (App. Div. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">So in the present ease \u2014 during the extended period of time plaintiff acted on behalf of Reitman, and then for Cali on the latter\u2019s express agreement to pay plaintiff commissions on any successful transaction with respect to the land, plaintiff expected, and could have expected, no commissions from defendant. Before Alfieri\u2019s purchase there existed no relationship between plaintiff and him. Plaintiff never operated under any mistake of fact with respect to this expectancy, and no fraud on Alfieri\u2019s part deprived plaintiff of its expectations of a commission. Again, the only conduct on the part of Alfieri which deprived plaintiff of its expected commission was Alfieri\u2019s purchase of the land\u2014 a transaction which, I submit, cannot be deemed a malicious act interfering with plaintiff\u2019s expectations. See <em>George F. Hewson Co. v. Hopper, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Moreover, plaintiff was at all time well aware of the ever-present hazard to its commissions from the sale of the land to another. The record is rife with references to plaintiff\u2019s sense of urgency, which it communicated to the principals by counselling speed in negotiations by almost daily telephone calls. In fact, it was in recognition of the hazard of what actually did occur that plaintiff urged Reitman to procure a 45-day option on the land from Cali for a price of $10,000, which Reitman declined to do. Apparently Reitman was so undecided about the land and his intentions with respect to it that he' declined to put up the money necessary to provide him with some freedom of action. Hence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the Alfieri-Cali contract came as no surprise to plaintiff, but merely as the realization of its worst fears. Moreover, plaintiff was not without the means of self-protection. As a broker of substance, accustomed to dealing in large figures with substantial industrial property, it could have exacted from Eeitman an obligation to pay commissions for the substantial work plaintiff was doing on his behalf in the event such commissions, for any reason, were not forthcoming from the seller. It chose not to do so, probably because it feared loss of a client. It took its risks in that regard and cannot now put the consequences on defendant who asked it do nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In short, my analysis of this interesting case convinces me that the expectancy of economic advantage which measures the damages imposed upon Alfieri was plaintiff\u2019s contract for commissions with Cali. The event which terminated that expectancy was the Alfieri contract, an arms-length, bona fide transaction for a substantial purchase price, not contingent Upon the execution of a lease with Eeitman, procured through the offices of another broker who was paid a full commission for his services. Cali had a right to sell to Alfieri and Alfieri had a right to purchase from Cali. There is not the slightest suggestion that Alfieri and Cali had any prior relationship. The April 18, 1973 Alfieri-Caii contract was the only event from which plaintiff\u2019s loss of expectancy can be traced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time, its loss was total except perhaps if the transaction failed to close for some reason. Nothing that occurred thereafter could increase this loss, and nothing did. Neither the secrecy which my colleagues perceive nor Alfieri\u2019s participation in the Cali bid submitted after April 18, 1973 could have caused any loss. Indeed, as a result of Alfieri\u2019s negotiations with Eeitman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>new terms were agreed to; Alfieri insisted upon $1.75 a square, foot as the rental rather than the $1.70 a square foot rental the Cali bid had disclosed. Plaintiff\u2019s contention on appeal that.Alfieri simply took over the Cali-Reitman lease prospect is simplistic and unrealistic. First, Alfieri, as previously noted, did no such thing; he made a better deal for himself. Second, he could not take over the deal; he had no power to do so. There was no deal at the time and Reitman had to agree to any deal which was proposed. And, as has been noted, Reitman initially refused to deal with Alfieri. In any event, and viewed in .its legal aspects, whether all that was so or not, such events, the secrecy and Alfieri\u2019s- participation in. the designing of Cali\u2019s bid had no effect whatever, that I can discern, on plaintiff\u2019s loss. Had those events. not occurred, plaintiff\u2019s loss would have be.en the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">One of the essentials of a recovery -for malicious interference with prospective economic advantage is that the act of malicious interference must have been, the cause of plaintiff\u2019s loss. Prosser, <em>Torts </em>(4 ed. 1971), \u00a7 130 at 953. All of the reported cases so require either expressly or by necessary implication. I agree with my colleagues that plaintiff\u2019s claim cannot be condemned simply because the facts underlying it fail to parallel those of any reported case. Each case must indeed be decided upon its own facts since the conduct resorted to bilk brokers of their legitimately expected commissions can never be predicted with precision. The law must be equal to perfidy, whatever form it takes.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Nonetheless, the decided cases should not be ignored. They do set forth a standard and from them can be extrapolated the essentials of the tort without which no action will lie, and one of those elements is that the condemned conduct, whatever its form, must have occasioned the loss. <em>Harris v. </em>Perl, 41 <em>N. J. </em>455 (1964), which my colleagues regard as the principal support for their conclusions, does not hold otherwise. In <em>Harris </em>the defendant, ultimately held liable foT his broker\u2019s commissions, had retained the broker to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>find him a residence. In response to this request the broker performed services with the desired result \u2014 the residence defendant wanted and at the price he was willing to pay. Moreover, defendant knew that for the services being performed by the broker at his, defendant\u2019s request, the broker expected to receive commissions from the seller of the residence. During the period of negotiations, however, defendant came into possession of knowledge which he thought would enable him to purchase the residence at his price but without payment of the broker\u2019s commissions. He had learned that during negotiations title to the house had passed to a bank, also a party, in payment for a preexisting debt of the seller. Accordingly, he put off; his broker with a fib, telling her he was too busy to talk to her, so that he could instead deal directly with the bank for the sole purpose and with the effect of contracting with the bank for the purchase of the residence without the price reflecting the amount of commissions his broker had been expecting. The court was careful to point out that had he dealt fairly with his own agent by disclosing his knowledge that the bank was the title holder, the broker could have attempted to obtain recognition from the bank and an agreement on its part to pay the commissions. Moreover, the court made clear that the bank\u2019s agreement to pay the commissions before disclosure of the purchaser\u2019s identity was a virtual certainty had it been asked to do so, thus forging the causal link between the tortious act and plaintiff\u2019s loss so conspicuously absent in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 461. It was defendant\u2019s failure to disclose to his broker that the bank was the title holder for the purpose and with the effect of depriving her of the opportunity to obtain recognition, <em>which would have been forthcoming, </em>that was the basis for the recovery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Hence, from <em>Harris v. </em>Perl, supra, can be extrapolated the following requirement for the tort: (1) a broker\u2019s legitimate expectation of commission for services performed; <em>(2) </em>an act of doubtful moral quality which was motivated by defendant\u2019s desire to deprive the broker of the commission expected and which had that effect, and (3) that had the act not been performed, the broker would, in all probability, have collected' the expected commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The same analysis of the earlier <em>Louis </em>Kamm, <em>Inc. v. Flink, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>582, <em>586 </em>(E. &amp; A. 1934), yields the same principles. \u2018There, the broker\u2019s cause of action was held sustainable on the theory that its disclosure to the seller of the identity of the prospective purchaser was made upon the assurance of a corporate seller\u2019s principal that the disclosure would be \u201cheld in the strictest confidence,\u201d and he ,(the broker) would not in any way be injured thereby. The proofs in that case justified the inference that the officer to whom disclosure was made violated that assurance of confidence, disclosed the purchaser\u2019s identity to his brother, a broker in competition with plaintiff, and that the motive of this disclosure was the payment of the commission to his brother, at the sacrifice of plaintiff\u2019s rights, in which disclosing officer was thereby enabled to share.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">There, too, analysis discloses that (1) the broker had an expectation of commission from the seller; (2) defendant committed an act which was both breach of a contract of confidence and transgressive of generally acceptable moral principles (breaking one\u2019s word) which was motivated by the desire, and had the effect, of depriving the broker of the expected commission, and (3) had the act not been performed, the broker would have collected the expected commission, the element lacking in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In <em>Sustick v. Slatina, </em>48 <em>N. J. Super. </em>134 (App. Div. 1957), the seller, who had agreed orally to pay commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>sions, misled the broker into believing that no deal was possible in order to deprive the broker of the expected commission, and then the buyer and the seller, dealing personally, consummated a deal which profited them by the loss o\u00ed the commissions which the seller had orally agreed to pay. The first element was present because the statute of frauds had been waived and the oral agreement was therefore fully enforceable. The second element was satisfied in the deception of the broker by leading him to believe no deal was possible, for the purpose of depriving him of his expectations. Had they not deceived the broker in order to deal personally with each other, the commissions would almost certainly have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In <em>Brenner &amp; Co. v. Perl, 72 N. J. Super. </em>160 (App. Div. 1962), the seller waited until expiration of his agreement with his broker before selling to the buyer in order to beat his broker out of his expected commissions. The waiting, for the specific purpose of escaping liability for commissions otherwise owing by contract, was the act of interference with the broker\u2019s contractual right to commissions which was considered the tort. Without the delay occasioned only by the desire to avoid commissions, the commissions would have been collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Finally, in <em>McCann v. Biss, </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>301 (1974), the broker\u2019s suit in tort failed for failure to satisfy the first of the three elements, no legally enforceable claim to commissions, and hence no expectation of which he could he deprived. There, the broker had been denied commissions when the seller, -who had orally agreed to pay them, had dealt directly with the buyers who had been introduced to the property by the broker. Eecognizing that the claim on the contract could not be maintained for noncomplianee with the statute of frauds, the court considered the issue of whether, in such situations, a broker denied commissions for failure of the owner to honor the oral agreement to pay them, could recover them by resort to a tortious interference theory. The court held that he could not, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>We are of the opinion that, as a general proposition, a broker, who may not recover commissions from a seller directly by reason of the statute of frauds, may not accomplish the same result indirectly by a claim against the seller for wrongful interference with the broker\u2019s reasonable expectancy of the economic benefit. That expected benefit has to be the payment of commission by the seller, but the basis thereof is in turn the oral agreement between broker and seller which is void and unenforceable by reason of the. statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a claim actually seeks to enforce the oral agreement, amounts to an effort to evade the statute, and like a claim in <em>quantum meruit, </em>would substantially undercut the law and its spirit, [at 310].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The common thread running through all of the decided cases, and indeed through all tort law, is that conduct condemned as tortious becomes actionable only when it causes a loss, or when loss is presumed, as in cases, for example, of libel or slander <em>per se. </em>The loss so caused provides the measure of compensatory damages. In this case plaintiffs loss was caused by the Alfieri purchase of the land to which plaintiff introduced Reitman. Following that transaction plaintiffs expectations had come to an end, not through any tort but as the normal result of competition when another, privileged to do so, bought the land for which plaintiff was negotiating. The majority opinion recognizes this fundamental principle when it notes the necessity for \u201cproof that if there had been no interference there was a reasonable probability that the victim of the interference would have received the anticipated economic benefits.\u201d I agree with that principle. But its application to this case yields a result at variance with the one reached by my colleagues. Had Alfieri announced immediately to plaintiff the execution of the April 18 contract and had he not participated in designing the bid submitted by Cali, the result to plaintiff would have been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>same. It would not have been entitled to commissions. That principle is just another way of stating the requirement that the found tortious conduct must have caused, or at least contributed to, the loss; one test for determining such causal relationship is whether the loss would have been the same in the absence of such conduct. Here it was the same, and hence whatever Alfieri did, with the notable exception of purchasing the land, had nothing to do with plaintiff\u2019s loss or its extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">I cannot ignore that my colleagues\u2019 opinion makes a fundamental change in the law regarding real estate brokers and their rights to a commission. In its effect the opinion seems to regard a broker\u2019s expectancy of commission arising from the introduction of a purchaser or lessee to the land as a charge thereon, running with the land as a covenant and binding on all subsequent purchasers having knowledge thereof. Not only is such a view unsupported by authority but it runs directly contrary thereto. <em>George F. Hewson Co. v. Hopper, supra. </em>Although I would have no objection to considering this form of liability as a new principle, the parties have not asked us or the trial court to do so, and I question whether this is the court for such an undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As to a recovery in <em>quantum meruit, </em>I have previously suggested wherein the present matter lacks elements essential to that form of recovery. I see no reason to expand the scope of that well-defined doctrine to eliminate the disappointments of only real estate brokers. Further, the essential nature of a broker\u2019s expectancy provides further reason for approaching a <em>quantum meruit </em>recovery with caution. A broker\u2019s expectancy of a commission with respect to any transaction is a contingent one and hence the rate which measures it is designed with knowledge that in some transactions no commissions at all will be forthcoming. The commissions derived from a successful transaction must cover those instances where, despite considerable effort, no commission is collectible. The rate of commission exacted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>a seller, by the latter\u2019s agreement, bears no necessary or even probable relationship to the effort expended in a given transaction. Eor example, one telephone call or introduction can result in a sizeable commission, whereas, in another transaction, considerable effort will result in none. See, <em>e. g., American Trial Lawyers Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Supreme Ct., </em>126 <em>N. J. Super. </em>577 (App. Div.), aff\u2019d 66 <em>N. J. </em>258 (1974), wherein the court noted that contingent fee arrangements are contracts for \u201ca method for compensation which bears no direct relationship either to the effort expended * * * or the actual value of the services.\u201d 126 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 592. Nothing in this case suggests that plaintiff\u2019s efforts on Reitman\u2019s or Cali\u2019s behalf are worth in excess of $250,000. Indeed, no evidence at all was received in support of that theory. I view as inequitable, therefore, the assessment of damages on the basis of a contingent expectancy where the contingency which underlay it has failed. To do so in the present case results in giving plaintiff more than was bargained for and probably more than could have been recovered on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">I concede that it would have been a nice thing for Alfieri to have voluntarily agreed to pay in excess of $250,000 in commissions since he did derive benefit from plaintiff\u2019s activity. On the other hand, it is not exactly unusual for him to have declined to do so. Many people would. More importantly, I don\u2019t view this one tort, that of alleged malicious interference with economic advantage, as the only tort wherein a jury may, without more, assess substantial damages whenever it takes issue with the morality of a defendant\u2019s actions which cause no loss. And yet, that is precisely what this jury was asked to do in this case, and undoubtedly what it did. They obviously felt that Alfieri should have paid the commissions because he received benefit from plaintiff\u2019s introducing Reitman to the property. I don\u2019t conceive such facts, without a good deal more, as a proper basis for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">I would reverse and enter judgment for defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Reitman\u2019a architect did not finish his work until April 1, 1973 because, as he testified, Reitman had still not decided where he wanted to locate his building. Alfieri had, by March 16, 1973, two weeks earlier, orally agreed on a purchase price for the entire tract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The court\u2019s suggestion that perhaps someone else\u2019s soil-testing rig was brought on the land \u2022 is both unsupported and unavailing. The presence of any rig would have provided Reitman with notice of another\u2019s interest in the land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The charge did not, however, inform the jury of the possible significance of the Cali-Alfieri sale upon plaintiff\u2019s right to commissions and, hence, they might well have overlooked the effect that the sale had on plaintiff\u2019s expectation of a commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The bank title holder was the party in a position similar to Alfieri\u2019s, a subsequent grantee. The bank obtained summary judgment in its favor on the broker\u2019s claim against it. Apparently no appeal was taken from this determination. The purchaser\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>against the bank for contribution as a joint tortfeasor also went unresolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b248-5\"> Although the statute of frauds, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>25:1-9, pertaining to real estate brokers, is not here applicable because a lease rather than a sale is involved, the statute underscores the necessity for agreement, even oral in the case of leases, as the basis for imposition of liability for commissions. \u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
