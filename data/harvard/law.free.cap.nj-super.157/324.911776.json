A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ATNP\">Carmen Iannelli, a 50-year-old firefighter employed by the Camden Pire Department since 1953, died suddenly on June 5, 1975 after participating in the fighting of a fire. His widow filed an application for accidental death pension benefits with the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :16A-10. The board of trustees of the system denied her application. She appealed, whereupon an administrative hearing was held, following which the hearing officer recommended that the decision of the board of trustees denying the application be affirmed, essentially upon findings that \u201c[t]he work effort of June 4th and 5th, 1975 involved no injury by external force or violence,\u201d and \u201c[d]eath resulted from work effort alone.\u201d The board of trustees adopted the recommendation and rejected the claim. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The issue is whether decedent\u2019s death after prolonged exposure on the night in question to smoke and fumes from burning bales of paper in an open area adjacent to a ware<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>house resulted from an \u201caccident\u201d within the purview of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 TGA-IO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In determining this question we apply the judicial guidelines for \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d the term appearing in accidental disability retirement statutes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which has been equated with the word \u201caccident\u201d in death benefit statutes. <em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund,, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>142, 152-153 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On the evening of June 4, 1975, at about 8:30 o\u2019clock, the deceased proceeded with his unit to the scene of the fire in response to a second alarm. After deploying the hoses he and other firemen ascended the roof of the warehouse from which place they directed water onto the burning bales of paper. The acting captain of the unit described the conditions which existed: \u201cthere was a lot of smoke,\u201d \u201cmost of the time it was just black smoke,:\u201d \u201c[t]he wind was blowing against us,\u201d \u201c[w]e were eating smoke all the time,\u201d \u201cit was very intense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">After about a half-hour, the unit moved to another location, where the wind again blew smoke toward them. They remained in the area for four to five hours, during which the deceased walked around close to the heat and the smoke, directing a hose on the various \u201cperimeter fires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Upon their return to the firehouse, at about 1:45 a.m., the firemen proceeded to stretch out the hoses in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>wash them down. As the deceased was unrolling a hose he suddenly collapsed. He had not complained that evening about his health or physical condition. He was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">An autopsy disclosed the cause of death to be \u201cacute pulmonary-congestion and edema due to idiopathic [unknown] cardiomyopathy.\u201d The medical examiner reported that \u201cThis is a natural cause of death and persons with this type of heart disease<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are subject to sudden death under a wide variety of circumstances, it appears likely that the vigorous e'xertion which Mr. Iannelli was subjected in performing his duties on that day played a role in precipitating his death.\u201d However, according to the deceased\u2019s widow, he had no prior history-of heart disease or any other significant medical problem. In addition, a note was produced at the hearing from the deceased\u2019s personal physician, who had been treating him since 1971, in which he stated that during that time the-deceased \u201chad not once complained of, had any symptoms of, or was treated in any way, shape or form for a cardiac condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADL\">. Appellant\u2019s expert was Dr. Dominick D. Davalos, a board-eligible cardiologist who described himself as actively involved in health problems of special occupational groups, including firefighters. His testimony was by deposition. He expressed the-opinion, based upon a hypothetical question containing the essential facts and his review of the pertinent documents and records, that \u201cMr. Ianelli died of heart and lung damage that resulted from- exposure to a number of toxic environmental conditions and toxic gases .that he was exposed to over a six or seven hour period in fighting the paper fire.\u201d He- explained that the smoke indicated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>presence of carbon dioxide and an insufficient amount of oxygen. He said that paper fires produced cyanide gas. This exposure to heat, carbon monoxide, cyanide gas and lack of oxygen, according to the witness, was responsible for the fatal pulmonary edema, in that the irritation produced by inhalation of the smoke \u201ccaused fluid to pour out into the spaces of the lungs.\u201d He further stated that when the heart was unable to pump blood from the pulmonary circulation, \u201cfluids backed up.\u201d This, he said, was congestive heart failure. The witness noted that decedent was \u201cremarkably free of arteriosclerosis,\u201d and that the autopsy revealed a normal precordium and valves, with no indication of high blood pressure. He said it was inconceivable that decedent had suffered from any myocardial damage or pulmonary edema prior to the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The hearing officer here correctly perceived the main issue to be whether the death was the result of a traumatic event, \u201cwithin the meaning of the statute as interpreted by the various cases.\u201d But he resolved that issue adversely to appellant, expressing the view that while the death appeared to have stemmed directly from the work event, \u201cthe mishap or inhalation did not involve the application of external force to the body or the violent exposure of the body to some external force.\u201d He said that the \u2019deceased\u2019s usual and expected duty was to fight fires, with smoke inhalation as an attendant danger. It was his concept that injury resulting from ordinary work effort, though unexpected, was not \u201can extraordinary or unusual consequence in common experience,\u201d and \u201c[disability or death is not accidental within the meaning of this or similar statutes when all that appears is that the employee was doing his usual work in the usual way.\u201d He added that \u201c[i]nhaling smoke is a natural hazard of firemanic duty and as such does not constitute a traumatic event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We are convinced that the hearing officer was mistaken in his interpretation and application of the relevant principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number> Before the several public employee pension statutes, including the one here involved, were amended so as to make the granting of an accidental disability pension more difficult, an applicant needed to show only that the disability resulted from \u201can accident arising out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d a test equated with the principles applicable in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>Hillman v. Bd. of Trust., Pub. Emp. Ret. Sys., </em>109 <em>N. J. Super. </em>449, 459-460 (App. Div. 1970). The amendments,-in this instance <em>L. </em>1964, <em>c. </em>241, \u00a7 4, introduced the requirement that the permanent and total disability be \u201ca direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Legislature intended thereby to mandate \u201csomething- more than an unexpected injury or death to satisfy the requirement of accidental disability or accidental death.\u201d <em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Bund, supra, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>at 153-154. Thus, injury by \u201cordinary work effort or strain\u201d to a diseased heart, although \u201cunexpected by the individual afflicted,\u201d would- not be \u201can extraordinary or unusual conseq'uence in common experience,\u201d and \u201cdisability or death in such circumstances is not accidental within the meaning of a pension statute when all that appears is that the employee was doing his usual work in the usual way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154. But <em>cf. Skulski v. Nolan, </em>68 <em>N. J. </em>179, 207-208 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><em>Hillman, supra, </em>introduced a three-pronged test in determining \u201cwhether there truly was a traumatic event\u201d: that (a) the- event be identifiable as to time and place, (b) the injury or disability resulted directly from it, and (c) the event was undesigned, unexpected and unusual. 109 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 460-461. See <em>Shea v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>116 <em>N. J. Super. </em>348, 350 (App. Div. 1971). \u201cDirect result\u201d connoted \u201crelative freedom from remoteness, whether in terms of time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>intervention of other attributive causes or the like, or a combination of such factors.\u201d <em>Hillman, supra, </em>109 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 461; <em>Titman v. Bd. of Trustees, Teachers\u2019 Pens. &amp; An. Fund, </em>107 <em>N. J. Super. </em>244, 247 (App. Div. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The correctness of the <em>Hillman </em>definition of traumatic event was considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Cattani v. Bd. of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>69 <em>N. J. </em>578 (1976). This case involved an application by a retired fireman, totally and permanently disabled from performing firefighting duties, for accidental disability retirement under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:16A-7. It was denied by the board of trustees of the retirement system of which he was a member on the ground that the fireman\u2019s disability was unrelated to a traumatic event occurring in the performance of his duties. On appeal, this court, with one judge dissenting, reversed and ordered the board to grant the application. The Supreme Court reversed and reinstated the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The facts in that case were that Cattani\u2019s fire company, short two men, responded to a fire. He took part first in removing 75-pound lengths of hose from the engine, and he then dragged the hose into place and played water on the fire, following which he carried a section of hose up to the roof of an adjoining building. After returning to the ground he felt nauseous and dizzy and was administered oxygen. He was taken to a hospital, temporarily unable to move his arms and legs. He was examined there and released. Several days later, when episodes of paralysis recurred, Cattani was again admitted to a hospital. He was discharged about a month later with a diagnosis of basilar artery occlusion (obstruction of a major blood vessel leading to the brain), and type IV hyperlipidemia (an increase in the amount of fats in the blood stream, causing hardening of the arteries).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Medical evidence at the hearing given by a physician for the board of trustees included the opinion that Cattani\u2019s underlying, pre-existing disease could have been aggravated and rendered symptomatic by the added strain and effort at the fire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>but was not caused by it. Cattani\u2019s medical expert agreed as to the preexisting condition. While he thought that the stress and strain probably increased the clotting mechanism in the blood, thus bringing about the final closing of the basilar artery; he conceded that a person could suffer an episode such as Cattani did, without experiencing any strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">This court held, following <em>Hillman, </em>that the work effort at the fire .was a traumatic event since it was both unusual and excessive, and that the disabling condition was the direct result thereof. The Supreme Court found the third prong of the <em>Hillman </em>test (an undesigned, unexpected and unusual event) to.be too broad, \u201cfrustrating] the restriction which the Legislature intended to place on the granting of an accidental disability pension when it substituted the expression \u2018traumatic event\u2019 for the word \u2018accident\u2019.\u201d 69 <em>N. J. </em>at 585. It stressed-that much more must be' shown than \u201cdisability resulting from the aggravation or acceleration of a preexisting disease even though unusual or excessive work effort is involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It said that the word \u201ctraumatic\u201d in the statute was intended to describe the event which results in a disabling injury, rather than the injury itself. <em>Id. </em>at 586. The phrase \u201ctraumatic event\u201d was defined as ordinarily implicating \u201ca mishap or accident involving the application of some kind of external' force to the body of the. violent exposure of the body to some external force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court recognized, however, that \u201ca traumatic event' may possibly be found in some situations which do not literally, fall within the external force 'or violence-concept but still might be regarded as having traumatic-origin.\u201d <em>I</em>d.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"> The. specific conclusion reached in <em>Cattani </em>was that tvhere disability- is the end result of a .preexisting cardiovascular condition, work effort alone, \u2022 whether unusual or excessive,-cannot be considered a traumatic event, even though it may have aggravated or. accelerated the preexisting disease; But the-court-also stated, that'th\u00e9 result would be different-if it were.' shown that the disability directly resulted from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>combined effect of a traumatic event and a preexisting disease. 69 <em>N. J. </em>at 586. Since there was no showing that Cattani\u2019s disability came about in any way from any injury caused by external force or violence, the court sustained the denial of the application. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The hearing officer in this case considered the facts in <em>Cattani </em>to be very similar to those in the matter before him. He was correct to the extent that both cases involved firemen whose \u201cusual and expected duty was to fight fires,\u201d and that fire \u201centails smoke and smoke inhalation [which are] dangers attendant upon the performance of fi remani\u00f3 duties.\u201d But he failed to take into account the substantial and significant factual differences between the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Cattani, it is to be noted, coneededly suffered from a preexisting, progressive cardiovascular disease, the end result of which in any case would have been some kind of heart episode. Although he was exposed to smoke while fighting the fire prior to his attack, the attack resulted from <em>work effort alone </em>and not wholly, or in combination with a preexisting disease, from any injury caused by external force or violence. But in the case under review no such prior, progressive disease was established, and the issue of aggravation or exacerbation did not arise. Moreover, the proofs here established that the death did not result from work effort alone; it was caused, rather, by the physiological consequences of the deceased\u2019s exposure to toxic smoke and fumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The precise question which thus confronts us is whether the inhalation of toxic smoke and fumes may constitute a traumatic event as defined in <em>Cattani; </em>that is, whether exposure to such smoke and fumes involves \u201cthe application of some kind of external force to the body or the violent exposure of the body to some external force.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cattani </em>did not define further the term \u201cexternal force,\u201d nor did it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>elaborate on the distinction, if any, between an external force applied to the body and the exposure of the body to an external force. Although the hearing officer in this case concluded that \u201cthe mishap or inhalation of gas\u201d did not involve the application of an external force, it is evident that he did so in the belief that a fireman\u2019s being exposed to \u201ca natural hazard of firemanic duty,\u201d such as inhaling smoke, did not amount to a traumatic event within the intendment \u25a0of the statute. We come to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The concept of \u201cexternal,\u201d in the context of death or injury, is that the causative means acts from without the body. The term \u201cforce\u201d relates to the cause of the injury or death. Thus the connotation of \u201cexternal force\u201d is an outside force applied to the body, or to which the body is exposed, resulting in injury, whether external or internal, or death. In this regard, one normally envisages a solid, physical object coming into contact with the body, such as a falling beam striking a fireman at the scene of a fire. <em>Cf. Still v. Bd. of Trustees, Pub. Emp. Ret. Syst., </em>144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>103 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 73 <em>N. J. </em>46 (1977). But we are unable to discern any sound reason for excluding smoke, fumes and gases from the classification of external forces, particularly since it has been held that where one dies from the inhalation of gas, the death, in such circumstances, results from an external agency, and is violent, in the sense that it was not in the ordinary course of nature. <em>Caffaro v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>14 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>167, 183 <em>A. </em>200, 201 (Sup. Ct. 1936), aff\u2019d 117 <em>N. J. L. </em>146 (E. &amp; A. 1936). See also, <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co. v. Van Altena, </em>67 <em>F. </em>3d 836, 839 (7 Cir. 1933). We entertain no doubt whatever that where one is subjected to toxic smoke and fumes resulting in death or total and permanent disablement of the body, such death or disability is directly caused by a traumatic event as defined in <em>Gattani,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We do not agree with the hearing examiner\u2019s view that the death in this ease was not accidental within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>meaning of the pension statute because \u201call that appears is that the employee was doing his usual work in the usual way.\u201d Whether the decedent was engaged in his usual work is immaterial if his death had a traumatic origin. The <em>Gattam </em>court\u2019s reference to unusual work effort is pertinent in deciding direct causation when a pre-existing disease is involved. But where, as here, the only question is whether a traumatic event occurred, the relative usualness of the work or the work effort is irrelevant. The only consideration is whether there was a traumatic event and, if there was, whether the death directly resulted therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We conclude that the deceased\u2019s exposure to the toxic smoke, fumes or gases, on the facts here present, satisfied the requirements of a traumatic event. There was a gaseous assault upon his heart and lungs with physical consequences so severe as to cause his death without the impetus of any-preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the final determination of the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System denying appellant\u2019s application for death pension benefits. The matter is remanded to said Board of Trustees with direction to grant the application. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">This section provides for accidental death benefits upon proof of death of a member in active service as a result of an accident met in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Such statutes, <em>e. g., N.
