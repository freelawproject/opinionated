The State contends that the police had ample justification to stop and search defendant based on probable cause or reasonable suspicion. Defendant, as appellee, has not filed a brief, but this will not prevent resolution of the matter. First Capitol Mortgage Corp. v. Talandis Construction Corp. (1976), 63 Ill. 2d 128, 345 N.E.2d 493.</p> <p id=\"b180-6\" pgmap=\"180\">Defendant was charged with possession of more than 500 grams of cannabis (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 56V2, par. 704(e)) as a result of a warrantless street search conducted on the south side of Chicago on February 17, 1984. At the evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the arresting officer testified that defendant was stopped, and, as the officers exited their car with guns drawn, defendant dropped the duffel bag he was carrying and raised his hands. A pat-down search of his person was conducted and the contents of defendant\u2019s duffel bag examined. It was the latter search which disclosed the 13 large bundles of contraband.</p> <p id=\"b180-7\" pgmap=\"180\">The arresting officer explained that the police action was prompted by a radio message of a man with a gun walking northbound from the 5100 block of South Drexel Boulevard; the offender was described as wearing a gray hat, maroon and gray striped sweater, black pants and a black coat. The officer and his partner then proceeded toward the scene, which was a short distance away, and as they reached the corner of 49th Street and Drexel Boulevard, they saw defendant, who was the only person in the area walking, moving northbound on the 4800 block of Drexel carrying a duffel bag. When the defendant turned toward them, the police could see that his clothing matched the description contained in the message. The officers then approached defendant and stopped him.</p> <p id=\"b180-8\" pgmap=\"180\">The trial court concluded that the officers\u2019 actions were reasonable, but indicated that it could not find a legal basis for the search of the duffel bag. The court stated that defendant \u201cno longer ha[d] possession of the bag.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b180-9\" pgmap=\"180(57) 181(272)\"> The State now contends that a police officer may arrest a person when he has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is committing or has committed an offense. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 38, par. 107 \u2014 2(c).) Under the totality of the circumstances, the State maintains that the officers acted properly because probable cause was established by the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge which enables a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been committed and that the person arrested has committed that offense. (People v. Lippert (1982), 89 Ill. 2d 171, 178, 432 N.E.2d 605.) The State indicates that probable cause did exist under the circumstances presented based on the description of the offender which matched defendant and defendant\u2019s location in relation to the broadcast information. Alternatively, the State maintains that, even if probable cause did not exist, the police could conduct a reasonable search pursuant to Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868, because the specific and \u00bfrticulable facts available to the arresting officers would have warranted a person of reasonable caution to believe that prompt police action involving a limited search for weapons to protect their safety was necessary. The State maintains that under such circumstances the officer could also search any area within the person\u2019s immediate grasp and any item or container within the immediate area of the suspect in order to determine if it contained a weapon. The State contends that it would be impossible to ascertain whether the duffel bag contained a gun by merely touching the outside of the bag and that a search of the bag was therefore justified given the fact that the police had at least a reasonable suspicion that defendant was carrying a gun. Finally, the State asserts the proposition that defendant abandoned the bag and may therefore not contend that it was seized and searched improperly.</p> <p id=\"b181-5\" pgmap=\"181\">We dispense with the State\u2019s final argument by merely noting that in this case the defendant dropped a duffel bag as the police exited their squad car with drawn guns. It is clear that if in effect an abandonment did occur by the defendant, such abandonment was prompted by the police action. If the police action was improper, the State may not rely upon the defendant\u2019s dropping the bag to justify the subsequent seizure and search of the bag. (See 1 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure sec. 2.6, at 373-74 (1978).) Further, under the circumstances we do not believe that defendant abandoned a reasonable expectation of privacy as to the contents of the duffel bag. See People v. Collins (1985), 106 Ill. 2d 237, 478 N.E.2d 267, cert, denied (1985), 474 U.S___, 88 L. Ed. 2d 274, 106 S. Ct. 267.</p> <p id=\"b181-6\" pgmap=\"181(65) 182(211)\"> We believe that probable cause for defendant\u2019s arrest existed, and that a search of defendant\u2019s person and property within his immediate reach in the duffel bag was proper. Here, the trial court accepted the arresting officer\u2019s testimony as truthful because it stated that he and his partner had acted reasonably under the circumstances. Clearly the officers were acting upon specific and articulable information received through a radio broadcast indicating that a man was carrying a gun. They saw the defendant in the area near the sight described in the occurrence, defendant matched the clothing description, and he was walking in the direction of the individual described in the broadcast. We concur in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the police acted properly in stopping the defendant. The fact that they exited the vehicle with guns drawn is only a circumstance which indicates that the officers actually feared for their safety in approaching someone who might possibly be carrying a gun. In People v. McElroy (1976), 44 Ill. App. 3d 1047, 358 N.E.2d 1180, police responded to a radio broadcast of a woman with a gun. After concluding that defendant was the more likely of two women on the street to have the weapon, police arrested her and then found the gun in her purse. This court held that the arrest and subsequent search of her purse disclosing the weapon were proper. The facts of McElroy closely resemble the facts of the present case. As such the police officers\u2019 search of the bag here was made incident to a lawful arrest, and defendant may not contend that the officers acted improperly.</p> <p id=\"b182-5\" pgmap=\"182\"> Finally, even if probable cause did not exist to arrest defendant and search his bag, a limited search under Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868, to protect the police officer who has a reasonable suspicion that defendant may be carrying a dangerous weapon was proper. It would seem contrary to this tenet that the contents of a bag which the defendant was carrying and was within his immediate grasp could not be subject to a search if the officers could lawfully search the defendant\u2019s person. See 3 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure sec. 9 \u2014 4, at 134 (1978).and 1985 Pocket Part at 78-79.</p> <p id=\"b182-6\" pgmap=\"182\"> We therefore believe that the police acted properly in searching the duffel bag which defendant had dropped to the ground upon the approach of the officers. To hold otherwise would subject these officers to the possible danger that upon having the duffel bag returned to him by the officers when no evidence of a weapon was found on his person, defendant would then produce the weapon from the duffel bag and fire at the officers. See People v. Berry (1977), 54 Ill. App. 3d 647, 370 N.E.2d 26, where the police searched a jacket thrown to the ground by defendant upon their arrival in response to a dispatch of a man with a gun.</p> <p id=\"b182-7\" pgmap=\"182\"> Accordingly, the order of the circuit court of Cook County is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings. Since this appeal is not taken from a conviction, we deny the State\u2019s request that defendant be assessed $50 as costs for this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b183-4\" pgmap=\"183\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b183-5\" pgmap=\"183\">SULLIVAN, P.J., concurs.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b180-10\" pgmap=\"180\"> This opinion was prepared, approved and presented by Justice Mejda, and concurred in by Justice Sullivan, prior to the retirement of Justice Mejda.</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b183-6\" pgmap=\"183\">JUSTICE PINCHAM</author> <p id=\"A6q\" pgmap=\"183\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b183-7\" pgmap=\"183\">I dissent. This case is but one of many in which the triple barrel is ' fired, \u201c(1) radio message probable cause, (2) stop and frisk, and (3) drop,\u201d to validate an arrest and/or a search. Invariably, the trial court or the court of review holds that one of the barrels has hit the legality target.</p> <p id=\"b183-8\" pgmap=\"183\">Although the trial court in the case before us stated, \u201cI think the officers acted reasonably and obviously in doing exactly what they did,\u201d the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 conduct is not the criteria for determining the validity of an arrest. The constitutional requirement is \u201cprobable cause\u201d for the arrest. An officer may act reasonably in making an arrest but without probable cause, in which event the arrest is constitutionally invalid.</p> <p id=\"b183-9\" pgmap=\"183\">The trial judge did not predicate his ruling on the \u201cradio message probable cause\u201d barrel. Rather, the trial judge predicated his ruling on the \u201cdrop\u201d barrel, holding:</p> <blockquote id=\"b183-10\" pgmap=\"183\">\u201cBut I am somewhat troubled. I don\u2019t know how they can get into the bag. I say that advisedly having some idea what was in the bag. I just don\u2019t know how you can justify them going into the bag. He no longer has possession of the bag. Motion to suppress will be sustained.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b183-11\" pgmap=\"183\">This court, however, relies on the \u201cradio message probable cause\u201d barrel to strike the legality target for the defendant\u2019s arrest. The reliability of the source of the information of the radio message is not revealed in the record before us; nor is the source of the information of the radio message disclosed. The time that the information was initially submitted to the radio dispatch is not given. To constitutionally validate an arrest and search on uncorroborated radio message testimony and the officers\u2019 possibly post-arrest acquired information subjects the privacy of all citizens to the unbridled whims of law enforcement officers.</p> <p id=\"b183-12\" pgmap=\"183\">In this case, the record reveals that the police reports of the facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s arrest were necessarily prepared after the defendant\u2019s arrest, which arrest occurred on February 17, 1984. Yet, on March 21, 1984, on the hearing of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the following colloquy occurred and the arresting officer testified:</p> <blockquote id=\"b183-13\" pgmap=\"183\">\u201cQ. Just prior to approaching the defendant, had you received a call on the radio?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-4\" pgmap=\"184\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-5\" pgmap=\"184\">MR. SCOTT [attorney for defendant]: I am going to object to any testimony regarding any calls on the radio. We served a subpoena on the police department for that, and the police department did not honor the subpoena. They told us they erased the tapes on the 20th of February, three days later.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-6\" pgmap=\"184\">THE COURT: Well, I will allow him to answer the question. Objection overruled. He may answer.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-7\" pgmap=\"184\">THE WITNESS: Would you repeat the question?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-8\" pgmap=\"184\">MR. HYNES [assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Did you receive a call on the radio in the squad car shortly before seeing the defendant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-9\" pgmap=\"184\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-10\" pgmap=\"184\">Q. What was the nature of the call?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-11\" pgmap=\"184\">A. Simulcast of a man with a gun.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-12\" pgmap=\"184\">Q. Did they give you any other information?'</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-13\" pgmap=\"184\">A. Walking northbound on Drexel Boulevard from 51st Street and also gave a clothing description.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-14\" pgmap=\"184\">Q. What was that clothing description, to the best of your recollection?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-15\" pgmap=\"184\">A. Gray hat, maroon and gray striped sweater, black pants and a black coat.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b184-16\" pgmap=\"184\">The defense attorney\u2019s efforts to obtain the tapes of the radio message for possible impeachment purposes were successfully thwarted by erasure of the tapes. Corroboration, if any, of the officer\u2019s testimony of the radio message was obliterated by the police department.</p> <p id=\"b184-17\" pgmap=\"184\">Further examination of arresting officers regarding the clothing description is quite notable.</p> <p id=\"b184-18\" pgmap=\"184\">The arresting officers knew the descriptive content of the radio message when they prepared their reports of the defendant\u2019s arrest. More importantly, they were certainly aware of the description of the defendant\u2019s wearing apparel when they prepared their post-arrest police reports. Examination of the arresting officer on the clothing description in the radio message and his post-arrest police report is also quite notable:</p> <blockquote id=\"b184-19\" pgmap=\"184\">\u201cQ. Officer, did you prepare a case report in this matter?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-20\" pgmap=\"184\">A. My partner prepared the case report.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-21\" pgmap=\"184\">Q. Your partner was in the car with you when you heard the simulcast?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-22\" pgmap=\"184\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b184-23\" pgmap=\"184\">Q. Did you read the report he prepared and sign it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-4\" pgmap=\"185\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-5\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. I show you what\u2019s marked Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, for identification, and ask you to look at that and tell me if that is the report that was prepared in this matter?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-6\" pgmap=\"185\">A. This is an arrest report.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-7\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. Well, did you prepare an arrest report?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-8\" pgmap=\"185\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-9\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. Now, sir, would you look at that report. Anyplace in that report does it say the man had on a black overcoat?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-10\" pgmap=\"185\">A. No, it doesn\u2019t.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-11\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. Is there any place in that report where it says a man was walking north from 51st Street?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-12\" pgmap=\"185\">A. No, it doesn\u2019t.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-13\" pgmap=\"185\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-14\" pgmap=\"185\">MR. SCOTT: It was dark out, it was nighttime, is that right, is that correct?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-15\" pgmap=\"185\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-16\" pgmap=\"185\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-17\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. Were you able to see the striped shirt when you approached the defendant?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-18\" pgmap=\"185\">A. Not when we originally approached him.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-19\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. You approached him from behind, is that correct, sir?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-20\" pgmap=\"185\">A. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b185-21\" pgmap=\"185\">The arresting officer\u2019s testimony regarding the \u201cdrop\u201d barrel aspect of the arrest and search is also revealing:</p> <blockquote id=\"b185-22\" pgmap=\"185\">\u201cQ. What happened next?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-23\" pgmap=\"185\">A. We exited our vehicles. The defendant dropped the large</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-24\" pgmap=\"185\">duffel bag and put his hands in the air.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-25\" pgmap=\"185\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-26\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. Did either of you have your guns drawn?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-27\" pgmap=\"185\">A. Yes, I believe we did.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-28\" pgmap=\"185\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-29\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. And, officer as you approached the defendant, what did your partner do with relation to that bag?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-30\" pgmap=\"185\">A. He took the bag and felt the bag.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-31\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. And after making \u2014 feeling the bag, what did he do?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-32\" pgmap=\"185\">A. He opened the bag.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-33\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. And what was observed inside the bag?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-34\" pgmap=\"185\">A. Several large packages that were crammed into the duffel bag and wrapped in cellophane.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-35\" pgmap=\"185\">Q. What was inside those cellophane bags?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b185-36\" pgmap=\"185\">A. Crushed green plant.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-4\" pgmap=\"186\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-5\" pgmap=\"186\">Q. Now, sir, when your partner was feeling this duffel bag, do you know whether or not he felt any hard objects in the duffel bag?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-6\" pgmap=\"186\">A. He told me he did.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-7\" pgmap=\"186\">Q. What were the hard objects he got out of the duffel bag that felt like a gun or a weapon?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-8\" pgmap=\"186\">MR. HYNES: Objection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-9\" pgmap=\"186\">THE COURT: I will let him answer, if he can.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-10\" pgmap=\"186\">THE WITNESS: We removed 13 large bundles of what now proved to be green crushed plant that was tightly wrapped in clear Saran Wrap.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-11\" pgmap=\"186\">MR. SCOTT: They felt like guns?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-12\" pgmap=\"186\">A. Hard object.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-13\" pgmap=\"186\">Q. They felt like guns?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-14\" pgmap=\"186\">MR. HYNES: Objection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b186-15\" pgmap=\"186\">THE COURT: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b186-16\" pgmap=\"186\">It is difficult to perceive how crushed green plant, packaged in cellophane inside a duffel bag could feel like a gun. It is therefore understandable why the assistant' State\u2019s Attorney objected to this inquiry. It is not understandable, however, why the trial judge sustained his objection.</p> <p id=\"b186-17\" pgmap=\"186\">Although it is axiomatic that the fruit of a search cannot be relied upon to justify the search, nevertheless, it is noteworthy in the case before us no gun was found on or about the defendant \u2014 which was the \u201cradio message probable cause\u201d for the officers initial arrest of the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b186-18\" pgmap=\"186\">The citizen\u2019s constitutional right of privacy and to be free from unwarranted government intrusion merits greater protection and should not be allowed to be so callously infringed upon and violated as it was in the case before us. The following authorities relied on by the majority to validate this arrest are not controlling.</p> <p id=\"b186-19\" pgmap=\"186\">In Terry v. Ohio (1968), 392 U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868, the defendant and his companion were observed by the officer repeatedly strolling back and forth, together and alone, peering in a store window, as though \u201ccasing a job, a stick-up.\u201d The officer approached and identified himself and asked for their names. The men mumbled something. The officer spun Terry around, patted down the outside of his clothing and felt a pistol in the left breast overcoat pocket. The \u201cstop and frisk\u201d was held not to violate Terry\u2019s fourth amendment constitutional right of privacy. Such is not the case before us.</p> <p id=\"b187-2\" pgmap=\"187\">People v. Collins (1985), 106 Ill. 2d 237, 478 N.E.2d 267, cert, denied (1985), 474 U.S___ 88 L. Ed. 2d 274, 106 S. Ct. 267, involved the search of a garbage bag which had been \u201cplaced in the second-floor landing of an outdoor stairway which served a multi-unit apartment building.\u201d The court held that this search \u201cwas no more intrusive than what the defendant might have expected from passing tenants, vagrants, neighborhood children or animals,\u201d and \u201csince the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to the place searched, the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment ***.\u201d Such is not the instant case.</p> <p id=\"b187-5\" pgmap=\"187\">In People v. McElroy (1976), 44 Ill. App. 3d 1047, 1050, 358 N.E.2d 1180, on facts appreciably different from the instant case, the court stated, \u201cWe recognize the danger inherent in police use of anonymous information for intrusive governmental action and expressly limit the effect of our opinion in that regard to exigent circumstances of the degree found in this case. [Citations.] We conclude that under the circumstances and exigencies of this case, the conduct of the police officer in arresting defendant and searching her purse was not unreasonable and did not exceed constitutional or statutory mandate.\u201d This is not the case before us.</p> <p id=\"b187-6\" pgmap=\"187\">I am of the opinion that the arrest of the defendant and the search of his duffel bag were constitutionally impermissible and the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress should be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
