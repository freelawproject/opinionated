He raises two questions, which we have reordered and rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">I. Did the juvenile court commit legal error by failing to recognize that it had discretion to grant him a hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">II. Did the juvenile court violate his due process rights by denying him an evidentiary hearing on his opposition to the guardianship petition?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the juvenile court erred in failing to grant Justus an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, we vacate the guardianship order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Justus K. was born on July 7, 1986 to Ingrid K., who was not married at the time and did not name a father on Justus\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>birth certificate. Ingrid K. later disclosed that George W. is Justus\u2019s father. George W. did not deny paternity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Until Justus was five years old, he and his siblings lived with Ingrid K. and George W.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On April 7, 1992,. DHHS filed a petition alleging that Ingrid K. was unable to provide minimal care and supervision for Justus and his three younger siblings and asking that they be found to be Children in Need of Assistance (CINA).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that point, Justus was committed to the custody of DHHS and placed in foster care. A month later, on May 6, 1992, Justus and his siblings were adjudicated CINA.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">At first, Justus lived in a foster home with one of his sisters. They later were separated. Since mid-1992, Justus has lived in four foster homes. During that time, George W. has had no contact with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">On November 21, 1994, Justus\u2019s mother died of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrom (AIDS). Three years later, on November 14, 1997, DHHS filed a petition for guardianship of Justus with the right to consent to adoption or long-term care short of adoption. DHHS alleged that George W. was withholding consent to the termination of his parental rights, contrary to Justus\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">On November 19, 1997, the juvenile court issued a show cause order to George W. at the Washington, D.C. address that was listed for him on the petition for guardianship. When service could not be effected because George W. could not be found at that address or elsewhere, DHHS filed a motion to waive notice, pursuant to Md.Code (1984, 1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-322(d) of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d). That motion was granted on January 12,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">In the meantime, on December 5, 1997, the juvenile court appointed counsel for Justus. It did so in accordance with the established practice of the juvenile court in Montgomery County in guardianship cases. The attorney who was appointed to represent Justus was not the same attorney who had represented him in the CINA proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">On February 23, 1998, DHHS filed a motion for final order of guardianship of Justus. Through his attorney, Justus filed a written opposition to DHHS\u2019s motion, in which he objected to the termination of his father\u2019s parental rights and requested that the juvenile court deny the petition for guardianship. He attached to Ms opposition a report by Ms therapist in which she states that she \u201ccannot readily support a plan for termination of parental rights, unless the Department has no other option.\u201d Justus requested that DHHS\u2019s motion for final order be set in for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">DHHS did not move to strike Justus\u2019s opposition. The juvenile court scheduled oral argument on the limited question \u201cwhether a hearing should be held on th[e] petition for [termination o\u00ed] parental rights.\u201d Counsel submitted memoranda of law. The argument took place on July 9, 1998, soon after Justus\u2019s twelfth birthday. Justus\u2019s counsel urged: 1) that the constitutional requirements of due process dictate that Justus be given the opportunity to be heard on the petition for guardianship; 2) that because Justus was not consenting to the termination of Ms father\u2019s parental rights, the petition for guardianship was \u201ccontested\u201d and therefore a hearing was required under Md. Rule 9 \u2014 109(a); and 3) that, even if the case were \u201cuncontested,\u201d the juvenile court had discretion to conduct a hearing and the proper exercise of discretion required that it do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Justus\u2019s counsel also proffered for the juvenile court some of the evidence that would be introduced at the sought after hearing. Specifically, she explained that Justus had lived with his father for five years, that he had some memories of George W., most of which were bad, and that he harbored some hope that he and his father would be reunited. In addition, Justus\u2019s counsel proffered that his therapist would testify about the basis for her opinion that termination of George W.\u2019s parental rights would not be in Justus\u2019s best interest at this time, including her clinical observation that Justus\u2019s mental state had deteriorated since the filing of the petition for guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Counsel for DHHS argued that because Justus\u2019s consent was not required for the granting of a guardianship, he had no standing to object and hence no right to be heard. Moreover, because Justus\u2019s father had consented to the guardianship, the case was \u201cuncontested,\u201d within the meaning of Md. Rule 9-109(a), and therefore a hearing was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">After counsel concluded their arguments, the juvenile court granted the guardianship petition without affording Justus a hearing. In doing so, the court noted that \u201cthis is really about the parents[\u2019] rights, not about the child\u2019s rights and that the child that is the subject of a guardianship proceeding does not have the right to consent and thus does not have the right to object.\u201d Thereafter, Justus noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">It will be helpful to preface our discussion of the issues presented with an outline of the pertinent portions of the Maryland statutory scheme for guardianships and adoptions, as set forth in Title 5, subtitle 3 of the Family Law Article and as implemented by Md. Rules 9-101 through 9-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">As used in subtitle 3 of the Family Law Article, a \u201cguardianship\u201d means \u201cguardianship with the right to consent to adoption or long-term care short of adoption.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>301(e). Only a minor may be placed under such a guardianship. F.L. \u00a7 5-307(b). The executive head of a child placement agency (which includes local departments of social services) or the attorney for a child on behalf of that child may file a petition for the agency to be granted guardianship of the child. F.L. \u00a7 5-317(a). No other person or entity may bring a guardianship action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">A guardianship decree has the effect, <em>inter alia, </em>of terminating each natural parent\u2019s rights, duties, and obligations toward the child. F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 317(f)(1). Except as set forth by statute, a guardianship decree may be granted only after \u201cany investigation and hearing that the court considers necessary\u201d and only with the consent of each living natural parent of the child. F.L. \u00a7 5-317(c). If a natural parent of a child who is the subject of the petition for guardianship refuses to consent, the court may grant the guardianship only upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that, <em>inter alia, </em>it is in the best interest of the child to terminate the non-consenting natural parent\u2019s rights to the child. F.L. \u00a7 5-313(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Notice of a petition for guardianship must be given to each person whose consent is required, which, as explained above, includes each living natural parent of the child. F.L. \u00a7 5-322(a). When the child previously has been adjudicated to be CI\u00d1A and the petitioner has made good faith but unsuccessful efforts to serve the show cause order on a natural parent, the court may waive the requirement of notice to that parent. F.L. \u00a7 5-322(e)(8). In that case, the parent is deemed to have consented to the guardianship, and the petition is treated in the same manner as one to which consent has been given. F.L. \u00a7 o-322(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is not necessary for a child who is the subject of a guardianship proceeding to consent to it. Accordingly, the child is not a person who is entitled to notice of the petition for guardianship under F.L. \u00a7 5-322. If, however, the child has been adjudicated a CI\u00d1A, a neglected child, or an abused child, notice of the petition for guardianship must be provided to the attorney who represented the child in the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>proceeding. F.L. \u00a7 5-322(a)(l)(ii)(l). A child who has reached the age of ten, however, may not be adopted without his consent. F.L. \u00a7 5-311(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In an adoption case, the court must hold a hearing before entering a final decree. F.L. \u00a7 5-324.1. In a \u201ccontested\u201d guardianship action, an \u201con the record\u201d hearing on the merits must be held before the court enters a judgment of guardianship. Md. Rule 9-109(a). In such a hearing, the court must make the findings required by F.L. \u00a7 5-313.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In an \u201cinvolun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tary termination of parental rights\u201d proceeding, the court must appoint separate counsel to represent the child who is the subject of the proceeding (be it a petition for guardianship or for adoption). F.L. \u00a7 5-323(a)(l)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">It is clear that the statutory scheme outlined above does not require that the court conduct a hearing on a petition for guardianship when neither living natural parent has withheld consent, unless the court considers that a hearing is necessary. F.L. \u00a7 5-317(c)(l). In this case, Justus\u2019s only living natural parent, George W., did not withhold his consent to the guardianship. On the contrary, because he could not be found, notice to him was waived and he was deemed to have consented to the guardianship by operation of law. F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 322(d); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055/CAD, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681 (1997). Because it concluded that Justus\u2019s rights were not at stake, the juvenile court found that the hearing that Justus had requested was not necessary, and granted the petition without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Justus first contends that the juvenile court committed legal error because it denied him a hearing on the ground that it did not have the discretion to grant him one under the Family Law Article. This contention is not supported by the record. At no time during the oral argument on the question whether to grant Justus a hearing did the juvenile court indicate a belief or understanding that it was without discretion to do so. In fact, the record of the juvenile court\u2019s ruling makes plain that the court knowingly exercised its discretion to deny Justus a hearing because it did not consider a hearing to be necessary, in accordance with the standard set forth in F.L. \u00a7 5-317(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The primary question in this case thus becomes whether Justus has a liberty interest in his filial relationship with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>father that the State cannot disrupt without due process of law and, if so, whether the process to which Justus is due includes the opportunity to present evidence to the court. If so, the juvenile court did not have discretion to deny Justus the opportunity to present evidence, and erred in denying his request to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Justus contends, as he did below, that his liberty and property interests were at stake in the guardianship proceeding and, therefore, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, he was entitled to at least a minimum of procedural safeguards, including the opportunity to be heard, before the State could deprive him of those interests. DHHS counters that the only constitutionally protected interest implicated by its petition for guardianship was George W.\u2019s parental rights, and that because he had consented to the guardianship, a hearing was not required either under principles of due process or under the guardianship statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. U.S. Const, amend. XIV \u00a7 1. Among other things, the Due Process Clause affords a right to \u201cprocedural due process,\u201d that is, a constitutionally required minimum of procedural safeguards, in connection with a deprivation of life, liberty, or property by the State. <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 337, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (Stevens, J. concurring).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>We must begin our analysis of whether Justus\u2019s constitutional right to procedural due process was violated by determining the nature of the private interest that he contends was threatened by the State in the guardianship action. \u201cOnly after that interest has been identified, can we properly evaluate the adequacy of the State\u2019s process ... We therefore first consider the nature of the interest in liberty for which appellant claims constitutional protection and then turn to a discussion of the adequacy of the procedure that [the State] has provided for its protection.\u201d <em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 256, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983) (citing <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 482-83, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972)); <em>Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality and Reform, </em>431 U.S. 816, 838-39, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 (1977) (\u201cOur first inquiry is whether [challengers] have asserted interests within the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018property.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We note, preliminarily, that children are \u201cpersons\u201d under the Constitution and possess some constitutional rights. <em>See e.g. Bellotti v. Baird, </em>443 U.S. 622, 633, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[a] child, merely on account of his minority, is not beyond the protection of the Constitution\u201d); <em>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, </em>428 U.S. 52, 74, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976) (\u201cConstitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age of majority\u201d); <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 13, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967) (\u201cwhatever may be their precise impact, neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults alone\u201d); <em>Parham v. J.R., </em>442 U.S. 584, 600, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979) (child has substantial liberty interest in not being confined unnecessarily for medical treatment). Nevertheless, a child\u2019s liberty interests are not identical to those of an adult. The Supreme Court has long recognized the \u201cspecial needs of children,\u201d and thereby justified treating them differently than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>adults. <em>Bellotti, supra, </em>443 U.S. at 634, 99 S.Ct. 3035; <em>See also, May v. Anderson, </em>345 U.S. 528, 536, 73 S.Ct. 840, 97 L.Ed. 1221 (1953) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (stating that \u201c[c]hildren have a very special place in life which law should reflect. Legal theories and their phrasing in other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncritically transferred to determination of a State\u2019s duty towards children.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In this case, the liberty interest that Justus maintains warrants protection in the guardianship proceeding is his filial bond to the natural father with whom he lived until he was five years old but with whom he has had no contact for seven years. \u201cIt is an established part of our constitutional jurisprudence that the term \u2018liberty\u2019 in the Due Process Clause extends beyond freedom from physical restraint.\u201d <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D., </em>491 U.S. 110, 121, 109 S.Ct. 2333, 105 L.Ed.2d 91 (1989) (plurality opinion by Scalia, J.). \u201c[T]he Supreme Court has consistently maintained that \u2018freedom of personal choice in matters of ... family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Halderman v. Pennhurst State School and Hospital, </em>707 F.2d 702, 706 (3rd Cir., 1983) (quoting <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, </em>414 U.S. 632, 639-40, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974)). Furthermore, it is well-settled that the parent-child relationship gives rise to a liberty interest in the parent that may not be terminated by the State absent procedural safeguards that allow for fundamental fairness. <em>See, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) (holding that statute conclusively presuming that unwed father is unfit to have custody regardless of the actual relationship between father and child violates Due Process Clause); <em>Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981) (holding that a parent\u2019s desire for and right to companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her child is an important interest that warrants deference and protection absent a powerful countervailing interest); <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982) (holding that a parent has a protected liberty interest in relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>with child that State cannot sever absent proof of unfitness by clear and convincing evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The United States Supreme Court has not addressed directly the question whether a child\u2019s filial bond to his parents is a protected liberty interest under the Due Process Clause. In a case involving the termination of parental rights, the Court made plain, however, that the relationship between parent and child is neither one-sided nor one-dimensional: \u201cThe intangible fibers that connect parent and child have infinite variety. They are woven throughout the fabric of our society, providing it with strength, beauty, and flexibility. It is self-evident that they are sufficiently vital to merit constitutional protection in appropriate cases.\u201d <em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 256, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983) (also observing, <em>id. </em>at 258, 103 S.Ct. 2985, that \u201cthe relationship of love and duty in a recognized family unit is an interest in liberty entitled to constitutional protection .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In a context outside of the termination of parental rights, one federal appeals court has recognized the existence of such a liberty interest. <em>Smith v. Fontana, </em>818 F.2d 1411, 1418 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 935, 108 S.Ct. 311, 98 L.Ed.2d 269 (1987) (\u201c[C]onstitutional interest in familial companionship and society logically extends to protect children from unwarranted stated interference with their relationships with their parents. The companionship and nurturing interests of parent and child in maintaining a tight familial bond are reciprocal, and we see no reason to accord less constitutional value to the child-parent relationship than we accord to the parent-child relationship.\u201d). <em>See also Franz v. United, States, </em>707 F.2d 582, 595 (D.C.Cir.1983) (freedom of personal choice in matters of family life that constitutes a fundamental liberty interest includes \u201cthe freedom of a parent and child to maintain, cultivate, and mold their ongoing relationship.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Our analysis of whether Justus K., as a child, has a liberty interest in his relationship with George W., as his father, that is entitled to constitutional protection is best guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s plurality decision in <em>Michael, H. v. Gerald D., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>supra, </em>in which the Court assumed, without deciding, that a child \u201chas a liberty interest, symmetrical with that of her parent, in maintaining her filial relationship.\u201d 491 U.S. at 130, 109 S.Ct. 2333. In that case, Carole D. gave birth to a daughter, Victoria, by Michael H., who was not her husband. When Victoria was conceived and born, Carole was married to Gerald D. Carole listed Gerald as Victoria\u2019s father on her birth certificate and Gerald thought that he was Victoria\u2019s father. Soon after Victoria was born, Gerald and Carole separated and Gerald moved to another state. Carole, Michael, and Victoria then underwent blood tests that confirmed that Michael was Victoria\u2019s biological father. Carole and Victoria took up residence with Michael, who held the child out as his own. Carole later left that arrangement, and she and Victoria moved in with a third man. Subsequently, Carole and Victoria resumed living with Michael for an eight month period, during which he again held Victoria out as his own. Eventually, Carole reconciled with Gerald, with whom she later had two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">When Carole rebuffed Michael\u2019s attempts to visit Victoria, he brought an action in California state court to establish his paternity and right to visitation. Through a guardian ad litem, Victoria joined in Michael\u2019s request. Gerald intervened in the action and moved for summary judgment, citing the California statute that provides that a child born to a married man who is not impotent or sterile and who is cohabiting with his wife is conclusively presumed to be the child of the marriage. Gerald argued that under that statute, Michael could not prevail, regardless of whether he could prove that he was Victoria\u2019s natural father. The court agreed, and entered judgment in Gerald\u2019s favor. On appeal, Michael and Victoria asserted that the California paternity statute violated their substantive and procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">After the California appellate courts affirmed the statute\u2019s constitutionality, the United States Supreme Court issued a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>Michael argued that the paternity statute was unconstitutional because the requirements of procedural due process prevented the State from terminating his liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>interest in his relationship with Victoria without affording him the opportunity to present proof of his paternity in an evidentiary hearing. 491 U.S. at 119, 109 S.Ct. 2333. In so asserting, he relied upon Supreme Court cases that he read as holding that a liberty interest in the parent-child relationship is created by \u201cbiological fatherhood plus an established parental relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 109 S.Ct. 2333. <em>See Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983) (holding that biological father has constitutionally protected interest in opportunity to develop a relationship with offspring; if he fails to act on that opportunity, he is not denied due process of law by state adoption statute that did not afford him notice); <em>Quilloin v. Walcott, </em>434 U.S. 246, 98 S.Ct. 549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978) (holding that adoption of child by new husband of child\u2019s mother did not violate due process rights of father who had not sought visitation or to legitimate child until adoption proceeding was commenced); <em>Caban v. Mohammed, </em>441 U.S. 380, 99 S.Ct. 1760, 60 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979) (holding that unwed father who had lived with mother and children for several years had a constitutionally protected liberty interest in relationship with children that could be overcome in adoption proceeding only by showing that State had an equally important interest); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">A plurality of the Court rejected Michael\u2019s argument. It reasoned that even though Michael\u2019s bond to Victoria not only was biological but also was established by a pattern of parental conduct, those factors were not sufficient to create a liberty interest unless the relationship was one that \u201chas been treated as a protected family unit under the historic practices of our society,\u201d or on some other established basis. 491 U.S. at 124, 109 S.Ct. 2333.

It concluded, moreover, that Victoria\u2019s claim to due process protection was \u201cat best ... the obverse of [her biological father\u2019s claim] and fails for the same reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 109 S.Ct. 2333.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">As Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Michael D. </em>makes plain, even though \u201c[t]he Constitution protects the sanctity of the family ... because the institution of family is so deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d <em>Moore v. City of East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 503, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (plurality opinion), whether there exists a protected liberty interest in the parent-child or child-parent bond that the State may not sever without procedural due process is not merely a function of biological or psychological ties, and cannot be ascertained out of context. In addition, \u201c[t]he unique role in our society of the family, the institution by which we inculcate and pass down many of our most cherished values ... requires that constitutional principles be applied with sensitivity and flexibility to the special needs of parents and children.\u201d <em>Bellotti, supra, </em>443 U.S. at 634, 99 S.Ct. 3035 (internal quotations and citations omitted). We agree, moreover, with Justice Brennan\u2019s observations in <em>Bowen v. Gilliard, </em>483 U.S. 587, 107 S.Ct. 3008, 97 L.Ed.2d 485 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">A fundamental element of family life is the relationship between parent and child____ [The Supreme Court has been] vigilant in ensuring that government does not burden the ability of parent and child to sustain their vital connection. \u2018The rights of the parents are a counterpart of the responsibilities they have assumed.\u2019 When parents make a commitment to meet those responsibilities, the child has a right to rely on the unique contribution of each parent to material and emotional support. <em>The child therefore has a fundamental interest in the continuation of parental care </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>and support, and a right to be free of governmental action that would jeopardize it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 612, 107 S.Ct. 3008 (quoting <em>Lehr v. Robertson, supra, at </em>257, 103 S.Ct. 2985) (other citations omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We hold that, in the circumstances of this case, Justus has a liberty interest in his relationship with his father that cannot be disrupted without affording him some measure of due process. George W. and Justus are related by blood and for the first five years of Justus\u2019s life, they lived in one household in a father-son relationship. The filial bond between Justus and George is not just biological. It developed through a pattern of conduct over a period of years and existed within the framework of a family unit historically recognized by society. The bond endured long enough for Justus to form <em>a </em>relationship with his father that he remembers and to develop an emotional tie that has led him to hold out the hope, whether realistic or not, that George W. will come back and resume the role of father.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The family in which Justus lived with George W., Ingrid, and his siblings is the only family that Justus ever knew. The disintegration of that family was brought about by Ingrid, most certainly, and by George, most likely- \u2014 but not by Justus. Justus\u2019s relationship with his father was developed, like those in <em>Stanley </em>and <em>Caban, </em>not potential, like those in <em>Quilloin </em>and <em>Lehr. </em>Justus had a fundamental interest in the continuation of that developed relationship. To be sure, the relationship did not continue. Although years have passed since its existence, the relationship was developed nonetheless. That obviously continues to have some emotional value to Justus. The \u201cfundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their children does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State.\u201d <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. at 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388. <em>See also Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 </em>U.S. 816, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 (1977) (natural parents of children placed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>foster care maintain liberty interests in their relationships with their children). Likewise, Justus\u2019s developed relationship with his father, with its lasting emotional ramifications, did not evaporate when his father ceased maintaining contact with him. Moreover, unlike the circumstance in <em>Michael D., </em>in which the natural father\u2019s relationship with his daughter was viewed by a plurality of the Supreme Court as historically disfavored and as inconsistent with the continuation of her relationship with the \u201cfather\u201d in the marriage to which she was born, Justus\u2019s relationship to George W. has no effect on any other parental relationship. Indeed, he has no other such relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In this Court, DHHS repeats the argument it made below, and that the juvenile court adopted: that Justus was not entitled to be heard because the guardianship proceeding would terminate George W.\u2019s rights only. In support, DHHS relies upon the fact that, under the guardianship statute, a child is not required to consent to being placed under guardianship. For the reasons we have explained, Justus\u2019s liberty interest in his relationship with his father is implicated in this proceeding. Moreover, DHHS\u2019s argument is not persuasive in any event because the issue here is not whether Justus has a veto right over any guardianship \u2014 which he does not \u2014 but whether he has the right to minimal procedural safeguards in a proceeding that may have the ultimate effect of terminating his bond to his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">DHHS also cites and relies upon <em>In re Adoption No. 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681, to support its position that Justus does not have a liberty interest at stake in the guardianship proceeding. That case also has no bearing upon our inquiry. There, the Court of Appeals approved and upheld the \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision of F.L. \u00a7 5-322(d) which, as the Court explained, is not triggered until the parent has been given notice of the measures that he or she is required to take to protect his or her parental rights. 344 Md. at 494, 687 A.2d 681. The Court focused its inquiry on whether the statutory scheme comported with due process with respect to the protection of parental rights. It held that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>in the ordinary case, \u201cthe parent is given fair and adequate notice of what is required [for the parent to object to the termination of his or her parental rights] and a fair and adequate opportunity to file a timely notice of objection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we have explained, the filing of a notice of objection by a natural parent entitles the parent to a hearing before the court may terminate parental rights. The Court in <em>In re Adoption No. 93321055 </em>did not address the constitutional adequacy of the statutory scheme with respect to the termination by the State of the child\u2019s liberty interest in the parent-child relationship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u201cOnce it is determined that due process applies, the question remains what process is due.\u201d <em>Morrissey v.

Likewise, Justus\u2019s liberty interest in his relationship with his father is basic, significant, and vital; and it is no less so than his father\u2019s interest in the relationship. Indeed, consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s assumption in <em>Michael D., </em>a child\u2019s liberty interest in maintaining his filial relationship with his parent is \u201csymmetrical with that of h[is] parent.\u201d 491 U.S. at 130, 109 S.Ct. 2333. Furthermore, the guardianship, if granted, would work the ultimate infringement on Justus\u2019s liberty interest in his relationship with his father, by ending it. <em>Santosky, supra, </em>455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The countervailing governmental interest flows from the State\u2019s duty, as <em>parens patriae, </em>to step into the shoes of the parent when he or she is unable or unwilling to fulfill his obligations to the child. To be sure, the State has a paramount concern with the swift and suitable placement of children whose parents are no longer providing for their most basic needs. \u201cOnce it appears that reunification with their parents is not possible or in their best interest, the government has not only a special interest but an urgent duty, to obtain a nurturing and permanent placement for them, so they do not continue to drift alone and unattached.\u201d <em>In re Adoption No. 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. at 492, 687 A.2d 681. Yet, the governmental interest in securing a permanent placement for a child is less compelling when the child has reached the age at which he exercises some control over the placement that may be made. No amount of expediency on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>DHHS will bring about Justus\u2019s adoption \u2014 the most permanent of placements \u2014 unless Justus consents to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We shift our focus then to the risk of error in the process, the likely value, if any, of additional or substitute safeguards, and the burdens that those safeguards might entail. The termination of a child\u2019s parental rights necessarily terminates any liberty interest that the child has in his relationship with his parents. As we explained in Part I, when the State seeks to terminate parental rights through a guardianship (as opposed to by adoption), the court is required to conduct a hearing and to make findings, including a \u201cbest interest\u201d determination, only if one of the natural parents objects; otherwise, the court has discretion to hold a hearing. F.L. \u00a7 5-317(c). The child\u2019s statutory entitlement to a hearing is thus tied to his parents\u2019 decision(s) to challenge the State\u2019s petition. Even when the child\u2019s protected liberty interest in his relationship with one or both of his natural parents is at stake in the proceeding, he has no independent channel by which to be heard. It is likely that information from the child that could have a bearing on whether the termination of the parents\u2019 rights (and hence the child\u2019s rights) will be in his best interest will not be presented to the juvenile court, absent a refusal to consent by at least one parent. In our view, such a procedure \u2014 which, in effect, permits an irrebuttable presumption that the termination of parental rights and the filial relationship is in the child\u2019s best interest in all cases in which the natural parents have consented by act or by operation of law \u2014 poses a risk of error that is not insignificant. Furthermore, in this case, as in the overwhelming number of guardianship cases in which the child has previously been adjudicated CINA, the burden that would flow from the additional safeguard of requiring an evidentiary hearing when the child\u2019s liberty interest is at stake is minimal. The guardianship statute already provides that notice of the filing of the petition must be given to the attorney for the child in the CINA proceeding. Moreover, as is plain from the established practice of the juvenile court in the case <em>subjudice, </em>it is not unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>burdensome to allow for the appointment of counsel for children who are the subjects of guardianship proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">For these reasons, we hold that, in the circumstances of this case, due process requires that Justus be given the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way, that is, by presentation of evidence on the question whether the termination of his parent-child relationship with George W. is in his best interest. At age twelve, Justus is old enough to understand the nature of the guardianship proceeding and its effect on him, to have formed considered views about it, and to express those views. In so holding, we point out that in cases in which the government has acted to deprive children of their liberty or property interests, the Supreme Court has held that because children are \u201cpeculiar[ly] vulnerablej,\u201d the process to which they are due need not mirror that which would be afforded an adult. <em>Bellotti, supra, </em>443 U.S. at 634, 99 S.Ct. 3035. As the Supreme Court concluded in <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), hearings for children need not \u201cconform with all of the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative hearing ... [,nevertheless they] must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 87 S.Ct. 1428.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The juvenile court erred in concluding that only George W.\u2019s parental rights were at stake in the guardianship proceeding. Justus\u2019s liberty interest in his relationship with his father was also at stake and, for that reason, he constitutionally was entitled to an opportunity to be heard on the question whether the guardianship would be in his best interest, even though he was not entitled to consent to it. The court erred in denying Justus the process to which he was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ORDER VACATED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-13\">.

The Supreme Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause to include a substantive component that protects some liberty interests from State interference no matter what process is given, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling State interest. <em>See Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 301-02, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). Justus K. does not argue that his interest in the termination of his father's parental rights is entitled to the substantive protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Due Process Clause. Rather, he argues that he was entitled to procedural due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\">. Justus also contends that the guardianship proceeding was constitutionally inadequate because it deprived him of property interests without due process of law. Specifically, he argues that the petition for guardianship cut off his right to inherit from his father, as well as his right to support from his father. See Md.Code. (1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-103 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article; and F.L. \u00a7 5-203(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">DHHS concedes that the termination of George W.\u2019s parental righls had the effect of eliminating Justus's inchoate right to inherit a portion of his father\u2019s estate. It responds, however, that Justus waived that argument by not proffering to the court whether any such estate exists. DHHS responds to Justus's second contention, that the granting of the petition permanently deprived him of liis right to demand support from his father without due process, by asserting that in effect, he has lost nothing because he can look to DHHS for his support.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Because we have determined that Justus has a liberty interest in his relationship with his father that the State cannot terminated by the State without affording him procedural safeguards that comport with due process of law, we find it unnecessary to reach the question whether the guardianship proceeding implicated Justus's property interests. For the purpose of determining the process to which Justus is due, we must focus on his liberty interest, which is paramount; and the process due to protect that interest will serve to protect any property interest as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">.
