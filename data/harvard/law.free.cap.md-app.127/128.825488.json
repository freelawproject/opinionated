Wankel, appellant, and her fianc\u00e9, Daniel I. Wilcox, appellant, were sleeping in the upstairs bedroom of Wankel\u2019s home, located at 110 Beckwith Street, when they were awakened by an explosion. Wilcox ran to the landing on the second floor and discovered that the first floor of the house was engulfed in flames. The couple soon realized that the only means of escape was through the bedroom window. Wankel and Wilcox were injured when they jumped from the second story to the frozen ground below. As they watched from a neighbor\u2019s porch, their house burned to the ground. The explosion also damaged the home of Wankel\u2019s neighbors, Karen and George Gouzoulis. Ms. Gouzoulis, appellant, was injured by the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As a result of the explosion, Wankel\u2019s insurer, State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. (\u201cState Farm\u201d), appellant, paid Wankel $253,264.08 under Wankel\u2019s homeowner policy for the damage to her residence. In addition, State Farm paid $163,950.00 to Wankel for personal property losses, and $25,943.71 in \u201cadditional living expenses.\u201d Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co. (\u201cNationwide\u201d), appellant, the Gouzoulis\u2019s insurer, paid $11,699.65 for repairs to the Gouzoulis\u2019s dwelling, located at 102 Kent Oaks Way.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">On January 16, 1997, Wankel, Wilcox, Ms. Gouzoulis, State Farm, and Nationwide filed a five-count complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against various defendants who were involved in the construction of the Wankel home. Specifically, appellants sued the following entities: D.R. Horton, Inc. (\u201cHorton\u201d), appellee and cross-appellant, the general contractor of the Wankel home; Great Seneca Development Corporation (\u201cGreat Seneca\u201d), cross-appellee, the developer of the Kentlands Community; Wright Excavating, Inc. (\u201cWright\u201d), cross-appellee, a subcontractor that performed excavation and grading work on the property for Horton; A &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>B Contractors, Inc. (\u201cA <em>&amp; </em>B\u201d), appellee and cross-appellee, a subcontractor that repaired the silt fence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> around the property for Horton; Redland Genstar, Inc. (\u201cGenstar\u201d), crossappellee, a subcontractor that paved an alleyway near the Wankel home for Great Seneca and paved a driveway for Horton; and Triangle Landscapers, Inc. (\u201cTriangle\u201d). In their suit, appellants claimed that a wooden stake used for the silt fence was driven into the ground during the construction process, puncturing a natural gas pipeline. According to appellants, gas then leaked from the pipeline, made its way into the house, and exploded when it came in contact with an unknown heat source.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In March and April of 1997, the defendants lodged a flurry of cross-claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Of particular importance to this appeal, Horton filed cross-claims against Wright, A &amp; B, Great Seneca, Genstar, and Triangle, seeking recovery on theories of indemnity and contribution. Thereafter, Horton impleaded Keith Dodson,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> individually and doing business as Ravenwood Associates (\u201cRavenwood\u201d), in connection with the installation of the silt fence on the Wankel property. Dodson answered Horton\u2019s third party complaint on October 10, 1997. Appellants explain that by the time they realized Dodson was the original installer of the silt fence, they could not amend their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>complaint to add him as a defendant, because the statute of limitations had expired as to Dodson. Nevertheless, they contend that Horton is responsible for Dodson\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">By July 1997, Triangle was dismissed from the case, after it filed a motion for summary judgment that was not opposed. Triangle had claimed that its work on the Wankel property was limited to planting shrubs and mulching a flower bed in the front yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The court limited the first phase of discovery to the issue of liability, with a completion date of January 80, 1998. In a Second Amended Scheduling Order entered on January 5, 1998, the court also ordered that \u201cLiability Motions, except for Defendant, Ravenwood, shall be filed by Jan. 30, 1998.\u201d Thereafter, on January 28, 1998, appellants moved to voluntarily dismiss Great Seneca, Wright, and Genstar, which Horton opposed. Defendants Great Seneca, Wright, Genstar, Horton, and A &amp; B subsequently filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In an order dated March 25, 1998, the circuit court granted appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The court also granted summary judgment in favor of Horton and A <em>&amp; </em>B, concluding that appellants failed to prove that either party proximately caused the explosion. It also granted summary judgment in favor of Great Seneca, Wright, and Genstar with regard to the cross-claims of Horton and A <em>&amp; </em>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">On appeal, appellants present a single issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">Did the plaintiffs present sufficient evidence to create a question of fact as to whether Horton and/or A &amp; B\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of their injuries and damages?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Horton noted a cross-appeal, challenging the court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment, because appellants failed to present expert testimony as to the standard of care of a contractor. Horton also complains about the dismissal of its cross-claims, and seeks to \u201cpreserve a right to revive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>cross-claims if necessary after resolution of this appeal.\u201d It presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">Did the lower court correctly rule that Plaintiffs presented legally sufficient evidence (including expert testimony) to permit a jury to conclude that Defendant Horton breached a duty of care owed to Plaintiffs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In reply to Horton\u2019s cross-appeal, Wright, Great Seneca, Genstar, and appellants (as cross-appellees) filed separate briefs raising various issues of their own. We have set forth below the issues raised by each cross-appellee:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Cross-Appellee Wright:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">I. Since there was no evidence from which a trier of fact could reasonably infer that Wright excavating was responsible for driving \u201cthe stake\u201d down into the ground, was the trial court\u2019s decision to grant Wright Excavating\u2019s motion for summary judgment on D.R. Horton\u2019s cross-claims legally correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">II. Was the trial court\u2019s decision to grant Wright Excavating\u2019s motion for summary judgment on D.R. Horton\u2019s cross-claim for indemnification legally correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">III. Was the trial court\u2019s decision to grant Wright Exeavating\u2019s motion for summary judgment on D.R. Horton\u2019s cross-claim for contribution legally correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Cross-Appellee Great Seneca:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">I. Whether the appeal of the court\u2019s ruling on Horton\u2019s cross-claim against Great Seneca is properly before this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">II. Whether the court ruled that Horton\u2019s cross-claim against Great Seneca is moot as a result of its granting summary judgment to Horton on plaintiffs claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Cross-Appellee Genstar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-14\">Did the lower court properly enter summary judgment in favor of Redland Genstar, Inc.?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Cross-Appellees Wankel, Wilcox, Gouzoulis, State Farm, and Nationwide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">I. Did the trial court correctly conclude that the Plaintiffs had produced evidence concerning Horton\u2019s duty and its breach of that duty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">II. Did the trial court correctly conclude that the Plaintiffs\u2019 standard of care expert was qualified to express the opinions elicited from him?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In addition, Great Seneca, Genstar, and Wright have moved to dismiss Horton\u2019s cross-appeal. Great Seneca and Genstar contend that the court granted summary judgment as to Horton\u2019s cross-claims on substantive grounds, not merely because Horton\u2019s cross-claims became \u201cmoot\u201d when the court granted judgment in Horton\u2019s favor with regard to appellants\u2019 claims. Citing Md. Rule 8-602(a)(7), which permits dismissal of an appeal when a party fails to submit a timely brief, they urge dismissal of Horton\u2019s cross-appeal, for failure to address the substantive grounds on which the court resolved the cross-claims. For its part, Wright seeks dismissal of Horton\u2019s cross-appeal, pursuant to Rule 8-504(a)(5), because Horton failed to address the substance of the court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment as to Wright. On January 22, 1999, less than two weeks before oral argument, Horton filed a Motion for Leave to Supplement Brief. Great Seneca, Wright, and Gens-tar all oppose Horton\u2019s motion to supplement. That motion is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">For the reasons that follow, w\u00e9 shall affirm. To be sure, the occurrence was extremely unfortunate. But, a plaintiff cannot recover based on sympathy. We agree with the trial court that appellants failed to show that any of the defendants proximately caused appellants\u2019 injuries. It follows that we need not consider the issues relating to Horton\u2019s cross-appeal or Horton\u2019s motion to supplement its original brief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Our factual recitation derives from the pleadings and the evidence produced in connection with the motions filed by appellees and cross-appellees. To the extent there is any factual dispute, we have cast the facts in the light most favorable to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In March 1992, Wankel entered into a contract with Horton to purchase a \u201cBetsy Ross\u201d model home, to be constructed on Lot 27A of the \u201cKentlands\u201d development in Gaithersburg. It is unclear, based on the record, whether Horton acquired the lot from Joseph Afandre, the original developer of the Kent-lands, or from Great Seneca.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any event, on June 23, 1992, Horton applied, as the general contractor, for a building permit to construct the Wankel house.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Wankel\u2019s house faces Beckwith Street; the garage is located on the southeastern corner of her property. Lot 27A is rectangular in shape, 99 feet long and 46 feet wide, and is situated so that its narrower, northern end faces Beckwith Street. A paved common-use alley runs along the 99 foot southern edge of the lot, and then turns along the rear edge of the property, providing access to the garages of homes on Beckwith Street. Redland Genstar, a subcontractor for Great Seneca, paved the alley in October 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In July 1992, Horton hired Wright to excavate and backfill the foundation of the Wankel house and garage. In its answers to appellants\u2019 interrogatories, Wright averred that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>spent two days in July 1992 working on Lot 27A; Wright spent one day \u201cdigging the foundation and stockpiling dirt on an adjacent lot with a 958 Front End Loader ....\u201d, and another day placing dirt around the foundation of the house, using the Front End Loader to \u201crough grade the yard.... \u201d Invoices submitted to the court by appellants indicate that Wright\u2019s initial work was completed on July 8, 1992, and the backfill operations were completed on July 26, 1992. Wright claimed that it returned to Lot 27A on November 19, 1992, in order to \u201cfinal grade the yard for seeders.\u201d Then, on November 24, 1992, Wright loaded excess dirt from lots 27 and 28 onto trucks that were parked on Beckwith Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On July 14, 1992, during the course of Wright\u2019s work, Horton\u2019s site superintendent, John Buffet, contacted \u201cMiss Utility\u201d to advise that it intended to excavate Lot 27A. He made the report pursuant to the \u201cunderground facilities\u201d provision of the Maryland Code. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Art. 78, \u00a7 28A. A computer printout memorializing Buffet\u2019s call indicates that he gave notice that Horton intended to build a garage on the southeastern corner of the lot.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Invoices submitted by appellants indicated that Dodson installed 320 feet of silt fence on Lot 27A on August 3, 1992, and an additional 50 feet of silt fence on September 15, 1992. The invoices do not specify where within Lot 27A the fencing was installed. At his deposition, Dodson testified that Buffet, Horton\u2019s site manager, instructed him to install the fence along the edge of the asphalt alleyway on the long side of the lot, in order to prevent soil erosion into the alleyway. At the time, the area was marked by yellow flags indicating an underground gas line. Dodson testified that while he did not know how deep the gas lines were located in this particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>area, gas lines, in his experience, are generally buried three feet underground. The following portion of Dodson\u2019s deposition testimony, which was submitted to the court by the appellants, is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: I may have asked you this: Mr. Buffett told you where to put the silt fence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7U\">DODSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: Did he tell you to put it up against the alley, the paved alley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">DODSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: Okay. And you were aware at the time that you were putting it over ostensibly what was the gas line; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">COUNSEL FOR DODSON: Objection. I\u2019m \u2014 I think that\u2019s kind of a trick question, because \u2014 wait a minute. You\u2019re indicating that he\u2019s ostensibly putting it over the gas line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">Why don\u2019t you ask him how far the gas \u2014 the gas line was from the edge of the asphalt, at least as far as the markings indicated to him? Because you\u2019re having him put it over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: Did you know exactly where the gas line was located when you put that silt fence up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">COUNSEL FOR DODSON: Go ahead. You can answer. DODSON: Okay. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: Where was it located? DODSON: On the ground right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: Right there next to the alleyway, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">DODSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: Did you know generally where [the gas line] was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-16\">DODSON: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: \u2014beneath the ground? Where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">DODSON: Where the little yellow marks were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: All right. And did you know generally how deep it was in the ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">DODSON: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: How deep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">DODSON: Approximately three feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLANTS: How do you know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVW\">DODSON: Because I\u2019ve been doing it for 15 years and I\u2019ve seen a million of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Dodson further testified at his deposition that the silt fence stakes that he used measured 1\u201d x 2\u201d x 42\u201d. Later, Dodson averred, in an affidavit, that he \u201cmay have also installed silt fence across the rear of Lot 27A.\u201d Several other witnesses, including Wankel, corroborated that the silt fence encompassed the rear portion of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">On October 23, 1992, Horton hired A &amp; B to perform repairs to the silt fence that Dodson had previously installed. Tom Atkins and Burt Leffingwell, employees of A &amp; B, worked on the repairs for Lot 27A. At his deposition, Atkins testified that A &amp; B used stakes measuring 2\u201d x 2\u201d x 42\u201d. He also said that silt fence stakes generally come already stapled to the silt fencing with one and one-half inch staples. Further, he estimated that when a silt fence stake is driven into the ground, it reaches a depth of approximately ten inches. Ordinarily, A <em>&amp; </em>B\u2019s stakes are made of a hard wood, such as oak, but the wood type varies depending on what is available on the market. Atkins also stated that, as far as he knew, A &amp; B was not required to contact \u201cMiss Utility\u201d before installing silt fencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Atkins testified that, on occasion, A &amp; B is retained to repair a \u201cblowout\u201d of silt fencing. Atkins explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">If the silt fence is, say, blown out \u2014 what I mean by blown out is, there\u2019s been heavy runoff, and the silt fence itself is bellied, sometimes I have to get in there and dig out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>area, throw it back, disperse it so the silt fence is not weakened, and maybe go in and put a stake there, and drive the stake down and then staple the stuff back up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">Then other times the silt fence may be torn. Say two pieces are torn, torn apart and laying there, then we may have to put in a stake there, put the two together, and staple it back up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Leffingwell recalled that A <em>&amp; </em>B performed a repair of a \u201cblowout\u201d in the rear left corner of Lot 27A. Leffingwell testified that the portion of the fence he repaired was \u201cright along the edge of the asphalt\u201d of the paved alleyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On a date not entirely clear from the record, Horton arranged for removal of the silt fencing. Robert Richter, Horton\u2019s corporate designee, could not recall whether the fencing was removed before or after Wankel moved into the house, nor could he remember who performed the removal. Richter testified that Horton would have utilized a \u201clabor service\u201d for the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Wankel moved into her home on November 30, 1992. More than thirteen months later, on January 21,1994, the house was destroyed by the explosion and fire that we previously described. At the time of the accident, the temperature was quite cold and the ground was frozen.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">After the explosion, representatives of the Montgomery County Fire Marshal\u2019s office, Washington Gas Company, and an investigator from the Maryland Public Service Commission\u2019s Gas Pipeline Safety Program, responded to the scene. Public Service Commission investigators took \u201cbar hole readings\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the property, which indicated that natural gas had permeated the ground around the house. Representatives of Washington Gas conducted \u201cpressure tests\u201d of the gas lines that serviced 110 and 114 Beckwith Street. The pressure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tests indicated a leak from a two inch plastic distribution line under the rear alley. When the area around the suspected leak was excavated, the workers discovered a 3/4\u201d hole in the top of the pipe, which was buried at a depth of 39\u201d below the surface. They also discovered a wooden stake in the ground at a depth of 34 inches, which measured 2\u201d x 2\u201d x 38\u201d. The stake was located just outside the boundary of Wankel\u2019s property, next to the paved alleyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">A \u201cGas Pipeline Failure Investigation\u201d report prepared by the Public Service Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">3/4\u201d hole in top of pipe made by 1.5\u201d by 1.5\u201d sharpened wooden stake. Pipe depth 39\u201d. Stake was measured at a depth of 34\u201d during excavation, but had already been disturbed by backhoe and subjected to air pressure in pipe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">The report drew the following conclusion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">Freezing of the ground probably moved the stake upward away from the gas pipeline allowing natural gas to escape from the pipe. The ground temperature was 32 F at the installed pipe depth of 39\u201d. The gas migrated under the garage slab and porch slab into the house and was ignited by an unknown source.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">At his deposition, William Hinde, a corporate designee of the Washington Gas Light Company, described the process by which the stake was unearthed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: Why don\u2019t you just tell me, if you can, how the gas company excavated the stake that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">HINDE: Once we had determined the most probable location of \u2014 of the leak, we excavated \u2014 we took the very first four to six inches up with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: Four to six inches of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">HINDE: Soil, dirt, ice, gravel, earth materials, up with a backhoe. And then the remainder of the excavating was done by hand with using \u2014 by hand \u2014 using pneumatic air tools, because the ground was so hard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>COUNSEL FOR HORTON: When you removed the first four to six inches of earth material with the backhoe, was the stake visible at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">HINDE: No, it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: So the stake was completely underground; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">HINDE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: Do you recall at what point the top of the stake became visible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">HINDE: We had excavated down approximately a foot and a half or so. And what you do is you start with a small hole and you work your way out using both air tools and a manual tunneling bar. And as they were knocking the bank down, the stake became visible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">In excavating we took the first four to six inches up. We expanded the hole. And in expanding the hole we moved over into ground that had not been previously disturbed with the backhoe and knocked \u2014 sheared that wall off. It\u2019s a common excavating practice. And in shearing that wall down is when we came upon the stake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: Okay. So the earth material you removed with the backhoe was not over top of the location where you found the stake?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">HINDE: It was not directly over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: All right. I\u2019m with you. So, actually, the stake was uncovered by the use of digging bars and shovels when you were taking down the wall of the hole you were trying to create?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\">HINDE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: And I assume that you eventually hand dug all the way down until you got to the depth of the gas line; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>HINDE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: Were you literally standing over the hole when the gas line was unearthed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">HINDE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: Did you observe the stake actually sticking in the gas line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">HINDE: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">COUNSEL FOR HORTON: Did anybody present at the scene tell you that the stake was actually sticking in the gas line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">HINDE: No, they did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">When asked if he knew of any similar incidents in which a stake has been driven into a plastic gas line, Hinde responded: \u201cIt has \u2014 it has happened before.\u201d But, Hinde was unable to specify when or how often he had observed the phenomenon.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">In its report, the Montgomery County Fire Marshal\u2019s office concluded that \u201cthe fire was on the first floor, based on the interviews of neighbors and the observation of the writer on his arrival.... \u201d Further, the report indicated that \u201cthe cause was a natural gas leak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">Walter Rothfuss, of Rothfuss Engineering Co., investigated the accident on behalf of Washington Gas. In a report completed on April 21, 1994, Rothfuss concluded that the gas leak was caused by \u201cthe penetration of a line by a wooden stake most probably used as a <em>grade </em>stake.\u201d (Emphasis added). Rothfuss wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">Weather conditions on the day of the incident, and for some days prior to the fire were extreme. Single digit temperatures were common. There was an ice cover over the area. It was noted that the temperature of the soil at the depth of the distribution line was at freezing (32 degrees F). This condition would affect the flow of gas leaking from the distribution line. Under less frigid conditions the gas would naturally rise, find its way through the soil, and be dispersed in the atmosphere. When the moisture in the ground has frozen and the ground has an ice covering, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>gas is prevented from percolating up through the soil and seeks the path of least resistance through the soil. It is quite possible that this path was along the electric, telephone or CATV lines which lead from the area where the stake was discovered toward the SW elevation. From this point the gas could have entered the foundation of the structure by seepage through the foundation wall, or entering through the foundation drainage system into the basement sump. From this point it would migrate through the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">Ignition of the migrating gas could be accomplished by any of the various naturally occurring sources of ignition found in the home. Any electrical arc from contacts on motors, or standing pilots on gas appliances, or even furnace thermostats would suffice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">It was discovered that the gas distribution line under the alley at the rear of the structure had been penetrated by a wooden stake. <em>The length of this stake and the attached piece of black plastic material indicates that this stake was at one time used for silt fencing. </em>It was also reported by Dr. Millman that a silt fence was indeed placed in the alley. This was the only leak site found for natural gas in this area, which was verified by pressure testing after the leak was repaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">The Montgomery County Soil Conservation Department states that the erosion control (silt) fencing is required to be 2 feet wide on a 36 inch stake. It further requires that 4 inches of the fencing fabric should be placed below grade, which results in a 16 inch penetration of the surface by the stake. <em>Since there was approximately 27.5 inches of soil covering the distribution line under the asphalt and gravel sub-base it is improbable that this leak was the result of the placement of the silt fence unless there had been a substantial fill placed prior to the final grading or the stake had been driven deeper underground my some other means.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Rothfuss was later named an expert for the appellants. During his deposition, Rothfuss testified \u201cat one time,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u201coffending stake\u201d found at the scene was a silt fence stake, because it had a \u201csmall fragment of silt fence fabric still attached by a staple\u201d. Indeed, a photograph attached by appellants to their opposition to Horton and A <em>&amp; </em>B\u2019s motion for summary judgment depicts strands of fabric affixed to the wooden stake recovered from the scene. Rothfuss theorized, however, that the stake may have been utilized as a grade stake sometime after its use as a silt fence stake. When asked if he would state an opinion at trial as to whether the stake was used as a silt fence stake immediately prior to perforating the gas line, Rothfuss responded that he would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Rothfuss conceded that, despite the conclusion stated in his written report, he could not opine as to how the stake penetrated thirty-nine inches below the surface. The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: [A]re you going to opine in this case that [the stake] was serving as a silt fence stake immediately prior to perforating the gas line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">ROTHFUSS: No, because it apparently had not. There was only a small fragment of silt fence fabric still attached by a staple to the stake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: Do you have an opinion, sir, as to the likelihood that the stake identified on page ten of your report was or was not serving as a silt fence stake immediately prior to it perforating the line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">ROTHFUSS: That, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: And you\u2019ll state no opinion at trial on that subject?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">ROTHFUSS: That\u2019s correct, I will not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: <em>And you have no idea how [the stake] got down to the 39 inches below grade where it was found on the day after the fire?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">ROTHFUSS: <em>I agree.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: <em>And you\u2019ll state no opinion one way or the other in that regard at trial?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">ROTHFUSS: <em>That is not my intent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: <em>In other words, you will not?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A19\">ROTHFUSS: <em>I will not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: During the course of your developing your opinions in this case, were you asked to consider anything in regard to relative probabilities between, say, the stake being driven into the ground by some kind of piece of equipment or being excavated to the gas line and left in the ground in some backfill scenario? Were you asked to consider either of those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">ROTHFUSS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: <em>Were you asked to consider anything in regard to how that stake got in close proximity and perforated that gas line?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">ROTHFUSS: <em>That\u2019s something everybody would like to know, but no, I haven\u2019t been asked to do that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: In fact, that\u2019s something you were asked to determine by the gas company and were unable to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOq\">ROTHFUSS: We followed a convoluted paper trail as far as we could. We were burning up a lot of money. We told our client that this was getting nowhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: <em>And your conclusion was, at the end of that process, that it was indeterminate?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">ROTHFUSS: <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">On January 28, 1998, two days before the close of discovery and liability motions, appellants sought leave to voluntarily dismiss Genstar, Great Seneca, and Wright, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-506(b). Horton opposed the dismissal, however.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>motion to dismiss was still pending before the court when, on January 30, 1998, Horton and A &amp; B filed motions for summary judgment, each seeking judgment as a matter of law as to appellants\u2019 claims and the co-defendants\u2019 cross-claims. On the same day, Great Seneca filed a motion for summary judgment against Horton and A &amp; B. It argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was not liable to Horton or A <em>&amp; </em>B for contribution or indemnification, because, as evidenced by appellants\u2019 own motion to dismiss, appellants could not prove a <em>prima facie </em>case against Great Seneca. Furthermore, Great Seneca argued that it had no liability for any negligence of Horton or A <em>&amp; </em>B, because both were independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Genstar and Wright also moved for summary judgment. Wright argued that although it had excavated the foundation of the house and graded the yard, Wright \u201cwas never involved with the installation or removal of a silt fence\u201d on the lot. Wright also sought summary judgment as to Horton\u2019s cross-claims for indemnification and contribution, asserting that Horton had failed to furnish a contract entitling it to indemnification, and that no evidence of negligence could be attributed to Wright\u2019s conduct. Similarly, Genstar moved for summary judgment as to Horton\u2019s cross-claim, asserting that appellants were unable to show \u201cwho caused the stake to puncture the gas line, or when.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">On February 12, 1998, appellants filed their opposition to Horton and A &amp; B\u2019s motions for summary judgment. With regard to A &amp; B\u2019s motion, appellants argued that a jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>conclude, based on Atkins\u2019s deposition testimony, that the \u201coffending stake\u201d found near the puncture was left there by A &amp; B. Appellants pointed to a portion of Atkins deposition in which he looked at a photograph of the stake found at the scene and opined that it was a silt fence stake, not a grading stake. Appellants also claimed that A <em>&amp; </em>B had an affirmative duty to call \u201cMiss Utility\u201d before repairing the silt fence. Moreover, they contended that whether the explosion was foreseeable was a question for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">With regard to Horton\u2019s motion, appellants contended that there was credible evidence that Horton or its subcontractor negligently placed the silt fence over the underground gas line. Appellants also asserted that expert testimony was not needed to establish Horton\u2019s negligence. In any event, they claimed that the testimony of Salvatore J. Ficarro, their \u201cstandard of care\u201d expert, was sufficient. Moreover, appellants argued that it was for the jury to decide whether the actual cause of the perforation of the gas line was a \u201csuperseding intervening cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Ficarro, a \u201cConstruction/Civil Structural Consultant,\u201d was employed by Rothfuss Engineering Company. He testified that, based on forty years of experience in the construction trade, Horton was negligent in installing a silt fence directly over a gas line. The following portion of Fiearro\u2019s deposition testimony, which was provided to the court by appellants, is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: The second opinion that you have here is that \u2014 I believe you start \u2014 it is negligent to install a silt fence over a natural gas distribution line. And you say that is \u2014 are you saying it\u2019s the duty of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">FICARRO: It\u2019s his [the general contractor\u2019s] responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: So he cannot \u2014 strike that. It\u2019s his duty to supervise and see that that does not occur. Is that your point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">FICARRO: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: And what do you base that duty to supervise on, again, your own personal experience on the jobs you\u2019ve been involved in personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">FICARRO: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: Not on any understanding of what is standard operating procedure amongst the industry at large?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">FICARRO: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: Or within this locality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">FICARRO: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: And that\u2019s the same for both the issue concerning contacting Miss Utility and supervision to assure that silt fences aren\u2019t installed over natural gas lines?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">FICARRO: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: The third opinion here is that in removing it, one must take care to remove all the silt fence stakes. Again, you\u2019re saying I have to supervise \u2014 my client has to supervise that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">FICARRO: It\u2019s his responsibility to see that it\u2019s removed. HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: Okay. And, again, he can\u2019t delegate that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">FICARRO: Oh, he can\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: \u2014 to a subcontractor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-16\">FICARRO: He can delegate it. I\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t delegate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-17\">HORTON\u2019S COUNSEL: But that doesn\u2019t relieve him of\u2014 FICARRO: It doesn\u2019t relieve him of the responsibility. If the county inspector comes out and it\u2019s still there, the county doesn\u2019t care if he told us \u2014 you know, some subcontractor to do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">The circuit court conducted a hearing on February 26, 1998. On March 25,1998, the court issued a thorough, eighteen-page memorandum opinion and order, which was docketed on March 30,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Preliminarily, the court granted appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss Great Seneca, Wright, and Genstar. It noted, however, that \u201cthe granting of [that] motion does not completely dismiss [those] parties from the case because of the cross-claims against them ...\u201d Accordingly, the court considered the defendants\u2019 various motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">With regard to Great Seneca\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court noted that only Horton had opposed that motion. Horton argued that the \u201coffending stake\u201d was not found on the Wankel property. Therefore, a trier of fact could find that Great Seneca, but not Horton, was liable. The court ruled, however, that \u201cthe source and location of the stake\u201d were not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the dispute as between Horton and Seneca because, in either case, Great Seneca would not be liable to Horton. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">If a fact-finder concluded that the stake came onto the property after Horton bought the property and was within the province of Horton, Great Seneca is exonerated because the stake could not have come onto the property both before and after- Horton bought the property. However, if a fact-finder concluded that Great Seneca was responsible for the stake, then neither Horton nor Great Seneca would be liable because Plaintiffs have dismissed their claims against Great Seneca and Horton would not be in a posture to seek contribution from Great Seneca.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The court then turned to Wright\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which was opposed only by Horton. The court found \u201cno evidence that Wright had anything to do with the stakes.\u201d Consequently, the court rejected Horton\u2019s argument that it was entitled to indemnification, because \u201c[i]f a jury finds Horton negligent, it cannot be based on Wright\u2019s actions.\u201d Further, it ruled that Horton\u2019s claim for contribution must also fail, because the right to contribution is based on a joint tortfeasor relationship between the defendants, which no longer applied as to Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In addition, the court granted Genstar\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Again, the court rejected Horton\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>that it was entitled to contribution and indemnification from Genstar, because \u201c[a]ll Plaintiffs and Defendants agree that no witness has testified to any negligent act or omission committed by Redland Genstar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The court focused its analysis on Horton\u2019s motion. The court noted that Horton moved for summary judgment on three grounds: 1) that \u201cPlaintiffs must present expert testimony on standard of care and do not have a qualified expert;\u201d 2) that \u201cthere is no factual evidence or evidence from which inferences may be drawn that Horton breached a duty;\u201d 3) and that \u201cif a breach did occur, it was not a proximate cause of the injuries suffered.... \u201d Ultimately, the court disagreed with Horton regarding the first two issues. Nevertheless, because it agreed on the third, it entered summary judgment in favor of Horton.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">As we indicated, Horton complained that appellants failed to present an expert who could testify as to the applicable standard of care for a contractor. Appellants responded that an expert was not necessary, \u201ceither because a contractor is not a professional and his duties should be held to a reasonable person standard, or the negligence is grossly negligent and obvious.\u201d Without expressing an opinion about whether an expert witness was needed in order to establish the standard of care of a general contractor, the court ruled that the credentials of Salvatore Ficarro, appellants\u2019 named expert, were sufficient to qualify him as an expert \u201con the standard of care owed by general contractors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Next, the court determined that, viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving parties, there were genuine issues of material fact that could lead a jury to conclude that Horton, through its subcontractors, breached a duty owed to appellants. The court was satisfied that appellants presented circumstantial evidence that Horton, through Dodson, \u201chad the offending stake installed over the gas line.\u201d Furthermore, the court concluded that Horton and A &amp; B were required to notify \u201cMiss Utility\u201d before making repairs to the silt fence, and opined that a violation of the \u201cMiss Utility\u201d statute \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>provide evidence of negligence.\u201d Therefore, the court found that appellants\u2019 evidence with regard to A &amp; B\u2019s repair of the fence was sufficient to defeat Horton\u2019s motion for judgment as to Horton\u2019s breach of duty. The court also concluded that summary judgment was inappropriate because there was circumstantial evidence that Horton or its agents failed to remove all of the stakes when it removed the silt fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Nevertheless, the court ruled that appellants had failed to show that any of Horton\u2019s acts were the proximate cause of the harm. First, the court evaluated the evidence under the \u201csubstantial factor test.\u201d The court reasoned, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[I]t is undisputed that, regardless of Horton\u2019s conduct, Plaintiffs would have not suffered harm from the existence of the offending stake but for a series of extraordinary events. Assuming that Horton was responsible for installing a stake over the gas line, the following subsequent events occurred to cause the explosion: the offending stake became separated from the silt fence fabric; the stake was not removed; the stake was driven into the ground; the stake, at the same time or some later time, hit the round pipe squarely enough and with enough force to crack the pipe; the stake, either at the same time or at some later time, came back out allowing the gas to leak; the unusual frozen cap developed over the ground stopping the escaping gas from harmlessly percolating through the ground; the gas followed the pipe toward the house; the gas entered the house; and finally, something ignited the gas. If any of these events did not occur in this exact sequence, then Plaintiffs would not have been harmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">While it verges on speculation to say that Horton\u2019s conduct created the series of forces that lead [sic] to the cracking of the pipe, the subsequent events cannot be considered continuous and active. The gas line was not damaged upon installation of the fence. The subsequent events occurred from natural forces of weather and unexplained actions by unknown persons. In addition, there was a large gap in time between Horton\u2019s conduct and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>explosion which occurred more than thirteen (13) months after Horton sold the house to Wankel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Because of the \u201cdiaphanous nexus\u201d between Horton\u2019s negligence and the injury suffered by appellants, the court concluded that Horton\u2019s negligence, even if proved, was not a substantial factor in the ultimate catastrophe.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Alternatively, the court found that the explosion was caused by a series of intervening forces that superseded Horton\u2019s alleged negligence. Thus, even if Horton\u2019s act could be deemed a cause in fact, it concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because the harm was not foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Having found that appellants failed to show proximate cause, the court also granted A &amp; B\u2019s summary judgment motion. The court noted that because it granted Horton\u2019s motion as to liability, Horton\u2019s cross-claims against A &amp; B and Dodson were moot. With regard to Dodson, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALK\">Because the Court is granting Horton\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Horton\u2019s claims against Dodson are moot. However, Dodson did not file a motion. Upon proper motion, the Court dismiss [sic] Dodson as a Third Party Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">On April 8, 1998, Horton and Dodson stipulated to the dismissal, without prejudice, of Horton\u2019s third-party complaint against Dodson. Thereafter, on April 9, 1998, appellants filed a motion for reconsideration, which was subsequently denied. Appellants and Horton then noted their respective appeals and cross-appeal.

Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In order to recover damages in a negligence action, the plaintiff must establish: \u201c \u2018(1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, (2) that the defendant breached that duty; (3) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss, and (4) that the loss or injury proximately resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec.

The trial court granted summary judgment because, in its view, appellants could not establish that the negligence, if any, of Horton or A &amp; B was the proximate cause of appellants\u2019 injuries. The court\u2019s opinion focused on the chain of intervening events that occurred between the defendants\u2019 alleged negligent acts and the explosion, concluding that appellants were unable to establish either cause in fact or legal causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in removing the question of proximate cause from the jury. They assert: \u201cWhile it is true that a number of events had to take place following Horton and A &amp; B\u2019s negligent conduct in order for the explosion to occur, none of them were unforeseeable as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We turn to consider the issue of proximate cause. In doing so, we are mindful that questions of proximate causation are often intractable, in part because proximate cause is a \u201cconcept that possesses a chameleon-like ability to defy precise categorization, and must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Yonce v.

The breach of duty must proximately cause injury to the plaintiff\u2019). Maryland courts have employed two tests to determine whether cause in fact exists: the \u201cbut for\u201d test and the \u201csubstantial factor test.\u201d <em>Yonce, </em>111 Md.App. at 138, 680 A.2d 569. In <em>Yonce, </em>the Court explained the difference between the two concepts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">By its very nature, the \u201cbut for\u201d test applies when the injury would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant\u2019s negligent act. The \u201cbut for\u201d test does not resolve situations in which two independent causes concur to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>bring about an injury, and either cause, standing alone, would have wrought the identical harm. The \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test was created to meet this need but has been used frequently in other situations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Legal cause, on the other hand, asks whether the defendant, in light of \u201cconsiderations of fairness and social policy,\u201d should be held liable for the injury, even when cause in fact has been established. <em>Peterson, </em>258 Md. at 16, 264 A.2d 851. \u201cThus, although an injury might not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 an antecedent act of the defendant, liability may not be imposed if for example the negligence of one person is merely passive and potential, while the negligence of another is the moving and effective cause of the injury, or if the injury is so remote in time and space from defendant\u2019s original negligence that another\u2019s negligence intervenes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The question of legal causation often involves a determination of whether the injury was foreseeable. As we stated in <em>May: </em>\u201cA person will not be relieved of liability for a negligent act if, at the time of that act, the person \u2018should have foreseen the \u201cgeneral field of danger,\u201d not necessarily the specific kind of harm to which the injured party would be subjected as a result of the [person\u2019s] negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>May, </em>122 Md.App. at 384, 712 A.2d 166 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Maryland courts have adopted the view found in \u00a7 435 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1965)(\u201cThe Restatement\u201d) concerning proximate causation. <em>Board of County Commrs. of Garrett County v. Bell Atlantic-Maryland, Inc., </em>346 Md. 160, 184, 695 A.2d 171 (1997); <em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. v. Kenney, </em>323 Md. 116, 129-30, 591 A.2d 507 (1991); <em>Henley v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>305 Md. 320, 334, 503 A.2d 1333 (1986). That section states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Foreseeability of Harm or Manner of Its Occurrence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALq\">(1) If the actor\u2019s conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another, the fact that the actor neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the extent of the harm or the manner in which it occurred does not prevent him from being liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>(2) The actor\u2019s conduct may be held not to be a legal cause of harm to another where after the event and looking back from the harm to the actor\u2019s negligent conduct, it appears to the court highly extraordinary that it should have brought about the harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Here, the trial court applied the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test. Quoting <em>Yonce, </em>it considered three factors in determining whether Horton\u2019s<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about appellants\u2019 injuries. The factors, as articulated in <em>Yonce, </em>are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">(a) the number of other factors which contribute in producing the harm and the extent of the effect which they have in producing it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">(b) whether the actor\u2019s conduct has created a force or series of forces which are in continuous and active operation up to the time of the harm, or has created a situation harmless unless acted upon by other forces for which the actor is not responsible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">(c) lapse of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\"><em>Yonce, </em>111 Md.App. at 138-39, 680 A.2d 569 (in turn quoting Restatement \u00a7 433); <em>see also Bartholomee v.

In the trial court\u2019s view, the installation of a silt fence stake over a gas line could not have caused the explosion unless a series of \u201cextraordinary\u201d events occurred. The stake would have had to become separated from the fence meshing, and then left in the ground. At some later time, it was driven deeper into the ground by some unknown force, in such a way as to puncture, with the sharpened end of the stake, a round plastic pipe. Thereafter, another unknown force would have had to dislodge the stake, allowing gas to leak into the ground. Furthermore, the explosion would not have occurred unless an ice cap had developed in such a way as to prevent the gas from seeping up \u201charmlessly\u201d through the soil. Finally, some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>thing within the house must have ignited the gas, sparking the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The trial court compared the causal nexus in appellants\u2019 case to that in <em>Peterson v. Underwood, </em>258 Md. 9, 264 A.2d 851 (1970). There, a young boy was killed when a five-year old concrete wall collapsed on him. The plaintiff presented evidence that the wall had been built in a defective manner, in violation of local building codes; the wall \u201chad no steel reinforcing rods, no butresses or pilasters, and no subsurface footing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 264 A.2d 851. The evidence also indicated that the wall had been built on a slight angle. Between the time of the wall\u2019s construction and the accident, a subsequent tenant or owner installed a metal rod in the shape of an inverted \u201cU\u201d into the wall, to support a clothesline. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 264 A.2d 851. The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cthe Plaintiffs proof was clearly sufficient to allow the jury to find that [the defendant] negligently constructed ... the wall and that [the boy\u2019s] death was the result of the collapse of that wall.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 264 A.2d 851. Nonetheless, the Court ruled in favor of the defendant, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">What we find to be a fatal defect in ... Underwood\u2019s case is lack of any evidence causally linking defendant\u2019s negligence to the injury suffered. Such a defect is described as a failure to prove that defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">The validity of an inference depends on commonly experienced relationships of acts and forces; thus spatial and temporal distances between one occurrence and another may militate against connecting them by an inference of cause and effect. Plaintiff in our case has proved too little and too much at the same time. On one hand, her expert witness did not give his opinion on what caused the wall to fall, his testimony amounting to no more than that the original construction of the wall was negligent. On the other hand, by negativing likely contributing causes shortly before the wall fell, such as the children pulling on the clothesline, plaintiff left the jury with no data with which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>they could evaluate how \u2018substantial a factor\u2019 the original negligent construction was in causing the later injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-a\"><em>Peterson, </em>258 Md. at 15, 18, 264 A.2d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Court in <em>Peterson </em>also focused on the amount of time that had elapsed between the negligent act and the harm, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">With the limited proof in this case we hold that the glimmering of a causal connection has been extinguished by the passage of time, and direct proof is necessary to re-illumine the relationship. Without other types of direct proof, the testimony of experts most frequently corrects this deficiency. To allow a jury to draw the connection now without direct proof would allow them to indulge in mere conjecture or speculation. It would amount to holding that liability may be predicated upon the mere happening of an accident which, exclusive of <em>res ipsa loquitor </em>situations, is not the law of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\"><em>Peterson, </em>258 Md. at 19, 264 A.2d 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Appellants contend that <em>Peterson </em>is inapposite because, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>\u201cthere is direct evidence that Horton and/or A &amp; B were responsible for the installation of a silt fence directly over a marked gas line, that repairs were made to the silt fence by A &amp; B in the location where the \u2018offending stake\u2019 was ultimately unearthed, that A &amp; B had previously performed repairs where they had left a stake in the ground because it was buried too deeply, that Horton was responsible for the removal of the silt fence, and that the explosion was caused by a puncture in the gas line in the exact location where the silt fence was installed and the \u2018offending stake\u2019 was found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">In analyzing the matter presented here, <em>Stone v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 329, 624 A.2d 496 (1993), provides guidance to us. In <em>Stone, </em>a homeowner sued his title insurer and the attorney who represented him in the purchase of a new home, alleging negligence and breach of contract for their failure to record a release of a deed of trust in a timely manner. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 624 A.2d 496. Stone contended that because the loan release was not recorded, he was prevented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>from obtaining a $50,000.00 home equity loan more than a year after he purchased the home. Moreover, Stone had applied for the home equity loan in order to purchase \u201c \u2018stock puts\u2019 to protect his financial position in the stock market in response to anticipated margin calls on certain stocks he had purchased on credit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 624 A.2d 496. Because Stone was unable to borrow money, he claimed that he was forced to meet the margin call and sold his stock at a substantial loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Citing \u00a7 435(2) of the Restatement, the Court held that the attorney\u2019s negligence was not a proximate cause of Stone\u2019s loss, because Stone\u2019s loss was not within the \u201cgeneral field of danger that [the attorney] should have anticipated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 624 A.2d 496. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">In the instant case, Stone would have us hold that his loss arising from the August, 1990 collapse in the market in certain stocks in which he was speculating was proximately caused by his sale of those stocks, which was caused by his lack of funds to pay off other loans, which was caused by his inability to secure a second mortgage before August 6,1990, which in turn was caused by Savitz\u2019s failure to record timely the release of the extinguished lien on his home. He argues that but for Savitz\u2019s negligence he would have secured a home equity loan and used the proceeds to meet his broker\u2019s margin call, thus avoiding the sale of stock to raise capital in a falling market. We disagree. <em>We believe that Stone\u2019s stock market damages were a highly extraordinary result of Savitz\u2019s failure to timely record the release. We hold that there was no acceptable nexus between Savitz\u2019s negligent conduct and the stock market losses suffered by Stone and, consequently, that Savitz\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of the ensuing harm ivhieh befell Stone.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnP\"><em>Id. </em>at 340-41, 624 A.2d 496 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Appellants analogize the case to <em>Texas Co. v. Pecora, </em>208 Md. 281, 118 A.2d 377 (1955). There, two boys were burned when a gasoline tank owned by the Texas Company (\u201cthe Company\u201d) exploded. The tanks had been placed on a vacant lot by agents of the Company, after the owners of a nearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>gas station and grocery store, who leased the tanks from the company, decided to enlarge the store. Approximately twenty feet from the tanks stood a metal trash can, which was used by clerks of the gas station to burn trash. The boys were playing near the unsecured tanks when one of them took a lighted stick from a fire in the trash can and held it to a puddle of gasoline that had seeped from the tank, causing an explosion. From the evidence adduced at trial, it was uncertain whether a gasoline station employee had failed to extinguish the fire in the trash can, or whether it was reignited by one of the children who had been playing in the area. The jury returned a verdict for the boys and their parents. On appeal, the Court held that the Company\u2019s negligence in leaving the tanks unsecured on a vacant lot proximately caused the boys\u2019 injuries. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">Proximate cause being a question for the jury, it was warranted in this case in finding that although the Texas Company capped the pipes leading to the tanks, it knew the tanks must be moved; it knew a suction pipe about five feet long was attached to the tank and ran into a concrete island; that a vent pipe attached to the tank extended fifteen feet up the side of a building and a fill pipe two feet long was attached to the tank. The jury could have found that the Texas Company knew or should have known that these pipes would be cut off or disconnected in removal of the tank from the ground. The jury could have found that the tank once removed, with open pipes attached, was known by the Texas Company to be a dangerous instrumentality, capable of doing great harm; and that the removal to a vacant lot, the rolling about by the children, the application of the fire and the explosion and injury were all links in a chain of foreseeable circumstances. The facts of the case are such that the Court cannot say as a matter of law that the original negligence of the Texas Company was not the proximate cause of the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 294, 118 A.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In our view, the case at bar is more akin to <em>Peterson </em>than <em>P\u00e9cora. </em>We recognize that, in the light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>appellants, the evidence was sufficient to show that the explosion was caused by a leak in the underground gas pipe, and that the leak was caused by a puncture from a silt fencing or grading stake. There was no evidence, however, that the gas line was pierced at the time of installation or repair of the silt fence. Nor have appellants offered any legally significant evidence that would allow the jury to determine how the stake made its way into the gas main, or who among a field of defendants was responsible for that occurrence. At best, appellants could prove only that a stake was left in the ground and that the silt fence stakes and grading stakes should not have been installed over a gas line. Whether Horton or A &amp; B\u2019s negligence was a substantial factor in causing the ultimate explosion depends, however, on what \u201ccaused\u201d the wooden stake to pierce the pipe. Moreover, even assuming that the silt fence was negligently installed over the gas line, or that the grading was negligent, or that A <em>&amp; </em>B or Dodson negligently left the stake in the ground, we cannot say that the gas explosion was a foreseeable consequence of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Significantly, appellants\u2019 own expert, having studied the accident thoroughly for Washington Gas, could not offer an opinion as to how the stake made its way into the gas pipe. Appellants have only meager proof that Horton or A <em>&amp; </em>B was responsible for driving the stake down to a depth of thirty-nine inches, much less that appellees did anything that would have caused the stake to strike the gas line with such force that it penetrated the gas pipe. Because a jury would have been unable to ascribe fault to any of the appellees for what transpired, the trial court was correct in not permitting a jury to speculate about such a crucial evidentiary gap.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We are mindful that, \u201c[ojrdinarily, the question of whether causation is proximate or superseding is a matter to be resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>May, 122 </em>Md.App. at 383, 712 A.2d 166; <em>see Lane, supra, </em>338 Md. at 52, 656 A.2d 307. Nonetheless, based on the evidence before the trial court, appellants were unable to show that Horton\u2019s or A &amp; B\u2019s negligence was \u25a0 a cause in fact of the explosion, nor were they able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>demonstrate that appellants\u2019 injuries were a foreseeable consequence of the alleged negligent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">To be sure, as <em>P\u00e9cora </em>illustrates, each link in the causal chain need not have been under the control of the one whose negligence triggered the chain of events. Nor do we suggest that the lapse of time between the negligent act and the injury is dispositive. A foreseeable injury may follow months, if not years, after a negligent act that triggers a calamitous chain of events. Nevertheless, each link in the causal chain must be connected to the one that came before.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Alternatively, the trial court found that, even if appellees\u2019 negligence in leaving the stake in the ground was a \u201ccause in fact\u201d of the explosion, the intervening forces that combined to drive the stake into the pipe and trigger the ultimate explosion were superseding causes that obviated appellees\u2019 liability. Again, <em>Yonce </em>provides guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In <em>Yonce, </em>we held that the six factors set out in Restatement \u00a7 422 \u201cshould be evaluated when determining whether an intervening force rises to the level of a superseding cause.\u201d <em>Yonce, </em>111 Md.App. at 146, 680 A.2d 569. Specifically, the trial court should examine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">(a) the fact that its [the intervening force\u2019s] intervention brings about harm different in kind from that which would otherwise have resulted from the actor\u2019s negligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">(b) the fact that its operation or the consequences thereof appear after the event to be extraordinary rather than normal in view of the circumstances existing at the time of its operation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">(c) the fact that the intervening force is operating independently of any situation created by the actor\u2019s negligence, or, on the other hand, is or is not a normal result of such a situation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">(d) the fact that the operation of the intervening force is due to a third person\u2019s act or to his failure to act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">(e) the fact that the intervening force is due to an act of a third person which is wrongful toward the other and as such subjects the third person to liability to him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>(f) the degree of culpability of a wrongful act of a third person which sets the intervening force in motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The trial court\u2019s opinion evaluated each factor separately. With regard to factor (a), the court noted that \u201c[t]he normal result of \u2018negligently\u2019 placing a silt fence stake over a gas line is that the stake is removed with the rest of the silt fence when sediment control is no longer needed. If the stake gets separated from the silt fence as the offending stake apparently did, the customary result is still harmless.\u201d As to factor (b), the court stated that \u201c[e]aeh subsequent event, all of which were necessary to achieve the final result, is in some degree unexpected if not extraordinary. The cumulative effect is an extraordinary event.\u201d With regard to factor (c), the court observed that \u201c[t]he force which drove the stake down then up, the weather, and the source of ignition are independent intervening forces unconnected to Horton\u2019s conduct.\u201d In considering factors (d), (e), and (f), the court stressed that the cause of the gas line puncture remains unknown. The court stated that although \u201c[t]he person or object driving down the offending stake is unknown by identity or time,\u201d the court opined that \u201c[t]he driving down of the stake into the ground is a potentially wrongful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Appellants contend that \u201cas long as the intervening act is one that the original actor should have anticipated, was an act which a reasonable person would not consider highly extraordinary in light of the situation involved, or was a normal consequence of the situation created by the original actor,\u201d the intervening acts cannot be considered superseding causes. In appellants\u2019 view, \u201ca question of fact was raised about whether the act of a third party driving the \u2018offending stake\u2019 into the ground was a superceding cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Appellants are correct in emphasizing foreseeability as a crucial aspect of a superseding cause analysis. Recently, in <em>Matthews v. Amberwood Assoc. Ltd. Partnership, Inc., </em>351 Md. 544, 578, 719 A.2d 119 (1998), the Court of Appeals reiterated what had been made clear in <em>Lane: </em>namely, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u201c \u2018[essentially, the intervening negligence is not a superseding cause if it is reasonably foreseeable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Lane, supra, </em>338 Md. at 52, 656 A.2d 307). The <em>Matthews </em>Court quoted the helpful explanation of superseding cause found in <em>State v. Hecht Company, </em>165 Md. 415, 422, 169 A. 311 (1933):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">If the negligent acts of two or more persons, all being culpable and responsible in law for their acts, do not concur in point of time, and the negligence of one only exposes the injured person to risk of injury in case the other should also be negligent, the liability of the person first in fault will depend upon the question whether the negligent act of the other was one which a man of ordinary experience and sagacity, acquainted with all the circumstances, could reasonably anticipate or not. If such a person could have anticipated that the intervening act of negligence might, in a natural and ordinary sequence, follow the original act of negligence, the person first in fault is not released from liability by reason of the intervening negligence of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azm4\"><em>Matthews, </em>351 Md. at 578, 719 A.2d 119; <em>see also Kenney, supra, </em>323 Md. at 131, 591 A.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We agree with the trial court that the intervening causes that allegedly combined to link one segment of the causal chain to another, so that an abandoned wooden stake contributed to the explosion of appellant Wankel\u2019s home, were highly extraordinary and, in the aggregate, unforeseeable. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The case of <em>Hartford Ins. Co. v. Manor Inn of Bethesda, Inc., </em>335 Md. 135, 642 A.2d 219 (1994), is helpful. There, a patient escaped from a State-operated hospital for the mentally ill, where he was assigned to a \u201chigh security ward for acutely disturbed patients.\u201d Three days after his escape, the patient appeared in Bethesda, Maryland. There, officers of the Montgomery County Police Department, believing that the patient was \u201chomeless and in need of emergency shelter,\u201d referred him to the Montgomery County Department of Social Services, which arranged for the escapee to stay at the Manor Inn of Bethesda for the night. The following morning, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>patient stole a laundry van that had been left unattended with the keys in the ignition. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 642 A.2d 219. Thirty minutes after commandeering the van, the patient negligently drove it into a car that was stopped at a stop sign, injuring the driver. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41, 642 A.2d 219. In the wake of the accident, the driver\u2019s insurance company sued the State and the Manor Inn in an attempt to recover what it had paid its insured under its insurance policy, alleging negligence. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff claimed the State was negligent in failing to detain the patient. The plaintiff also claimed Manor Inn was negligent in leaving the van unattended with the keys in the ignition. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the State because it found that State had no duty to protect the driver whose car was struck by the stolen van; the collision was not a foreseeable consequence of the patient\u2019s escape from the State facility. The court also, <em>sua sponte, </em>granted summary judgment in favor of Manor Inn, on the ground that the patient\u2019s negligent driving was a superseding cause of the insured\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">On appeal, the Court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Manor Inn without a motion requesting it. <em>Id. </em>at 144-47, 642 A.2d 219. The Court went on to address the issue of Manor Inn\u2019s liability, however, and concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because the patient\u2019s negligence was a superseding cause. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">Leaving the keys in the ignition of a motor vehicle increases significantly the chances of that vehicle being stolen. Thus, viewing the total facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is patent that it was reasonably foreseeable that, by leaving the keys in the ignition, a thief would take the van. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>but for the negligence of Manor Inn, [the patient] would not have taken the van. It is not so clear, however, that the thief would drive negligently, and even more unclear that, in doing so, he or she would injure the plaintiff. Consequently, while the negligence of Manor Inn clearly was the proximate cause of the theft of the van, it does not follow that that causal relationship continued from the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ment of the theft to the moment of the impact between the van and [the insured\u2019s] car. [The patient\u2019s] conduct in taking the van was not \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d; indeed, it was highly predictable. On the other hand, <em>the manner in which he drove the van, and its consequences, were \u201chighly extraordinary. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 160, 642 A.2d 219 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Moreover, the case <em>sub judice </em>is distinguishable from <em>Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company v. Kenney, supra, </em>323 Md. 116, 591 A.2d 507. There, the driver of a tractor-trailer parked his 45-foot truck and trailer in a no-parking zone, so that it blocked the view of drivers attempting to exit a shopping center parking lot, as well as the view of drivers proceeding on the road that passed the exit. While the trucked was parked there, Tracey Hill, driving her father\u2019s car, attempted to exit the parking lot, despite the obstructed view. As she pulled into the intersection, she struck an approaching car. Subsequently, Tracey\u2019s father and his insurer instituted suit against Kenney, the driver of the truck, and Kenney\u2019s employer, Roadway Express, Inc. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 591 A.2d 507. At trial and on appeal, the defendants claimed that Tracey\u2019s negligence in pulling into the intersection was not foreseeable, and constituted a superseding cause of the ultimate damage. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABU\">the risk of the very type of harm that was suffered here was reasonably foreseeable from the negligence of Kenney in parking his tractor trailer so as to significantly obstruct the vision of drivers likely to meet at that point. The negligence of Kenney continued through the moment of impact. The conduct of Hill was not \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d \u2014 it was predictable. The circuit court erred in finding absence of proximate cause as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 132, 591 A.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In our view, <em>Kenney </em>illustrates what is missing in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Unlike <em>Kenney, </em>appellees\u2019 alleged negligence was remote in time. Moreover, unlike <em>Kenney, </em>one would have been hard pressed to predict, at the time of the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>negligence, what catastrophe might occur as a result of using or discarding the wooden stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">In sum, we conclude that, in the light most favorable to appellants, a jury could conclude that a wooden stake punctured the gas line, and that the stake was probably a silt fencing stake. We do not know, however, how the puncture occurred, or who had contact with the stake when it was imbedded in the ground. Because it appears rather extraordinary to us that leaving a wooden stake at the site or in the ground, even above a gas line, would set off the chain of events that culminated in this disaster, we perceive no error by the trial court in ruling in favor of Horton &amp; A &amp; B. To the contrary, appellants failed to show that the negligence of Horton and A &amp; B proximately caused appellants\u2019 harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">III. Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Maryland Rule 2-332(a) provides that \u201c[a] defendant, as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint ... to be served upon a person not previously a party to the action <em>who is or may be liable </em>to the defendant for all or part of a plaintiffs claim against the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, a third-party complaint is \u201cby its nature ... a contingent claim.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 283, 674 A.2d 106 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997); <em>see </em>Paul V. Niemeyer <em>&amp; </em>Linda M. Schuett, Maryland Rules Commentary 224 (2nd ed.1992). A third-party complaint \u201calleges that, <em>if </em>the defendant is found liable to the plaintiff, then the third-party defendant is, in whole or in part, liable to the defendant.\u201d <em>Scarlett Harbor Assocs., </em>109 Md.App. at 283, 674 A.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In this case, Horton\u2019s indemnity and contribution claims against Great Seneca, Genstar, A <em>&amp; </em>B, Wright, and Triangle were predicated on the possibility that Horton would be found liable for appellants\u2019 damages. Because we have concluded that the court properly entered summary judgment in favor of Horton, the cross-claims filed by Horton are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>academic. Therefore, we shall not address the issues raised by Horton\u2019s cross-appeal, nor by the cross-appellees\u2019 various motions to dismiss Horton\u2019s cross-appeal. <em>See Kennedy v.
