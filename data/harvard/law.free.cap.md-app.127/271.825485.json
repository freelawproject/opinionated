State, </em>352 Md. 279, 291, 721 A.2d 699 (1998); <em>Cox v. State, </em>311 Md. 326, 331-32, 534 A.2d 1333 (1988). The fault involved in such negligent conduct may come in any of three degrees. At the bottom end of the culpability scale is mere civil liability for a wrongful death, where there may be uncontestable fault and perhaps heavy civil liability but still something less than criminality. From the point of view of the criminal law, it is the level of homicide known for the last 600 years as excusable homicide. It is noncriminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Higher up the ascending scale of blameworthy negligence are those more \u201cgross deviations\u201d from the standard of care used by an ordinary person where the negligent conduct can reasonably be said to manifest \u201ca wanton or reckless disregard of human life.\u201d <em>Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. at 291, 721 A.2d 699; <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 499, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). That level of fault constitutes involuntary manslaughter of the gross negligence variety. Yet higher still on the culpability ladder are those acts of a life-endangering nature so reckless that they manifest a wanton indifference to human life. That level of blameworthiness constitutes second-degree murder of the depraved-heart variety. Definitionally, the Maryland case law has yet provided no meaningful distinction between those last two levels of culpability. \u201c[0]ur cases have not drawn a precise line between depraved heart murder and involuntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. at 299, 721 A.2d 699. As an abstract matter, however, we know that there is\u2014 somewhere \u2014 such a line. There must be or else there is no legally cognizable distinction between murder and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In considering this appeal, our analysis will be confined exclusively to this single vertical column of ascending and descending culpability, rising from mere civil negligence at the bottom to gross-negligence manslaughter in the middle to depraved-heart murder at the top. Our concern, moreover, will be with the procedural devices that may be available to trigger or to limit movement upward and downward within that vertical column.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b302-22\">Is there a single, entry-level burden of production requiring a mere <em>prima facie </em>case as to some negligence with the ultimate level of culpability then being consigned to the idiosyncratic and unfettered weighing process of the fact finder? Do we simply give the jurors the appropriate definitions and turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>them loose? Or are there intermediate and progressively more demanding burdens of production that must be met by the State, as a matter of law, before the fact-finding process is even ratcheted up from one to the next higher level of possible culpability? If so, what precisely are those progressively more demanding burdens?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">It is clear that each legally cognizable level of culpability has its own unique burden of production that must independently be satisfied before a fact finder will be permitted even to consider civil liability or criminal guilt at that level. A plaintiff, suing a defendant for an injury caused by the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence for the issue of liability even to be submitted to the jury. <em>Isen v. Phoenix Assurance Co., </em>259 Md. 564, 270 A.2d 476 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In a case charging involuntary manslaughter of the gross negligence variety, as we graduate upward, the State will not be permitted to take its case to the jury simply by proving a <em>prima facie </em>case of ordinary negligence. It must meet an additional and higher burden of production by showing such gross negligence, above and beyond mere civil negligence, as to evidence \u201ca wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u201d There are a number of cases where ordinary negligence has been established or assumed but where the evidence was nonetheless held, as a matter of law, to have been legally insufficient to have permitted the jury even to consider a manslaughter verdict based on gross criminal negligence. <em>Plummer v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 244, 702 A.2d 453 (1997); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>213 Md. 527, 132 A.2d 853 (1957); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>206 Md. 49, 109 A.2d 909 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Although as yet no Maryland decision has had to come to grips with the issue, it is logically ineluctable that even a <em>prima facie </em>case of gross criminal negligence would not, <em>ipso facto, </em>survive a motion for judgment of acquittal on a murder count and justify submitting to the jury a charge of second-degree murder of the depraved-heart variety. A yet higher burden of production would intervene and require a <em>prima </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>facie </em>case as to some state of mind even more blameworthy than gross criminal negligence. Were that not a legal requirement, then every case of involuntary manslaughter of the gross negligence variety properly submitted to a jury would automatically permit a verdict of second-degree murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When that issue arises as to what the precise burden of production is before the jury may even consider depraved-heart murder, the appellate courts will, to be sure, have to do some serious grappling with some treacherously ambiguous earlier language. But when that time comes, one must have faith, our courts will somehow surmount the linguistic hurdle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are relieved of that challenge in this case, however, because the State never charged the appellant with second-degree murder of the depraved-heart variety. As a purely doctrinal exercise, one wonders why. In any event, the unveiling of the content of the burden of production as to depraved-heart murder will have to await another day. In considering this appeal, therefore, the question of how, <em>prima facie, </em>to get to the highest level of this vertical column of culpability need not concern us.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">By the same token, we need not concern ourselves with the entry-level question of how, <em>prima facie, </em>to get into the negligence column at its lowest level. Taking, as we must, that version of the evidence most favorable to the State\u2019s case, the appellant was <em>prima facie </em>accountable for ordinary civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>negligence that contributed at least in part to the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Our focus in this case, therefore, will be on the second and intermediate burden of production that must be satisfied to raise a case of <em>prima facie </em>civil negligence to the level of <em>prima facie </em>gross criminal negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our focus, therefore, must not be on the negligence <em>per se </em>but only on the INCREMENTAL elements or characteristics that are required to ESCALATE ordinary civil negligence, be it ever so grievous in its consequences, into a genuine case of gross criminal negligence. In this case, the homicidal agency of the appellant is a given. The <em>actus reus </em>of some negligence is also a given. Our attention must be on WHAT FURTHER PROOF is then required, as a matter of law, even to permit the jury to consider a <em>felonious mens rea. </em>Once we identify those INCREMENTAL elements that may transform a tort into a crime, we can begin to assess the legal sufficiency of the State\u2019s case to satisfy those INCREMENTAL elements. We will not second-guess the fact finders. Our concern is not with what the jury found but with what the judge permitted the jury even to consider. In other words, we are only concerned with the burden of production and not with the burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The appellant is Sergeant Stephen Pagotto, a fifteen-year veteran of the Baltimore City Police Department at the time of the alleged crimes. At approximately 8:80 P.M. on the evening of February 7, 1996, in the course of Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s performance of his police duties, a bullet from his handgun hit and killed Preston Barnes, who was behind the wheel of an automobile that Sergeant Pagotto was at that moment at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>tempting to stop. A Baltimore City jury convicted Sergeant Pagotto of the involuntary manslaughter of Preston Barnes and of the reckless endangerment of two other persons who were passengers in the automobile being driven by Barnes at the time he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">At the end of the entire case, the appellant moved for judgments of acquittal on all three counts. The motion was denied. Although the appellant raises ten separate contentions on this appeal, our attention will turn initially to his contention that the State\u2019s evidence was not legally sufficient to have permitted those three charges to be submitted to the jury. More particularly, the contention challenges the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence to show a criminal <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In assessing the legal sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence, we will take, as we must, that version of the evidence most favorable to the State\u2019s case. The respective versions of the case, however, do not diverge from each other until we reach the critical minute leading up to and including the discharge of the appellant\u2019s weapon. There is no dispute as to the nature of the mission Sergeant Pagotto and his partner that evening, Officer Stephen Wagner, were on as they approached what turned out to be the critical confrontation. Officer Wagner was the key State\u2019s witness in that regard and his version as to the nature of that night\u2019s assignment is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The Gun Recovery Unit</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Officer Wagner testified that on the evening of February 7, Sergeant Pagotto and he were both assigned to the newly commissioned Gun Recovery Unit that had been created by the Baltimore City Police Department four months earlier for the express purpose of removing guns from the street. He and Sergeant Pagotto were both assigned to the Northeastern District. As of February 7, the Gun Recovery Unit, at least as far as the Northeastern District was concerned, was just entering its second week of operation. Officer Wagner described the training film that had been shown to those officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>who were assigned to gun recovery. It informed them as to the characteristics they should look for in determining what persons or groups of persons to approach as those who were more likely than others to have guns in their possession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">Prior to actually the first day of the gun squad, there was <em>a videotape made up to show characteristics of people carrying guns, </em>whether they are in the jacket, the way the jacket hangs, <em>if they are in cars, just their reaction, movements that they were doing in the car at the time, where they are placing the gun in the car just by their movements.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">It\u2019s approximately, I would say 20 minutes to a half hour tape that we watched to get these characteristics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">As driving around on the streets, we would watch people as standing on corners, loitering on comers, whichever, to look for those characteristics. <em>And that was our point to take and go and approach those people to see, to interview them and get those guns off the street.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">As part of a highly publicized city-wide effort to reduce the number of guns available on the streets of Baltimore, the mission of the Gun Recovery Unit was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">Q: And what was the purpose of the gun squad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">A: To go out and get guns off the street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Officer Wagner explained that on the evening of February 7, the primary mission that he and Sergeant Pagotto had was to recover guns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">The focus was on guns. That\u2019s all we were focused on. So we weren\u2019t handling domestics or calls for service. That was our focus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">As they set out that evening to \u201cget guns off the street,\u201d Sergeant Pagotto and Officer Wagner were in plain clothes. There was no mistaking their status as police officers, however, for they were using \u201ca marked Tracker,\u201d which Officer Wagner described as a car having \u201cthe police striping, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>shield, and a little red light on the roof.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sector of the Northeastern District which Sergeant Pagotto and Officer Wagner were patrolling that evening was that which Officer Wagner described as \u201cthe lower end ... around Harford Road, the Alameda, Clifton Park area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Officer Wagner further described the area as one called \u201cLittle Eastern\u201d because the area is dangerous and has a higher-than-ordinary crime rate. The State never disputed Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s description of the neighborhood as \u201ca high narcotic trafficking area, high shooting area,\u201d or his testimony that those persons suspected of dealing in drugs are the same persons most likely to be carrying weapons because, as he explained, \u201cguns and narcotics are synonymous with each other.\u201d One small indication of the inherently dangerous nature of the mission Sergeant Pagotto and Officer Wagner were assigned to that night was the fact that Sergeant Pagotto was wearing his \u201cblue bullet-resistant vest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Initial Automobile Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">It was at approximately 8:30 P.M. when the two officers spotted the white Subaru driven by Preston Barnes in the 2600 block of Kirk Avenue. The justification that presented itself for stopping the white Subaru was that the Subaru was not properly displaying a license plate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officer Wagner very candidly testified that neither he nor Sergeant Pagotto were \u201con traffic patrol\u201d and that, subjectively, they were not interested in the license tag violation <em>per se. </em>Under the constitutional imprimatur of the Supreme Court in <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), however, the police are permitted to seize the opportunity presented by a traffic violation in order to accomplish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>some other investigative purpose or police function. A subjectively pretextual stop is permitted if it can be objectively justified. The real purpose of the stop, on the night of February 7, was to discover and to recover guns. The real purpose is important to keep in mind, because one of the State\u2019s experts incorrectly analyzed the confrontation in this case as if he were analyzing a true traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In addition to the fact that the white Subaru was not properly displaying its license tag on the rear bumper, Sergeant Pagotto noted the further factor that it \u201cwas in a high drug gun area, and it was suspicious.\u201d He explained that it was a common <em>modus operand\\i </em>for those who were \u201cdealing narcotics or doing a drive-by shooting\u201d to \u201ctake the tag off\u2019 in order to frustrate any easy identification of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The white Subaru was southbound on Kirk Avenue when the two officers activated the dome light and signaled for it to pull to the side of the street. It came to a stop in the 2700 block of Kirk Avenue between Montpelier Street and Gorsuch Avenue. Sergeant Pagotto stopped the Tracker several car lengths behind it. Both officers exited the Tracker and approached the stopped Subaru from the rear, Sergeant Pagotto on the driver\u2019s side and Officer Wagner on the passenger side. Without contradiction, Sergeant Pagotto testified that as he approached the Subaru, he observed Preston Barnes tilt his head back and drop his shoulder down in such a way that the action was consistent with the picking up of a weapon or the placing of one under the seat. Officer Wagner characterized the movements of all three occupants of the Subaru as \u201cvery excited and moving\u201d around inside the car. These movements were consistent with the profile that had been described and depicted in the training film. The two other occupants of the Subaru at the time of the stop were Damien Jackson and Ali Austin.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">As the two officers approached the Subaru, several additional facts are also undisputed. The hour of 8:30 P.M. in the first week of February in Baltimore City is after dark. The only purpose for which the two officers were approaching the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Subaru at that time was because they had reason to believe that its occupants might well be in the possession of handguns. The occupants of the Subaru, moreover, outnumbered the officers, three to two.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The Reaction Inside the Subaru</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Before turning to the finer parsing of Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s movements during the minute or fraction thereof immediately preceding the discharge of his weapon, it behooves us to ascertain what was happening inside the white Subaru as it was being stopped. An appreciation of the actions of the individuals inside the Subaru, especially those of the driver Preston Barnes, and of the movement of the Subaru itself is indispensable for us to evaluate the state of mind of Sergeant Pagotto as he responded to those actions and movements. The testimony of Damien Jackson, the twenty-year-old passenger in the right-front seat of the Subaru, and of Ali Austin, the eighteen-year-old passenger in the rear seat of the Subaru, are part of the State\u2019s most favorable version of the evidence. That version, however, shows the driver\u2019s total noncompliance with the lawful order of the police to bring the car to a complete stop and to submit to questioning by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Damien Jackson gave the more illuminating testimony; Ali Austin, though not testifying as fully, essentially corroborated the testimony of Jackson. Jackson established that as the three young men set out in the white Subaru that evening, one of their first activities was to drive to the home of Preston Barnes\u2019s girlfriend on Abbotston Street, where Barnes obtained ten bags of a form of cocaine known as \u201cReady Rock.\u201d Jackson further testified that Preston Barnes and he had jointly participated in the selling of cocaine in that form on the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">It was shortly after picking up the cocaine that Barnes drove the Subaru to Kirk Avenue. As soon as the police car signaled for the Subaru to stop, Barnes\u2019s first words to his companions were, \u201cOh, shit, I\u2019m dirty.\u201d Barnes was already on probation for an earlier criminal conviction. Jackson testified that Barnes knew that in addition to any new charges, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>would be faced with a violation of probation with more than five years yet to be served for such a violation. \u201cHe was backing up ... more than five years.\u201d Jackson testified that Barnes put all ten bags of cocaine in his mouth. The fact that they were wrapped in cellophane was the apparent explanation for why they were not metabolized into his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Jackson further testified that he and Barnes had generally worked out, off and on over the preceding year, an escape plan if they were ever caught in such a situation. Recognizing that they might not successfully get away from a pursuing police car already in motion, the plan was for them, when signaled to stop, to come to an apparent stop. In response to such apparent submission, the police cruiser would itself stop and the officers would get out of the vehicle and approach the stopped car, perhaps several car lengths away. As the officers got close to the stopped car, the stopped vehicle would suddenly \u201crev up.\u201d The driver would \u201cfloor it\u201d and make a getaway before the now pedestrian officers could make it back to their own vehicle, get it started again, and resume pursuit. Jackson then recounted how Barnes\u2019s handling of the white Subaru that night was completely compatible with the getaway plan they had decided upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The Critical Confrontation</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Our attention now turns back to Sergeant Pagotto. Whatever evidence there was of gross negligence on his part to support the manslaughter conviction or the two convictions for reckless endangerment concerned his actions within the space of a minute or less. That was the brief time period, immediately after he alighted from the police vehicle, between the moment he drew near the driver\u2019s side of the stopped white Subaru and the moment his handgun discharged. All parties agreed that as he approached the Subaru, he had withdrawn his Glock 17 automatic from its holster and carried it in his right hand. We will reduce the narration to slow motion in an attempt to capture the nuances of those critical seconds. Five witnesses, including Sergeant Pagotto himself, testified with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>respect to that critical minute. We will examine the testimony of each one.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\n<em>Angela Purnell, Neighbor:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Angela Purnell, could contribute little of significance. She was the tenant of an apartment located at the intersection of Kirk Avenue and Montpelier Street. Looking out from her upstairs dining room window, located near the back of her building, she initially observed the white car that had been stopped and a police car with flashing lights behind it. She saw a person she believed to be a police officer approach the driver\u2019s side of the white car and position his arms as if he were aiming a weapon. She could hear shouts that sounded \u201csomething to the effect\u201d of \u201cstop the car or don\u2019t move the car.\u201d She further testified that the white car was moving or drifting forward during the entire time she was watching it and that the police officer was similarly moving at \u201ca walking pace and he was following the car.\u201d At that point, the white car and the officer moved out of her line of sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Shortly thereafter, she heard a gunshot. By the time she got to her bedroom window to look out onto Kirk Avenue from the front of her building, all she could see was the gathering of \u201ca lot of people\u201d and of police cars several blocks further down Kirk Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>Officer Stephen Wagner, Partner:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">With respect to the three closely intertwined actions that allegedly transformed the behavior of Sergeant Pagotto that night from that of a law enforcement officer to that of a criminal, the testimony of Officer Wagner was no more illuminating than that of Angela Purnell. After the white Subaru had been stopped by Sergeant Pagotto and Officer Wagner, Sergeant Pagotto alighted from the police car and approached the Subaru on what Officer Wagner described as a \u201ccar stop position.\u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">For that officer\u2019s safety, you don\u2019t want to stand in front of or alongside the driver. You want to stand beside him, behind him in his blind spot so if anything were \u2014 occurred he would have to turn, make motions to indicate to you that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>At the same time, Officer Wagner alighted from the other side of the police vehicle and approached the right-hand side of the Subaru, staying to the rear of Sergeant Pagotto. He was in what he referred to as the \u201ccover position,\u201d which he also described:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">If there is a two-man unit, you want the other unit along on the passenger side or closer to the rear, depending on how many occupants are in the car, to see what the occupants are doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Because the Subaru was between Sergeant Pagotto and Officer Wagner, Officer Wagner could only see Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s head and shoulders. He could not testify as to whether Sergeant Pagotto had even drawn his weapon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">From my position on the car I couldn\u2019t see the defendant\u2019s hands. And as I approached, I knew the defendant was alongside of me, but I couldn\u2019t tell what he had in his hands because my focus was on the rear of that car through that window.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\"><em>A fortiori, </em>he could not testify as to whether Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s trigger finger was properly or improperly placed on his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Officer Wagner did testify that as he and Sergeant Pagotto approached the Subaru, it \u201cbegan drifting forward because Kirk Avenue is a slightly downgrade road right there in that block.\u201d He testified that the driver\u2019s door opened and that \u201cthere was a grinding sound as if someone was taking the gear shift and forcing it into a park position.\u201d He and Sergeant Pagotto were both \u201cyelling orders for that car to stop, put on the brake, put it in park.\u201d He testified that the car continued drifting and then he heard the \u201cdistinct sound of [the] engine starting.\u201d At that point, Sergeant Pagotto yelled over to him, \u201cGet the Tracker,\u201d meaning the police vehicle. Officer Wagner immediately ran back to the Tracker and opened its door. As he was entering it, he heard a gunshot. Turning back toward the Subaru, he saw Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body falling forward from a position against the car. \u201cHe\u2019s falling forward in the direction of the motion of the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Officer Wagner started up the Tracker and drove it forward to where Sergeant Pagotto was lying in the street. When he discovered that Sergeant Pagotto had not been shot, they both looked forward and saw that the Subaru had crashed into a parked car approximately two blocks further south on Kirk Avenue. By the time they got to it, both Damien Jackson and Ali Austin had fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The three actions of Sergeant Pagotto on which the State based its case of gross criminal negligence were 1) his \u201cclosing\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the Subaru with his service weapon drawn; 2) his grappling with the driver, Preston Barnes, with his left hand while his gun was in his right hand; and 3) his placement of his trigger finger along the \u201cslide\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the weapon rather than underneath the trigger guard. The significance of all three actions was that they allegedly increased the likelihood that the weapon might be discharged by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\n<em>Damien Jackson and Ali Austin, Passengers:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">With respect to the more minute actions of Sergeant Pagotto that may have been negligent, there were two versions that differed from each other in one regard but were not otherwise contradictory. One version of events was furnished by the two passengers in the white Subaru, Damien Jackson and Ali Austin. Jackson\u2019s testimony was the fuller of the two. Austin\u2019s testimony, though skimpier, essentially corroborated that of Jackson. The other version of what happened during that critical minute was that supplied by Sergeant Pagotto himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Both versions were in agreement that Sergeant Pagotto, with his weapon drawn and in his right hand, \u201cclosed\u201d to within a few feet or less of the driver\u2019s door. Neither Jackson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>nor Austin testified with respect to the placement of Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s trigger finger on his weapon. The only testimony in that regard was that of Sergeant Pagotto himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Where the two versions differed with each other was with respect to the opening of the driver\u2019s door. Both Jackson and Austin testified that when Sergeant Pagotto initially approached the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, he screamed at Preston Barnes, ordering him to stop the car. At that point, they testified, Sergeant Pagotto himself \u201copened up the door\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and then \u201cstepped back.\u201d Although they have him \u201chollering\u201d the words, \u201cStop the car, stop the car, or I\u2019m going to shoot,\u201d they also have him stepping back at that point to a distance of about three feet away from the car. They both testified that at that point Barnes \u201chit it down,\u201d which they explained to mean \u201cput the car from park into drive.\u201d The Subaru could not go directly forward because of a parked car blocking it in the curb lane. As the car sped up, it moved toward the center of Kirk Avenue and, therefore, toward and into Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body. It was as it did so that Jackson and Austin heard the shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">They testified, moreover, that it had always been Barnes\u2019s intention to ram the Subaru into gear and to make a getaway as soon as the approaching officer got close to the car. They both testified that after the car crashed to a halt two blocks down the street, they both ran from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>It is also noteworthy that the testimony of neither Damien Jackson nor Ali Austin indicated that Sergeant Pagotto ever engaged in any grappling or wrestling with Preston Barnes at all, let alone a left-handed grappling while still carrying his Glock automatic in his right hand. They both indicated that Sergeant Pagotto \u201copened the door and stepped back, walking along the car.\u201d The only evidence of what the State characterized. as an ill-advised and reckless effort at \u201cvehicular extrication\u201d came from Sergeant Pagotto himself, who, however, cast his brief physical struggle with Preston Barnes in a very different light than the act of swashbuckling bravado suggested by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Sergeant Pagotto:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The only version of the critical confrontation that referred to any physical contact between Sergeant Pagotto and Preston Barnes was that supplied by the testimony of Sergeant Pagotto. According to that version, Sergeant Pagotto did not himself initiate the physical contact by opening the driver\u2019s door of the Subaru in an effort to pull Barnes out of the car. Instead, he reacted only defensively when, to his surprise, the door suddenly sprang open and he feared he was about to be shot. His instinctive reaction was to move forward and grab the arm of the person he thought was about to shoot him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">Q: What was the next thing you did after pulling the gun from the holster?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">A: I took about two or three more steps toward the car, and got to about the back door on the driver\u2019s side ... and that is when the door sprung open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">Q: What were you thinking when that door sprung open?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">A: I was thinking I was going to get shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">Q: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">A: Because I have had training and saw videos where a ... door would open up ... and there would be a shotgun right inside the door ... When an officer approaches, because everybody knows that an officer usually approaches close to the vehicle, the shotgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>goes off and kills the officer. I also saw the video showing officers being killed as they approached. I just thought at that point in time, I was going to get killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">Q: Is that what was going through your mind at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">Q: Why didn\u2019t you turn and run back to the Tracker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">A: I didn\u2019t think of it at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">Q: What did you do instead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">A: I went towards the driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">Q: And why did you do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">A: This?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">Q: Go towards the driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-14\">A: It was the best plan of attack that way to go in and get ahold of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-15\">Q: And what are you basing that on when you say it was the best plan of attack?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-16\">A: Years of experience, and all the time in a possible ambush situation, I was always trained to go into the ambush, drawing any fire towards that person. It was just instinct, I mean, I pushed the door out of the way and grabbed his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-17\">Q: And what was your purpose in grabbing his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-18\">A: Pull him out of the car, get him away from the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-19\">Sergeant Pagotto went on to describe his physical struggle with Preston Barnes and his efforts to bring the car, which was then moving, to a halt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-20\">Q: What did Preston Barnes do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-21\">A: When he ripped his hand up like that (indicating), he leaned over and went down towards the console.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-22\">Q: And what were your thoughts at that moment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-23\">A: That he could be going for the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-24\">Q: What was the next thing you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>A: Tried to get out, felt I should disengage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">Q: How did you try to get out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">A: Reached back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">Q: What are you reaching back ... to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">A: First I went for like the steering wheel, the keys. The keys, I figured if I could get the keys, I can throw them out and this way the car wouldn\u2019t go nowhere. I couldn\u2019t do that, so I just kept reaching and finally I grabbed onto the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">Q: Now, how fast is the car moving at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">A: A good roll, at this point it is a good roll.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">Q: At what moment did you first see the car begin to move?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">A: Actually I felt it first when I was inside the car. I felt the car moving because my feet were still outside the car and I could feel my feet slipping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Sergeant Pagotto testified that he was pulling himself free of the Subaru at the moment when the Subaru engaged its gears and shot out toward him, at which point his hand hit the side of the car and his gun discharged. He himself was knocked to the streetbed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-13\">Q: Were you ever able to get out of the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">Q: How did that happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-16\">A: I reached back and I got ahold of the door, the top of the door frame.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-17\">Q: Is that the open door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-18\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-19\">Q: The open driver\u2019s door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-20\">A: Yes. And I pulled myself back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-21\">Q: And at this moment, what did Preston Barnes do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-22\">A: Started the car and I heard the engine roar and then the tires started spinning and shot out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Q: And what happened to you as a result?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">A: I was thrown down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">Q: Okay. And did anything happen during the time you were thrown down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">A: That is when my hand hit the side of the car, the gun discharged, glass was everywhere, and I fell to the ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Sergeant Pagotto described the entire critical confrontation as something that took place within a period of three to five seconds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">Q: What was the amount of time that passed from the moment you saw the driver\u2019s door open to the point where the gun discharged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">A: Probably three to five seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">Q: Were you hurt at all as a result of the fall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">A: I hurt my hand and I hurt my knee, my left knee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-13\">Q: Did you ever seek any treatment for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-15\">Q: And where did you seek that treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-16\">A: I went to Good Samaritan Hospital that night after I finished at Homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-17\">Q: And did you learn what the injuries you sustained were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-18\">A: Abrasion to my hand and abrasion to my knee, and my knee hasn\u2019t been the same since, the ligaments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-19\">On cross-examination by the State, Sergeant Pagotto elaborated that just before he pulled himself free from the moving car, he was \u201creaching for the keys with my left hand, the gun in my right hand, and I\u2019m running sideways.\u201d It was then, just as he was freeing himself from the Subaru, that the Subaru suddenly accelerated and drove sideways into him, knocking him to the ground. It was as he was hit and going into his fall that his right hand, holding the gun, hit (or was hit by) the vehicle, causing it to discharge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-20\">Q: And you fall how? Forward?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>A: Forward like that (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">Q: And you indicated that your gun hand hit the vehicle and the gun discharged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">A: My gun hand hit the vehicle, the gun discharged, and then the glass exploded and I went down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Sergeant Pagotto elaborated that it was the back of his right hand, especially his knuckles, that struck (or was struck by) the Subaru at the moment \u201cthe gun discharged and then the glass exploded and I went down.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">Q: Okay. What part of your hand hit the car? The back of your hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">A: This area here (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">Q: Okay. Would you show the ladies and gentlemen of the jury the area on your hand you say you hit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">A: This area here (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">Q: The back of the hand, these knuckles; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-14\">Q: And how are you holding the gun at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-15\">A: I guess like this (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-16\">Q: You guess like that. You\u2019re saying your finger was not on the trigger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-17\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-18\">Q: But it wasn\u2019t under the trigger guard, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-19\">A: No, it wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-20\">Q: And, again, one more time, you hit the back of your hand on the car, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-21\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-22\">\n<em>The Physical Evidence:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-23\">The physical evidence as to the trajectory of the lethal bullet was completely compatible with Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s testimony as to how the back of his right hand, holding the gun, hit (or was hit by) the left side of the Subaru just as his weapon discharged. The reason there was a simultaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>shattering of the glass was that the bullet entered the left rear passenger window of the Subaru through the lower left-hand corner of that closed glass window. The bullet moved in a forward direction from the rear toward the front of the Subaru, passing between the pillar or post that separates the front door from the rear door, on the left, and the driver\u2019s bucket seat, on the right. It immediately struck and entered the body of Preston Barnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The autopsy revealed the continuing trajectory. Barnes, as he was hit, had obviously turned fully to his left and then slightly to the rear with his left arm upraised. The bullet entered his body just under his left armpit and passed through the anterior part of his chest, piercing the heart and a lung, just before it came to rest toward the right side of his anterior chest. Its passage through the body was at a slightly downward angle.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The Standard of the Reasonable Police Officer</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Before turning to a close examination of those actions of Sergeant Fagotto that allegedly constituted gross criminal negligence, it is appropriate to set out the standard against which his conduct is to be measured. It is not that of a reasonable civilian similarly situated but that of a reasonable police officer similarly situated. As Judge Raker explained in <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>836 Md. 475, 501, 649 A.2d 336 (1994), quoting in part from <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 630, 642, 632 A.2d 163 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">In determining whether an accused\u2019s actions were grossly negligent or criminally reckless, the standard against which a defendant\u2019s conduct must be assessed is typically the conduct of an ordinarily prudent citizen similarly situated. As the Court of Special Appeals correctly noted in its opinion, however, where the accused is a police officer, the reasonableness of the conduct must be evaluated not from the perspective of a reasonable civilian but rather from the perspective of a reasonable police officer similarly situated. <em>Albrecht, </em>97 Md.App. at 642, 632 A.2d at 169. As the intermediate appellate court explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Under almost all circumstances, the gratuitous pointing of a deadly weapon at one civilian by another civilian would almost certainly be negligence <em>per se, </em>if not gross negligence <em>per se. A police officer, on the other hand, is authorized and, indeed, frequently obligated to threaten deadly force on a regular basis. </em>The standard of conduct demanded of a police officer on duty, therefore, is the standard of a reasonable police officer similarly situated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9k\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">We must look to the testimony of the various experts to establish a standard of required, or recommended, police procedure and then determine whether the evidence generated a jury issue as to whether Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s conduct \u201cconstituted \u2018a gross and wanton deviation\u2019 from such a standard.\u201d <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>97 Md.App. at 643, 632 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Common Law Manslaughter and Automobile Manslaughter Involve Precisely the Same Gross Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">As we determine whether the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support the finding of gross criminal negligence, we note that the cases involving manslaughter by automobile, pursuant to what is now Art. 27, \u00a7 388, are just as pertinent as are the cases involving common law manslaughter. Chapter 414 of the Acts of 1941 created the crime of manslaughter by automobile. The new crime was made a misdemeanor<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> whereas more generic common law manslaughter remained a felony. Indeed, <em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 143 A. 872 (1928), was an automobile manslaughter case prosecuted as common law involuntary manslaughter thirteen years before the automobile manslaughter law was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The new statutory misdemeanor completely incorporated the gross negligence standard of the common law felony. <em>Hughes v. State, </em>198 Md. 424, 431, 84 A.2d 419 (1951)(\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>common law standard of \u2018gross negligence\u2019 as the minimum requirement for conviction of manslaughter where one unintentionally kills in the course of doing a dangerous act is carried over into the recent Maryland statute setting up the separate crime of manslaughter by automobile or other vehicle.\u201d); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>206 Md. 49, 51, 109 A.2d 909 (1954)(\u201cThis statute has been interpreted to have the common law meaning of gross negligence so that, in order to establish guilt, there must be a \u2018wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u2019 \u201d). <em>See also Faulcon v. State, </em>211 Md. 249, 257, 126 A.2d 858 (1956); <em>State v. Gibson, </em>4 Md.App. 236, 242-43, 242 A.2d 575 (1968); <em>Boyd v. State, </em>22 Md.App. 539, 550, 323 A.2d 684 (1974); <em>Forbes v. State, </em>324 Md. 335, 340-41 n. 2, 597 A.2d 427 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">What Escalates Negligence Up To Gross Criminal Negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">It is universally agreed that a legally sufficient case of ordinary civil negligence is not <em>ipso facto </em>a legally sufficient case of gross criminal negligence. As we explained earlier in this opinion, it is not enough to provide a set of legally correct definitions and then simply turn the fact finders loose. In <em>Duren v. State, </em>203 Md. 584, 588, 102 A.2d 277 (1954), the Court of Appeals confirmed that evidence sufficient to support a finding of simple negligence is not of itself sufficient to support a manslaughter verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">In <em>State of Maryland v. Chapman, </em>101 F.Supp. 335, Judge Chesnut in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, declared that proof of simple negligence will not support a conviction of manslaughter but that there must be proven gross negligence, which must be \u201c... such that it amounted to a \u2018wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The incremental catalyst that may transform mere negligence into gross negligence is, albeit elusive, a substantive element with a unique burden of production that must be satisfied as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>As we strive to attach a convenient handle to that elusive incremental element, we must, moreover, scrupulously avoid working backward from the consequences. As Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy explained for this Court in <em>Mills v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 196, 200, 282 A.2d 147 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 750 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">[Wjhether an accused\u2019s conduct constituted <em>gross negligence must be determined by the conduct itself and not by the resultant harm. </em>Nor can criminal liability be predicated on every careless act merely because its carelessness results in injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">(Citation omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The first definition in Maryland of involuntary manslaughter of the gross negligence variety was that provided by <em>United Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Prostic, </em>169 Md. 535, 539, 182 A. 421 (1936), as it quoted with approval 1 Russell, <em>Crimes </em>636:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axz\">There are many <em>acts so heedless and incautious as necessarily to be deemed unlawful and wanton, </em>though there may not be any express intent to do mischief, and <em>the party committing them causing death by such conduct will be guilty of manslaughter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><em>Hughes v. State, </em>198 Md. 424, 432, 84 A.2d 419 (1951), stated that \u201cthe question is whether the conduct of the defendant, considering all the factors of the case, was such that it amounted to a \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duren v. State, </em>203 Md. 584, 588, 102 A.2d 277 (1954), concluded that the \u201cgross negligence\u201d that must be proven to support a manslaughter conviction \u201camounted to a wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u201d That definition was repeated verbatim in case after case. <em>Allison v. State, </em>203 Md. 1, 5, 98 A.2d 273 (1953); <em>Clay v. State, </em>211 Md. 577, 584, 128 A.2d 634 (1957); <em>Lilly v. State, </em>212 Md. 436, 442, 129 A.2d 839 (1957); <em>Johnson v.

State, </em>220 Md. 590, 155 A.2d 684 (1959), was a case involving common law manslaughter rather than automobile manslaughter. The Court of Appeals did not hesitate to adopt the same definition of gross negligence and readily looked to the automobile manslaughter cases for precedential guidance. The Court stated, 220 Md. at 597, 155 A.2d 684:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">[T]o establish civil liability, the rule, generally, is a failure to use that degree of care and caution that an ordinarily careful and prudent person would exercise under like circumstances. But, in Maryland, if the basis of the charge be felonious negligence as it is in the instant case, it must have been gross or criminal negligence, which has been interpreted by this Court to mean \u201ca wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\"><em>Palmer v. State, </em>223 Md. 341, 164 A.2d 467 (1960), was also a case involving common law manslaughter rather than automobile manslaughter. Again, the Court of Appeals applied the same definition of gross negligence, stating at 223 Md. at 351-52,164 A.2d 467:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">We think that the appellant\u2019s conduct and actions, in permitting and, in fact, compelling this poor little defenseless urchin to remain in an environment where she was subjected to merciless, inhumane and inordinate brutality of a protracted nature, manifested a recklessness of justice and the rights and feelings of the tiny infant in such a manner so as to support the finding that the appellant\u2019s conduct and actions displayed \u201ca wanton or reckless disregard for human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>life.\u201d The actions of McCue were so outrageous as to put any reasonable person on guard that the child\u2019s life was in real and imminent peril.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>Mills v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 196, 282 A.2d 147 (1971), was a case involving common law involuntary manslaughter. Chief Judge Murphy utilized the standard definition of gross criminal negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">[W]here a charge of involuntary manslaughter is predicated on negligently doing some act lawful in itself, the negligence necessary to support a conviction must be gross or criminal, <em>viz., </em>such as manifests a wanton or reckless disregard of human life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">13 Md.App. at 200, 282 A.2d 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In <em>Duley v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 275, 467 A.2d 776 (1983), a father was convicted of both child abuse and the involuntary manslaughter of his daughter. In affirming the conviction for common law manslaughter, Chief Judge Gilbert stated, 56 Md.App. at 289, 467 A.2d 776:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">Involuntary manslaughter may consist of the doing of a lawful act in a grossly negligent manner. The evidence shows that Duley exercised a reckless disregard for human life and thus sustains the manslaughter conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">In <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 499-500, 649 A.2d 336 (1994), Judge Raker synthesized all of the pre-existing language on the quality of gross negligence into the most complete statement our case law has yet produced as to that incremental quality necessary to transform civil negligence into criminal negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">It has long been stated that where the charge of involuntary manslaughter is predicated upon the allegation that the defendant committed a lawful act in a negligent manner, a conviction of manslaughter will not lie on a showing of simple negligence or misadventure or carelessness but must rather be predicated upon that degree of aggravated negligence which is termed \u201cgross\u201d negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>In determining whether a defendant\u2019s actions constituted gross negligence, we must ask whether the accused\u2019s conduct, \u201cunder the circumstances, amounted to a disregard of the consequences which might ensue and indifference to the rights of others, and so was a wanton and reckless disregard for human life.\u201d Stated otherwise, the accused must have committed \u201cacts so heedless and incautious as necessarily to be deemed unlawful and wanton,\u201d manifesting such a gross departure from what would be the conduct of an ordinarily careful and prudent person under the same circumstances so as to furnish evidence of an indifference to consequences. It is only conduct which rises to this degree of gross negligence upon which a conviction of involuntary manslaughter can be predicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The Accidental Firing of the Weapon</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The State\u2019s theory of the case is of necessity predicated on an assumption that Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s service weapon discharged accidentally, thereby killing Preston Barnes. At the end of the State\u2019s case, Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal was granted with respect to any theory of voluntary manslaughter. The trial judge agreed that there was no evidence to support a conclusion that Sergeant Pagotto had intentionally killed Preston Barnes and that any possible manslaughter had, therefore, to be of the involuntary variety. After brief argument on the possible theory of voluntary manslaughter, the ruling of the court was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">The Court: [T]he obvious logic of this is that the voluntary manslaughter would not be put to the jury [; that] essentially is what it comes down to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">Mr. Belsky: Your Honor, I\u2019m asking for judgment on acquittal on voluntary manslaughter. I don\u2019t want the case to go back to the jury [on the theory] that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>[might] be voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">The Court: No, I think we just said that it would go back only on involuntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Thus, the case went to the jury entirely on the theory of involuntary manslaughter of the gross negligence variety. The alleged gross negligence essentially consisted of three violations of Baltimore City Police Department guidelines, that enhanced the likelihood that the service weapon might discharge accidentally. Although the prosecution insisted that a finding that Sergeant Pagotto had no intention to kill Preston Barnes did not necessarily compel a conclusion that Sergeant Pagotto had not intentionally discharged his weapon, the entire presentation of the case belied that lesser intentional act. Indeed, had the State itself believed that Sergeant Pagotto had intentionally fired his weapon, Sergeant Pagotto would have also been charged with murder rather than just with manslaughter. It would be hard even to concoct a manslaughter theory on these facts based on the intentional firing of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Had the appellant intentionally fired the weapon with the intent to kill Preston Barnes, the State\u2019s theory of the case would have been murder of the specific-intent-to-kill variety. Had the appellant intentionally fired the weapon with the intent only to injure or to incapacitate Preston Barnes, the State\u2019s theory would have been murder of the speeific-intentto-inflict-grievous-bodily-harm variety. Had the appellant intentionally fired the weapon with the intent to intimidate or to frighten the occupants of the Subaru into compliance, the State\u2019s theory would have been murder of the depraved-heart variety.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The State, instead, presented a parade of expert witnesses to testify to the alleged violations of Baltimore City Police Department guidelines. The express purpose in calling those experts was to show that Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s negligence had significantly increased the likelihood that his weapon might go off accidentally. Had the State\u2019s case been predicated on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>theory that Sergeant Pagotto fired intentionally, the testimony of the experts would have been utterly irrelevant. The deliberate pulling of the trigger would not in any way have been dependent upon whether the trigger finger had a moment earlier been slightly closer or slightly further away from the trigger itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The legal sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence, therefore, must be focused exclusively on the proposition that the weapon discharged accidentally because of the grossly negligent way in which Sergeant Pagotto was handling it at the moment of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The Alleged Acts of Gross Criminal Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">To prove its case of gross criminal negligence against Sergeant Pagotto, the State called four expert witnesses. They were 1) Major Francis Melcavage, a former instructor at the Baltimore City Police Training Academy; 2) Sergeant Craig Meier, an instructor with the Firearms Training Unit of the Education and Training Division of the Baltimore City Police Department; 3) Sergeant Timothy Vittetoe, a former instructor at the Maryland State Police Academy; and 4) John L. Meiklejohn, a retired Captain of the Montgomery County Police Department, who had been involved for years in training members of that department.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The defense also called three expert witnesses, including former Baltimore City Police Lieutenant Charles J. Key, a former instructor at the Baltimore City Police Academy and the author of the guidelines allegedly violated by Sergeant Pagotto. Although Lieutenant Key had been interviewed by the State initially, the State declined to call him as its witness. The two other experts called by the defense were 1) Gary McElhennv, a seventeen-year veteran of the Baltimore City Police Department who had spent eight years working in narcotics; and 2) Sergeant Willis Patrick O\u2019Toole, assigned to the Training Division of the Anne Arundel County Police Department and specializing in the subjects of (a) use of force, (b) officer survival, and (c) firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The State\u2019s case with respect to gross negligence consisted of what were essentially three alleged violations of Baltimore City Police guidelines. The State\u2019s theory was that each of the three violations negligently increased the risk that Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s trigger finger might slip from a position where it was not on the trigger into a position on the trigger so that, in the final struggle between Sergeant Pagotto and Preston Barnes, Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s finger ended up in a position where the weapon could accidentally be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">A. <em>The Placement of Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s Trigger Finger:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The first of the alleged guideline violations concerned the placement by Sergeant Pagotto of his trigger finger on his weapon. On the day of the shooting in this case, February 7, 1996, the police department guideline for an officer approaching a suspect with a drawn and loaded weapon was that the officer should have his trigger finger not only outside the trigger guard but literally underneath the trigger guard. The evidence indicated that Sergeant Pagotto properly had his finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard but improperly, in undisputed contravention of the guideline, along the \u201cslide\u201d of the automatic weapon rather than underneath the trigger guard. The slide of a Glock automatic is the side of the weapon encasing the barrel. It is above and might well be forward of the trigger guard area, so that a clutching motion could readily result in the trigger finger\u2019s entering the trigger guard area and coming into contact with the trigger itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Major Melcavage testified that he was the training officer at the Baltimore City Police Academy who personally taught Sergeant Pagotto in the subject of defense tactics when the Sergeant first went through the Academy in 1980. Major Melcavage further explained that in 1980 the service weapons issued to Baltimore City officers were revolvers rather than automatics and that there was, at that time, no training with respect to automatics and where an officer should place his trigger finger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Q: When he was provided that training, where was the training of where to put your finger:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">A: That question was not addressed in training either when he went through the academy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">Q: But what was the general guideline when he got his training?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">A: It wasn\u2019t addressed. I don\u2019t know that there was one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Nothing that Sergeant Pagotto did on February 7, 1996 contravened any training he had received at the Baltimore City Police Training Academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Periodically, however, the guidelines change. For officers who have already gone through the Academy, there is also periodic, albeit minimal, retraining. A guideline was promulgated for the first time with respect to the placement of the trigger finger in 1990, when the police department changed its standard weapon from the revolver to the Clock automatic. The new guideline as of 1990, however, actually authorized the placement of the trigger finger along the \u201cslide.\u201d Major Melcavage testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">Q: ... And where was the training to put your finger, when running and handling a gun and you didn\u2019t want to fire it, before they were put under the trigger guard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\">A: It was to be outside the trigger guard along the slide like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Nothing that Sergeant Pagotto did on February 7, 1996, contravened the guideline promulgated in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">At some time in 1993 or 1994, a newer guideline was promulgated. It was the result of several accidents that had happened at the Baltimore City Police Training Academy. The new guideline was written for the police department by Lieutenant Charles J. Key. It directed that the trigger finger be underneath the trigger guard and not along the \u201cslide\u201d of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Significantly, Captain Meiklejohn testified that Montgomery County officers, unlike their counterparts in Baltimore City, are still trained to keep the trigger finger on the \u201cslide\u201d of the weapon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">Q: ... [Y]ou generally keep your finger on the slide or on the trigger guard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">Q: And that\u2019s different than Baltimore City. Baltimore City trains its police officers to keep its fingers underneath of the guard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">He explained that having the trigger finger below the trigger guard unduly slows down the officer\u2019s reaction time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">Q: Okay. Now, putting one\u2019s finger on the slide or trigger guard for your department deals with the concept that you don\u2019t want the finger on the trigger so you can avoid an accidental shooting, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">Q: And the reason you don\u2019t put it below the trigger guard as Baltimore City does is that it interferes with the reaction time of the police officer. It takes a little longer to raise it to put it in the trigger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">A: That\u2019s possible depending upon the individual, but like you had stated, it\u2019s up to each individual agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">Sergeant Meier also testified for the State as to the guideline with respect to the placement of the trigger finger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">But the finger has to be off the trigger and below the trigger guard until it\u2019s perceived that he\u2019s actually going to have to use the weapon to defend himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-19\">Q: Just to follow up on that. Below the trigger guard, isn\u2019t it a fact that your department is the only department that has that policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-20\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Q: That every other department in the state has either the slide or on top of the trigger guard itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">A: That\u2019s my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Q: And that\u2019s a fairly recent policy, is it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">A: That was created by your expert [to wit, former Lieutenant Charles J. Key, who wrote the new guideline] in 1993.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The questioning on that subject went on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">Q: The State Police do not teach the method that Joe Key created; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">A: As far as I know, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">Q: And Baltimore County does not teach that method, does it? They teach the method that you used to teach up until two and half years ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">A: Three years ago now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Sergeant Vittetoe of the Maryland State Police also testified as to finger placement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">Q: And isn\u2019t it true that the Maryland State Police Department trains their officers to also keep their finger in a ready position along the slide of the gun as opposed to under the trigger guard, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">A: That is correct, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-16\">Q: And it\u2019s after they move from that position on the slide that they can then put it down on the trigger ready to shoot while they are covering the suspect that they are covering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-17\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-18\">Former Lieutenant Key was the author of the new Baltimore City guideline with respect to the placement of the trigger finger under the trigger guard. He explained the reasoning behind the new standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-19\">But the finger, as I wrote the guideline, I think about 1994, it changed over in the lesson plan, is put the finger here, not under here as you\u2019ve seen and there are reasons for that, that you couldn\u2019t [accidentally] shoot the weapon. But I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>wanted the finger up here because it would take a positive movement to move it in the trigger guard. And there is a clutching reaction that occurs with firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Lieutenant Key further pointed out that Baltimore City is the only police agency in the state that has such a guideline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASl\">Q: Now, regarding where his finger was on the gun, can you explain \u2014 first of all, is your guideline the only guideline in the state that has that, that specific guideline at, at the point you showed it [to] the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHtP\">A: The finger underneath or forward of the trigger guard and just underneath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Q: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">A: We are the only agency in the state that has that as a guideline, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">When asked why he thought Sergeant Pagotto had his finger on the \u201cslide\u201d on the evening of February 7, 1996, Lieutenant Key explained that \u201cin 13 years, there\u2019s a factor in skills training. It\u2019s called muscle memory.\u201d He explained \u201cmuscle memory\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">Your body trains itself to do certain things. That applies in this situation because it over the years, and in this case 13 years, your finger is alongside the slide, you cannot eradicate this muscle memory in ... 20 or 30 minutes worth of training. It just won\u2019t happen. He\u2019s going to go back and do what he did in a stress situation, what he\u2019s trained himself to do most frequently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">Q: And in every other department in the State of Maryland, what he did, assuming he had it on the slide, would have been the appropriate standard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">We hold that Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s placement of his trigger finger along the \u201cslide\u201d of his Glock automatic, whether considered alone or in combination with any other factor, does not remotely generate a <em>prima facie </em>case of gross criminal negligence. We are not substituting our weighing of the evidence.for that of the jury. We are holding, as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of law, that the burden of production as to gross criminal negligence was not satisfied so as even to permit the jury to consider such a charge. Although Sergeant Pagotto may not have followed a recently imposed and geographically unique guideline, his action in that regard was not inherently wrong or of a <em>malum-in-se </em>character.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Had a Maryland State Trooper or a Baltimore County Officer, for instance, ridden along with Sergeant Pagotto on February 7, 1996, and engaged in precisely the same conduct that Sergeant Pagotto did, that State Trooper or County Officer would have been acting with complete propriety with respect to the placement of the trigger finger on a weapon. Had Sergeant Pagotto himself placed his trigger finger on the \u201cslide\u201d of his weapon on February 7, 1993, instead of on February 7, 1996, he would then have been acting with complete propriety. Except for a criminal violation of a local municipal or county ordinance, precisely the same act under precisely the same circumstances cannot be a crime in Baltimore City but not a crime in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Under the circumstances, no trier of fact could reasonably read into the appellant\u2019s act of placing bis trigger finger where he did any notion of a wanton and reckless disregard of human life or of some gross and outrageous deviation from what reasonable police officers do and are expected to do. If that behavior was negligent, why are we authorizing police officers all over the state to engage with impunity in such negligent conduct? This hypertechnical violation of a departmental guideline clearly does not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">B. <em>The Closing on the Target With Weapon in Hand:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The second alleged violation of a Baltimore City Police Department guideline by Sergeant Pagotto was that he \u201cclosed\u201d on the white Subaru with his gun drawn. Although there was no clear consensus among the State\u2019s experts as to precisely what the forbidden \u201cclosing\u201d radius was, it was universally agreed that \u201cclosing\u201d is a much more restrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>term than \u201capproaching.\u201d From the moment that Sergeant Pagotto alighted from the police vehicle and started walking toward the stopped Subaru, several car lengths ahead, he was approaching the Subaru but he was not yet \u201cclosing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">During that approach, Sergeant Pagotto withdrew his weapon from its holster and held it in his right hand. None of the experts questioned the propriety of that action. Sergeant Meier was clear on that point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">Q: If as he approached that vehicle, when he was ten feet away from the vehicle he felt a threat to himself, number one, <em>I assume you have no problem with him withdrawing his weapon?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">A: <em>No, he\u2019s perfectly justified in doing that.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Lieutenant Meiklejohn agreed, making reference to Montgomery County practice in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">A: It\u2019s under a note. \u201cDisplay of firearms. Firearms may be drawn whenever officers have reason to fear for their safety or the safety of others. Once again, drawing your weapon is <em>not </em>predicated on the type of offense, it\u2019s the threat you perceive. There are no guidelines that specifically outline when you draw your weapon, it is up to you to make that decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">Q: So the drawing of a weapon \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 this policy is a pretty universal policy, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">A: I would say yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">Q: So the drawing of a weapon does not mean that you need probable cause that a felony or a misdemeanor had been committed. It simply means that it is the police officer\u2019s perception that his life is in danger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-14\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">(Emphasis in original). He then made a more specific assessment of Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>[I]n Officer Pagotto\u2019s situation, <em>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with him drawing his weapon when he draws it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Lieutenant Key was also of the opinion that Sergeant Pagotto had acted reasonably in drawing his weapon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">A: Yes, sir, <em>the unholstering the weapon was reasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">Q: Would <em>you </em>cover the basis for that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">A: The basis for that opinion is the time of night; the type of, the type of crime that occurs in this area; Sgt. Pagotto\u2019s perception that the driver in this ear to shoulder movement was reaching for a weapon; the potential for the persons in that car to be involved in other crimes, a stolen car or the drugs. All of that is\u2014 it would be reasonable and consistent with his training in order to draw his weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\"><em>Q: But he didn\u2019t see a weapon. </em>Would that, <em>would that factor into it?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">A: <em>Absolutely does not factor into it. </em>The, the instruction to officers in drawing their, their weapon is that if they have a reasonable belief that theirs or someone else\u2019s life is in danger. <em>If we had an instruction that said you may not draw a weapon unless you see a weapon, then you\u2019re going to get a lot of police officers shot or killed because they cannot react quickly enough </em>to a threat to be able to draw, to be able <em>to draw their weapon after they have already seen the weapon. By then, it\u2019s too late.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">Major Melcavage placed the encounter in perspective when he explained that the automobile stop (along with responding to a domestic violence call) is one of the two most dangerous situations in which police officers find themselves:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The Witness: It is a situation that a police officer has very-little control over right from the beginning. You don\u2019t have full view of the subject that you are approaching, you don\u2019t know if weapons are in the vehicle, you don\u2019t know if the person in the vehicle is hiding something. It was an action that was initiated by the officer. All of those factors make it a dangerous situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The distance from the target at which approaching becomes \u201cclosing\u201d was variously given as somewhere between six and ten feet. Whatever the distance, the generating principle is that an officer should not, with a drawn weapon, get so close to a suspect that the suspect might be able suddenly to wrench the weapon from the exclusive control of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">For purposes of assessing the special <em>mens rea </em>of involuntary manslaughter, it must be noted that this particular guideline, as part of the larger subject known as DEFENSE TACTICS, is quintessentially designed for the protection of the officer himself. While it is true a struggle over a weapon could also incidentally lead to the inadvertent injury of the suspect or an innocent third person, the self-preservation of the officer is the energizing <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>behind this particular tactic and, indeed, behind the whole course in defense tactics. As the State\u2019s experts repeatedly emphasized, an officer who in the course of his duties overrides this guideline is risking his own life.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Although Sergeant Vittetoe characterized Sergeant Pagotto as \u201creckless\u201d in drawing his weapon in the first instance, his concern was that Sergeant Pagotto was thereby being reckless primarily about his own safety and secondarily about that of his fellow officer and of \u201cany citizens ... not related to that incident.\u201d He did not include a non-compliant or aggressive suspect within the protective compass of the policy or guideline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">[S]ometime during [his] exiting his vehicle and approaching the suspect\u2019s vehicle, or Preston Barnes\u2019 vehicle, he had taken his gun out. To me that is reckless because if this is not a routine or unknown risk traffic stop, Sergeant Pagotto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>should have never left his vehicle or the area surrounding his vehicle. <em>The reason I say that, he does that for his protection, for Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s protection, </em>he uses that vehicle as kind of a barrier between him and the vehicle in which he is dealing with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\"><em>His responsibility </em>at that point in time <em>should have been for his protection, the protection of his fellow police officer, Sergeant Wagner, and any citizens or civilians not related to this incident, </em>period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Sergeant Meier placed the critical distance at ten feet but also described the danger of moving closer as a danger to the officer himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">A: We teach closing as coming into an area where you are limiting your reaction time. We teach keep a distance of at least ten feet from a suspect when you have your weapon in your hand. <em>Anything closer puts you in jeopardy. It cuts your reaction time down.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Major Melcavage estimated the critical radius to be no more than five or six feet. He also testified, however, that although \u201cclosing\u201d within that radius might be tactically \u201cinadvisable,\u201d it would not constitute a violation of any policy or guideline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgJR\">Q: [H]ow close do you get when it is considered closing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANg\">A: I have never considered that question before. Certainly <em>you would need enough distance so that if someone were to pull a weapon, you would be able to react, </em>gain cover if you needed to, five or six feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">Q: Five or six feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">A: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">Q: So it would be in your mind a violation of a policy or guideline to come within five or six feet of a subject with your gun drawn if you suspected they had a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>A: I don\u2019t think that policy has even been delineated. <em>I wouldn\u2019t say it was a violation of policy, I would say it was probably inadvisable action.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">Q: <em>Well, but there is a policy that you are familiar with that you should not close with your weapon in your hand, right? Isn\u2019t that what you are saying?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">A: <em>No, not that I am aware of.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">Q: All right. <em>So you can close with a weapon in your hand?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">A: <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">Q: And closing would be coming up and putting the person under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">A: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">Lieutenant Key, the author of the \u201cclosing\u201d guideline, did not believe that Sergeant Pagotto was acting unreasonably when he violated it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-14\">Q: Okay. Do you, do you have an opinion as to whether or not Stephen Pagotto on February the 7 th, 1996, was reasonable despite the fact the guidelines were violated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">A: As far as to the closing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">Q: As far as the closing is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-17\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-18\">He explained the reasoning behind his conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-19\">Q: Okay. Give us the basis of your opinion that the closing in this case was reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-20\">A: Well, <em>it\u2019s a guideline. Guidelines are discretionary to some degree. </em>The officer has a reasonable perception that his life was in danger. Every circumstance or every situation is evaluated differently. <em>He did not abide by the guideline, but in this circumstance </em>the immediacy of the situation from the perception of a reasonable officer, which is the standard that I used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>evaluate the \u2014 a police-involved shooting, <em>was reasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">Q: <em>So, you\u2019re saying he, he did what a reasonable police officer would do under the same or similar circumstances </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">A: <em>Yes, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Lieutenant Key raised the additional issue that the entire guideline about \u201cclosing\u201d actually applies to a distinct situation \u2014 when the officer is holding an arrestee or a stoppee at bay \u2014 and does not really pertain to the situation in which Sergeant Pagotto found himself on February 7,1996:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">Q: He received your training?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">Q: In conformance with these guidelines?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">A: I trained the officers in conformance with the guidelines, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">Q: And you trained them not to close with a gun in their hand within 10 feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">A: Well, <em>actually, that section </em>\u2014 the section <em>applies to a situation where they\u2019re holding someone at bay. </em>That is one of the sections and one of the things in there. <em>It\u2019s confronting an individual. It really is not the case at hand.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">It bears noting, moreover, that the specific danger this guideline is designed to guard against never came to pass. Preston Barnes never grabbed Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s weapon nor wrestled with the Sergeant for the control of it. What Barnes did, rather, was to drive the automobile he was controlling into Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body and particularly into the arm that was holding the weapon. In the last analysis, Barnes \u201cclosed\u201d on the gun rather than <em>vice versa. </em>The harm that the guideline was designed to prevent never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Even assuming that \u201cclosing\u201d to within a few feet of Preston Barnes constituted ordinary civil negligence, there was nothing in the appellant\u2019s behavior to suggest \u201ca wanton and reckless disregard for human life.\u201d He approached an inherently dangerous confrontation with his weapon in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Hindsight, indeed, revealed that Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s suspicions and fears were well-grounded. Although Sergeant Pagotto did not know it at the time, Preston Barnes was almost certainly committing a felony in his presence \u2014 the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. Rather than risk a violation of probation, Preston Barnes was poised, just as the Sergeant drew near, to initiate a high-speed getaway, wantonly running down Sergeant Pagotto in the process if need be. If in a stress-laden situation and for his own self-protection Sergeant Pagotto violated a departmental guideline, he did not thereby commit an act of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">C. <em>The So-Called Vehicular Extrication:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The State\u2019s third alleged violation of a Baltimore City Police Department guideline is its theory that Sergeant Pagotto, as some sort of \u201cRambo\u201d or one-man army, deliberately kept his gun in his right hand and, with his left hand alone, initiated the opening of the door of the Subaru and then attempted a one-armed \u201cvehicular extrication,\u201d to wit, a dragging of Preston Barnes out of the automobile. The assistant state\u2019s attorney characterized the defendant as a self-styled Superman.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The only witness to any direct physical contact between Sergeant Pagotto and Preston Barnes, however, was Sergeant Pagotto himself. Neither Damien Jackson nor Ali Austin testified to any touching, let alone struggling, between Pagotto and Barnes. Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s version of the struggle is neither the best State\u2019s version nor the best defendant\u2019s version of the evidence. It is the only version we have. He described how, just as he \u201cgot to about the back door on the driver\u2019s side,\u201d the front door suddenly \u201csprung open.\u201d His only thought was that he \u201cwas going to be shot.\u201d His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>instinctive reaction was to go \u201ctowards the driver.\u201d He testified that \u201c[i]t was the best plan of attack ... to go in and get ahold of him\u201d and that \u201c[yjears of experience, and all the time in a possible ambush situation, I was always trained to go into the ambush.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Sergeant Pagotto testified that it is particularly dangerous for an officer to be facing a partially open car door. That configuration gives the person on the inside both concealment and the advantage of a narrow gun port or avenue of fire while affording the person on the outside a minimal window of opportunity through which to take effective countermeasures. In such a situation, the officer has to get the door either closed or opened wider. As a purely defensive reaction, Sergeant Pagotto opted to pull the door further open and then to grab for Barnes\u2019s arm. That widening of the already opened breach may have been the action observed by Jackson and Austin although they did not see Sergeant Pagotto reach in.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The expert assessment of the appellant\u2019s testimony about that final encounter was minimal. Major Melcavage explained the training that is given with respect to vehicular extrication in the abstract. He testified that he did not \u201cteach firearms\u201d and that his course on defense tactics was concerned with \u201cmostly unarmed techniques.\u201d He pointed out that \u201cthe subjects that I basically taught, the defense tactics program, ... was all hand to hand.\u201d It was in that context that he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">Q: As part of the defense tactics, were there any control tactics as part of your teaching that would involve the use of a single hand or one hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">A: No, sir, <em>all the techniques I taught required two hands.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">Q: And why was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">A: You can\u2019t effectively gain control of an individual with just one hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">(Emphasis supplied). Major Melcavage elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">Q: And the weapon is not supposed to be part of that equation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">Q: If you have a gun in your hand, and you intend to remove a driver from a vehicle through the use of a control tactic, what should you do with that weapon? A: You would have to holster the weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Q: And why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">A: Because you need two hands to gain control of an individual or to apply a technique as taught at the academy as I taught.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Major Melcavage further acknowledged that in the twenty-week programs given to police recruits, such as the one Sergeant Pagotto took in 1980, a single three-hour class is spent on vehicular extrication and then, in subsequent retraining programs, the subject is \u201cnever touched upon again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Sergeant Vittetoe was critical of Sergeant Pagotto for attempting to control Barnes \u201cwith one hand and with a gun in the other.\u201d He elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">And this is for a reason. <em>First of all, it\u2019s difficult to control somebody with one hand. </em>You don\u2019t know of their physical size, strength, abilities, or anything else, and it generally requires two hands. Also, for the protection of the firearm, the firearm, once you take it out and you are dealing with a suspect, a driver, in this case Preston Barnes, <em>you don\u2019t want to present that gun to that person because that weapon can now be used against you.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Sergeant Vittetoe acknowledged, however, that the Maryland State Police had permitted State Troopers to grab persons they were attempting to arrest with one hand even while holding a gun, ready to shoot, in the other hand until approximately 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">The testimony of both Major Melcavage and Sergeant Vittetoe dealt with the subject of vehicular extrication as an abstract academic or training exercise. Self-evidently, one can wrestle with an opponent more effectively with two hands than with one. That\u2019s the school solution. They analyzed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>problem as if Sergeant Pagotto had moved forward <em>ab initio </em>with a pre-formed and deliberate plan to perform a one-armed vehicular extrication. Their opinions had no pertinence to an instinctive, split-second reaction, actual or hypothetical, where the right hand is already holding a weapon and where a car door suddenly opens, a foot or two away, in front of one\u2019s face. The instantaneous reaction either to \u201cmove into the ambush\u201d or to attempt to retreat to the cover of the police cruiser is something that is not concerned with the schoolroom paradigm of a model vehicular extrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Lieutenant Key placed Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s instinctive reaction, when suddenly faced with a partially opened car door and the fear of being shot, in a less abstract perspective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">Q: Well, do you have an opinion as to Steve Pagotto reholstering his weapon as he got closer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">Q: And what is that opinion? Could he have done that? Should he have done that? Explain, explain it to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">A: <em>His not reholstering </em>\u2014 it\u2019s <em>not a question should he or could he, it\u2019s a question of whether it\u2019s reasonable. His not reholstering in this instance was reasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">Q: <em>And why is that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">A: There are two reasons. One, <em>the immediacy or the potential of the person being armed inside the car. That\u2019s first and foremost because it\u2019s his life that he\u2019s trying to protect.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The appellant\u2019s version of this part of the encounter does not permit a finding that the Baltimore City Police Department guideline as to vehicular extrication had been violated. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that there had been a violation, however, that would be, at most, a <em>prima facie </em>case of ordinary civil negligence. Assuming that this is a case in which an officer might be civilly liable for negligence, there was insufficient evidence of the type of wanton and abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>indifference to human life required to meet the incremental burden of production that must be satisfied before a jury can consider the issue of gross criminal negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">D. <em>The Unfeasability of a Mass Police Response:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">A sub-theme running through the testimony of several of the State\u2019s experts was that even if Sergeant Pagotto could not be faulted for his conduct once he was involved in a close one-on-one confrontation, he was at fault for allowing the one-on-one confrontation to develop in the first instance. The expert opinion was that once Sergeant Pagotto had some reason to believe that the white Subaru might be stolen or some reason to believe that the occupants of the white Subaru might be armed, he should have been more circumspect than he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Several of the experts testified that he should have remained behind the door of his police cruiser, using it as a shield, while he radioed his dispatcher and requested additional backup units. There was even the suggestion that he could have requested one of the two police helicopters in case the white Subaru attempted a getaway.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The State was not entitled as a matter of law to rely upon the suggestion that Sergeant Pagotto should have summoned the police reinforcements necessary to treat the stop in this case as a \u201cfelony stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">It was Lieutenant Key who placed in perspective just what a felony stop would entail and why the stop in this case could not possibly be justified as a felony stop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\"><em>[I]t was a traffic violation. The reasonable suspicion that there are other activities will not, in itself, justify a felony car stop. </em>There is no probable cause to believe that a felony was being committed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In a felony car stop, if you go through the procedures, you get people out, you put them on the ground, you put their hands on their head, they\u2019re laying out in the street. You have to have traffic stops. You have to have more than one car. <em>It\u2019s actually two cars, and sometimes three cars, involved in it. </em>You go through this whole process, bring them back, frisk them one at a time. The process takes 35 or 40 minutes. We have thousands of cars recovered\u2014 stolen cars recovered in the City of Baltimore every year. Overwhelmingly, the majority of them are unauthorized use. That\u2019s what they\u2019re charged with in the end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">Q: Is that a felony or misdemeanor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">A: That\u2019s a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">Q: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">A: And <em>if we had a felony car stop every time the cop believed that somebody was inside that might be armed </em>or a threat to his safety, <em>ive don\u2019t have enough police to be able to conduct felony car stops. </em>This is a violent, urban community in places in the City of Baltimore and the cops have to deal with it like that. It\u2019s not like being on the roads in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The recommended response testified to by the State\u2019s experts ignored the fact that the city-wide gun recovery program had gun recovery units operating throughout the city on a daily and nightly basis. Every stop of an automobile by a gun recovery unit necessarily involved a suspicion by the officers that the occupants of the automobile might well be armed. The occupants of the automobile fit the profile of those who were more likely than others to be in possession of guns or they would never have been stopped in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The gun recovery effort relied upon, as a key technique, pretextual stops for traffic violations in order 1) sometimes to frisk the occupants, 2) sometimes to spot guns or other evidence of crime in plain view, or 3) sometimes to engage in consensual searches of the automobile and/or its occupants, all as ways of discovering and recovering guns. Whatever the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>real motivation, however, the only constitutional justification remained a traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Without benefit of hindsight, the stop of the white Subaru in this case would have appeared to be no different than the stop of any other automobile by any other gun recovery unit. Many such stops will, by the very nature of things, yield no guns. If in this case, for example, Sergeant Pagotto and Officer Wagner had remained beside their police cruiser holding the occupants of the white Subaru at bay, other police cars had sped to the scene with sirens wailing and dome lights flashing, a helicopter perhaps had hovered overhead, the occupants of the Subaru had been handled as potentially armed and dangerous individuals, and all that had ultimately eventuated was the issuance of a traffic citation for displaying a license tag in the wrong place, the angry community reaction can readily be imagined. If such a scenario were repeated a half-dozen times, outraged demonstrators would besiege City Hall and law suits and requests for injunctions would fill the emotionally charged atmosphere. What the experts in this case suggested, with the benefit of hindsight, was simply not realistic for gun recovery units relying on pretextual traffic stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">If anything on the night of February 7, 1996 was fraught with the danger of ill consequences, it was perhaps the governmental policy itself of relying on pretextual traffic stops for the purpose of taking guns off the street, a policy of confronting a grave on-the-street reality with a relatively feeble rationale. Such a policy, of course, was something decided on at a level far above Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s in the governmental chain of command.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Another obvious flaw in this suggestion is the fact that the Baltimore City Police Department simply does not have the resources to respond massively to every potentially dangerous stop by a gun recovery unit. What the experts suggest that Sergeant Pagotto should have done was simply not a viable alternative. <em>A fortiori, </em>his disinclination to pursue a non-viable alternative was, as a matter of law, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>evidence of a felonious <em>mens rea </em>and the charge of manslaughter should not, therefore, have gone to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">E. <em>The Legal Significance of Not Following a Guideline:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">All of the testimony of all of the experts, save one, made no mention of a key link in the chain of logic that was an indispensable but unspoken part of the State\u2019s case. Even granting, <em>arguendo, </em>the failure of an officer to follow a departmental guideline, what is the significance of such a failure? The missing premise was vital to the validity of the State\u2019s ultimate syllogism of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The only witness to testify with respect to the significance of the Baltimore City Police Department guidelines was former Lieutenant Charles J. Key. He was called, to be sure, as a defense witness and his testimony, therefore, does not literally qualify as part of that version of the evidence most favorable to the State\u2019s case. In any meaningful discussion of the legal sufficiency of the evidence in this case, however, his testimony \u2014 in strictly legal terms and not in any terms of competing credibilities or the weighing of evidence \u2014 cannot be ignored. He was the author of the critical guidelines in issue and the only expert witness to testify with respect to their significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Lieutenant Key is a twenty-six-year veteran of the Baltimore City Police Department, having served as a supervisor for twenty-one of those twenty-six years. On the subject of the use of firearms, he had received certification from Northwestern University. He has been a consultant on the subject to both the Baltimore City Police Department and various outside agencies. He had taught the use of force to thousands of police officers and to over a thousand prosecuting attorneys \u2014 United States Attorneys, State Assistant Attorneys General, and local State\u2019s Attorneys and District Attorneys. He had done over five hundred evaluations of officer conduct in police-involved shootings and had personally \u201cresponded to over 100 police shootings.\u201d He was a State\u2019s witness before the Grand Jury in this case. The State subsequently made the tactical decision, however, not to call him as a trial witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>With respect to his authorship of the guidelines in this case, Lieutenant Key testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">Q: And can you <em>explain </em>to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury <em>your experience in police policy, training and procedures?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">A: As I said, I was a supervisor for 21 years. I have written in that time \u2014 I have no idea how many memorandums. <em>I\u2019ve written specifically </em>the general order on hostage rescue/hostage barricade situations; <em>the use of force general order, the new use of force general order, the sections pertaining to lethal force; the training guidelines on use of force; a dozen or so lesson plans on use of force, officer survival; </em>a number of other memorandums for the agency, <em>in addition </em>to which <em>I wrote the state regulations for firearms for the Maryland Police Training Commission which were adopted into law by the Maryland Police Training Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">Q: I\u2019m going to show you what\u2019s been marked as Exhibit Number 26, called \u201cGuidelines, Use of Force.\u201d Did you write these?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">A: For the sake of brevity, it looks like it\u2019s complete, and <em>these are the ones that I wrote, yes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The specific guidelines that were central to the State\u2019s case were those involving the \u201cuse of force.\u201d Lieutenant Key was not only the author of those guidelines, both in their original version and in the 1993-94 revision, but had testified in a number of courts as an expert witness on the subject of \u201cuse of force\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">Q: Okay. Could you <em>explain </em>to the ladies and gentlemen <em>what use of force means </em>and, and how that \u2014 what your expertise in that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">A: I\u2019ve been qualified in probably 10, 11 courts, in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City in use of force. Also, the District Court for Rockbridge County, Virginia. The subject <em>im\u00f3lves-although I\u2019ve been qualified both </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>as an expert in police and civilian use of force, generally first self-defense issues, those issues involving specifically, in this case, police officers, what goes into the circumstance of the use of force and what is reasonable and appropriate in the officer\u2019s response to an incident</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Lieutenant Key pointed out that in writing the guidelines, the general orders, and the lesson plans with respect to the use of firearms, he took a number of factors into consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">Q: Let\u2019s talk about guidelines for a moment. <em>Explain </em>to the jury <em>the different elements you considered when you wrote training guidelines, lesson plans, general orders, and the state regulation pertinent to the firearms training.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">A: The writing of guidelines for police officers has to take in that whole body of information that the officer needs to function on the street. Involved in that is law, specific regulation, the officer survival concepts that we\u2019ve heard discussed over the period of time of this trial. So that <em>when the guideline comes out, it has to recognize certain bodi.es of information, some of which are regulatory, some of which are guides.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">He further explained the differences that separate a law from a regulation and a regulation from a guideline and the fact that even the violation of a regulation would only subject the violator to administrative charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">Q: fTjell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury the difference between a guideline, a law, a regulation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">A: Well, the laws, of course, are the laws that we all have to abide by. Police officers are not exempt from that. There is a body of law involving police officer use of force that gets involved in the regulation. Those are absolutes. The regulation is an absolute....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>When asked what the sanction would be for violating a regulation, Lieutenant Key responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">A: Then he could be subject to administrative charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">Q: Not criminal charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Lieutenant Key then contrasted a guideline with a regulation and testified specifically with respect to State\u2019s Exhibit No. 26, which was a nine-page set of guidelines governing the use of deadly force that had been published in May of 1995 and had been written by Lieutenant Key himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">A: <em>The guideline is created to guide the officers. It\u2019s exactly what it says it is, a guide. It\u2019s discretionary to some extent and within the policy. </em>Specifically to these guidelines, I incorporated them by reference into general order having to do with use of force for the purpose of the agency being able to determine what they wanted the officer to do by being able to bring administrative charges against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">Q: When you say \u201cguidelines,\u201d are you referring to what\u2019s been previously marked as Defense Exhibit \u2014 State\u2019s Exhibit Number 26?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">A: Yes, sir, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">Q: <em>And is it your testimony [that] these guidelines were not written as </em>law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-13\">A: <em>No, sir, they are not.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">Lieutenant Key testified that the \u201cregulation\u201d applicable to Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s conduct on the night of February 7, 1996 was that he report to the Homicide Squad. Lieutenant Key, who responded to the shooting of Preston Barnes that night, further testified that Sergeant Pagotto fully complied with any applicable regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-16\">Q: Did Sgt. Pagotto abide by Department regulations on the night of February the 7th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-17\">A: Yes, sir, he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Lieutenant Key further distinguished between failures to follow a guideline which related to training (and would indicate that some retraining is required) and policy violations. He testified further that the alleged guideline violations at issue in this case, even if they occurred, were in no event policy violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">Q: [T]he ones we\u2019re talking about here were all discretionary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">A: Yes, sir, they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">Q: They were not policy violations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">In terms of the significance and the gravity of any arguable violation of a departmental guideline by Sergeant Pagotto, Lieutenant Key\u2019s testimony as to that significance was the only evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\"><em>State v. Albrecht </em>Distinguished</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">In arguing for legal sufficiency, the State relies heavily on <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>836 Md. 475, 649 A.2d 336 (1994), and there are, indeed, surface similarities between that case and this. In that case, a Montgomery County police officer was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and of two counts of reckless endangerment when the shotgun he was holding accidentally discharged, killing Rebecca Garnett and endangering several others. On closer inspection, however, that case is not at all dispositive of this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Before turning to five distinctions which we believe to be critical, we note, in passing, two other lesser differences between the two cases. Because <em>Albrecht </em>was a court trial rather than a jury trial, there was at the end of the case no formal analysis of the burden of production <em>per se. </em>Unlike the situation where the judge, as legal referee, must make a deliberate decision to submit the case to a fact-finding jury, the judge in a non-jury case tends to glide almost subconsciously from his role as legal referee into his very different role as fact finder with little or no pause to mark the transition. Although, to be sure, appellate review of the two trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>modes involves the same measure of legal sufficiency, the <em>Albrecht </em>opinion nonetheless had little occasion to analyze the burden of production as such. <em>Albrecht </em>held that the evidence, if given maximum weight, would support the verdicts. It had no occasion to ask whether the fact finder should have engaged in the weighing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">A factual difference between the two cases is that the physical confrontation in <em>Albrecht </em>took place in daylight, at 7 P.M. in late May, in the presence of a number of witnesses out on the street and surrounding sidewalks at that hour. The confrontation in this case took place in the dark, at 8:30 P.M. on an icy February night, on an apparently deserted street.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In addition to these lesser distinctions, the Court of Appeals in <em>Albrecht </em>found of express significance five factors that differ dramatically from the corresponding factors in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">A. A Shotgun Versus a Handgun:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Much mention was made in the <em>Albrecht </em>opinion of the fact that the officer there unlimbered a shotgun instead of a handgun and of the heightened justification required before making such a deliberate choice of a weapon. \u201c[W]e find that there was sufficient evidence presented from which the trial court could have concluded that Albrecht was both grossly negligent and reckless in failing to exercise the extreme caution that he was required to exercise in the handling and the use of his shotgun.\u201d 336 Md. at 486, 649 A.2d 336. \u201cAccording to Muelenhort, an officer\u2019s shotgun is considered the \u2018ultimate weapon to utilize\u2019 and constitutes the highest level of force that an officer may use to respond to a particular situation.\u201d 336 Md. at 490, 649 A.2d 336. \u201c[T]he officer must be able to articulate a clear and present danger to himself or others before the shotgun may be used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cMcNally stated that the shotgun is \u2018more of an offensive weapon\u2019 than a handgun because the shotgun discharges \u2018multiple projectiles,\u2019 creating \u2018a better chance of the officer hitting whatever it is he\u2019s intending on shooting at.\u2019 \u201d 336 Md. at 492, 649 A.2d 336. \u201cFormer Sergeant Raymond Griffin ... stated that the shot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>gun is a \u2018particularly dangerous weapon\u2019 which \u2018creates a pattern of destruction\u2019 when used, and that an officer must exercise \u2018extreme caution\u2019 in the use of that weapon.\u201d 336 Md. at 493-94, 649 A.2d 336. In our case, by contrast, Sergeant Pagotto was carrying only a standard handgun and not a shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">B. <em>The Placement of the Trigger Finger:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">More than on any other single factor, the <em>Albrecht </em>decision relied on the fact that the officer\u2019s finger was literally on the trigger, enhancing thereby the risk of accidental discharge. \u201cWe find that the evidence was sufficient to establish that ... Albrecht took substantial steps to use deadly force against her \u2014 to wit, racking his shotgun and aiming it, <em>with his finger on the trigger, </em>at Garnett.\u201d 336 Md. at 486, 649 A.2d 336 (emphasis supplied). \u201cMcNally further testified that police candidates were instructed that an officer\u2019s trigger finger should be kept on the trigger guard and away from the trigger.\u201d 336 Md. at 492, 649 A.2d 336. \u201c[Griffin] testified that an officer should not place his finger on the shotgun\u2019s trigger unless and until the officer believes that he may have to shoot the suspect.\u201d 336 Md. at 494, 649 A.2d 336. Officer Albrecht, indeed, testified that his finger was on the trigger. 336 Md. at 497, 649 A.2d 336. The final holding was that the evidence permitted a finding that the officer brought his gun to bear on the victim <em>\u201cwith his finger on the </em>trigger336 Md. at 505, 649 A.2d 336 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In the present case, Sergeant Pagotto testified that his finger was never intentionally on the trigger and no witness offered any testimony to the contrary. As a matter of physics, on the other hand, there is a logical inference that the finger must have been on the trigger at the moment it was fired. Whether it was there at some time prior to the Sergeant\u2019s apparent clutching motion as he was pushed to the ground, however, is pure speculation. In marked contrast to <em>Albrecht, </em>the only direct evidence was that his finger was outside the trigger guard, although admittedly along the slide of the weapon rather than literally underneath the trigger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>guard. Lieutenant Meiklejohn, the Director of Training for the Montgomery County Police Department and also a key expert witness in the <em>Albrecht </em>case, testified that Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s placement of his finger along the slide of the automatic would have been an authorized action in Montgomery County and, indeed, in every jurisdiction in Maryland except for Baltimore City. The importance of this is that for a common law felony such as manslaughter, the quality of gross criminal negligence has to be something inherently dangerous, something of a <em>malum in se </em>character, rather than a mere <em>malum-prohibitum-type </em>of regulatory violation that may vary from year to year and from county to county. The placement of the trigger finger in <em>Albrecht </em>was generally, if not universally, prohibited; the placement of the trigger finger in this case was almost universally accepted. It is obviously not deemed to be an <em>inherently </em>reckless and wanton and thereby criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">C. <em>The Aiming of the Weapon at the Victim:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In <em>Albrecht, </em>the officer enhanced the danger to the victim by deliberately fixing the victim in his gunsights. \u201cWitnesses at the scene testified that Albrecht, looking down the barrel of the gun, aimed his shotgun directly at Garnett.\u201d 386 Md. at 481, 649 A.2d 336. \u201cAlbrecht testified that he kept his shotgun pointed at Garnett.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAlbrecht was steadily holding the. shotgun and directly aiming it at Garnett at the time that the weapon discharged.\u201d 336 Md. at 482, 649 A.2d 336. \u201cAlbrecht took substantial steps to use deadly force against her \u2014 to wit, racking his shotgun and aiming it ... at Garnett.\u201d 336 Md. at 486, 649 A.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Although Damien Jackson and Ali Austin testified that the appellant had earlier pointed his weapon at Preston Barnes through the open driver\u2019s door, the only testimony with respect to the gun after the Subaru began to move was that Sergeant Pagotto was not aiming his weapon at Preston Barnes when it discharged and that the gun only went off after Barnes drove the Subaru into Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body causing his gun hand to crash into the left rear window. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>trajectory of the fatal bullet, through the rear window rather than through the open front door, bears that out.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">D. <em>The Status of the Victim </em>As <em>One No Longer Posing a Threat:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">It was important to the <em>Albrecht </em>decision that Rebecca Garnett, at whom the shotgun was aimed with a finger on the trigger, no longer posed any threat to the officer who had her in his gunsight. \u201cAlbrecht ... decided that she did not pose any danger to him\u201d and \u201ccheck[ed] off Garnett as a threat.\u201d 336 Md. at 481, 649 A.2d 336. \u201cWe find that the evidence was sufficient to establish that ... Rebecca Garnett did not pose any danger to either Albrecht himself or to third parties.\u201d 336 Md. at 486, 649 A.2d 336. \u201cAlbrecht admitted ... that he did not feel threatened by Rebecca Garnett.\u201d 336 Md. at 495, 649 A.2d 336. \u201cAlbrecht repeatedly testified that ... he had \u2018checked her off,\u2019 and that \u2018she was the least of his worries.\u2019 \u201d 336 Md. at 496, 649 A.2d 336. The final holding was that the evidence supported the conclusion that the officer was unreasonable in bringing the shotgun to bear \u201con an unarmed individual who did not present a threat.\u201d 336 Md. at 505, 649 A.2d 336. Rebecca Garnett was standing still, some distance away from the car, with her hands in full view holding a bag of potato chips.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Preston Barnes, by contrast, posed a continuing threat to Sergeant Pagotto. From the outset, Sergeant Pagotto feared that Barnes might be armed. Barnes was inside the car, making suspicious motions, and his hands were not in view. In no conceivable way had Preston Barnes, unlike Rebecca Garnett, been eliminated as a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">E. <em>Compliance With Police Commands:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In the <em>Albrecht </em>case, Rebecca Garnett and the two others who had been with her were fully complying with the police commands at the moment the shotgun discharged. The fact-finding judge referred to \u201cthe lack of threats posed by the suspects, <em>given their essential compliance </em>with [the officer\u2019s] shouted commands.\u201d 336 Md. at 484, 649 A.2d 336 (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>supplied). Albrecht himself testified, \u201cI was thinking to myself, \u2018Okay. <em>She has </em>complied.\u2019 \u201d 336 Md. at 497, 649 A.2d 336 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In diametric contrast, Preston Barnes aggressively resisted rather than complied with the lawful police commands. Instead of stopping the car when he was lawfully ordered to do so, he deliberately allowed it to continue to drift. Instead of putting on the emergency brake and placing his hands on the dashboard when he was lawfully directed to do so, he argued with Sergeant Pagotto, protesting that he had not done anything wrong. When Sergeant Pagotto opened the door wider and reached inside the Subaru, Barnes presumed to struggle with him instead of doing what he was ordered to do. We know, moreover, that Barnes\u2019s tactical plan all along had been to make a sudden vehicular getaway from the scene of his detention. Immediately before Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s weapon went off, Preston Barnes deliberately \u201crevved up\u201d the motor and turned the car into Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body as the car began to accelerate. Far from complying, Preston Barnes was literally assaulting Sergeant Pagotto, with an automobile as the weapon, at the moment the gun went off.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">F. <em>Conclusion:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">This case, key factor by key factor, is the diametric opposite of <em>Albrecht </em>The contrast, moreover, highlights the deficiency of the evidence of gross negligence in this case. Even in <em>Albrecht </em>the evidence was close. Here, it did not get close.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The <em>Mens Rea </em>of Reckless Endangerment Is No Less Than the <em>Mens Rea </em>of Gross-Negligence Manslaughter</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Sergeant Pagotto was convicted, under two separate counts, of the reckless endangerment of both Damien Jackson and Ali Austin as well as of the involuntary manslaughter of Preston Barnes. A single set of facts, a single state of mind on Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s part served as the predicate for all three convictions. Our review of the legal sufficiency of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>dence, therefore, is effectively reduced from three reviews to a single review.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The crime of Reckless Endangerment was created by Ch. 969 of the Acts of 1989 and is now codified as Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-2. Section 12A-2(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">(a) <em>Creation of substantial risk of death or serious physical injury; penalties. </em>\u2014 (1) Any person who recklessly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person is guilty of the misdemeanor of reckless endangerment and on conviction is subject to a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than 5 years or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">As Judge Bishop pointed out for this Court in <em>Minor v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 305, 314-15, 583 A.2d 1102 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>326 Md. 436, 605 A.2d 138 (1992), the language of the new Maryland statute employs substantially the language of \u00a7 211.2 of the Model Penal Code. Although Maryland has not adopted the Model Penal Code itself or its definition of \u201creckless,\u201d a part of that definition, contained in \u00a7 2.02(2)(c), was tracked, almost word for word, by the Court of Appeals in <em>Minor v. State, </em>326 Md. 436, 443, 605 A.2d 138 (1992). Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 2.02 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1985), defines \u201crecklessly\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves <em>a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe </em>in the actor\u2019s situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">In <em>Minor v. State, </em>326 Md. at 443, 605 A.2d 138, Chief Judge Murphy set out the test for recklessness in this state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ6\">The test is whether the appellant\u2019s misconduct, viewed objectively, was so reckless as to constitute <em>a gross depar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>ture from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe, </em>and thereby create the substantial risk that the statute was designed to punish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 649 A.2d 336, the Court of Appeals essentially treated the <em>mens rea </em>of reckless endangerment and the <em>mens rea </em>of involuntary manslaughter as a single and indistinguishable phenomenon. It set its mission of reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">As Judge Messitte noted, the \u201coverriding question\u201d in this case was whether Albrecht\u2019s conduct constituted a \u201cgross and wanton deviation from reasonable conduct\u201d such as would support convictions of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment. As such, the evidence presented at trial, both in the form of documentary and testimonial evidence, focused upon the issue of whether Albrecht had acted as a reasonable police officer under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdB\">336 Md. at 486-87, 649 A.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">In <em>Williams v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 468, 474, 641 A.2d 990 (1994), we essentially treated <em>mentes rei </em>of the respective crimes as one and the same:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">The state of mind of recklessness, in the context of reckless endangerment as well as in other criminal contexts such as depraved heart murder and possibly grossly negligent manslaughter, is variously described as <em>an attitude wherein the criminal agent, </em>conscious of the life-endangering risk involved, <em>nonetheless acts with a conscious disregard of or wanton indifference to the consequences.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Although it is not necessary to decide in this case, it is conceivable that, in terms of the consciousness of risk, there is a slightly heavier content to the <em>mens rea </em>of reckless endangerment than there is to the <em>mens rea </em>of gross-negligence manslaughter. This is a very real possibility because reckless endangerment is probably the inchoate form of depraved-heart murder as surely as it is the inchoate form of gross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>negligence manslaughter. The consciousness of risk, however, is not a factor in this case. One thing that is sure is that the <em>mens rea </em>of gross-negligence manslaughter is the minimal content of the <em>mens rea </em>of reckless endangerment. If, therefore, the evidence in this case is not legally sufficient to support a conviction for involuntary manslaughter, as we hold it is not, it is <em>ipso facto </em>legally insufficient to support the convictions for reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The Burden of Production Beyond Mere Negligence: The Manslaughter Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We turn our attention to the <em>mens rea </em>of involuntary manslaughter. Evidence of some negligence does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>satisfy the production burden with respect to gross criminal negligence and it is not permissible to delegate the ultimate decision in that regard to the unreviewable weighing process of the jury. The legal control gate is in place for the precise purpose of limiting the evidence of negligence that may be weighed by the fact finders as a predicate for possible criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>206 Md. 49, 109 A.2d 909 (1954), two children were killed by a truck driven by Thomas allegedly \u201cin a grossly negligent manner.\u201d A Montgomery County trial judge, sitting without a jury, found Thomas guilty of two separate counts of automobile manslaughter. After equating statutory gross negligence with common law gross negligence, 206 Md. at 51, 109 A.2d 909, Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e observed that the evidence could have supported a finding of some negligence in three separate regards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">This rather full review of the evidence shows that there were only three factors from which gross negligence might be deduced: (1) excessive speed; (2) defective brakes; and (3) intoxication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">206 Md. at 55, 109 A.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">With respect to the possibility that Thomas was violating the speed limit, the Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[i]f it was exceeded, it was not greatly exceeded.\u201d 206 Md. at 55-56,109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>A.2d 909. Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e noted that the trial judge seemed to have inferred that there was some negligence but not gross negligence. Significantly, the Court of Appeals, reviewing the evidence as a matter of law, concluded that there was no legally sufficient evidence of gross negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APs\">Though the comments of the learned trial judge at the conclusion of the testimony indicate that <em>he considered the speed at that point greater than it should have been and, we infer, negligent, </em>he did not, as we read his comments, find it such as to indicate gross negligence. Neither do we.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">206 Md. at 56, 109 A.2d 909 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">With respect to the possible finding that Thomas continued to drive the truck even with the knowledge that the brakes were defective, the Court of Appeals concluded that such conduct, even if ill-advised, was not legally sufficient to permit a finding of a \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atu\">In this Court, the State seeks to establish negligence on the part of the appellant because he continued to operate the truck despite his knowledge that the brakes were defective____Even if the contention made by the State in this Court is open to it, <em>we think the evidence is insufficient to support a charge of gross negligence against the appellant. </em>He duly and promptly reported the unsatisfactory condition of the brakes to his superior after they had supposedly been repaired, and he was ordered to go on using the truck until it could be spared for further repairs. <em>The defects in the brakes do not appear to have been so great or of such a nature as to indicate that the continued operation of the truck would amount to \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">206 Md. at 56,109 A.2d 909 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">It was the evidence of intoxication that the fact finder found weighty enough to constitute gross criminal negligence. The fatal accident occurred at 3:30 P.M. The undisputed evidence showed that the nineteen-year-old driver had consumed six bottles of beer that day, two of which were consumed a few minutes before the occurrence of the accident. The Montgomery County detective who first arrived at the accident scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>smelled alcohol on Thomas\u2019s breath. Notwithstanding such evidence and the significance given to it by the fact finder, the Court of Appeals held that the evidence of intoxication was not legally sufficient to have permitted a finding that Thomas was guilty of gross negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">In our opinion, the evidence with regard to intoxication was not sufficient to warrant a finding that the appellant was guilty of gross negligence within the established meaning of the statute in operating the truck at the time of the occurrence of the tragic accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">206 Md. at 57-58, 109 A.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>213 Md. 527, 132 A.2d 853 (1957), a Baltimore City judge, in a non-jury case, found the appellant guilty of automobile manslaughter primarily on the basis of excessive speed. There was also evidence from the investigating officer that the appellant \u201chad an odor of alcohol on his breath.\u201d The version of the evidence most favorable to the State was that the appellant was operating his vehicle on a Baltimore City street at \u201cabout 60 miles per hour.\u201d Because the street was in a commercial area and because the time was almost 2 A.M., however, the Court of Appeals, speaking through Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, held that the speeding, even though enough to establish civil negligence, was not legally sufficient to permit a finding of gross negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\"><em>His speed may well have been such as to establish ordinary negligence </em>for which he would be liable in a civil suit, <em>but that is not the test under our manslaughter statute, </em>which imposes a penalty <em>only for gross </em>negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">213 Md. at 532, 132 A.2d 853 (emphasis supplied). The Court of Appeals went on to point out that even evidence of negligent conduct does not necessarily permit a finding that it \u201camounted] to criminal indifference to consequences\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\"><em>The speed </em>that was indulged in, at the time and in the place, in the case at bar <em>is not such that amounts to criminal indifference to consequences.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">213 Md. at 534, 132 A.2d 853 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">In <em>Plummer v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 244, 702 A.2d 453 (1997), a Montgomery County jury found the appellant guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>manslaughter by automobile. Although the evidence permitted a finding that the appellant was operating his vehicle slightly in excess of the thirty-miles-per-hour speed limit, that was clearly not the basis for the jury\u2019s verdict. The accident occurred at 2:30 in the afternoon as the twelve-year-old victim was walking home from school. The appellant\u2019s vehicle, apparently because of the appellant\u2019s inattention, drifted to the right and proceeded up onto the sidewalk where it struck the victim from the rear. A witness, driving behind the appellant, saw the appellant beginning to drift and blew his horn and flashed his high-beams in an effort to get his attention. After the accident, the appellant fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">After a thorough analysis of the case law distinguishing ordinary civil negligence from gross criminal negligence, Judge Thieme observed with respect to the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">There is little doubt in our minds that <em>the actions of the appellant </em>on 22 December 1995 <em>were reprehensible, immoral, and callous. We can think of many other terms to describe the appellant </em>for being directly responsible for the death of a twelve-year-old girl as she strolled home from school ... <em>\u201cMurderer, </em>\u201d <em>however, is not one of those terms.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsX\">118 Md.App. at 254, 702 A.2d 453 (footnote omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The State argued that because the appellant was driving through a school zone, he had a heightened duty to maintain a proper lookout. In holding that the evidence was not legally sufficient to have permitted the trial judge to submit the manslaughter charge to the jury, the Court of Special Appeals rejected that contention by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">The State relies heavily on the fact that the accident occurred in a school zone and that the appellant, because he failed to maintain a proper lookout in such an area, was therefore grossly negligent. We disagree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">118 Md.App. at 267, 702 A.2d 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The Court of Special Appeals also held that evidence that the appellant fled the scene was not a sufficient predicate for a finding of gross criminal negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>It is also uncontested that the appellant fled the scene after the accident. Granted, flight is a factor to consider, but given the fact that the only evidence of irregular driving was the appellant\u2019s brief drift to the shoulder and the curb, <em>flight from, the scene cannot support a finding of gross negligence.... [T]he appellant\u2019s choice not to stop and render aid, while morally inexcusable, may have amounted to no more than the manifestation of his oim fright and disbelief. We do not think that such flight, </em>under the circumstances, <em>demonstrates that the appellant cared so little about what he had done as to render him grossly negligent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">118 Md.App. at 268, 702 A.2d 453 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The appellant was unquestionably negligent and that negligence resulted in \u201csheer tragedy.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals nonetheless reversed the conviction and held that the negligence was not of such an \u201cextraordinary or outrageous character\u201d as to have permitted the jury to speculate on whether it constituted manslaughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">The reason for the appellant\u2019s departure from the travel portion of the roadway is and forever will be unknown. He may have dozed off at the wheel; he may have been changing the radio station; he may have been reading directions; he may have spotted something across the street that caught his attention. <em>That he should have paid 100% attention to the roadway in front of him is without question. </em>Nevertheless, <em>his brief lack of attention, even though it resulted in sheer tragedy, was not of such \u201cextraordinary or outrageous character\u201d as to rise to the level of gross negligence capable of sustaining a conviction for automobile manslaughter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">118 Md.App. at 269, 702 A.2d 453 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">It is the lesson of <em>Thomas v. State, Johnson v. State, </em>and <em>Plummer v. State </em>that it is no adequate answer to say that the jury heard both the State\u2019s position and the defendant\u2019s position and then, properly instructed, rendered its verdict. It must also be determined as a matter of law, first by the trial judge and then by the appellate court, whether the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>threshold was crossed so as to permit the jury to consider a verdict of possible criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The Burden of Production Beyond Mere Negligence: The Punitive Damage Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">With respect to that special quality of wantonness and abandon that may transform a negligent tort into a negligent crime, we need not look to the manslaughter cases alone. Precisely the same standard of gross negligence is also an integral part of Maryland tort law, as the minimal mental state that will permit the awarding of punitive damages. The employment of the same gross negligence standard is appropriate because an award for punitive damages in a tort case and a criminal prosecution share the common denominator purpose of DETERRING negligence of \u201can extraordinary or outrageous character\u201d that manifests a \u201cwanton or reckless disregard of human life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">It was the landmark opinion of Judge Levine for the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith v. Gray Concrete Pipe Co., </em>267 Md. 149, 168, 297 A.2d 721 (1972), that first established the absolute equivalency of gross negligence in the context of automobile manslaughter prosecutions and gross negligence as the necessary minimal condition for an award of punitive damages in tort actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">We regard a \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life\u201d in the operation of a motor vehicle, with the known dangers and risks attendant to such conduct, as the legal equivalent of malice. It is a standard which, although stopping just short of wilful or intentional injury, contemplates conduct which is of an extraordinary or outrageous character. Yet, it is both a functional and definitive test which, as we have noted, enjoys the virtue of having been frequently applied in this state. And if, as a test, it has been regarded as adequately stringent to serve as a basis for possible imprisonment, then, surely, there appears to be no valid reason for deeming it too liberal for imposing civil sanctions. We hold that it is the standard by which claims for exemplary damages arising out of motor vehicle operation are to be tested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The eighteen-year-old driver of a truck in the accident that caused the death of a minor 1) undertook to operate the truck without having first inspected it to determine its mechanical condition; 2) failed, when the hood flew up, to pull the truck to the side of the roadway and instead pulled it into the center lane of a 70-miles-per-hour interstate highway; and 3) knew or should have known that the truck a) was precariously loaded, b) was impossible to control in excess of 50 miles per hour, c) was in violation of many requirements of law, and d) had a hood that was precariously fastened and might come undone at any time. 267 Md. at 170-71, 297 A.2d 721. The Court of Appeals held that that \u201c[e]onstitut[ed] sufficient negligence to support a claim for compensatory damages\u201d but did not represent \u201ca wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">With respect to the claim against Edwards in count four, <em>we are of the view that said conduct, although constituting sufficient negligence to support a claim for compensatory damages, does not mount up to \u201ca wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u201d </em>Simply stated, there is absent the \u201cextraordinary or outrageous\u201d conduct on Edwards\u2019 part which we have said must attend the operation of a motor vehicle in order to sustain a claim for exemplary damages. What plaintiffs allege is a breach of duty by Edwards in operating a truck without being assured of its condition, and a failure to respond correctly to the emergency confronting him when the hood flew up. The <em>failure to respond properly under exigent circumstances underscores the very distinction we make between a situation reflecting \u201cmere\u201d negligence, for which compensatory damages are available, and that which we say may entitle an injured party to exemplary damages.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">267 Md. at 171, 297 A.2d 721 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The trucking company, on the other hand, charged with the negligent entrustment of the truck to the driver was held to have been grossly negligent and was ordered to pay punitive damages. The thing that distinguished the case against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>driver from the case against the trucking company was the presence versus the absence of \u201cthe pressures of a highway crisis.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">The salient feature of the case at bar is that the conduct of Gray which subjects it to possible exemplary damages did not occur under <em>the pressures of a highway crisis, </em>where <em>what might superficially appear to be caused by \u201cextraordinary or outrageous conduct\u201d could be merely the result of poor judgment exercised under such circumstances.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">267 Md. at 172, 297 A.2d 721 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In <em>Medina v.

This Court distinguished ordinary negligence from gross negligence, affirmed a $400,000 award for compensatory damages, and reversed a $300,000 award for punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\"><em>It is clear that the actions of appellants amounted to negligence </em>but ... we must decide whether that is \u201can aggravated form of negligence, differing in quality rather than in degree from ordinary lack of care\u201d and is \u201cmore than any mere mistake resulting in inexperience, excitement, or confusion ...; more than mere thoughtlessness or inadvertence, or simple inattention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">The quantity of the negligence in this case does not change the quality of that negligence so that it becomes different from ordinary lack of care. <em>We hold that the conduct of appellants in this case, while clearly negligent, was not so extraordinary or outrageous as to raise that conduct to the qualitative level necessary to establish a foundation for the award of punitive damages.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">62 Md.App. at 251-52, 489 A.2d 35 (citation omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">In <em>Nast v. Lockett, </em>312 Md. 343, 351, 539 A.2d 1113 (1988), Judge Orth reaffirmed that the test for gross negligence is the same in a manslaughter prosecution and in a tort claim for punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\n<em>[T]he test in a civil automobile accident action for the submission of the award of punitive damages to the trier of fact is the same as the test in a criminal prosecution of manslaughter by automobile for the submission of the question of the guilt of the accused to the trier of fact.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUE\">(Emphasis supplied). Judge Orth also reaffirmed that the test for gross negligence is a stringent one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\"><em>Only conduct that is of an extraordinary or outrageous character will be sufficient </em>to imply this state of mind.... <em>Simple negligence will not be sufficient </em>\u2014 even reckless driving may not be enough. It is not reckless driving that allows punitive damages; it is the reckless disregard for human life. <em>Reckless driving may be a strong indicator, but unless it is of an extraordinary or outrageous character, it will ordinarily not be sufficient.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">312 Md. at 352, 539 A.2d 1113 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">With respect to one of the drivers charged with negligence, the Court of Appeals held, 312 Md. at 366, 539 A.2d 1113, that evidence of driving under the influence of alcohol (but short of intoxication) and evidence of several traffic law violations were not enough to require submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">[T]he evidence as to Lockett was legally sufficient to establish that she was driving while under the influence of alcohol, but was not legally sufficient to show that she was intoxicated. <em>The degree of her impairment, </em>not having reached the level of intoxication, <em>would not, without more, be sufficient to elevate her simple negligence to gross negligence.

In certain instances, a governmental employee performing a discretionary function in a non-malicious way who would otherwise enjoy immunity could lose that immunity if his conduct involved gross negligence. Those cases are particularly pertinent to the case <em>sub judice </em>because they involve dangerous and clearly negligent actions by law enforcement officers and other governmental personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Section 19-103(b) of the Transportation Article confers immunity on operators of emergency vehicles for ordinary negligence but does not confer immunity if the operator, <em>inter alia, </em>was guilty of gross negligence. <em>Boyer v. State, </em>323 Md. 558, 594 A.2d 121 (1991), was a case in which two persons were killed after being hit by a drunken driver involved in a high-speed chase with the State Police. A State Trooper was charged with gross negligence for having engaged in a seven-mile chase with a drunken driver through heavy traffic and numerous intersections at speeds that were at times in excess of 100 miles per hour. It was also charged that the State Trooper failed to \u201cactivate immediately all of the emergency equipment on his police car.\u201d The trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of the State Trooper. After a thoroughly analyzed review of the gross negligence standard, Judge Eldridge affirmed that grant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we nevertheless hold that <em>Trooper Titus\u2019s alleged conduct did not amount to gross negligence as a matter of law. The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations </em>that Trooper Titus drove at high speeds on a road congested with traffic in an attempt to apprehend a suspected intoxicated driver <em>do not indicate that he acted with wanton or reckless disregard for the safety of others. </em>Although the complaint states that Trooper Titus did not \u201cimmediately\u201d activate his emergency equipment and violated police procedures, these somewhat vague allegations do not support the conclusion that he acted with gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">323 Md. at 580, 594 A.2d 121 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. In <em>Khawaja v. City of Rockville, </em>89 Md.App. 314, 598 A.2d 489 (1991), the plaintiffs were badly injured in a collision with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>a police cruiser driven by a sergeant of the Montgomery County Police Department. It was alleged that the sergeant, in responding to an emergency call, deliberately failed to activate the cruiser\u2019s siren and ran a red light through an intersection with the victim\u2019s automobile in view. After an extensive review of the case law on gross negligence in both the governmental immunity cases and the punitive damage cases, this Court affirmed the trial judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaint because \u201cthese facts do not set forth a cause of action in gross negligence.\u201d 89 Md.App. at 318, 598 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In <em>Wells v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 693, 642 A.2d 879 (1994), employees of the State Department of Human Resources and the Baltimore City Department of Social Services were charged with gross negligence by omission in failing to take steps to correct an egregious case of child abuse. The opinion for this Court by Chief Judge Wilner affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that although the allegations suggested ordinary negligence, they did not spell out a case of gross negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\"><em>These allegations, taken in a light most favorable to appellants, suggest individual negligence and bureaucratic mismanagement and incompetence; </em>they suggest a critically important governmental unit not properly doing its job because of underfunding, understaffing, lack of effective leadership and supervision, lack of training, and lack of clear procedures and protocols. <em>They do not indicate, however, malice, evil intention, or wanton, wilful, or reckless disregard for human life or the rights of others. In short, they do not allege gross negligence </em>on the part of any of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">100 Md.App. at 705-06, 642 A.2d 879 (emphasis supplied). <em>See also Foor v.

All of the governmental immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ty cases discussed and all of the punitive damages cases discussed make it clear that a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence is not, <em>ipso facto, </em>a <em>prima facie </em>case of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The Persuasive Authority of the Civil Rights Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">This case is unusual in that it involves <em>a criminal prosecution </em>of a police officer for the involuntary manslaughter of a civilian. Where a police officer in the course of his duties shoots and wounds or shoots and kills a civilian, such a case, in recent decades, typically has resulted in a suit, federal or state, charging a violation of the victim\u2019s civil rights, frequently under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The claim is typically that the officer is guilty of the violation by virtue of having unreasonably used excessive force. Our case also involves the allegedly unreasonable use of excessive force. It involves the allegedly negligent and unreasonable creation of an enhanced risk that excessive force will accidentally be unleashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">These \u00a7 1983 cases provide a helpful benchmark for measuring the case now before us, for it is in the context of \u00a7 1983 civil rights claims that most of the case law with respect to the alleged use of excessive force by a police officer is to be found. There are not many manslaughter cases brought against police officers and we must look, therefore, to the \u00a7 1983 cases to see how other courts are handling this situation. The prevailing standard of objective reasonableness used in measuring \u00a7 1983 claims, moreover, is clearly apposite to the case before us, for it overlaps, though it is less demanding than, the standard of wanton and reckless disregard of human life necessary for a manslaughter conviction. While some police actions that might be deemed unreasonable in the \u00a7 1983 context may still fall short of the standard of gross criminal negligence, the converse is not true. A police action deemed to be reasonable in the \u00a7 1983 context could clearly not be the basis for a finding of gross criminal negligence on the part of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The landmark case establishing the standard for measuring claims that an officer used excessive force is <em>Graham v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). The standard is that of objective reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court stated that standard, 490 U.S. at 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\"><em>[A]U </em>claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force \u2014 deadly or not \u2014 in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other \u201cseizure\u201d of a free citizen should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its \u201creasonableness\u201d standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">(Emphasis in original). The Supreme Court, moreover, articulated the appreciation of the stress of combat-like conditions that should illuminate the assessment of the reasonableness of the officer in using force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">With respect to a claim of excessive force, the same standard of reasonableness at the moment applies: \u201cNot every push or shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge\u2019s chambers,\u201d violates the Fourth amendment. <em>The calcrdus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments </em>\u2014 in <em>circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving </em>\u2014 about <em>the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">490 U.S. at 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (citation omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The Supreme Court also noted that among the circumstances bearing on the reasonableness of the use of force, significant questions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and <em>whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (emphasis supplied). In this case, Preston Barnes was \u201cactively resisting arrest\u201d and was \u201cattempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">The decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>Greenidge v. Ruffin, </em>927 F.2d 789 (1991), is amazingly parallel to the case now before us. In that case, Baltimore City Police Officer Ernestine Ruffin, working for the Vice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Squad, observed a woman believed to be a prostitute entering a vehicle with a man on the evening Of May 12, 1988. But for the guideline dealing with the placement of a trigger finger under the trigger guard, Officer Ruffin in 1988 would have been operating under essentially the same guidelines that applied to Sergeant Pagotto in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Officer Ruffin was in plain clothes and in an unmarked vehicle. She followed the suspect car until it stopped. She approached the car and observed an illegal sex act in progress. The Fourth Circuit, 927 F.2d at 790, described what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">With her police badge hanging from her neck, <em>Ruffin opened the door of the car with her left hand, </em>identified herself as a police officer, and ordered the two passengers to place their hands in view. When neither complied, <em>Ruffin pointed the drawn revolver in her right hand into the vehicle </em>and repeated the order. Ruffin then observed appellate Leonard Greenidge reach for a long cylindrical object from behind the seat, which she believed to be a shotgun (the object later turned out to be a wooden nightstick). Ruffin fired her weapon at Greenidge. The bullet struck him in the jaw and lodged near the spinal cord, causing permanent injury. Greenidge now slurs his speech, limps and is unable to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The \u00a7 1983 suit charged Officer Ruffin with the unreasonable use of excessive force. For a mere sexual offense, a Baltimore City policewoman opened a car door with her left hand and then reached into the car with a loaded revolver in her right hand. The jury nonetheless found in favor of Officer Ruffin. The plaintiffs primary contention before the Fourth Circuit was that District Court Judge Motz had erroneously precluded him from introducing evidence of Officer Ruffin\u2019s \u201cconduct leading up to the time immediately before the arrest.\u201d The plaintiff argued, as the State did in this case, that the officer\u2019s antecedent violations of various police procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>were \u201can important part of the reasonableness inquiry.\u201d The Fourth Circuit summarized the plaintiffs contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\"><em>The police officer allegedly violated standard police procedure </em>for night time prostitution arrests by not employing proper backup and not using a flashlight. <em>Appellant asserts that these facts are probative to the reasonableness inquiry because the appellee recklessly created a dangerous situation during the arrest.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">927 F.2d at 791 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In almost <em>verbatim </em>terms, the State in this case claims that Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s alleged violations of \u201cstandard police procedures ... recklessly created a dangerous situation.\u201d Although Officer Ruffin\u2019s alleged violations of standard police procedure might have created, or at least contributed to, a dangerous situation, the Fourth Circuit affirmed Judge Motz\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs reaching for a long cylindrical object created a supervening reality and that the antecedent actions by the officer, even if violations of standard police procedure, were immaterial and, therefore, inadmissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">In light of ... the Supreme Court\u2019s focus on the very moment when the officer makes the \u201csplit-second judgments,\u201d we are persuaded that <em>events which occurred before Officer Ruffin opened the car door and identified herself to the passengers are not probative of the reasonableness of Ruffin\u2019s decision to fire the shot.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">927 F.2d at 792 (emphasis supplied). By parity of reasoning, Preston Barnes\u2019s decision to flee the scene was a supervening reality causing the accidental discharge of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">In <em>Drewitt v. Pratt, </em>999 F.2d 774 (4th Cir.1993), a Norfolk, Virginia police officer was working, during his off-duty hours, as a part-time security guard for a local Pizza Hut. When he observed a car being driven in a reckless manner, <em>he ran toward the vehicle with his service revolver drawn. </em>He was not in uniform at the time and did not display his police badge, which he carried in his pocket. The vehicle came to a stop. As the officer crossed in front of it to approach the driver\u2019s side, the vehicle\u2019s headlights came on and the vehicle moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>toward the officer. He fired one shot through the windshield of the car and then, as he fell from the hood of the car in the direction of its left front fender, a second bullet was accidentally discharged. Both hit the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In affirming the decision of the District Court judge to dismiss the complaint against the officer, the Fourth Circuit noted that while the officer\u2019s \u201cfailure to display his badge while attempting to execute a warrantless misdemeanor arrest ... may have violated Virginia statutory law,\u201d it was immaterial to the assessment of his later decision to fire his weapon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ach\">[T]he failure of Officer Pratt to display his badge when announcing himself as a police officer and demanding Drewitt to stop his vehicle is irrelevant to the issue of whether at the moment of the shooting Officer Pratt had probable cause to believe that Drewitt posed a threat of death or serious bodily harm to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">999 F.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In <em>Elliott v. Leavitt, </em>99 F.3d 640 (4th Cir.1996), two Northern Virginia police officers arrested a motorist for drunken driving. They handcuffed him and conducted a cursory search for weapons before seating him in his automobile. They subsequently observed that he had managed, despite the handcuffs, to get control of a small handgun which he at that moment was pointing at the officers. They fired twenty-two bullets into him, killing him. In the \u00a7 1983 suit brought by the parents of the young man, the District Court judge ruled that the officers had been guilty of using \u201cexcessive force in the course of arresting Elliott for driving while intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The Fourth Circuit reversed that decision, commenting that the \u201cConstitution simply does not require police to gamble with their lives in the face of the serious threat of harm.\u201d 99 F.3d at 641. The Fourth Circuit also rejected the plaintiffs contention that the cursory nature of the initial search of the arrestee contributed to the dangerous condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">Appellees make much of the fact that Leavitt searched Elliott only cursorily before placing him in the car. <em>Even assuming Leavitt should have conducted a more intensive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>search, this issue is irrelevant to the excessive force inquiry. As </em>we noted in <em>Greenidge, Graham requires us to focus on the moment force was used; conduct prior to that moment is not relevant in determining whether an officer used reasonable force.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">99 F.3d at 643 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>Young v. Killeen, </em>775 F.2d 1349 (5th Cir.1985), the plaintiff made the same argument that the State is making in this case. The \u00a7 1983 suit there was brought by the widow, after Officer Kenneth Olson shot and killed David Young on June 7, 1981. Young, with a friend, had driven to a parking lot where they bought marijuana from a pedestrian. The officer subsequently attempted to block Young\u2019s car by pulling his police vehicle in front of it. Officer Olson left his car and ordered Young and the passenger out of theirs. When Young apparently reached down toward the seat or toward the floor board, Officer Olson believed that Young was going for a gun. Officer Olson fired his weapon and the shot was fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The District Court judge found that Officer Olson had acted unreasonably and was responsible for the death of David Young. He based that finding on <em>a number of violations of police procedure </em>on the part of Olson that the judge believed <em>created a greater danger of a fatal error. </em>The Fifth Circuit summarized the finding of the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\"><em>The district judge, </em>relying on the testimony of an expert witness on police procedure, <em>found that Olson acted negligently and contrary to good police procedure </em>in the following respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">(1) failure to use his radio;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">(2) failure to utilize a back-up unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">(3) dangerous placement of his patrol car in a \u201ccut off\u201d maneuver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">(4) ordering the two men to exit their car rather than issuing an immobilization command to remain in the car with their hands in plain view;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>(5) increasing the risk of an incident by having two suspects getting out of the car;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">(6) abandoning a covered position and advancing into the open, where the odds of overreacting would be greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\"><em>The judge concluded that Olson\u2019s fault in this respect </em>not only placed Olson in a position of greater danger but also <em>imperiled Young by creating a situation where a fatal error was likely.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">775 F.2d at 1350 (emphasis supplied). The Fifth Circuit opinion again set out the reasoning of the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A20\">The sense in which he finds excessive force is that <em>the force would have been avoided if Olson had approached Young as required by proper police procedures. ... </em>The court expressly found that the six errors of police procedure enumerated above, \u201cwhen taken together caused the death of David Young.\u201d ... [T]he court said: \u201cWhile all witnesses agreed that at the moment David Young made a sudden movement Olson was justified in shooting, <em>it would be anomalous indeed to suppose that a police officer may escape liability where the dangerous situation was created entirely by the officer\u2019s disregard of prudent procedure.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcB\">775 F.2d at 1352 (emphasis supplied). The State\u2019s argument here is an echo of what the District Court judge found there\u2014 that \u201cthe dangerous situation was created entirely by [Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s] disregard of prudent procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The Fifth Circuit reversed the District Court\u2019s decision. It held that merely creating a situation where the risk of a fatal accident is enhanced does not constitute the unreasonable use of excessive force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\"><em>The only fault found against Olson was his negligence in creating a situation where the danger of such a mistake would exist. </em>We hold that no right is guaranteed by federal law that one will be free from circumstances where he will be endangered by the misinterpretation of his acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">775 F.2d at 1353 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">In <em>Fraire v. Arlington, </em>957 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir.1992), an Arlington, Texas police officer was dressed in plain clothes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>driving an unmarked car when he observed a pickup truck engaged in a number of acts of reckless driving. On at least three occasions, the officer attempted to get the pickup truck to stop. The pickup truck led the officer through a number of residential neighborhoods, first appearing to stop and then driving off again. Ultimately, the officer was standing in front of the truck and ordering it to stop, when the truck suddenly headed directly toward him. He fired a shot and killed the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The investigation of the Internal Affairs Division of the Arlington Police Department exonerated the officer on the charge of using excessive force. It did state, however, that \u201c[a] review of Officer Lowery\u2019s actions shows no policy violations; <em>however, there were tactical errors that might have possibly affected the outcome of the incident.\u201d </em>957 F.2d at 1272 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The plaintiffs based their case in part on the fact that the officer had not followed correct police procedures and had thereby created the dangerous situation. The opinion of the Fifth Circuit rejected that contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">The Plaintiffs have charged that the force Lowery employed was excessive, <em>at least in part because Lowery may not have followed established police procedures </em>in displaying his badge and identifying himself while in plain clothes. <em>The implication is that Lowery thereby manufactured the circumstances that gave rise to the fatal shooting. </em>We rejected a similar argument in <em>Young. </em>There, the district court found that the officer had acted negligently and contrary to good police procedure... .We found to the contrary, however, that <em>regardless of what had transpired up until the shooting itself, </em>Young\u2019s movements gave the officer reason to believe, at that moment, that there was a threat of physical harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">957 F.2d at 1275-76 (emphasis supplied). \u201cRegardless of what had transpired up until the shooting itself\u2019 in the present case, the calculated decision of Preston Barnes to attempt to flee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>from lawful detention and to drive his car into Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body created a new and overriding reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In all of these cases, the claim that an officer has unreasonably used excessive force must be assessed as of the moment when the force is employed. Antecedent and allegedly negligent acts that may have contributed to the creation of a dangerous situation are not pertinent in evaluating the officer\u2019s state of mind at the critical moment when the gun, for instance, is discharged. In most of the \u00a7 1983 cases reviewed, moreover, the ultimate decision of the officer was intentionally to pull the trigger and intentionally to kill the person the officer believed to be an actual or imminent assailant. In the present case, by contrast, we are dealing with no such intentional shooting or killing. Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s weapon discharged only when the white Subaru was deliberately driven into the Sergeant\u2019s body.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It cannot be that the accidental discharge of a weapon would be deemed more blameworthy than the intentional shooting of the victim. All that the Sergeant\u2019s alleged negligence did was, at most, to bring his body and his hand holding his service weapon into sufficient proximity of the white Subaru so that the white Subaru could more readily be driven into him and it. That is not a criminal <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Legal Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In reaching a final holding with respect to the legal sufficiency of the evidence, it is, of course, required that we take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that version of the evidence most favorable to the State\u2019s case. That version was succinctly summed up by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney in the course of his closing argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">[A] police officer, the Defendant in this case, introduces a loaded, Glock semi-automatic pistol which has no manual safeties. It\u2019s chambered and prepared to be fired as soon as the trigger is pulled. This Defendant introduces this fully loaded weapon with his finger not where he\u2019s trained to have it. He introduces it in a manner contrary to the way he\u2019s been trained to handle it into a situation where it is foreseeable that he may receive resistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">He closes with the gun in his hand with his finger in the wrong place, opens the door to a moving vehicle and attempts to drag the driver of the vehicle out with one hand. Now is anyone here surprised that this weapon discharged under those circumstances? Is anyone here surprised that when the weapon is discharged, being highly dangerous, it struck and killed an individual, in this case Preston Barnes the driver?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">That version of the evidence shows three or four possible deviations from or violations of departmental guidelines of the Baltimore City Police Department. It shows that the actions of Sergeant Pagotto may well have contributed to the creation of a dangerous confrontation between himself and Preston Barnes. It shows what may be a case of actionable civil negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We hold that it does not show, however, such a departure from the norm of reasonable police conduct that it may fairly be characterized as \u201cextraordinary and outrageous.\u201d We hold that it does not show on the part of the law enforcement officer, even if guilty of some negligence in the performance of his duties, a <em>mens rea </em>that qualifies as a \u201cwanton and abandoned disregard of human life.\u201d The burden of production with respect to gross criminal negligence was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Preston Barnes\u2019s Getaway Attempt As An Independent Intervening Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Even though in a criminal case, unlike a tort case, the clear contributory negligence of Preston Barnes may not have been efficacious as a defense, <em>Duren v. State, </em>203 Md. 584, 593-94, 102 A.2d 277 (1954), it is not utterly bereft of significance. The seminal discussion of proximate causation by Rollin Perkins and Ronald Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>(3d ed.1982), pp. 774-825, makes it clear that the negligence of the deceased, which in tort law would be contributory negligence, might well qualify in a criminal case as a superseding or supervening cause of death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">It must not be assumed that negligence of the deceased or of another is to be entirely disregarded. Even though the defendant was criminally negligent in his conduct <em>it is possible for negligence of the deceased </em>or another <em>to intervene between this conduct and the fatal result in such a manner as to constitute a superseding cause, </em>completely eliminating the defendant from the field of proximate causation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Our primary holding in this case is that the evidence was not legally sufficient to permit a finding of such a wanton and reckless disregard of human life on the part of Sergeant Pagotto as to raise what might arguably be ordinary civil negligence to the possible level of that gross criminal negligence necessary to support the conviction for involuntary manslaughter and the convictions for reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">As a completely alternative holding, we also conclude that when Preston Barnes put into motion his predetermined tactic of attempting a vehicular getaway from the detention scene, that criminal act on his part constituted an independent intervening cause that resulted in his own death.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">In terms of the necessity of proving the causative link between a defendant\u2019s gross negligence and the victim\u2019s death, the Maryland manslaughter case of <em>Craig v. State, </em>220 Md. 590, 155 A.2d 684 (1959), is very instructive. The central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>message in <em>Craig </em>is that \u201cin order to sustain a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, the gross and criminal negligence must be the proximate cause of death.\u201d 220 Md. at 597, 155 A.2d 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">A Washington County jury convicted Ollen and Lillian Craig, husband and wife, of the involuntary manslaughter of their six-month-old baby. They were charged with gross negligence in failing to provide necessary medical care over the course of an eighteen-day illness that grew progressively worse and ultimately proved fatal. The cause of death was advanced pneumonia in both lungs. The Washington County medical officer testified that the early use of penicillin alone \u201cwould probably have cured the child\u201d and that if antibiotics had been administered at any time during the first week of the child\u2019s illness, there would have been \u201ca very good chance of recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed the manslaughter conviction. It reasoned that the failure of the parents to obtain medical care for the baby during the early stages of the illness caused the death. It found no evidence, however, to show that the \u201cseriousness of the child\u2019s illness was apparent\u201d to the defendants. Even if they were guilty of ordinary civil negligence at that stage, the Court reasoned, the negligence at that stage was not gross and criminal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">It seems unquestionably true that pneumonia caused the child\u2019s death, and that the deleterious and deadly effects of pneumonia are caused by organisms which, generally, may be controlled if treated by antibiotics in the early stages of the disease. But, in this case, we have no testimony that the seriousness of the child\u2019s illness was apparent to the parents until the last two or three days of the child\u2019s life, when, according to the medical testimony, the antibiotics would probably have been ineffective to save the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">220 Md. at 598, 155 A.2d 684. The Court of Appeals operated on the assumption that the parents were, indeed, guilty of ordinary negligence in failing to obtain care. It could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>characterize that mere negligence, however, as a wanton or reckless disregard for the baby\u2019s life:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\"><em>If we assume that </em>ordinarily careful and prudent parents would have called in medical aid during the initial stages of the child\u2019s illness, and, therefore, <em>the defendants were guilty, at this time, of ordinary negligence </em>in failing to call in a physician, <em>we still find nothing </em>in the testimony <em>that would sustain a finding that </em>during this early period of the child\u2019s illness <em>the parents displayed \u201ca wanton or reckless disregard for\u201d the child\u2019s life.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The Court then took as its working assumption the fact that the seriousness of the child\u2019s illness was so apparent to the parents during the last two or three days of its life that their failure to obtain medical aid at that time did, indeed, constitute gross criminal negligence. The critical question, therefore, became that of whether the gross criminal negligence was the proximate cause of the child\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">[N]o matter how regrettable the child\u2019s death, nor how gross the defendants\u2019 negligence may have been, the defendants cannot be held criminally responsible unless there were a causal connection between their negligence and the death that ensued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The ultimate holding of the Court of Appeals was that the gross negligence was not the proximate cause of death because prompt intervention at that late hour would probably have come too late to save the child\u2019s life:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\"><em>[I]f we assume that </em>the seriousness of the child\u2019s illness was easily discernible to them in the last two or three days of its life, so that <em>their failure, at that time, to call in medical aid did constitute gross negligence, the record fails to disclose that this failure was the proximate cause of the child\u2019s death, </em>because ... the doctors stated that it would then have probably been ineffective to control the disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">220 Md. at 598-99, 155 A.2d 684 (emphasis supplied). On the subject of proximate causation in an involuntary manslaughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>case, <em>see also Palmer v. State, </em>223 Md. 341, 352-53, 164 A.2d 467 (1960). The lesson of <em>Craig v. State </em>is clear that antecedent ordinary negligence does not become gross negligence just because it contributes to a death. It must already be gross before it even enters into the causation equation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In this case, moreover, a dramatic and unforeseen event occurred a critical few seconds before the fatal shot was fired. Although Preston Barnes started to execute his flight plan just a moment or two before Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s gun discharged, the chronological sequence is nonetheless clear that the \u201crevving up\u201d of the motor and the initial acceleration of the Subaru literally preceded the discharge of the weapon, even if but briefly. The State never disputed the testimony of Damien Jackson that he and Preston Barnes had on much earlier occasions discussed the very escape plan that Barnes put into execution on the night of February 7, 1996. It was clear from the testimony of Damien Jackson that even as Sergeant Pagotto was approaching the driver\u2019s door, the gears and brakes and accelerator were in a state of readiness for the sudden activation of the getaway plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Critical to the status of the getaway as an independent intervening cause, however, is the fact that the beginning of the execution of the plan literally have preceded the discharge of the weapon. Even if the jury rejected Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s testimony that his gun went off only when the Subaru crashed into it and his hand hit the left rear window, that version of the evidence given by the State\u2019s witnesses yields the very same sequence of events. Officer Wagner testified that he heard the car start up, that he saw it \u201cstart moving a little quicker,\u201d that he saw Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s \u201cright side ... pressed against the car,\u201d and that he ran back to get the police cruiser before he heard the gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Damien Jackson referred to Preston Barnes\u2019s execution of his escape plan as a case of \u201cpulling off.\u201d His version of events was that Barnes \u201cpulled off\u2019 before the shot was fired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">Q: Now, when you say he pulled off you mean Preston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Q: At the time he pulled off where was the officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">A: Well, the whole time, like I say the car was still drifting, the officer was beside the car still trying to get him to stop it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">Q: Okay. <em>What happened after he pulled off?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">A: <em>I heard a shot.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Ali Austin testified clearly that the Subaru\u2019s engine \u201crevved up\u201d before the fatal shot was fired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">Q: Do you remember hearing the engine rev up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">Q: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">Q: That means that somebody was applying gas to it, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-14\">A: I guess so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">Q: Okay. And <em>that was before the shot?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-16\">A: <em>Before the shot.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-17\">Q: <em>Before you heard the shot you heard the engine rev up?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-18\">A: <em>Yeah, yes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">From the State\u2019s version of the events of February 7, 1996, it is clear that the dominant influence over those events \u2014 the precipitant, the catalyst \u2014 was from start to finish the pervasively criminal behavior of Preston Barnes. From the very moment when his Subaru was directed to pull to the curb, his criminality \u2014 past, present, and future \u2014 controlled the course of those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">His past criminality supplied the purpose and the motive for what ensued. He was still on probation for an earlier drug conviction and a violation of that probation could have meant five years of imprisonment that would have to be served. It was that shadow from the past that triggered Barnes\u2019s first reaction to being stopped, \u201cOh, shit. I\u2019m dirty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>His present criminality, as of the moment of the stop, was not the trivial inconsequence of a license tag violation. Preston Barnes was at that moment in possession of ten bags of cocaine, known as \u201cReady Rock,\u201d which he had picked up from his obvious \u201cstash,\u201d the home of his girlfriend, just a few minutes earlier. From the amount of the drugs and from the fact that he and Damien Jackson had been selling drugs the day before, the clear implication is that Preston Barnes was guilty of the possession of contraband narcotics with the intent to sell in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 286(a)(1). Not even factoring in any possibility of enhanced punishment because of the earlier drug conviction, a violation of \u00a7 286(a)(1) threatened a felony conviction with a maximum sentence of up to twenty years. That present reality precipitated resort to the getaway plan, a few moments in the future, which Barnes and Damien Jackson had discussed off and on over a period of months.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">It was Preston Barnes\u2019s future criminality measured from that moment, the imminent implementation of his getaway plan, that became the independent intervening cause of his own death. He never complied with the repeated orders from Sergeant Pagotto and Officer Wagner to stop the car, to put on the emergency brake, and to put his hands in clear view on the dashboard. The slow forward drift of the Subaru, keeping slightly ahead of Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s approach, was a game of \u201ccat and mouse.\u201d When Sergeant Pagotto reached with his left hand into the passenger compartment, Preston Barnes presumed to struggle with him rather than to comply with a lawful command.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">It was, however, the acceleration of the vehicle and its leftward movement into Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body that became the ultimate precipitating event. That Preston Barnes may at that moment have been guilty of the common law misdemean- or of resisting arrest is beside the point. He was at that moment perpetrating other and more serious crimes. One of them, the driving (even by way of sideswiping) of 2,500 pounds of metal into Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body was, <em>inter alia, </em>a clear case of reckless endangerment in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 12A-2(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The leftward movement of the Subaru that knocked Sergeant Pagotto to the roadbed, as testified to not only by the Sergeant but also by Officer Wagner, was no mere common law assault and battery. Still on the books on February 7, 1996 was Art. 27, \u00a7 386, which in pertinent part provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3-\"><em>If any person ... shall assault or beat </em>any person ... <em>with intent to prevent the lawful </em>apprehension or <em>detainer </em>of any party <em>for any offense for which the same party may be legally </em>apprehended or <em>detained, </em>every such offender ... shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">At the very moment the gun went off, Preston Barnes was committing an assault with the intent to prevent his own lawful detention. That statutory felony, originally enacted in 1853, carried a maximum sentence of fifteen years and remained on the books until the recodified assault provisions took effect on October 1, 1996. Ironically, if, as the Subaru was pushing into him, Sergeant Pagotto had actually shot with the intent to kill, he might still have had a plausible case of justifiable self-defense. <em>See Drewitt v. Pratt, </em>999 F.2d 774 (4th Cir.1993) and <em>Fraire v. Arlington, </em>957 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir.1992), both discussed <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The crashing of the Barnes-driven automobile into the Sergeant\u2019s gun hand was an unforeseen and intervening event that took on a causative life of its own. <em>Owens v.

Alternatively, we hold that the evidence was not legally sufficient to permit a finding that any action of the appellant, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>assumed to have been grossly negligent, was the proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s death and that the charge of manslaughter, therefore, should not have been submitted to the jury.

Despite an apparent contradiction, the two versions of the critical events may not actually be contradictory with respect to who opened the door. Sergeant Pagotto testified that it was the driver, Preston Barnes, who initially opened the door but only to a width of approximately six inches. Fearing a weapon, Sergeant Pagotto then responded by pushing the door further open so that he could grab Barnes\u2019s arm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">A: The car door was originally opened approximately six inches. I reached in with my forearm pushing the car door open farther and grabbed onto him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">Q: Who initially opened the car door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">A: The driver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">It may have been not the initial opening but Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s responsive widening of the opening that caught the attention of Jackson and Austin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\">. Chapters 372 and 373 of the Acts of 1997, however, upgraded the status of manslaughter by automobile, Article 27, \u00a7 388, back to the level of a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\">. The testimony revealed that in Baltimore City, unlike most other Maryland jurisdictions, the police are not permitted, except in cases of certain dangerous felonies, to engage in a vehicular chase of fleeing suspects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">. In saying that the car was \"deliberately\u201d driven into Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body, we are not saying that Preston Barnes\u2019s primary purpose or motive was to ram the automobile into the Sergeant. Barnes\u2019s undisputed primary purpose or motive was to make a vehicular getaway from the scene. A parked car blocked forward movement in the parking lane. The getaway, therefore, necessarily involved leftward lateral movement into the traveled southbound lane. From the hand-to-hand contact between them, Barnes either knew or should have known that the automotive force of the leftward lateral movement would have the inevitable effect of pushing Sergeant Pagotto\u2019s body out of the way. It is in this sense that we say that the car deliberately hit him. He was deliberately hit (sideswiped) because he was in the way.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
