Ethel Watson died on March 7, 1995, and John Watson died on December 10, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">On December 28, 1992, the Watsons\u2019 home health aide, Barbara Dower, was injured when she slipped on ice on the exterior steps of the Watsons\u2019 home while getting medicine for Mrs. Watson. Ms. Dower filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cWCC\u201d) against the Watsons and the Uninsured Employers Fund, alleging that she was the Watsons\u2019 employee and entitled to recover for any injury suffered in the course of the employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Notified of Ms. Dower\u2019s claim, appellant denied coverage, informing the Watsons by letter that \u201cYou have Medical Payment coverage under your Homeowner\u2019s policy that applies to bodily injury to others but it excludes a person eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>to receive benefits required to be provided under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation. Since Ms. Dower was employed by you, this coverage would not be available to her.\u201d The Watsons informed appellant that, in their view, (1) Ms. Dower was an independent contractor, and therefore not subject to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusion, and (2) Ms. Dower was also covered under the policy as a \u201cresidence employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The WCC conducted a hearing on April 26, 1994, at which the Watsons were represented by an attorney at their own expense. On May 27, 1994, the WCC released its finding that Ms. Dower was an independent contractor and not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Maryland law. Ms. Dower appealed the WCC\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on June 3, 1994. On December 2, 1994, Ms. Dower also filed a separate negligence suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Watsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Ethel Watson died on March 7, 1995. Appellant notified John Watson that, pursuant to the personal liability section of the Watsons\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy, it would appoint an attorney to represent Mr. Watson in the negligence suit, but it would not represent Mr. Watson\u2019s interests in Ms. Dower\u2019s appeal of the WCC\u2019s decision because the homeowner\u2019s policy did not cover that issue. John Watson died on December 10, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In January 1996, the circuit court ruled in Ms. Dower\u2019s favor in her appeal of the WCC\u2019s decision, finding that she was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the Watsons did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance, Ms. Dower collected her benefits from the Maryland Uninsured Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund and dismissed her negligence suit against the Watsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Appellee, on behalf of the Watsons\u2019 estates, filed a complaint against appellant to recoup the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in opposing Ms. Dower\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation action and included a motion for summary judgment. Appellee claimed that appellant\u2019s duty to defend was triggered by the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of a \u201cpotentiality for coverage.\u201d Appellant filed an answer and a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it had no obligation to defend the Watsons in the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings because the homeowner\u2019s policy excluded any potentiality of coverage for workers\u2019 compensation liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">After a hearing on February 25, 1998, the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and awarded appellee $3,475.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees related to the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings and $2,500 in attorneys\u2019 fees for the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Appellant presents one question for our review, which we have condensed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">1. Did the circuit court err by granting appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">Because we answer in the affirmative, we shall reverse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ADo\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">When granting a motion for summary judgment, a trial court makes rulings as a matter of law, resolving no disputed issues of fact. <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp., et al. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990) (citations omitted); Maryland Rule 2-501. The standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Heat &amp; Power, </em>320 Md. at 592, 578 A.2d 1202. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s construction or interpretation of a written contract, we do so as a matter of law. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Promenade Towers Mut. Housing Corp., </em>84 Md.App. 702, 716-717, 581 A.2d 846 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>324 Md. 588, 597 A.2d 1377 (1991). The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based on findings of fact. <em>Heat &amp; Power, </em>320 Md. at 591-92, 578 A.2d 1202 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>An insurance policy is interpreted in the same manner as any other contract. <em>Baltimore Gas and Elect. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., et al., </em>113 Md.App. 540, 553, 688 A.2d 496 (1997). \u201cMaryland courts do not follow the rule that an insurance policy must be strictly construed against the insurer.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 554, 688 A.2d 496 (citing <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 758, 779, 625 A.2d 1021 (1993)). The principal rule in the interpretation of contracts is to effect the intentions of the parties. <em>Kasten Constr. Co., Inc. v.

When a contract\u2019s wording is clear, the court will presume that the parties intended what they expressed, even if the expression differs from the parties\u2019 intentions at the time they created the contract. <em>Roged, Inc. v. Paglee, </em>280 Md. 248, 254 372 A.2d 1059 (1977). If reasonably possible, effect must be given to every clause and phrase of a contract, so as not to omit an important part of the agreement. <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, </em>330 Md. at 782, 625 A.2d 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The Homeowner\u2019s Policy and Statutory Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The \u201cLiability Coverages\u201d section of the Watsons\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy (\u201cthe policy\u201d) states in \u201cCoverage E \u2014 Personal Liability\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">[w]e [appellant] will pay damages the insured [the Watsons] is legally obligated to pay due to an occurrence.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> We will provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice.

The court found that the Watsons had not provided the benefits voluntarily, and \u201c[t]hat narrows it right down to one verb in that sentence. Required. Were they required to be provided----\u201d Shortly thereafter, the trial' court announced its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">[T]he fundamental issue here ... which is ... when you have this sense of uncertainty, the burden is shifted to the carrier to move in and provide the benefit. Now I am saying to you, as an insured of Nationwide ... [the trial court analogized to a hypothetical situation in which he, as an insured, was sued by a gardener for worker\u2019s compensation for a job-related injury]. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here. I\u2019m talking to my agent or my broker. All I\u2019ve got is this homeowner\u2019s policy. And he\u2019s \u2014 I have to answer this\u2014 I got this thing called a claim and it says I have to appear at the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission next month. What do I do?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The court stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">We all understand that in the public policy sense, a person who buys homeowner\u2019s coverage is entitled to protection for any reasonable expectation of expense to them arising out of \u2014 This is, I grant you, a very broadly stated insurance policy that I\u2019m writing as we speak here, for any untoward, unexpected occurrence, arising out of the ownership of that home. That\u2019s basically what you\u2019re buying. Now you have lots of exclusions and you have limits, but essentially that\u2019s what the purpose of homeowner\u2019s is. In fact, I have always been somewhat amazed at the extent to which homeowner\u2019s goes to cover things that go outside the house, but are related back to ownership of that property. So in a sense you have almost a presumption, when a person can make a reasonable case that by reason of the ownership of this property, I have sustained the following liability, to wit, attorney\u2019s fees. You then have the duty to say, I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s been excluded. You would have to come to a particularized exclusion and if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s covered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Appellant presents two arguments on appeal. First, appellant argues that the Medical Payments section of the policy did not implicate appellant\u2019s duty to defend the Watsons, because the Watsons had no direct liability under that section, as any claim is made directly against the insurer. Appellant also argues that, even if there was potential coverage under the Medical Payments section, it had no duty to defend the Watsons, because that section did not specifically create a duty as is provided for in the personal liability provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Appellant\u2019s second argument relates to the personal liability coverage. It contends that it had no duty to defend the Watsons because Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits are not damages, and the policy\u2019s coverage specifically excluded workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In appellant\u2019s opinion, once it had informed Ms. Dower that she was not covered by the Medical Payments section, to invoke liability coverage, she would have had to sue appellant directly, which she did and which appellant defended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We begin our analysis fully recognizing that the duty to defend should be construed liberally in favor of the policyholder. <em>Litz v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>346 Md. 217, 231, 695 A.2d 566 (1997); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Cochran, </em>337 Md. 98, 107, 651 A.2d 859 (1995); <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica, </em>276 Md. 396, 409, 347 A.2d 842 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In <em>Brohawn, </em>an insurance company, Transamerica, sought a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to either defend or indemnify an insured against actions brought by injured third parties, when the actions were based on allegations of negligence and assault. <em>Id., </em>at 397-398, 347 A.2d 842. The insured had pleaded guilty to assault in a criminal prosecution stemming from the same incident, and the insured\u2019s policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>specifically excluded from coverage any act the insured committed with intent to injure. The policy also provided, however, that Transamerica would defend the insured against a suit alleging bodily injury \u201ceven if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false, or fraudulent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 400, 347 A.2d 842. The Court observed that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of this covenant [the policy] is that the insurer will defend any suit stating a claim within the policy even though \u2018the claim asserted against the insured cannot possibly succeed because either in law or in fact there is no basis for a plaintiffs judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 408-409, 347 A.2d 842 (citations omitted). Transamerica argued that its interests were divergent from those of the insured, because once liability was established Transamerica would want to show that the injuries were intentional, and therefore not covered. The Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\u201c[t]he promise to defend the insured, as well as the promise to indemnify, is the consideration received by the insured for payment of the policy premiums. Although the type of policy here considered is most often referred to as liability insurance, it is \u2018litigation insurance\u2019 as well, protecting the insured from the expense of defending suits brought against him. By clear and unequivocal language, Transamerica has assumed the obligation of relieving its insured of the expense of defending an action alleging and seeking damages within the policy coverage. Additionally, the insured could reasonably expect that the insurer will employ its vast legal and investigative resources to defeat the action for the mutual benefit of both the insurer and the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\"><em>Id., </em>at 409-410, 347 A.2d 842 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">In <em>Aetna, </em>the Court of Appeals held that, because the insured had introduced evidence that his policy\u2019s exclusion <em>might not </em>apply to Aetna\u2019s defense of his civil suit for assault and battery, a potentiality of coverage existed, and Aetna had to defend him. <em>Id., </em>at 112, 651 A.2d 859. The Court used the two-part analysis identified in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 193, 438 A.2d 282 (1981), but expanded the scope of the second part beyond a plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>allegations to include extrinsic evidence referred to by the insured to establish a potentiality of coverage. <em>Aetna, </em>337 Md. at 110, 651 A.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The \u201cexclusive pleading rule\u201d dictated that \u201can insurer\u2019s defense obligation is determined solely by the allegations against the insured in the claimant\u2019s pleadings.\u201d <em>Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., et al., </em>99 Md.App. 545, 556, 638 A.2d 1196 (1994), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>338 Md. 131, 656 A.2d 779 (1995) (quoting Andrew Janquitto, <em>Insurer\u2019s Duty to Defend in Maryland, </em>18 U.Balt.L.Rev. 1, 7 (1988)); <em>see Aetna, </em>337 Md. at 106-07, 651 A.2d 859 (expanding analysis of potentiality of coverage to include extrinsic evidence proffered by insured). This rale has also been called the \u201ceight corners rale,\u201d encompassing an examination of those matters within the four corners of both the insurance policy and the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">In determining whether a liability insurer has a duty to provide its insured with a defense in a tort suit, two types of questions ordinarily must be answered: (1) what is the coverage and what are the defenses under the terms and requirements of the insurance policy? [and] (2) do the allegations in the tort action potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage? The first question focuses upon the language and requirements of the policy, and the second question focuses upon the allegations of the tort suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADM0\"><em>Pryseski, </em>292 Md. at 193, 438 A.2d 282. \u201cEven if the complaint does not allege enough facts to establish whether the claim is or is not covered, the insurer has a duty to defend. It is the potential for coverage that creates the duty to defend.\u201d <em>Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co., </em>99 Md.App. at 557, 638 A.2d 1196 (citing <em>U.S. Fidelity Guaranty Co. v. National Paving &amp; Contracting Co., </em>228 Md. 40, 54, 178 A.2d 872 (1962)). After <em>Aetna, </em>the test became (1) what are the coverages and defenses under the terms and requirements of the policy; and (2) do the allegations in the tort action, or any extrinsic evidence referred to by the insured, potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage? <em>See Aetna, </em>337 Md. at 112, 651 A.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The claim at issue is set forth in the standardized Employee\u2019s Claim form initiating Ms. Dower\u2019s claim with the WCC. Identifying herself as a \u201cNurse Assistant\u201d and the Watsons as her \u201cemployers\u201d she indicates that she suffered an \u201caccidental injury\u201d when she \u201c[shipped on steps at front of house on my way to get prescription for employers.\u201d She makes a \u201cclaim for compensation for an injury resulting in disability, due to accident (or disease) arising out of and in the course of [her] employment.\u201d Clearly, her claim\u2019s predicate was a work related injury and the alleged employer-employee relationship and was based on a remedial statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The circuit court complaint for damages involving the same injury, which properly was defended by appellant, was grounded in negligence and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">6. That the Plaintiff, as she was walking down steps from the front porch of the Defendants\u2019 home, slipped and fell on ice that was on the steps of the Defendants\u2019 residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">7. That as a result of the Plaintiffs slipping and falling, she severely injured herself, including but not limited to fracturing her left ankle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">8. That the Defendants were negligent in failing to keep their premises safe and clear of ice and snow which had been permitted to accumulate on their front steps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">9. That as a direct result of the negligence and want of due care of the Defendants, the accident caused the Plaintiff to suffer bodily injury and resulting pain and suffering, disability, mental anguish, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, expense of hospitalization, medical care and physical therapy services and treatment, loss of earnings and other damages. The loss and injuries are either permanent or continuing in nature and the Plaintiff will suffer the losses in the future. The Plaintiff was, and still is, unable to engage in her normal duties and activities thereby resulting in financial loss and deprivation of lifestyle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The predicate for this action was the failure of the Watsons to maintain properly their \u201cresidence\u201d or \u201cpremises.\u201d Although not expressly alleged, the Watsons\u2019 potential liability arises from their ownership or control of their home. Although liability insurance generally may be thought of as \u201clitigation insurance,\u201d it is not insurance for any litigation that may arise. Even if the required nexus is only potential coverage, there still must be some link between the coverage provided and the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Looking to the language of the policy, we can easily conclude that there is no coverage for a person eligible for \u201crequired\u201d workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the liability or the medical payment provisions. On the other hand, Maryland Code Ann. (1991, 1998 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 9-402 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d), \u201crequires\u201d employers to provide the type of workers\u2019 compensation benefits sought by Ms. Dower, and provides that \u201ceach employer shall secure compensation for covered employees of the employer ...\u201d by maintaining insurance with the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund or an authorized insurer. L.E. \u00a7 9-402(a). Although there is statutorily approved insurance and insurance alternatives available for the protection of one\u2019s employees, it is very clear that this policy excluded such coverage. The benefits claim made by Ms. Dower to the WCC was based on a remedial statutory scheme that impacted Mr. and Mrs. Watson because they were employers and not because they were homeowners. The employer-employee relationship is not an occurrence or accident contemplated by the policy and the cost of a defense to the assertion of such a relationship does not constitute damages under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Appellee seeks to invoke potential coverage through the defense to the claim. Appellee argues that the \u201cWatsons reasonably expected a defense to a legal proceeding, and nowhere in Appellant\u2019s policy does it state that such a defense would not be provided---- [T]he potentiality of coverage did not exist from an examination of the nature of Dower\u2019s claim, obviously, but from the defenses thereto which could trigger coverage for personal liability and [medical payments].\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>other words, the defense is that the claimant, Ms. Dower, was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation because she was not an employee. Therefore, if she was not an employee under the workers\u2019 compensation law, she was not a person eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and was not excluded from coverage. We believe this stretches the nexus string too far. What was at stake for the Watsons before the WCC was the burden of noncompliance that would result from a determination that Ms. Dower is an \u201cemployee\u201d entitled to benefits. If successful, Ms. Dower receives scheduled benefits, of which medical payments may be a part, as determined under the workers\u2019 compensation law, and the Watsons incur an obligation to the Fund. L.E. \u00a7 9-1005. If Ms. Dower was unsuccessful, she would make a claim directly against appellant, and not the appellee, for medical payments. To impose an obligation to defend workers\u2019 compensation claims effectively transforms personal liability and medical payments policies into workers\u2019 compensation and statutory compliance policies. Such a transformation is not in accord with a reasonable expectation of coverage under a homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">For these reasons, the trial court erred by granting summary judgment for appellee. There was no potentiality that the policy could offer coverage for the workers\u2019 compensation claim brought by Ms. Dower and, as a result, summary judgment should have been entered in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY, WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">.

Ms. Dower was injured on December 28, 1992; she filed her claim with the WCC on January 20, 1993; and on February 2, 1993, appellant informed Ms. Dower\u2019s attorney that appellant believed that Ms. Dower was injured while an employee of the Watsons and was therefore excluded from coverage by the policy\u2019s Medical Payments section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
