December 6, 1890, at six o\u2019clock in the evening, there was a small coating of ice over the sidewalk, very thin at the place where the defect was alleged to exist, and he put some sifted ashes on it. On cross-examination, he was asked when it was, after December 6, 1890, that he was first asked the question as to what the condition of the sidewalk was on that day, and he answered, \u201cTo the best of my recollection, I think it was either the 29th or 31st of May, 1893,\u201d the date upon which he was called as a witness at a previous trial of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-12\">In redirect examination of Kanze, the counsel for the defendant asked the following question : \u201c Let me refresh your recollection whether or not Mr. Devitt came to see you and had some talk with you?\u201d To which the witness answered, \u201cI think Mr. Devitt did come to see me, I am not positive.\u201d He was then asked, \u201c You don\u2019t remember the date of that?\u201d and answered, \u201c No.\u201d The following question was then put to him: \u201c Whether or not you did not, somewhere about the 12th of January, 1891, tell Mr. Devitt that you remembered that the side<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>walk was asked that night \u201d (meaning the night of the accident). To this question the plaintiff objected, but the judge admitted it, and the witness answered, \u201c By you refreshing my memory, I believe I did \u201d; and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-6\"><em>E.

It was competent on re-examination to show that he was mistaken in his answer, and had spoken about it at a much earlier time. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>1 Gray, 337, 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
