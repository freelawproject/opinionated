In 1888 the defendant\u2019s son, without her knowledge, raised a colt from the mare, and in 1890, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>out her knowledge or consent, employed the plaintiff to keep and train the colt for a carriage horse, agreeing to pay him therefor five dollars a week and the expense of shoeing. The defendant never had possession of the colt, and never gave any directions to her son regarding it, but after its birth she learned of the fact, and frequently saw it in the possession of her son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\">The plaintiff kept the colt for thirty-four weeks, and expended eight dollars for shoeing, and rendered a bill therefor to the defendant\u2019s son. The defendant prior to the commencement of this action had no knowledge of the contract of her son with the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-6\"><em>S.

Putting the case in the strongest way for the plaintiff, the defendant did no more than to lend the colt to her son. She did'not know of the contract with the plaintiff. Her son did not purport to contract on her behalf, nor did the plaintiff rely upon any supposed authority from her, or render the services on her credit. When one person lends a horse to another without more, he does not authorize the latter to make him answerable for its keep or improvement. See <em>Storms </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>137 Mass. 201; <em>Howes </em>v. <em>Newcomb, </em>146 Mass. 76, 80. Possession alone is no more ostensible authority to bind the owner for keeping and training than it is to sell, apart from statute. Even if circumstances could be imagined under which, without an actual knowledge of the owner, consent might be implied sufficient to create a lien under Pub. Sts. c. 192, \u00a7 32, <em>(Lynde </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>155 Mass. 481,) there is nothing in this case which would warrant the finding of an actual contract binding on the defendant. There is equally little ground for charging her upon a fictitious or quasi contract. The plaintiff furnished his services under a valid contract with the son, and must look to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
