Baker, Boston, Mass.\u201d Merrill collected her interest, and settled with her semiannually, and, a large balance remaining unpaid, he gave her his notes, to which, in July, 1892, she asked for some collateral security. Thereupon, as the defendant testified, he said that he would give to her as security for the notes certain policies of insurance; \u201c he [Merrill] said he would assign them to me; ... he put them all in my box; ... he said they were collateral security for all those notes; he said he assigned these policies to me for security for those notes; he told me they were all mine; he said they were mine just as much as if I had the money; ... he told me that the writing was to show that these policies belonged to me, and when his estate was settled, or if I should die suddenly, it would be all right, because I saw him put them in the box; ... he said those policies of insurance were mine: that he had assigned them to me, and that he gave them to me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-7\">The defendant further testified, that in December, 1892, not doubting that everything was all right in Merrill\u2019s dealings, she asked him for her box, and in January, 1893, he left it with her for examination; that the policies were in it, wrapped around with a paper, on the back of which was written, in the handwriting of Merrill, \u201cAssignment of policies\u201d; and on the inside in his handwriting, \u201c Life insurance policies on the life of Moody Merrill, July 25, 1892.\u201d Inside the wrapper was the following written direction: \u201c Boston, July 25, 1892.

Baker, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Boston, widow, I hereby direct James Hewins and Winthrop Minot Merrill, or whoever may settle my estate, in case of my decease, to appropriate the proceeds of Policy No. 121,715, No. 121,716, and No. 121,991 in the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, and No. 20,550, No. 21,898, and No. 22,947 in Home Life Insurance Company, and No. 166,241 in the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, to the payment of any notes or demands said Charlotte may hold against me at the time of my decease, and to pay any balance remaining due after such appropriation from other property belonging to my estate, without waiting to administer upon the same, upon said Charlotte releasing all claim to any stock, bonds, notes, or mortgages held by her or laid aside as collateral security for said notes and demands against me.

[Seal.] \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">This writing was enclosed in an envelope addressed in Merrill\u2019s handwriting, \u201c To James Hewins, Winthrop M. Merrill, or whoever may administer my estate, Boston, July 25, 1892.\u201d This address the defendant testified she read when the.writing, envelope, and policies were put in her box, July 25,1892. After the box had been left with the defendant she kept it in her possession, with its contents, including the policies of insurance, which, before the filing of the bill, the plaintiffs demanded of her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">Of these policies three were issued by the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, and were for $5,000 each ; two of them were fully paid up, while on the third the last premium was not payable until February 28, 1902. They were all payable to the legal representatives of Moody Merrill. Each of them contained this provision: \u201c This policy is issued and accepted upon the following express conditions and agreements. . . . No assignment of this policy shall be valid unless made in writing indorsed hereon ; and that any claims against this company arising under this policy made by any assignee shall be subject to proof of interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">Three other policies, for $2,000, $3,000, and $5,000, respectively, fully paid up, and payable to Moody Merrill, his executors, administrators, and assigns, were issued by the Home Life Insurance Company. Each of them provided that \u201c it is further understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that this policy shall not be assigned without the consent of the company in writing previously obtained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">The remaining policy, issued by the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, was for $10,000, payable to Merrill, \u201c his executors, administrators, or assigns,\u201d and contained a condition that \u201c the provisions and requirements printed by the company upon the back of this policy are hereby referred to and accepted as part of this contract, as fully as if they were recited at length over the signatures hereto affixed.\u201d On the back of the policy was the following provision: \u201c Assignments. This company will not take notice of any assignment of this policy until a duplicate or a certified copy thereof shall be delivered to the company at its principal office; and under no circumstances will the company assume any responsibility for the validity of such assignment; if any claim be made under an assignment, proof of interest to the extent of the claim will be required.\u201d Merrill defaulted on the annual premium payable on April 25, 1893, and in September, 1893, the defendant returned that policy to the company, and on application received in its place a paid up policy for $4,826. This policy contained the provision, \u201c In consideration of the application for a former policy, No..166,241, and of the surrender of the former policy,\u201d the company promised \u201c to pay to Moody Merrill, his executors, administrators, or assigns, $4,826, without profits, upon acceptance of satisfactory proofs at its home office of the death of said Moody Merrill during the continuance of this policy, subject to the provisions stated on the back of this policy, which are hereby referred to and made part hereof, and subject to all claims and equities attaching to the ownership of said former policy.\u201d On the back of said policy was the following provision : \u201c The company declines to notice any assignment of this policy until the original assignment, or a duplicate or certified copy thereof, shall be filed in the company\u2019s home office. The company will not assume any responsibility for the validity of an assignment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ay3O\">The judge found that these policies, and the paper dated July 25, 1892, set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, were on that day delivered as collateral security to the defendant for the notes of Merrill, and at the time of their delivery the defendant believed, and from what was said to her by Merrill was justified in be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>lieving that the policies were assigned to her as collateral security for whatever was then due or might thereafter become due from him to her; that she read the paper dated July 25, 1892, and understood the language, and that if it has any effect inconsistent with the assignment she did not understand that effect.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-5\"><em>D.

Independently of that, there was evidence that Merrill transferred them to her, and that she' received them as collateral security for the notes which ghe held against him. The defendant testified, among other things, that \u201c he [Merrill] said he would assign them to me; . . . he put them all in my box; . . . he said they were collateral security for all those notes; he said he assigned these policies to me for security for those notes; he told me they were all mine; he said they were mine just as much as if I had the money ; ... he told me that the writing was to show that those policies belonged to me, and when his estate was settled, or if I should die suddenly, it would be all right, because I saw him put them in the box; ... he said those policies of insurance were mine; that he had assigned them to me, and that he gave them to me.\u201d There was also evidence that the box, though kept in Merrill\u2019s safe, had a tag on it, with the words, \u201c Property of Charlotte E. Baker, Boston, Mass ,\u201d and that some months after this transaction. the box with its contents, and the key, which Merrill had had, were left by him with the defendant for examination, and thenceforward remained in her possession, Upon this evidence, the court was justified in finding that the policies were delivered to the defendant by Merrill as collateral security for his notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">It is well settled that the delivery of such a chose in action as an insurance policy for a valuable consideration, with the intent to vest the title in the assignee, operates as a valid transfer, and that the equitable interest thus acquired by the assignee will be protected and enforced in courts of law. <em>Crain </em>v. <em>Paine, 4 </em>Cush, 483. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>6 Cush. 286. <em>Currier </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Howard, </em>14 Gray, 511. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Piscataqua Ins. Co. </em>111 Mass. 532. There is nothing in the writing inconsistent with the paroi assignment. It does not purport on its face to be so much an assignment of the policies to the defendant, as a direction regarding the disposition of the proceeds to those who should administer on his estate, and who would hold the legal title to the policies ; and it recognizes, by implication at least, that the defendant is entitled to and has an interest in the proceeds of the policies. The indorsement on the wrapper of the words \u201c Assignment of policies \u201d is not conclusive as to the effect of the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In three of the policies there was a provision that the assignment should be in writing, and in three others a provision that the policies should not be assigned without the written consent of the company. In the policy of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, it was provided that the company would not take notice of any assignment until a duplicate or certified copy thereof should be delivered to the company at its principal office. The plaintiffs contend that there were no assignments of the policies, because these various provisions were not complied with. But it is expressly said in <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>New England Ins. Co. </em>103 Mass. 245, 252, of a provision that the policy should be null and void if assigned without the written consent of the company, that it \u201c does not prevent the transfer or pledge of the policy. It reserves to the company the right to give or to refuse its consent to such transfer; and, if made without its consent, to avoid its contract altogether. The effect of the condition is, to defeat the policy; not to defeat the transfer.\u201d The same reasoning applies to provisions requiring that assignments should be in writing, or requiring duplicate or certified copies to be delivered to the company at any particular place. Besides, in the case of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, the company, by issuing a paid up policy, would seem to have waived the provision relied on, and it is difficult to see how the plaintiff can set it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The result is, that the bill must be dismissed, with costs, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
