Writ dated December 1,1891. At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Br\u00e1ley, </em>J., it appeared that the plaintiff was the widow of J. Ellery Piper, to whom, on December 31, 1886, a policy of insurance had been issued by the defendant, by which it promised to pay the sum of five thousand dollars to the widow of the assured if, during the continuance of the policy, his death was occasioned by bodily injuries effected through external, violent, and accidental means within the intent and meaning of the conditions recited in the policy. One of the conditions of the policy provided: \u201c Entering or attempting to enter or leave any public conveyance using steam as a motive power while the same is in motion, or walking or being on the road-bed or bridge of any steam railway, are hazards not contemplated or covered by this certificate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-9\">The assured, on April 28, 1891, while walking longitudinally on the road-bed between the tracks of the New York and New England Railway Company at Hyde Park, for the purpose of reaching the railway station, was struck by an engine and killed. There was a public way across the railroad at a short distance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>from the station, and a walk parallel with the tracks extending from this way to the station which the assured could have used; but the place where he was walking was not fitted up as a way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-3\">The plaintiff offered evidence, which was admitted without objection, that in coming to that station many people daily crossed the tracks of the railroad at grade at the public way. He further offered to show that it was the universal practice to walk between the tracks where the assured was killed. The judge excluded this evidence; and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-4\">At the request of the defendant, the judge ruled that the action could not be maintained, and directed a verdict for the defendant; and, at the request of the plaintiff, reported the case for the determination of this court. If the ruling was right, the verdict was to stand; otherwise, a new trial was to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-5\"><em>J. Lowell, Jr., (H. H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB1\">The policy or certificate issued by the defendant was upon certain express conditions, one of which contained the following clause: \u201c Entering or attempting to enter or leave any public conveyance using steam as a motive power while the same is in motion, or walking or being on the road bed or bridge of any steam railway, are hazards not contemplated or covered by this certificate.\u201d On the undisputed facts of this case we think that the plaintiff\u2019s husband when he was killed was walking on the road-bed of the New York and New England Railroad Company within the meaning of this clause. We have no occasion to consider whether crossing the road-bed of a railroad when travelling along a public way, or along a private way which a person has a right to use, is \u201c walking or being on the road-bed \u201d within the meaning of the certificate. According to the report, it must be taken as conceded that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was walking longitudinally on the road-bed between the tracks of the railroad for the purpose of reaching the station. There was a public way across the railroad, and a walk parallel with the tracks extending from this way to the station, which he could have used. The place where he was walking was not fitted up as a way ; if was a part of the road-bed, and nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>more. That many people used it as the plaintiff\u2019s husband did is immaterial in a suit against this association.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In accordance with the terms of the report, the</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>Verdict is to stand.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
