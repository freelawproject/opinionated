Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20, cl. 1. Debts due to a person are certainly not goods, wares, or merchandise. The latter words occur in the statute of frauds, (Pub. Sts', c. 78, \u00a7 5,) and though it is held in this State that shares in corporations are goods, wares, and merchandise within the meaning of that statute, it is said that \u201c the words of the statute have never yet been extended . . . beyond securities which are subjects of common sale and barter, and which have a visible and palpable form.\u201d <em>Somerby </em>v. Buntin, 118 Mass. 279, 285. There is no reason why a wider meaning should be given to them when applied to taxable property. It is said in <em>Boston Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>158 Mass. 461, 463, that \u201c it is not contended, and it could not successfully be contended, that money in bank is \u2018 goods, wares, merchandise,\u2019 or <em>\u2018 </em>stock in trade,\u2019 within the meaning of the first clause of \u00a7 20 of c. 11 of the Public Statutes.\u201d If money in bank does not constitute stock in trade, clearly debts due one do not. The language of the statute is \u201c all goods, wares,' merchandise, and other stock in trade,\u201d etc., and we think it apparent from the connection and the rest of the clauses that by stock in trade is meant the visible and tangible property with which the trade or business of the owner is' carried on, and to which it relates. See <em>Hittinger </em>v. <em>Westford, </em>135 Mass. 258, 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">According to.the agreed facts, judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for fourteen hundred and twenty-six dollars and interest from October 10, 1891, and it is <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
