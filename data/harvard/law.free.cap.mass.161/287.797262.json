Writ dated August 25,1891. At the hearing in the Superior Court, before <em>Thompson, </em>J., it appeared that the plaintiff on the first Monday of June, 1891, recovered judgment against one Turner, and that thereafter the defendants were adjudged trustees. On June 17 execution issued against Turner and the defendants as his trustees, and payment thereof having been demanded of Turner and the defendant Glass, and by them refused, it was on August 15 returned into court unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-12\">The defendants requested the judge to rule, that upon the evidence the action had been prematurely brought, and could not be maintained; that the answer and sworn statement of the defendants must be regarded as true, and could not be con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>t radiated by the plaintiff; and that upon the evidence, as set f &gt;rth in their answer, the goods, effects, and credits in the hands of the defendants belonged to the firm composed of Turner and one Rideout, copartners, and could not be attached by the plaintiff as the goods, effects, and credits of Turner alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">The judge declined to rule as requested, and ordered judgment for the plaintiff; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-6\"><em>A.

That the debt was due to Turner and Rideout jointly as copartners was not matter of abatement, to be pleaded by the alleged trustees in the original action. They were not chargeable as trustees of Turner in respect of the debt due to his copartnership. <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>18 Pick. 451. <em>Bulfinch </em>v. <em>Winchenbach, </em>3 Allen, 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
