The defendant was a stranger to the process which the plaintiff was undertaking to serve, and it is not contended that she had in any way induced the plaintiff to believe that the person against whom the process ran was in the building which the plaintiff entered, nor that he had ever been in any way connected with that building.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Under these circumstances we are of opinion that the plaintiff had no right to enter the defendant\u2019s building, and that in entering it he was a trespasser. This conclusion does not rest upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the fact that the building was a dwelling, nor that the entrance to it was closed. It was in fact a tenement house, not occupied by the defendant but by tenants at will, and the entrance by which the plaintiff gained admission was not only open, but had no door. The plaintiff was a trespasser, because his office and his writ gave him no right to enter upon the property of a stranger, unless the person whom the writ directed him to serve with a summons either resided there or was actually in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">While it is for the public interest that officers charged with the duty of serving civil process should be clothed with such powers as will enable them to comply with their precepts, it yet is not necessary that they should have the right to enter any premises where they may suppose the person to be of whom they are in search; and if, without inducement from the owner or those in occupation, they see fit to enter a building where the person sought does not reside, they are properly held to do so at their peril, and if he is not in fact there they enter without right and as trespassers. In this respect their rights and powers are less than those of officers charged with the execution of warrants to arrest alleged criminals, or of those whose duty it is to arrest criminals without warrant. In such cases the officer may enter the house of a stranger and search there for the person named in his warrant, although that person is not there, if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the'person against whom he holds the warrant, or whom it is his duty to arrest without a warrant, is in the house. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Irwin, 1 Allen, 587. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Reynolds, 120 Mass. 190. <em>Parker </em>v. Barnard, 135 Mass. 116, 117. But there is a clear distinction, both upon principle and authority, between such cases and those in which officers charged only with the service of civil process invade the premises of strangers, which do not in fact shelter those of whom they are in search. In such cases they act at their own risk, and are justified or shown to be trespassers by the event. And,such is the current of authority. Thus in <em>Biscop </em>v. White, Cro. Eliz. 759, trespass was brought for breaking the plaintiff\u2019s house. The defendant held <em>a, fieri facias de bonis testator is, </em>and, the plaintiff\u2019s house being open, entered to levy the debt. There were in the house <em>bona proprio executrieis, </em>not liable to execution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>but no <em>bona testator is, </em>and the plaintiff had judgment; but if <em>bona testatoris </em>had been in the house, it was conceived that the plaintiff\u2019s entry would have been justifiable. So in Com. Dig. Execution (C. 5), it is said : \u201c After a <em>fieri facias </em>delivered to him, the sheriff may enter the house of the defendant, when the door is open, and seize the goods of the defendant there found; or the house of a stranger; and this by night or by day, if the door be open. But if it be the house of a stranger he ought to aver that the goods were there.\u201d In <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Birt, </em>5 Taunt. 765, Gibbs, C. J. says: \u201c Under a <em>fieri facias </em>the sheriff cannot, on suspicion of finding the defendant\u2019s goods, enter the house of a stranger. . . . The sheriff, finding the door open, may enter the house of a stranger, and is justified if the defendant\u2019s goods are in it, but it is at his own risk.\u201d And in the same case Dallas, J. says: \u201c The sheriff may enter the house of a stranger, if the door be open, but it is at his peril whether the goods be found there or not; if they be not, he is a trespasser.\u201d So in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Leigh, </em>6 Taunt. 246, the defendant\u2019s plea, averring only a suspicion that the person whom the defendant sought to arrest on mesne process was in the plaintiff\u2019s house, was held bad. And in <em>Morrish </em>v. <em>Murrey, </em>13 M. &amp; W. 52, it was held that an officer was not justified in entering and searching the house of a stranger for the purpose of arresting a debtor under a <em>copias ad satisfaciendum, </em>although the debtor had resided there before the entry, and the officer had reasonable cause to suspect that the debtor was there, if the debtor was not in the house at the time. See also <em>Sema.yne\u2019s case, </em>and notes in 1 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas. (9th Am. ed.) 228, 234-245. In <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>16 Pick. 553, 556, the officer had the right to break open the plaintiff\u2019s store for the purpose of attaching the goods of a third person, because the goods were in fact there.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">As in our opinion the plaintiff was a trespasser upon the defendant\u2019s property, and had no lawful right or license of any kind to enter her building, there is no occasion to inquire whether the city ordinances stated in the report applied to the entrance where the plaintiff fell, or whether, if he had not been a trespasser, but had entered under license or of right, he could have recovered for his injuries under the doctrine held in the case of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>135 Mass. 116. Nor whether, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>had not been a trespasser, he could have been found to be in the exercise of ordinary care in entering a dark passage with which he was unacquainted, and walking forward until he fell down stairs. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
