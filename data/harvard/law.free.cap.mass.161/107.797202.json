C. thereupon raised the money and paid the mortgage, and A. gave him a bill of sale of the stable, releasing his interest therein to C. In an action by A. against C. for money paid in the purchase of the stable, A. contended that he bought and paid for it at C.\u2019s request and for his use; and C. contended that A. bought it, not at C.\u2019s request, but substantially as a present for him. A. testified that he sent an attorney \u201c on business relative to this transaction \u201d to attend to A.\u2019s claim, to protect C., and to raise the money if he could. <em>Held, </em>that evidence of statements made by A.\u2019s attorney to the attorney representing B. in the foreclosure proceedings, that A. was relinquishing all right to the stable, and C. was thereby making a thousand dollars, was rightly excluded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b125-15\">In an action for money paid, evidence that the defendant had been summoned or was chargeable in another action, as trustee in respect of the money now sued for, is inadmissible.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Contract, for money paid \u201cby the plaintiff to the defendants\u2019 use, at their request,\u201d in the purchase of a stable in Norwood.

The plaintiff bought the stable and mortgaged it to one Ellis, and allowed the defendants to run it. He contended at the trial that he bought and paid for it at the defendants\u2019 request, and for their use, and they contended that he bought it, not at their request, but substantially as a present for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The mortgage was in course of foreclosure by sale, and Mr. Lane was the attorney who represented the mortgagee in the foreclosure proceedings. The plaintiff could not himself raise the money to pay the mortgage, and told the defendants that, if they could find some one who would raise the money and pay off the mortgage, he would release to them all claims to the stable, and they thereupon raised the money and paid off the mortgage and the plaintiff gave them a bill of sale of the stable releasing his interest therein to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The plaintiff testified that he sent Mr. Pearse, an attorney, to Norwood \u201c on business relative to this transaction,\u201d to attend to his (plaintiff\u2019s) claim, to protect the defendants, and to raise the money if he could. But it does not appear that the statements made by Pearse to Lane, that the plaintiff was relinquishing all right to the stable, and the defendants by reason of that fact were making a thousand dollars out of the plaintiff\u2019s action, were material to the negotiations between Lane and Pearse, and they must be treated as matters of conversation outside of the scope of those negotiations. The statements were not made to or acted upon by the defendants, and could not be binding on the plaintiff as to them, and were not admissible in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">2. Whether the defendants had been summoned or were chargeable in another action as trustees in respect of the money here sued for, was immaterial to the question whether the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict in the case at bar. This case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>must proceed so far as to ascertain what sum, if any, is due from the defendants; and it is not to be delayed on account of the trustee process, unless continued for judgment in accordance with the statute. Pub. Sts. c. 183, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
