The ruling excepted to was clearly correct. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quin, </em>5 Gray, 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">The exceptions recite as follows: \u201c The judge in charging the jury, among other things, made use of this expression, that the jury might take into consideration the fact whether this defendant had opportunity to commit said crime, and gave full instructions on all other points of the case. At the close of the judge\u2019s charge, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked that the further instruction be given to the jury that, if any one else had opportunity to commit said crime, that fact should be considered by the jury in her favor. The judge refused so to rule,\u201d etc. For aught that appears, full and appropriate instructions already had been given on this subject, and the presiding justice may have thought that the request was made for the purpose of having him put special emphasis upon this feature of the case at the close of the charge. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
