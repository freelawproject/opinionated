Ingram, to the appellants\u2019 notice of opposition to tbe appel-lee\u2019s application for registration of tbe trademark \u201cZodenta,\u201d for use on a dentifrice, tbe appellee claiming to have continuously used tbis trademark on a dentifrice since 1891. Within due time, under sec. 6 of tbe act of Congress of February 20, 1905, tbe appellants, Hall &amp; Ruckel, filed notice of opposition to tbe registration of \u201cZodenta.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">The grounds for opposition were that tbe word \u201cSozodont\u201d has been used continuously by tbe appellants and their predecessors in business as a trademark for dentifrices since 1863; that appellants are tbe sole and rightful proprietors of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>mark, and tbat the mark \u201cZodenta\u201d so nearly resembles the word \u201cSozodont\u201d as used by the appellants \u201cas to be calculated to mislead, deceive, and confuse, and to result in interference and conflict in trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The appellee demurred to the opposition. After hearing, the Examiner of Interferences sustained the demurrer, holding that the words in question \u201cdo not so nearly resemble each other as to cause confusion in the mind of the public, or deceive purchasers using ordinary care in the selection of the goods.\u201d The Commissioners affirmed the Examiner\u2019s decision, from which the present appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We are not impressed by the argument that \u201cSozodont\u201d is a derivative from the two Greek words mentioned, and \u201cZodenta\u201d' from combining the Greek and Latin words named. These fanciful etymologies are not apt to occur to the mind of the public nor to deceive purchasers. It is admitted upon this demurrer that during fifteen years the appellee had used the word \u201cZodenta\u201d as his trademark. The two words differ so much in appearance and in sound that ordinary purchasers buying with ordinary caution are not likely to be misled. It is unnecessary to review the authorities. Two trademarks are substantially the same if the resemblance would deceive an ordinary purchaser giving such attention as he usually gives in making a purchase, and cause him to purchase one article, mistaking it for the other. See <em>Gorham Mfg. Co. </em>v. White, 14 Wall. 511, 20 L. ed. 731; <em>McLean </em>v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 256, 24 L. ed. 832; <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Carlton Importation Co. </em>27 App. D. C. 571; <em>Buchanan-Anderson-Nelson Co. </em>v. <em>Breen &amp; </em>Kennedy, 27 App. D. C. 573. In considering the similarity between \u201cAnderson\u201d' and \u201cHenderson,\u201d Chief Justice Shepard [in the case last cited] remarked: \u201cThe single question for our determination is whether the resemblance between the two marks as used is calculated to deceive and mislead the public into purchasing Breen &amp; Kennedy\u2019s whisky under the belief that it is the whisky of the Buchanan-Anderson-Nelson Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">It is claimed by the appellants that the two trademarks here considered, by close resemblance are calculated to mislead and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>deceive, and it is further claimed that such an issue should not be decided upon a demurrer. It is said that a demurrer precludes the aid of evidence which might so inform the Office as to make it possible for the Office to intelligently decide this question. We think the Commissioner capable of deciding the resemblance or the difference between these words bythe spelling,, the appearance, and the sound, correctly. In the case last cited, as in this, the question arose upon a demurrer to the opposition, sustained by the Commissioner of Patents. The Federal cases cited by the appellant on this point apply with great force where novelty or invention is involved, and where the court may desire proof to be taken to better instruct the court. Witnesses were not needed to enable the Examiner and Commissioner of Patents to decide that \u201cZodenta\u201d and \u201cSozodont\u201d are quite dissimilar, and that \u201cZodenta\u201d is not calculated to mislead or deceive the average purchaser who may seek to buy \u201cSozodont.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is <em>affirmed, and it is further ordered that this decision he certified to the Commissioner of Patents as provided by law.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
