R.Crim. P., in which he attacked his capital-murder conviction and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-19\">In 1998, Reeves was convicted of murder made capital because it was committed during the course of a robbery in the first degree, see \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(2), Ala.Code 1975. By a vote of 10-2, the jury recommended that Reeves be sentenced to death for his capital-murder conviction. The trial court followed the jury\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Reeves to death. This Court affirmed Reeves\u2019s conviction and sentence on appeal. Reeves v. State, 807 So.2d 18 (Ala.Crim.App.2000). The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari review, and this Court issued a certificate of judgment on June 8, 2001. The United States Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari review on November 13, 2001. Reeves v. Alabama, 534 U.S. 1026, 122 S.Ct. 558, 151 L.Ed.2d 433 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-20\">In our opinion affirming Reeves\u2019s conviction and sentence, this Court set out the facts of the crime as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-21\">\u201cThe State\u2019s evidence tended to show the following. On November 27, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>the appellant (who was 18 years old at the time) and his younger brother, Julius, visited Brenda Suttles and Suttles\u2019s 15-year-old cousin, Emanuel, at Sut-tles\u2019s house on Lavender. Street in Selma. There, according to Suttles, everyone agreed to go out \u2018looking for some robberies.\u2019 (R. 684.) Shortly after noon that day, the foursome left Suttles\u2019s house on foot and walked to a nearby McDonald\u2019s restaurant, where they saw Jason Powell driving by in his car. The appellant\u2019s brother, Julius, flagged Powell down, and Powell agreed to give the group a ride.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\u201cBrenda Suttles and Emanuel Suttles testified that after the foursome got into Powell\u2019s car, Julius Reeves suggested that they go to White Hall, a town in neighboring Lowndes County, to rob a drug dealer. According to Brenda Sut-tles, everyone in the car agreed to the plan. (Powell, who also testified at trial, denied hearing the discussion about a robbery.) Before leaving Selma, the group stopped at an apartment on Broad Street. Julius Reeves went inside the apartment and returned to the car a short time later carrying a shotgun, which he handed to the appellant. With Powell driving, the group then headed for White Hall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">\u201cBefore they reached White Hall, however, Powell\u2019s car broke down on a dirt road off Highway 80. Shortly thereafter, a passing motorist, Duane Smith, stopped and told the group that he was in a hurry to meet some friends to go hunting, but that he would return around sunset and would take them to get help then. For the next couple of hours, the group sat in Powell\u2019s car and listened to music, until another passing motorist, Willie Johnson, stopped in his pickup truck and offered to tow Powell\u2019s car to Selma. Using some chains that he kept in his pickup truck, Johnson hooked Powell\u2019s car to the back of his truck. With Julius Reeves riding in the truck with him and the others in Powell\u2019s car, Johnson towed the car to the Selma residence where the appellant and Julius lived with their mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201cWhen they arrived at the Reeveses\u2019 house, Julius ReeVes got out of Johnson\u2019s truck and told the others that Johnson wanted $25 for towing them. However, no one had any money to pay Johnson. Julius Reeves then offered to give Johnson a ring as payment if Johnson would drive him to his girlfriend\u2019s house to get the ring. Johnson agreed and he unhooked Powell\u2019s car from his truck. According to Jason Powell and Emanuel Suttles, Julius Reeves at this point told the others that Johnson was going to be their robbery victim. While Jason Powell and Emanuel Suttles stayed behind with Powell\u2019s car in front of the Reeveses\u2019 house, Julius Reeves got back in the cab of the truck with Johnson, and Brenda Suttles climbed into the rear bed of the truck. Testimony indicated that when Johnson started the truck, the appellant jumped into the rear bed of the truck with the shotgun, hiding the weapon behind his leg as he did so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">\u201cWhen they arrived at Julius\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house in Johnson\u2019s truck, Julius went inside and retrieved the ring he had promised to give Johnson as payment. According to Brenda Suttles, when Julius came out of the house, he walked to the rear of Johnson\u2019s truck and told her and the appellant that he was not going to let Johnson keep the ring. After Julius got back in the cab of the truck, Johnson drove everyone back to the Reeveses\u2019 house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">\u201cJason Powell and Emanuel Suttles, who had remained at the house with Powell\u2019s car, testified that sometime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>around 7:00 p.m., they saw Johnson\u2019s truck drive by the house and turn into an alley\u2014known as Crockett\u2019s Alley\u2014 behind the house. According to Brenda Suttles, who was in the rear, bed of the truck with the appellant, just as the truck came to a stop in the alley, she heard a loud \u2018pow\u2019 sound. (R. 704.) Suttles. testified that when she looked up, the appellant was withdrawing the barrel of the shotgun from the open rear window of the truck\u2019s cab. Johnson had been shot in the neck and was slumped over in the driver\u2019s seat. Suttles testified that Julius Reeves jumped out of the truck\u2019s cab and asked the appellant what he had done, and that the appellant then told Julius and Suttles to go through Johnson\u2019s pockets to \u2018get his money.\u2019 (R. 704.) Suttles stated that Julius then pulled Johnson out of the truck and went through his pockets, giving the money he found in the pockets to the appellant. After Julius had gone through Johnson\u2019s pockets, Suttles helped him put Johnson back in the truck\u2019s cab, According to Suttles, Johnson was bleeding heavily and making \u2018gagging\u2019 noises. (R. 721.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adk-dedup-0\">\u201cJason Powell and Emanuel Suttles testified that they heard the gunshot after Johnson\u2019s truck pulled into Crockett\u2019s Alley and that'a short time later they saw the appellant, Julius Reeves, and Brenda Suttles run out of the alley and into the Reeveses\u2019 house. The appellant was carrying a shotgun, they said. They followed- the appellant, Julius Reeves, and Brenda Suttles into the Reeveses\u2019 house and saw the appellant place the shotgun under a bed in his bedroom. The appellant told Julius and Brenda Suttles to change out of their bloodstained clothes and shoes, and he took the clothes and shoes and stuffed them under, a dresser in his bedroom. According to Emanuel Suttles, as the appellant, Julius, and Brenda changed their clothes, they were \u2018jumping and hollering\u2019 and celebrating about \u2018all the stuff [they] got\u2019 from Johnson. (R. 842.) Jason PoWell testified -that he heard the appellant say, T made the money.\u2019 (R. 786.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">\u201cAfter changing their clothes, the appellant, Julius Reeves, and Brenda Sut-tles ran to Suttles\u2019s house. On the way, the appellant stopped to talk to his girlfriend, telling her that if she should be questioned by the police, to tell them that he had been with her all day. At Suttles\u2019s house, the appellant divided the money taken from Johnson\u2014approximately $360\u2014among himself, Julius Reeves, and Brenda Suttles. Testimony indicated that throughout the evening, the appellant continued to brag about having shot Johnson.- Several witnesses who were present'at Suttles\u2019s house that evening testified that they- saw the appellant dancing, \u2018throwing up\u2019 gang signs, and pretending to pump-a shotgun. Brenda Suttles testified that as the appellant danced, he would jerk his body around in a manner \u2018mockfing] the way that Willie Johnson had died.\u2019 (R. 713.) The appellant was also heard to say that the shooting would earn him a \u2018teardrop,\u2019 a gang tattoo acquired for killing someone. (R. 720.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">\u201cYolanda Blevins, who was present during the post-shooting \u2018celebration\u2019 at Suttles\u2019s house, testified that the appellant called her into the kitchen and told her that he had shot a man in a truck after catching a ride with him. Blevins noticed that there was what appeared to be dried blood on the appellant\u2019s hands. LaTosha Rodgers, who was also present at Suttles\u2019s house, testified.that the appellant told her that he had \u2018just shot somebody\u2019 in the alley. (R. 924.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>\u201cAt around 2:00 a.m. on November 28, .1996 (approximately seven hours after the shooting), Selma police received a report of a suspicious vehicle parked in Crockett\u2019s Alley. When police officers investigated, they found Johnson\u2019s body slumped across the seat of his pickup truck. There was a pool of blood on the ground on the driver\u2019s side of the truck. Several coins and a diamond ring were on the ground near the track. On the floorboard of the truck, police found wadding from a shotgun shell. The pockets of Johnson\u2019s pants had been turned inside out and were empty. Testimony at trial indicated that Johnson was a longtime employee of the Selma Housing Authority and that on the afternoon of November 27, 1996, he had cashed his paycheck, which had been in the amount of $500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">\u201cAt the shooting scene on the morning of November 28, police also discovered a trail of blood leading from Johnson\u2019s truck to the Reeveses\u2019 house. Randy Tucker, a canine-patrol officer with the Selma Police Department, testified that his dog tracked the blood trail from the pool of blood next to Johnson\u2019s truck, down Crockett\u2019s Alley, through the yard at 2126 Selma Avenue (the residence next to the alley), and ultimately to the front steps of the Reeveses\u2019 house at 2128 Selma Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">\u201cPat Grindle, the detective in charge of investigating Johnson\u2019s murder, went to the Reeveses\u2019 house after learning that the blood trail led there. Det. Grindle testified that he obtained the consent of the appellant\u2019s mother, Mar-zetta Reeves, to search the house. In a bedroom shared by the appellant and Julius, Det. Grindle found bloodstained clothes and bloodstained shoes; under a bed in this bedroom, Det. Grindle found a shotgun. In searching the kitchen, Det. Grindle found a pair of bloodstained pants. After making these discoveries, Det. Grindle questioned \u25a0. Marzetta Reeves and several other persons who were in the house at that time. Det. Grindle stated that he learned that the bloodstained clothes and shoes belonged to Julius Reeves, Brenda Suttles, and the appellant. Det, Grindle then went to Suttles\u2019s house in an attempt to locate the three. At Suttles\u2019s house, Det. Grin-dle found the appellant lying on a couch in a front room'. The appellant was placed under arrest, and the officers seized a balled-up bloodstained jacket he was using as a headrest on the couch'. Det. Grindle later returned to the Reeveses\u2019 residence, where he seized a 12 gauge shotgun shell from a garbage can in the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">\u201cAn. autopsy revealed that Johnson had died irom a shotgun wound to his neck that severed the carotid artery, causing him to bleed to death over a period of several minutes. Bloodstain patterns in Johnson\u2019s truck indicated that he was sitting upright in the driver\u2019s seat, facing forward, when he was shot from behind, through the open rear window. The bloodstain patterns also indicated that the driver\u2019s side door had been opened and closed shortly after Johnson was shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">\u201cTestimony indicated that the appellant\u2019s fingerprints were found on the shotgun that Det. Grindle had seized from under the bed in the appellant\u2019s bedroom. Brenda Suttles\u2019s and Julius Reeves\u2019s fingerprints were found on a fender of Johnson\u2019s truck. Joseph Sa-loom, a firearms expert with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, testified that the shotgun shell seized from the bathroom at the Reeveses\u2019 residence was of the type commonly fired from the shotgun, seized from the appellant\u2019s bedroom. S\u00e1loom stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>shotgun-shell wadding found on the floorboard of Johnson\u2019s truck was of the type commonly found in the kind of shotgun shell seized from the bathroom at the Reeveses\u2019 residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Reeves, 807 So.2d at 24-26.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Reeves timely filed his Rule 32 petition on October 30, 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He filed an amended petition on February 26, 2003, and a second amended petition on August 31, 2006. The circuit court, Reeves, and the State treated the second amended petition as superseding the previous petitions, and we do the same.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, e.g., Smith v. State, 160 So.3d 40, 47-49 (Ala.Crim.App.2010). In his petition, Reeves raised claims of ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel, of trial court error, and of juror misconduct. Reeves also alleged that he was intellectually disabled and that, therefore, his death sentence was unconstitutional under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State filed an answer to the petition on October 28, 2006. The circuit court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the petition on November 28-29, 2006. At the hearing, Reeves called two witnesses to testify, and the State called one witness. Reeves did not call his trial and appellate attorneys to testify. The parties also submitted numerous documentary exhibits. On May 7, 2008, the State filed a proposed order denying Reeves\u2019s petition. On September 9, 2008, Reeves filed a written objection to the State\u2019s proposed order and a post-hearing brief. On October 26, 2009, the circuit court issued an order denying Reeves\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">The record indicates that the parties were not notified of the circuit court\u2019s ruling until January 2013. Reeves then filed another Rule 32 petition pursuant to Rule. 32.1(f), Ala. R.Crim. P., requesting an out-of-time appeal from the circuit court\u2019s October 26, 2009, order denying his first petition. The circuit court ultimately granted Reeves an out-of-time-appeal on May 30, 2014. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">In a Rule 32 proceeding, both the burden of pleading and the burden of proof are on the petitioner. See Rule 32.3, Ala. R.Crim. P. (\u201cThe petitioner shall have the burden of pleading and proving by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to entitle the petitioner to relief.\u201d). \u201cOn direct appeal we reviewed the record for plain error; however, the plain-error standard of review does not apply to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Rule 32 proceeding attacking a death sentence.\u201d Ferguson v. State, 13 So.3d 418, 424 (Ala.Crim.App.2008). Therefore, \u201c[t]he general rules of preservation apply to Rule 32 proceedings,\u201d Boyd v. State, 913 So.2d 1113, 1123 (Ala.Crim.App.2003), and this Court \u201cwill not review issues not listed and argued in brief.\u201d Brownlee v. State, 666 So.2d 91, 93 (Ala.Crim.App.1995). Additionally, \u201c[i]t is well settled that \u2018the procedural bars of Rule 32 apply with equal force to all cases, including those in which the death penalty has been imposed.\u2019 \u201d Nicks v. State, 783 So.2d 895, 901 (Ala.Crim.App.1999) (quoting State v. Tarver, 629 So.2d 14, 19 (Ala.Crim.App.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The general rule is that \u201cwhen the facts are undisputed [or] an appellate court is presented with pure questions of law, that court\u2019s review in a Rule 32 proceeding is de novo.\u201d Ex parte White, 792 So.2d 1097, 1098 (Ala.2001). On the other hand, \u201cwhere there are disputed facts in a postconviction proceeding and the circuit court resolves those disputed facts, \u2018[t]he standard of review on appeal ... is whether the trial judge abused his discretion when he denied the petition.\u2019 \u201d Boyd v. State, 913 So.2d 1113, 1122 (Ala.Crim.App.2003) (quoting Elliott v. State, 601 So.2d 1118, 1119 (Ala.Crim.App.1992)). Even when the disputed facts arise from a combination of oral testimony and documentary evidence, we review the circuit court\u2019s findings for an abuse of discretion and afford those findings a presumption of correctness. See Parker Towing Co. v. Triangle Aggregates, Inc., 143 So.3d 159, 166 (Ala.2013) (noting that the ore tenus rule \u201capplies to \u2018disputed issues of fact,\u2019 whether the dispute is based entirely upon oral testimony or upon a combination of oral testimony and documentary evidence\u201d (citation omitted)). Moreover, with limited exceptions not applicable here, this Court may affirm a circuit court\u2019s judgment on a Rule 32 petition if it is correct for any reason. See Bryant v. State, 181 So.3d 1087 (Ala.Crim.App.2011); Moody v. State, 95 So.3d 827, 833 (Ala.Crim.App.2011); and McNabb v. State, 991 So.2d 313, 333 (Ala.Crim.App.2007), and the cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">With these principles in mind, we address each of the issues Reeves raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Reeves contends that the circuit court erroneously adopted verbatim that portion of the State\u2019s proposed order addressing his claim of intellectual disability. Reeves concedes that the circuit court did not adopt the State\u2019s proposed order in its entirety. Nonetheless, he argues that the circuit court\u2019s verbatim adoption of the language from the State\u2019s proposed order as to even one claim indicates \u201can absence of careful and independent judicial consideration\u201d of that claim and requires reversal. (Reeves\u2019s brief, p. 36.) Reeves maintains that the circuit court\u2019s findings on his intellectual-disability claim are not that of the circuit court itself, but solely of the State and, therefore, cannot stand. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">\u201cAlabama courts have consistently held that even when a trial court adopts verbatim a party\u2019s proposed order, the findings of fact and conclusions of law are those of the trial court and they may be reversed only if they are clearly erroneous.\u201d McGahee v. State, 885 So.2d 191, 229-30 (Ala.Crim.App.2003). \u201cWhile the practice of adopting the state\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions is subject to criticism, the general rule is that even when the court adopts proposed findings verbatim, the findings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.\u201d Bell v. State, 593 So.2d 123, 126 (Ala.Crim.App.1991). \u201c[T]he general rule is that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>where a trial court does in fact adopt the proposed order as its own, deference is owed to that order in the same measure as any other order of the trial court.\u201d Ex parte Ingram, 51 So.3d 1119, 1122 (Ala. 2010). Only \u201cwhen the record before this Court clearly establishes that the order signed by the trial court denying postcon-viction relief is not the product of the trial court\u2019s independent judgment\u201d will the circuit court\u2019s adoption of the State\u2019s proposed order be held erroneous. Ex parte Jenkins, 105 So.3d 1250, 1260 (Ala.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">For example, in Ex parte Ingram, supra, the circuit court adopted verbatim the State\u2019s proposed order summarily dismissing Robert Shawn Ingram\u2019s Rule 32 petition. In the order, the court stated that it had considered \u201c \u2018the events within the personal knowledge of the Court\u2019\u201d and that it'had \u201c \u2018presided over Ingram\u2019s'capital murder trial and personally observed the performance of both lawyers throughout Ingram\u2019s trial and sentencing.\u2019\u201d Ex parte Ingram, 51 So.3d at 1123 (citation and\u2019 emphasis omitted). However, : the judge who summarily dismissed the petition had not, in fact, presided over Ingram\u2019s trial and had no personal knowledge of the trial. The Alabama Supreme Court described these errors in the court\u2019s adopted order as \u201cthe most material and obvious of errors,\u201d 51 So.3d at 1123, and \u201cpatently erroneous,\u201d 51 So.3d at 1125, and concluded that the errors \u201cunderminefd] any confidence that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law [we]re the product of the trial judge\u2019s independent judgment.\u201d 51 So.2d at 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In Ex parte Scott, [Ms. 1091275, March 18, 2011] \u2014 So.3d - (Ala.2011), the circuit court adopted verbatim as its order the State\u2019s answer to Willie Earl Scott\u2019s Rule 32 petition. The Alabama Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">\u201c[A]n answer, by its very nature, is adversarial and sets forth one party\u2019s position in the litigation, It makes no claim of being an impartial consideration of the facts and law; rather it is a work of advocacy .that exhorts one party\u2019s perception of the law as it pertains to the relevant facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">Ex parte Scott, \u2014 So.3d at -. The Court then held that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s verbatim adoption of the State\u2019s answer to Scott\u2019s Rule 32 petition as its order, by its nature, violates this Court\u2019s holding in Ex parte Ingram \u201d that the findings and conclusions in a court\u2019s order must be those of the court itself. Ex parte Scott, \u2014 So.3d at -.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">Unlike Ex parte Ingram and Ex parte Scott, the record in this case does not clearly establish that the portion of the circuit court\u2019s order denying Reeves\u2019s intellectual-disability claim was not the product of the court\u2019s own independent judgment. The circuit court\u2019s order contains no patently erroneous statements as was the case in Ex parte Ingram,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the circuit court here adopted a portion of the State\u2019s proposed order, not a portion of the State\u2019s answer, as was the case in Ex parte Scott. After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that the circuit court\u2019s findings on Reeves\u2019s intellectual-disability claim were its own and were not merely an unexamined adoption of the proposed order submitted by the Stat\u00e9. See, e.g., Ex parte Jenkins, 105 So.3d at 1260; Van Pelt v. State, 202 So.3d 707 (Ala.Crim.App.2015); Spencer v. State, 201 So.3d 573 (Ala.Crim.App.2015); and Mashburn v. State, 148 So.3d 1094 (Ala.Crim.App.2013). Therefore, we find no error on the part of the circuit court in adopting verbatim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>portion of the State\u2019s proposed order addressing Reeves\u2019s intellectual-disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\u25a0 Reeves also contends that the circuit court erred in denying his claim of intellectual disability under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002). He argues that he suffers from significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and significant deficits in multiple areas of adaptive functioning, all of which manifested before he reached the age of 18, and that the circuit court\u2019s findings and conclusions to the contrary were erroneous\u2019. Therefore, Reeves concludes, his death sentence is unconstitutional, and the circuit court erred in not granting him relief on this claim in his petition.

The Court in Atkins did not establish a national standard for determining whether a person is intellectually disabled for purposes of the Eighth Amendment, but left to the states \u201c \u2018the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon [their] execution of sentences.\u2019 \u201d Atkins, 536 U.S. at 317 (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 416-17, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986)). The Court did note, however, the following clinical definitions of intellectual disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-15\">\u201cThe American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] defines mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>retardation as follows: \u2018Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning. It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work. Mental retardation manifests before age 18.\u2019 Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed.1992).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\">\u201cThe American Psychiatric Association\u2019s definition is similar: \u2018The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B). The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion C). Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous system.\u2019 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th ed.2000). \u2018Mild\u2019 mental retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 50-55 to approximately 70.

The Court also noted that an intelligence quotient (\u201cIQ\u201d) between 70 and 75 \u201cis typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.\u201d Id. at 309 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Subsequently, in Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1986, 188 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2014), the United States Supreme Court recognized that IQ test scores, alone, are not determinative of intellectual disability or even of the intellectual-functioning prong of intellectual disability because IQ testing has a margin of error or standard error of measurement (\u201cSEM\u201d). The Court held unconstitutional Florida\u2019s strict IQ score cutoff of 70 for establishing intellectual disability. The Florida Supreme Court had held that a person who attained an IQ score above 70 was, as a matter of law, not intellectually disabled and was prohibited from presenting any further evidence to support a claim of intellectual disability. See Hall v. State, 109 So.3d 704 (Fla.2012), citing Cherry v. State, 959 So.2d 702, 712-13 (Fla.2007). In holding this strict IQ score cutoff of 70 unconstitutional, the United States Supreme Court recognized that IQ test scores are \u201cimprecise\u201d and have a \u201c \u2018standard error of measurement\u2019 \u201d that \u201cis a statistical fact [and] a reflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself.\u201d Hall, 572 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1995. The Court noted that .the SEM, which the Court recognized to be plus or minus five points on standard IQ tests, \u201creflects the reality that an individual\u2019s intellectual functioning cannot be reduced to a single numerical score,\u201d Hall, 572 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1996, and that, therefore, IQ test scores are not \u201cfinal and conclusive evidence of a defendant\u2019s intellectual capacity,\u201d and \u201cshould be read not as a single fixed number but as a range.\u201d Hall, 572 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Because of the inherent imprecision in IQ testing, the Court noted, \u201c[flor professionals to diagnose\u2014and for the law then to determine\u2014whether an intellectual disability exists once the SEM applies and the individual\u2019s IQ score is 75 or below the inquiry would consider factors indicating whether the person had deficits in adaptive functioning.\u201d Hall, 572 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1996. In other words, \u201can individual with an IQ test score \u2018between 70 and 75 or lower,\u2019 Atkins, [536 U.S.] at 309 n. 5, may show intellectual disability by presenting additional evidence regarding difficulties in adaptive functioning.\u201d 572 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2000.

Ex parte Perkins, 851 So.2d 453, 456 (Ala.2002). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-17\">\u201cThose states with statutes prohibiting the execution of a mentally retarded defendant require that - a defendant, to be considered mentally retarded, must have significantly subaverage intellectual functioning (an IQ of 70 or below), and significant or substantial deficits in adaptive behavior. Additionally, these problems must have manifested themselves during the developmental period (i.e., before the defendant reached age 18).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-18\">Ex parte Perkins, 851 So.2d at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-19\">Later, in Smith v. State, 213 So.3d 239 (Ala.2007), the Alabama Supreme Court reiterated and clarified Alabama\u2019s definition of intellectual disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-20\">\u201cIn Ex parte Perkins, [851 So.2d 453 (Ala.2002),] we concluded that the \u2018broadest\u2019 definition of mental retardation consists of the following three factors: (1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning (i.e., an IQ of 70 or below); (2) significant or substantial deficits in adaptive behavior; and (3) the manifestation of these problems during the defendant\u2019s developmental period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>(i.e., before the defendant reached age 18). 851 So.2d at 456. All three factors must be met in order for a person to be classified as mentally retarded for purposes of an Atkins claim. Implicit in the definition is that the subaverage intellectual functioning and the deficits in adaptive behavior must be present at the time the crime was committed as well as having manifested themselves before age 18. This conclusion finds support in examining the facts we found relevant in Ex parte Perkins and Ex parte Smith [, 213 So.3d 214 (Ala.2003),] and finds further support in the Atkins decision itself, in which the United States Supreme Court noted: \u2018The American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) defines mental retardation as follows: \u201cMental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.\u201d \u2019 536 U.S. at 308 n. 3 (second emphasis added). Therefore, in order for an offender to be considered mentally retarded in the Atkins context, the offender must currently exhibit sub-average intellectual functioning, currently exhibit deficits in adaptive behavior, and these problems must have manifested themselves before the age of 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">\u201cThe definition set' forth in Ex parte Perkins is in accordance with the definitions set forth in the statutes of other states and with recognized clinical definitions, including those found in the American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.1994). The Manual of Mental Disorders lists four degrees of mental retardation: mild, moderate, severe, and profound. Id at 40-41. All four degrees of mental retardation require that all three prongs of the Ex parte Perkins test be satisfied before an individual can be diagnosed as mentally retarded; thus, if the defendant proves that he or she suffers any degree of mental retardation, the defendant is ineligible for the death penalty. However, a classification of \u2018borderline intellectual functioning\u2019 describes an intelligence level that is higher than mental retardation, id. at 45 and, thus, does not render a person ineligible for the death penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">213 So.3d at 248-49 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">The Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s definition of intellectual disability adopted in Ex parte Perkins comports with both Atkins and Hall, supra. Although the definition references an IQ score of 70, that referenced score is not a strict cutoff for intellectual disability, and Alabama does not preclude a court\u2019s consideration of the SEM when considering a person\u2019s IQ score. See Lane v. State, [Ms. CR-10-1343, April 29, 2016] \u2014 So.3d - (Ala.Crim.App.2016) (opinion after remand by the United States Supreme Court). Nor does Alabama preclude a person-from presenting additional evidence regarding intellectual disability merely because that person attained an IQ score above 70. Indeed, this Court, subsequent to Ex parte Perkins, twice recognized that a person may be intellectually disabled even- if that person attains an IQ score above 70 on a test, see Jackson v. State, 963 So.2d 150 (Ala.Crim.App.2006) (holding that Rule 32 petitioner was intellectually disabled even though he achieved a score above 70 on one of four IQ .tests h,e had taken), and Tarver v. State, 940 So.2d 312, 318 (Ala.Crim.App.2004) (remanding for a hearing to determine intellectual disability where record indicated that Rule 32 petitioner had IQ scores\u2019of 76, 72, and 61), and we three times recognized the; SEM in evaluating an Atkins claim. See Smith v. State, 112 So.3d 1108 (Ala.Crim.App.2012); Byrd v. State, 78 So.3d 445 (Ala.Crim.App.2009); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>and Brown v. State, 982 So.2d 565 (Ala.Crim.App.2006). Additionally, in Ex parte Smith, 213 So.3d 214, 225 (Ala.2003), the Alabama Supreme Court noted that an IQ score of 72 \u201cseriously undermines any conclusion that [a person] suffers from significantly subaverage intellectual functioning as contemplated under even the broadest definitions,\u201d but it did not hold that an IQ score of 72 precludes a finding that a person suffers from significantly subaver-age intellectual functioning or precludes a finding of intellectual disability. Both this Court\u2019s and the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s post-Atkins opinions make clear that a court should look at all relevant evidence in assessing an intellectual-disability claim and that no one piece of evidence, such as an IQ test score, is conclusive as to intellectual disability,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">At the evidentiary hearing, Reeves introduced a plethora of records from his childhood and adolescent years, including school records, medical records, mental-health records, juvenile-court records, Department of Youth Services records, and county-health-department records. Those records reflect that Reeves was habitually truant and engaged in defiant and aggressive behavior in school, that he had a lengthy criminal history, and that he had been committed to the Department of Youth Services. The records further reflect that Reeves began mental-health treatment in 1986, when he was.8 years old. Reeves was initially diagnosed with attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity and was later also diagnosed with conduct-disorder. Nonetheless, .Reeves was described as \u201cextremely goal-directed.\u201d (C. 1556.) When Reeves began treatment, his intelligence level was \u201cestimated to be low average range.\u201d (C. 1515.) Two years later, \u201cit [wa]s. estimated that his intelligence is somewhat below average, but not within the [intellectual-disability] range.\u201d (C. 1543.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">The records -further reflect that Reeves had to repeat the first, third, and fourth grades and that he was \u201csocially\u201d promoted to the seventh grade when he was 14 years old based only on his \u201clevel of maturity.\u201d (C. 1688.) However, the records indicate that although Reeves failed the first grade, when he repeated that grade, he. got A\u2019s and B\u2019s and made the -,honor roll: (C. 1513.) .Additionally, Reeves\u2019s mother reported that when he was 11 years old, Reeves was tested for placement into special-education classes, but that he \u201cdid not qualify.\u201d (C. 1543.) Reeves was later placed in special-education classes for emotional conflict. When he was 14 years old, Reeves was administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Revised (\u201cWISC-R\u201d), and he attained a verbal IQ score of 75, a performance IQ score of 74, and a full-scale IQ score of 73. At that time, Reeves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>was classified as being in the borderline range of intellectual functioning, but was described as having \u201csevere deficiencies in non-verbal social intelligence skills and his ability to see consequences.\u201d (C. 1590.) Reeves was subsequently expelled from school for behavioral reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Reeves also presented testimony from John R. Goff, a neuropsychologist who evaluated Reeves for purposes of the post-conviction proceedings to determine whether Reeves was intellectually disabled. As part of his evaluation, Dr. Goff examined Reeves\u2019s childhood and adolescent records and administered a battery of tests to Reeves. First, Dr. Goff administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (\u201cWAIS-III\u201d), on which Reeves attained a verbal IQ score of 71, a performance IQ score of 76, and a full-scale IQ score of 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">However, Dr. Goff stated that Reeves\u2019s full-scale IQ score of 71 should be adjusted downward for the SEM, which he initially said was plus or minus 2 points but later said on cross-examination was plus or minus 5 points, and for the \u201cFlynn Effect.\u201d Dr. Goff explained that the first requirement for a diagnosis of intellectual disability is significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, which generally requires the person to have an IQ of approximately 70 or below. However, Dr. Goff said that research had shown that scores on IQ tests tend to get higher year after year by approximately 0.3 points per year. According to Dr. Goff, this increase in scores, known as the \u201cFlynn Effect,\u201d requires that the IQ test be \u201cnormed\u201d periodically so that the mean score on the test stays the same. Dr. Goff testified that the WAIS-III was last \u201cnormed\u201d in 1996, 10 years before he administered the test to Reeves. According to Goff, the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d is recognized as valid and requires that 0.3 points be deducted from the full-scale IQ score achieved on an IQ test for each year since the test was last normed. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Reeves\u2019s \u201cadjusted\u201d full-scale IQ score on the WAIS-III, Dr. Goff said, was 66. To reach this conclusion, Dr. Goff subtracted three points for the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d and subtracted an additional two points for the SEM. However, Dr. Goff said that for purposes of diagnosing Reeves as intellectually disabled \u201c[i]t doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether his full-scale IQ score was adjusted \u201cbecause the criteria is that the IQ score has to be around 70 [and] he qualifies because 71 is around 70.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (R. 43.) Dr. Goff also testified that Reeves\u2019s full-scale IQ score of 73 on the WISC-R that was administered to him in 1992, if adjusted solely for the \u201cFlynn Effect,\u201d would have been 67.6. Dr. Goff testified that Reeves\u2019s IQ score in 1992 was \u201cstatistically identical\u201d to his IQ score in 2006. (R. 45.) Additionally, Dr. Goff said, Dr. Kathy Ro-nan, who had evaluated Reeves in 1997 before Reeves\u2019s trial to determine Reeves\u2019s competency to stand trial and his mental state at the time of the offense, had administered the verbal portion of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Revised (\u201cWAIS-R\u201d), the predecessor to the WAIS-III, and that Reeves had achieved a verbal IQ score of 74 at that time. Dr. Goff said that if that score were adjusted for the \u201cFlynn Effect,\u201d it would be 69.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">On cross-examination, Dr. Goff admitted that an article had been published in 2006, the year the evidentiary hearing was held, by Dr. James Flynn, the psychologist after whom the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d was named, in which Dr. Flynn admitted that the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d had not, in fact, been generally accepted as scientifically valid. Dr. Goff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>also admitted on cross-examination that he did not begin adjusting IQ scores for the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d until approximately a year and a half before the evidentiary hearing, even though the first article about the phenomenon was published in 1984, some 22 years before the hearing. He also admitted that the \u201cscoring manual\u201d for the WAIS-III does not require the use of the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d to get an accurate IQ score, and that' the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (\u201cDSM-IV\u201d), does not mention the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d; the DSM-IV mentions only the SEM of plus or minus five points. Dr. Goff also said that he would not have adjusted Reeves\u2019s IQ score for the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d if he had evaluated Reeves in 1997, before Reeves\u2019s trial, but he maintained that he would still have concluded that Reeves was intellectually disabled. Without the \u201cFlynn Effect,\u201d but considering the SEM, Dr. Goff said, Reeves\u2019s full-scale IQ score would fall between 66 and 76. Finally, Dr. Goff stated that Reeves would not qualify to be institutionalized for intellectual disability based on his IQ scores, although Reeves \u201cmight qualify\u201d for placement in a group home for the intellectually disabled. (R. 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Dr. Goff testified that he also administered two tests to Reeves to determine whether he was malingering on the IQ test\u2014the \u201cTest of Malingered Memory\u201d and the \u201c21-Item Test.\u201d (R. 48.) Dr. Goff said that these tests indicated that Reeves was not malingering, but \u201cwas putting forth a genuine effort.\u201d (R. 49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Dr. Goff also administered a portion of the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test battery, which assesses a person\u2019s neuropsychological functioning and cognitive abilities. Dr. Goff said that Reeves scored poorly on those tests and that Reeves did not even complete one of the tests because \u201c[hjalfway through ... he had made enough errors so that it wasn\u2019t necessary to continue the test because we had come to the conclusion that he couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d (R. 39.) Dr. Goff said that Reeves\u2019s performance on the Halstead-Reitan tests was \u201cnot -inconsistent with\u201d and \u201cwould tend to\u201d support a conclusion that Reeves was intellectually disabled. (R. 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Dr. Goff further testified that he administered \u201cthe abbreviated version of the second edition of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test,\u201d which assesses functional academics, one of the areas of adaptive functioning considered in evaluating whether someone is intellectually disabled. (R. 37.) Dr. Goff stated that this test indicated that Reeves could read at a third-grade level, that he could do math at a fourth-grade level, and that he could spell at a fifth-grade level, thus showing a deficit in functional academics. Dr. Goff described Reeves as illiterate because Reeves could not read at a fifth-grade level. Dr. Goff stated that Reeves was able to do basic multiplication and two-digit subtraction and addition, but stated that he could not do multi-digit multiplication, use decimals, or do division. When questioned by the circuit court, Dr. Goff said that generally a person with a low IQ will also have deficits in functional' academics. However, Dr. Goff said, most mildly intellectually disabled people can learn to read at about a fifth- or sixth-grade level and that that level of reading would not qualify as a significant deficit in functional academies.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">Dr. Goff testified that another test for adaptive'functioning is the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System Test (\u201cABAS test\u201d), which Dr. Goff said, is administered not to the individual being evaluated but to someone who is close to and familiar with the individual being evaluated. The ABAS test is \u201cnormed against the general popula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>tion\u201d to determine how a person\u2019s abilities compare to the general population, as opposed to just the intellectually disabled population. (R. 59.) Dr. Goff administered this test to Beverly Seroy, who appears to have been the former stepmother of Reeves\u2019s brother, Julius, and with whom Reeves had lived off and on for a period' of time before the murder. Dr. Goff testified that he interviewed Seroy for 45 minutes before -administering the test to her \u25a0 to determine whether she knew Reeves well enough to complete:the test. Dr. Goff said that Seroy had told him that \u201cshe thought she knew [Reeves] very well.\u201d (R. 62.) Dr. Goff also said that Seroy was able to provide him with \u201csome historical information\u201d' about- Reeves. (R. 62.) Thus, Dr. Goff concluded, Seroy was an appropriate person to whom to administer the ABAS test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Goff further testified that he did not administer' the ABAS test to Reeves\u2019s mother because (1) he did not know how to contact her; (2) he had been told that she was mentally ill; and (3) mothers ar\u00e9 \u201cnot necessarily\u201d the best people to administer the test to because, he said, they either tend to \u201coverestimate the capacities of their offspring\u201d or tend to \u201cunderestimate the capacities of their offspring.\u201d (R. 70.) When questioned by the circuit court about the ABAS test, which indicated that Seroy had \u201csimply guessed\u201d on 19 of the 24 questions regarding the \u201cwork\u201d area of adaptive functioning, Dr. Goff stated that Seroy\u2019s guessing \u201cdoes cast some doubt as to the validity of , that particular finding,\u201d i.e., the finding by Dr. Goff that Reeves had significant deficits in the work area of adaptive functioning. (R. 71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Dr. Goff testified that the results- of the ABAS test indicated that Reeves had significant deficits in the following areas of adaptive functioning: health and safety, which . Dr. Goff described as whether a person looks both, ways before crossing the street, whether a person knows how to get to: a hospital if necessary, and. whether a person can take care of personal health needs, such as brushing teeth, taking medications, and getting an annual physical; self-care, which Dr. Goff said overlaps with health and safety, but also includes such things as whether the person can prepare food, can pay the bills, or can get a haircut when necessary without being told; self-direction; functional academics; leisure activities, which Dr. Goff described as how a person spends , his or her free time, i.e., whether the person spends it productively or in goal-directed activities or whether the person \u201cjust kind of like hang[s] out and do[esn\u2019t] ever do anything in [his or her] leisure time activities\u201d (R. 57); and work, which Dr. Goff described as whether the person has a job, whether the person arrives on time to the job, and whether the person gets along with coworkers. Dr. Goffs written report indicates that Reeves scored iii the 16th percentile in the area of communication; in the 9th percentile in the areas of community use and home living; in the 5th percentile in the areas of functional academics, self-direction, leisure, and social skills; in the 4th percentile in the area of work; and in the 2nd percentile in the areas of health and safety and self-care. (G. 701.) Dr. Goff admitted on cross-examination that he did not consider Reeves\u2019s actions surrounding the murder in assessing Reeves\u2019s- adaptive functioning; Dr. Goff said that Reeves\u2019s actions (surrounding the murder were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>relevant to determining whether Reeves was intellectually disabled. Dr. Goff also admitted on cross-examination that it was \u201cnot surprising\u201d that Reeves\u2019s adaptive functioning was \u201clow\u201d because, he said, \u201c[m]ost people in prison have low adaptive skills.\u201d (R. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Based on Reeves\u2019s \u201cadjusted\u201d IQ scores, the results of the ABAS test, and all the other information before him, Dr. Goff concluded that Reeves suffered from significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and significant deficits in multiple areas of adaptive functioning and that both manifested themselves before Reeves was 18 years old. Therefore, Dr. Goff concluded that Reeves was intellectually disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Reeves also presented testimony from Karen Salekin, a forensic and developmental psychologist, who conducted a mitigation investigation for purposes of the postconviction proceedings. Dr. Salekin\u2019s testimony centered around her investigation of mitigating, evidence, specifically, her assessment of risk factors in Reeves\u2019s life\u2014i.e., factors that negatively influenced Reeves\u2019s development\u2014and protective factors in Reeves\u2019s life\u2014i.e., factors that positively influenced Reeves\u2019s development. The bulk of that testimony need not be repeated for purposes of this issue. Pertinent to Reeves\u2019s intellectual-disability claim, Dr. Salekin testified that Reeves\u2019s school records indicated that he had struggled in school from an early age and that he had \u201clower intelligence.\u201d (R. 179.) However, she said that Reeves\u2019s largely \u201cuntreated\u201d attention-deficit disorder with hyperactivity contributed to his struggles in school. (R. 179.) Dr. Salekin also testified that Reeves had attained a full-scale IQ score of 73 in 1992. She concurred with Dr. Goff that the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d is recognized as valid and requires that IQ scores be adjusted downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Dr. Salekin further testified that Reeves\u2019s brother, Julius,- had had a negative impact on Reeves, and that, although younger than Reeves, Julius was the leader of the two. Dr. Salekin stated that her investigation revealed that Reeves was kind and considerate and that he could follow directions when he was not around Julius and that it was only when he was around Julius that his behavior deteriorated. For example, Dr. Salekin testified that Jerry Ellis had employed Reeves at his construction company for approximately three months around , the time of the crime. Dr. Salekin said that Ellis reported that Reeves was a good employee\u2014 Reeves arrived at work on time, was responsive to directions, was motivated, had a, \u201creally good work ethic,\u201d and \u201cwas responsible.\u201d (R. 140.) However, Reeves was employed by Ellis only during the time Julius was in a juvenile-detention facility. Dr. Salekin said that once Julius was released from juvenile detention, Reeves never went back to work. Dr. Salekin also testified that her investigation revealed that Reeves lived \u201cintermittently\u201d with Beverly Seroy because his mother\u2019s house was too crowded. (R. 193.) Dr. Salekin said that Seroy provided Reeves with structure when he lived with her, requiring that Reeves obey the rules, do his homework, do chores, and abide by a curfew. Dr. Salekin said that Seroy reported that Reeves did well when he lived with her, often helping her take c\u00e1re of her own children, and that Seroy \u201ctrusted [Reeves] implicitly\u201d to babysit her children. (R. 194.) At one point, Dr. Salekin said, Seroy even hired a tutor to help Reeves with his: schoolwork and would drive Reeves to the library so that he could earn his GED.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">In rebuttal, the State called Glen David King, a clinical and forensic psychologist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>who also evaluated Reeves for the postcon-viction proceedings to determine whether Reeves was intellectually disabled. Dr. King, like Dr. Goff, had looked at various records relating to Reeves and administered a battery of tests to Reeves. Dr. King also had looked at the testimony of Reeves\u2019s mother during Reeves\u2019s trial and at Dr. Goffs data. Dr. King testified that he administered to Reeves the WAIS-III and that Reeves attained a verbal IQ score of 69, a performance IQ score of 73, and a full-scale IQ score of 68. Dr. King described the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d as \u201ca theoretical position\u201d that there is \u201can increase in performance\u201d on IQ tests \u201csuch that IQ scores seem to rise gradually over a period of time.\u201d (R. 242.) However, Dr. King said that the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d is not required to be taken into account when evaluating someone for intellectual disability and that the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d is \u201cnot settled\u201d in the \u201cpsychological community.\u201d (R. 244-45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Dr. King also administered the Wide Range Achievement Test to determine Reeves\u2019s reading, spelling, and math abilities. Dr. King said that the test indicated that Reeves could read at a fifth-grade level, that he could spell at a fifth-grade level, and that he could do arithmetic at a fourth-grade level. With respect to arithmetic, Dr. King said, Reeves was able to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and simple division. Dr. King said that Reeves\u2019s scores on the achievement test were \u201chigher than ordinarily would be predicted by the IQ test\u201d he had administered to Reeves. (R. 224.) In other words, Reeves\u2019s achievement-test scores \u201cindicate[d] a level of functioning higher than the IQ scores actually indicated.\u201d (R. 224.) Dr. King said that because of the discrepancy between Reeves\u2019s scores on the IQ test and the achievement test, those scores were not adequate, by themselves, for him to reach a conclusion as to whether Reeves was intellectually disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Dr. King also administered all but one of the tests that are included in the Hal-stead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test battery.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Halstead-Reitan tests, Dr. King said, are used to determine if a person has any impairment in brain function. Dr. King said that Reeves had no impairment in \u201csensory perceptional functioning,\u201d which he said indicates whether a person is properly receiving external stimuli. (R. 236.) Dr. King said that Reeves had some impairment in his motor functioning. Although he had \u201cgood motor strength in his upper limb[s],\u201d Reeves had impairment in f\u00edne motor coordination, such as tapping his fingers. (R. 237.) Dr. King stated that he could not explain \u201cexactly why\u201d Reeves had impairment in fine motor coordination, although sometimes deficits in this test will appear when the test is administered to a person with lower IQ. With respect to attention, concentration, and memory, Dr. King testified that Reeves had good attention and concentration, but that he scored \u201cbelow average\u201d with respect to memory. (R. 239.) Nonetheless, Dr. King said, Reeves was able to recall in \u201cfairly good detail ... historical events such as where he went to school and what happened when and who represented him at trial and things of that nature.\u201d (R. 239.) With respect to \u201clanguage skills,\u201d Dr. King said, Reeves was \u201cbelow average.\u201d (R. 240.) With respect to \u201cvisual spacial skills,\u201d which Dr. King described as \u201c[t]he ability to copy designs,\u201d Dr. King testified that Reeves had \u201csome impairment.\u201d (R. 240.) Specifically, Dr. King said that Reeves was \u201cactually able to copy designs very accurately most of the time [but he had] problems with more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>complex designs.\u201d (R. 240-41.) As for \u201creasoning and logical analysis,\u201d which Dr. King described as \u201chigher cortical functioning, ability to engage in abstract reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, taking new information and being able to apply it to solve problems,\u201d Reeves \u201cperformed well below average.\u201d (R. 241.) Dr. King stated that this indicated only that Reeves was \u201cslower to learn new things,\u201d not that he \u201ccan\u2019t learn,\u201d and that, in his opinion, Reeves had \u201csome impairment\u201d in this area. (R. 241.) Dr. King testified that Reeves\u2019s results on the Hal-stead-Reitan tests were consistent with Reeves\u2019s being in the borderline range of intellectual functioning, as opposed to the intellectual-disability range of functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Dr. King also administered to Reeves the Adaptive Behavior Scale, Residential and Community, Second Edition (\u201cABS-RC-II\u201d). Dr. King stated that this test is one of the tests recommended by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities for measuring adaptive functioning. The test measures skill level in several different \u201cdomains.\u201d (R. 226.) To score the test, Dr. King said, the test giver uses information provided by the test subject, the test giver\u2019s observations, and information from other individuals who know the test subject. Dr. King stated that the ABS-RC-II is \u201cnormed\u201d or scored, not against the population as a whole, but against those in the borderline range of intellectual functioning and those who are intellectually disabled. Dr. King said that this is because \u201cthe AAMR has taken the position that in order to diagnose somebody as mentally retarded, their adaptive abilities have to be substantially below that particular group.for which [the test] is normed.\u201d (R. 267.) However, on cross-examination, Dr. King conceded that the Mental Retardation Definition Classification and Systems of Support, 10th edition, a text published by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, states: \u201cFor diagnosis, significant limitations, in adaptive behaviors should be established through the use of standardized measures normed on the general population including people with disabilities and people without disabilities.\u201d (R. 274.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Dr. King obtained scores on the ABS-RC-II from Reeves in 10 different \u201cdomains\u201d of adaptive functioning. Dr. King testified that Reeves scored in the 99th percentile in the domain of independent functioning, which Dr. King described as \u201cbehaviors that have to do with things like use of table utensils, personal hygiene, being able to dress oneself, and a sense of direction, for example, use of transportation,\u201d essentially things \u201cthat an individual who can function independently would have to engage in every day in order to take care of themselves.\u201d (R. 227.) Reeves scored in the 98th percentile in the domain of physical development, which Dr. King said simply examines whether a person has any physical disability. In the numbers and time domain,' Reeves also scored in the 98th percentile. Reeves was able to tell time and do addition, subtraction and multiplication. As noted previously, Dr. King also testified that Reeves was able to do simple division.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">In the domain of language development, Reeves scored in the 84th percentile. Dr. King said that Reeves has much better verbal communication than written communication, but that Reeves was nonethe-' less able \u201cat least to get his idea across\u201d in written form.. (R. 229.) For example, Dr. King cited a letter Reeves had written in which Reeves \u2018had indicated that he was not interested in going to school because he could make more money selling drugs. Dr. King stated that, although \u201c[t]he syntax of the letter was not really very good,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Reeves was nonetheless able to get his \u201cmessage across\u201d in the letter* (R. 229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Reeves also scored in the 84th percentile in the responsibility and socialization domains. The responsibility' domain, Dr. King said, includes such things as \u201c[t]aking care of personal belongings, general responsibility, personal responsibility,' like maintaining self control, understanding concepts of being on time.\u201d (R, 232.) Socialization, Dr. King said, included such things as \u201c[c]ooperation, consideration for others, awareness of others, interaction with others, participation in group activities.\u201d (R. 233.) Dr. King also said that in the many hours he spent with Reeves, Reeves was \u201cquite cooperative and easy to get along with.\u201d (R. 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Reeves scored in the 63rd percentile in the domain of economic activity, which \u201chas to do with the handling of money, banking activities, budgeting, being able to run errands, purchasing things, being able to use shopping resources.\u201d (R. 228.) With respect to this domain, Dr. King said that Reeves was able to handle his own money, to pay bills, and to purchase personal items, but that Reeves had never used a credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In the domestic-activity domain, Reeves scored in the 25th percentile. Dr. King said the domestic-activity domain includes such things a \u201croom cleaning, doing laundry, table setting, food preparation, table clearing.\u201d (R. 230.) Dr. King said that, based on all the information he had, Reeves had never been required to do any type of domestic activity growing up and had been incarcerated since he was 18 years old. Therefore, Dr. King said, \u201che scored very low on those kinds of activities because I couldn\u2019t in good conscience rate him highly on those things. I didn\u2019t have any data to support it.\u201d (R. 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Reeves also scored in the 25th percentile in the domains of prevocational/vocational activity and self-direction. Prevocational/vocational activity, Dr. King said, \u201chas to do with job complexity, work, school, job performance and work school habits.\u201d (R. 230.) Dr. King said that Reeves scored low in this domain because \u201c[h]e did not get to the age where he might be able to m'aster use of complex job tools or equipment\u201d and because school records indicated that Reeves often missed school and had \u201cpretty poor school habits.\u201d (R. 230-31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Self-direction, Dr. King said, \u201chas to do with showing initiative, attention, persistence and directing one\u2019s own activities.\u201d (R. 231.) Dr. King said that he scored Reeves low in this domain but that since the testing, he had had the opportunity to speak with Detective Pat Grindle, an officer with the Selma Police Department, who had known Reeves \u201cquite well\u201d since Reeves was about nine years old. (R. 231.) Dr. King said that Det. Grindle told him that from an early age, Reeves \u201cwas involved in a lot of drug activity and was actually directing the behaviors and activities of. others in this drug related activity.\u201d (R. 231-32.) The degree of Reeves\u2019s involvement in drug activity, including not only what Det. Grindle- reported but also Reeves\u2019s admission to Dr. King that he made between $1500 and $2000 a week selling drugs and was able to purchase his own car, Dr. King said, \u201cwould indicate much more self-direction than the way that I rated him.\u201d (R. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Based on his testing of Reeves and all the other information before him, Dr. King concluded that Reeves was in the borderline range of intellectual ability, but was not intellectually disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">' On cross-examination, Dr. King admitted that he did not speak to any of Reeves\u2019s family members in conducting his evaluation. However, he said that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>was information in many of the records he examined that was inconsistent with a finding of intellectual' disability. Specifically, Dr. King said that Reeves\u2019s repeated IQ scores of over 70, and his placement in \u201cemotional conflict classes\u201d in school as opposed to placement in \u201cspecial education for mental retardation services\u201d were inconsistent with a finding of intellectual disability. (R. 253.) Dr. King also stated on cross-examination that, based strictly on the IQ test-he administered, Reeves satisfied the first prong for determining intellectual disability\u2014significantly subaverage intellectual functioning\u2014because Reeves achieved a full-scale IQ score of 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In its order, the circuit court found that Reeves had failed to satisfy his burden of proving that he was intellectually disabled. After summarizing the testimony presented at the hearing and the relevant law, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">\u201cThere is no dispute that Reeves\u2019s IQ is sub-average. However, the expert testimony about Reeves\u2019s adaptive functioning was conflicting. Before addressing the merits of Reeves\u2019s mental retardation claim, this Court believes it should first discuss the conflicting expert testimony about the Flynn Effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">\u201cDr. Goff and Dr. Salekin indicated that the Flynn Effect is accepted in the scientific community while Dr. King stated that it was not. The Court notes that Dr. Goff testified that Dr. Flynn published his findings in 1984. However, Dr. Goff did not start utilizing the Flynn Effect until 2005\u2014years after the Flynn Effect came into existence. There was no dispute that neither the publishers of the IQ tests , administered on Reeves nor the DSM-IV require that the Flynn Effect must be utilized in determining a person\u2019s intellectual functioning. While there was testimony that appellate courts outside of- Alabama have addressed the application of the Flynn Effect, this Court is unaware of any Alabama caselaw requiring use of the Flynn Effect.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] It does not appear to this Court that the issue of whether the Flynn Effect should be considered when reviewing an individual\u2019s IQ score, at least in Alabama, is settled in the scientific community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">. \u201cReeves achieved .a full scale IQ score of 73 on a test administered when he was 14 years old. The full scale IQ score of 71 achieved by Reeves on the test administered by Dr. Goff is consistent with his prior IQ score of 73. See Ex parte Smith, 213 So.3d 214 (Ala.2003) (holding that a full scale IQ score of 72 .\u2018seriously undermines any conclusion that [a defendant] suffers from significantly sub-average intellectual functioning contemplated under even the broadest definitions [of mental retardation]\u2019). Further, Reeves testified during a pretrial suppression hearing and the Court recalls nothing indicating that Reeves\u2019s intellectual functioning was significantly sub-average. See Clisby v. Alabama, 26 F.3d 1054, 1056 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that Clisby\u2019s testimony gave the trial judge \u2018an opportunity to gauge roughly his intelligence\u2019). This Court concludes that Reeves\u2019s intellectual functioning, while certainly sub-average, is not significantly sub-average.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">\u201cA review of the trial transcript indicates that Reeves does not suffer from significant or substantial limitations in his adaptive functioning. Testimony at trial indicated that Reeves was a gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>member. Further, Reeves\u2019s mother testified that while Reeves attended Job Corp he earned certificates in welding, brick masonry, and auto mechanics\u2014 jobs that would require some degree of technical skill. Reeves\u2019s mother also testified that after he returned from Job Corp that Reeves worked for Jerry Ellis doing carpentry and roofing. While he worked for Mr. Ellis, Reeves would get up as early as 5:30 a.m. to be ready for work. It was only after his younger bother Julius returned from being confined in the juvenile facility at Mt. Meigs that Reeves chose to stop working for Mr. Ellis. According to his mother, Reeves went with Julius because he was afraid his brother would get shot. Reeves had extensive contact with juvenile authorities and with law enforcement prior to his arrest for the victim\u2019s murder. In a pretrial mental evaluation, Dr. Kathy Ronan diagnosed Reeves as suffering from Adaptive Paranoia\u2014 that is, he adapted his behavior in order to survive in the dangerous environment in which he lived. Reeves reported to Dr. King that he sold drugs and sometimes made between $1500 and $2000 per week. Reeves used the money from his drug dealing to purchase clothes, food, and a car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-4\">\u201cThe record also reveals that Reeves and his codefendants planned to commit a robbery. It is undisputed that Reeves actively participated in the planning of the robbery. There was no evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing suggesting that Reeves\u2019s participation in the planning of the robbery or the ultimate murder and robbery of the victim was the result of being coerced or threatened by another person. The evidence from trial, including the compelling testimony from one of Reeves\u2019s co-defendants, proved beyond a reasonable [doubt] that it was Reeves, and Reeves alone, that decided to murder the victim. After he shot the victim, Reeves hid incriminating items of evidence, including the murder weapon and bloody clothes that he and his codefendants had worn. In addition, Reeves split the proceeds with his codefendants, was boastful to others about shooting the victim, and seemed proud that he might get a tear drop\u2014a gang symbol indicating that a gang member had killed another person. See Ex parte Smith, [213 So.3d at 250] (wherein the court considered Smith\u2019s actions after committing murder as a factor in concluding that Smith \u2018does not suffer from deficits in his adaptive functioning\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">\u2018\u201cIn the context of an Atkins claim, the defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is mentally retarded and thus ineligible for the death penalty.\u2019 Ex parte Smith, 213 So.3d 239, 252 (Ala. 2007). After considering the evidence presented at Reeves\u2019s trial and the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing, this Court concludes that Reeves failed to meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that he is mentally retarded and that his death sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. Rule 32.3, Ala. R.Crim. P. This claim for relief is, therefore, denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">(C. 949-53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">With respect to the intellectual-functioning prong of intellectual disability, Reeves contends that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that [he] has significantly subaverage intellectual functioning\u201d and that the circuit court erred in finding that he did not. (Reeves\u2019s brief, p. 41.) Specifically, Reeves asserts that the circuit court erred in rejecting the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d and in not deducting points from his IQ scores to account for that phenomenon. Reeves also appears to as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>sert that the circuit court was required to find that he suffered from significantly subaverage intellectual functioning because, he says, all three of his IQ scores fell within the range of significantly subav-erage intellectual functioning, i.e., between 70 and 75 or below, when considering the SEM, and one of his scores was below 70 even without consideration of the SEM.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We reject Reeves\u2019s argument that the circuit court erred in rejecting the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d and in not deducting points from his IQ scores to account for that phenomenon. This Court has repeatedly held that a circuit court is not required to accept, consider, or apply the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d in determining intellectual disability. See Carroll v. State, 215 So.3d 1135, 1151 (Ala.Crim.App.2015) (\u201c[T]he circuit court could have reasonably rejected the \u2018Flynn Effect.\u2019 \u201d); Smith v. State, 112 So.3d 1108, 1131 (Ala.Crim.App.2012) (\u201c[T]his Court has previously held on several occasions that a trial court need not accept the \u2018Flynn Effect\u2019 as binding, and that it has not been accepted as scientifically valid by all courts.\u201d); and Albarran v. State, 96 So.3d 131, 200 (Ala.Crim.App.2011) (\u201c[T]he circuit court could have reasonably rejected the \u2018Flynn Effect.\u2019 \u201d). As noted above, Dr. King testified that it is not required that the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d be taken into account when evaluating someone for intellectual disability and that the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d is \u201cnot settled\u201d in the \u201cpsychological community.\u201d (R. 244-45.) Although Dr. Goff and Dr. Salekin both testified that the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d is generally recognized as valid, Dr. Goff admitted that he did not use the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d for over 20 years after it was first discovered. He also admitted that Dr. Flynn himself, the psychologist who had discovered the \u201cFlynn Effect,\u201d had stated in a recent article that the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d had not, in fact, been generally accepted as valid. Finally, Dr. Goff admitted that the \u201cscoring manual\u201d for the WAIS-III does not require the use of the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d to get an accurate IQ score and that the DSM-IV also does not mention the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d or require its application to IQ scores. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in rejecting the \u201cFlynn Effect\u201d and in not deducting points from Reeves\u2019s IQ scores to account for that phenomenon.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">We also reject Reeves\u2019s argument that the circuit court erred in not considering the SEM. Nothing in the circuit court\u2019s order indicates that the court did not consider the SEM in evaluating Reeves\u2019s claim. Although the circuit court did not specifically mention the SEM in its order, it did state that it had considered all the evidence presented at the evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>hearing and that evidence- included testimony about the SEM.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">We further reject Reeves\u2019s argument that the circuit court was required- to find th\u00e1t he suffered from significantly subav-erage intellectual functioning because, he says, all of his IQ scores fell within the range of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning when the SEM is considered and one of his IQ scores was below 70 even without consideration of the SEM. As noted above, in Hall, the United States Supreme Court recognized that an IQ score, alone, is not determinative of intellectual disability or even of the intellectual-functioning prong <em>of </em>intellectual disability. The Court explained that because of the imprecision in intelligence testing, an IQ score should be considered a range, not \u00e1 fixed number. Subsequently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">\u201cThe consideration of SEM as discussed by the Supreme Court, however, is not a one-way ratchet. The imprecision of IQ testing not only provides that IQ scores above 70 but within the SEM do not conclusively establish a lack of significantly subaverage' general intellectual functioning, but also that IQ scores below 70 but. within the SEM do not conclusively establish the opposite. In other words, a sentencing court may find a defendant to have failed to meet the first prong of the AAMR\u2019s definition of intellectual disability even if his IQ score is below 70 so long as 70 is within the margin of error and other evidence presented provides sufficient evidence of his intellectual functioning,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Mays v. Stephens, 757 F.3d 211, 218 n. 17 (5th Cir.2014).

Stephens, 757 F.3d 211, 218 n. 17 (5th Cir. 2014). We agree with the Fifth Circuit that the standard error of measurement is merely a factor to consider when assessing an individual\u2019s intellectual functioning\u2014one that may benefit or hurt that individual\u2019s Atkins [v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002),] claim, depending on the content and quality of expert testimony presented.

In fact, the Supreme Court steers us away from such rigid assertions by emphasizing that an IQ score represents a \u2018range, not a fixed number,\u2019 Hall, 572 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1999,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">\u201cA district court\u2019s actual application of the standard error of measurement\u2014i.e. whether the concept would make a finding of significantly subaverage intellectual function more likely, less likely, \u2018or have no effect on the court\u2019s determination\u2014is a matter of fact-finding informed by testimony from expert witnesses. See Conner [v. GDCP Warden], 784 F.3d [752,] 766 [(11th Cir.2015)]; Thomas [v. Allen], 607 F.3d [749,] 758 [ (11th Cir.2010) ].

Warden, Georgia Diagnostic &amp; Classification Prison, 818 F.3d 600, 640-41 (11th Cir.2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In this case, Reeves- had full-scale IQ scores of 68, 71, and 73. Considering the SEM, these scores indicate that Reeves\u2019s IQ could be as low as 63 or as high as 78. Reeves\u2019s expert, Dr. Goff, concluded, based on Reeves\u2019s IQ scores as well as all other information before him, that Reeves suffered from significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. On the other hand, the State\u2019s expert, Dr. King, concluded, based on Reeves\u2019s IQ scores'-and all other information before him, that Reeves falls within the borderline range of intellectual functioning. . The circuit court, after considering all the evidence presented at the hearing, and after observing Reeves when Reeves testified at a pretrial hearing, resolved the conflicting expert testimony as to Reeves\u2019s intellectual functioning adversely to Reeves, finding that, although Reeves\u2019s intellectual functioning was subaverage, it was not significantly subaverage as required to meet the first prong of intellectual disability. \u201cConflicting evidence is. always a question for the finder of fact to determine, and a verdict rendered thereon will not.be disturbed on appeal.\u201d Padgett v. State, 668 So.2d 78, 86 (Ala.Crim.App.1995). There is ample evidence in the record to support the circuit court\u2019s finding and we will not disturb the circuit court\u2019s resolution of the conflicting \u2022 expert testimony. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the circuit court in concluding that Reeves failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered from significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">As for the adaptive-functioning prong of intellectual disability, Reeves contends that he \u201cpresented evidence of significant deficits in at least six areas of adaptive functioning and therefore [he] meets\u201d- the requirements for the second prong of intellectual disability\u2014significant deficits in at least two areas of adaptive functioning\u2014 and that the circuit court erred in not so finding. (Reeves\u2019s brief, p. 45.) Specifically, Reeves asserts that the circuit court \u201cerroneously discounted Dr. Goffs findings by pointing to anecdotal tasks that Mr. Reeves can perform, such as his purported planning of the crime, his earning of Job Corps certificates in welding, brick masonry, and auto mechanics, his extremely brief construction employment, and his purported drug selling activities,\u201d none of which, Reeves claims, undermines or refutes Dr. Goffs opinion that Reeves suffers from significant deficits in multiple areas of adaptive functioning. (Reeves\u2019s brief, pp. 50-51.) At oral argument, Reeves further argued that even discounting Dr. Goffs testimony, Dr. King testified that on the ABS-RC-II test, Reeves scored in the 25th percentile in the prevocational/voca-tional, self-direction, and domestic-activity domains,, thus conclusively establishing that Reeves suffered significant deficits in those three areas of adaptive functioning. Therefore, Reeves concludes, the circuit court was required to find that he suffered from significant deficits in at least two areas of adaptive functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Reeves\u2019s arguments in this regard appear to be based solely on his scores on the ABAS test administered by Dr. Goff and the ABS-RC-II test administered by Dr. King. However, contrary to Reeves\u2019s apparent belief, a circuit court is not required to find that a person suffers from significant deficits in adaptive functioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>merely because that person\u2019s scores on a standardized test indicate such deficits. Just as an IQ test is necessarily imprecise and, therefore, not determinative of the intellectual-functioning prong of intellectual disability, standardized tests for adaptive functioning are also necessarily imprecise and, therefore, are not determinative of the adaptive-functioning prong of intellectual disability. Cf., United States v. Davis, 611 F.Supp.2d 472, 493 (D.Maryland, 2009) (noting that \u201cnearly all methods of assessing an individual\u2019s adaptive functioning\u2014particularly in a retroactive analysis\u2014are imperfect\u201d and that, therefore, \u201cthe typical approach used in forensic assessments of adaptive functioning is to collect information from a multitude of sources and look for convergence of findings in order to confirm one\u2019s conclusions\u201d); and Singleton v. Astrue, (No. 2:11CV512-CSC, February 29, 2012) (M.D.Ala.2012) (not reported in F.Supp.2d) (noting that scores on the ABAS-II test are not determinative as to adaptive functioning for purposes of qualification for Social Security disability). Although standardized tests for adaptive functioning are certainly useful in assessing a person\u2019s adaptive functioning, a court should assess such test scores in light of the circumstances of each case and in light of all other relevant evidence regarding adaptive functioning, including the person\u2019s actions at the time of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In this case, the evidence regarding Reeves\u2019s adaptive functioning was conflicting. Although Reeves scored low in the domains of domestic activity, self-direction, and work on the ABS-RC-II test administered by Dr. King and in the areas of self-direction, work, leisure activities, health and safety, self-care, and functional academics on the ABAS test administered by Dr. Goff, thus indicating significant deficits in those areas of adaptive functioning, other evidence was presented that either called into question the validity of those scores and/or indicated that Reeves\u2019s deficits in those areas were not, in fact, significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">For example, Dr. King testified that Reeves scored in the 25th percentile in the domain of domestic activity because Reeves had never been required to do any type of domestic activity growing up and had been incarcerated since he was 18 years old. Dr. Goff testified that it is not unusual for someone who is incarcerated to have low adaptive functioning. Dr. King also testified that he would have scored Reeves higher in the self-direction domain if he had known at the time that he evaluated Reeves that, from an early age, Reeves had been \u201cinvolved in a lot of drug activity and was actually directing the behaviors and activities of others in this drug related activity.\u201d (R. 231-32.) Additionally, Reeves was described in his juvenile mental-health records as \u201cextremely goal-directed,\u201d even at a young age. (C. 1556.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Dr. King further testified that he believed that Reeves\u2019s low score in the work domain was because Reeves \u201cdid not get to the age where he might be able to master use of complex job tools or equipment\u201d before he went to prison, and because school records indicated that Reeves often missed school and had \u201cpretty poor school habits.\u201d (R. 230-31.) Dr. Goff concurred, stating that Reeves\u2019s deficit in the work area \u201cmay be because he had a lack of opportunity.\u201d (R. 62.) Dr. Goff further testified that the validity of Reeves\u2019s low score in this area was questionable in light of the fact that Beverly Seroy, the person to whom he administered the ABAS test, had simply guessed on the majority of questions in this area. Additionally, as the circuit court noted in its order, Reeves had obtained certificates in brick masonry, welding, and automobile mechanics, all of which require some level of technical skill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>and the record indicates that Reeves held a construction job while his brother was incarcerated and that he was a good employee. Furthermore, the evidence indicated that Reeves\u2019s \u201cpoor school habits\u201d were more a product of his defiant behavior in school than of any deficits in adaptive functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Additionally, although Reeves scored low in the health and safety, self-care, and leisure-activity areas on the ABAS test administered by Dr. Goff, on the ABS-RC-II test administered by Dr. King, Reeves achieved the highest score possible in the domain of independent functioning, which included such things as self-care and health and safety, and Reeves also scored high in the domains of responsibility and socialization. Moreover, the evidence indicated that' Reeves sold drugs to make money and that he used that money to buy personal belongings for himself, including a car, and to help pay the household bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Finally, Reeves scored in the 5th. percentile in the area of functional academics on the ABAS test administered by Dr. Goff, and Dr. Goff testified that Reeves was functionally illiterate and could read only at a third-grade level and, therefore, that Reeves suffered from a significant defjcit in this area. However, Dr. Goff indicated that the ability to read at about a fifth- or sixth-grade level would not qualify as a significant deficit in functional academics. Dr. King testified that Reeves was able to read at a fifth-grade level, thus indicating that Reeves did not have a significant deficient in functional academics.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Simply put, the circuit court in this case was faced with conflicting evidence- regarding Reeves\u2019s adaptive functioning, including conflicting expert testimony. Reeves\u2019s expert, Dr. Goff, testified that Reeves suffered from significant deficits in six areas of adaptive functioning. On the other hand, the State\u2019s expert, Dr. King, indicated that, although Reeves scored low on the ABS-RC-II test in three areas of adaptive functioning, those scores were questionable for various reasons. It was for the circuit court to resolve the conflicting evidence and the conflicting expert testimony, and it .obviously resolved the conflicts adversely to Reeves. In doing so, the court appropriately looked at evidence regarding Reeves\u2019s adaptive functioning other than the expert testimony\u2014such as Reeves\u2019s technical abilities-in . brick masonry, welding, and automobile mechanics; Reeves\u2019s ability, to work construction and do so reliably when he was not around his brother, Julius; Reeves\u2019s participation in a drug-sale enterprise in which he was able to make thousands of dollars a week that he then used to purchase personal items and a car; and particularly Reeves\u2019s cold and calculated actions surrounding the murder, including planning the robbery with his codefendants, hiding incriminating evidence after he had shot the victim, splitting the proceeds of the robbery with his codefendants, and bragging about the murder, claiming that he would earn a \u201cteardrop\u201d\u2014a gang tattoo indicating that a gang member had killed someone\u2014for the murder See, e.g., Ex parte Smith, 213 So.3d 313, 320 (Ala.2010) (\u201cWe find especially persuasive Smith\u2019s behavior during the commission of these murders.\u201d) There is ample evidence in the record to support the circuit court\u2019s finding that Reeves did not suffer from significant deficits in at least two areas of adaptive functioning, and we will not disturb the circuit court\u2019s resolution of the conflicting evidence. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the circuit court in finding that Reeves failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered from significant deficits in at least two areas of adaptive functioning.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AhyG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>For these reasons, the circuit court properly denied Reeves\u2019s claim of intellectual disability.</p>\n<p id=\"A6u\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"A8av\">Reeves next contends that the circuit court erred in denying several of his claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afs\">\u201c \u2018In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must meet the two-pronged test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v.

In its order, the circuit court found that Reeves had failed to prove his claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, in part, because he had failed to call Goggans and Wiggins to testify at the evidentiary hearing. On appeal, Reeves argues that the circuit court erred in finding that his failure to call his attorneys to testify resulted in his failing to prove his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims because, he says, \u201cthere is no requirement that trial counsel testify.\u201d (Reeves\u2019s brief, p. 62.) Specifically, Reeves argues that because the Strickland test is an objective one, testimony from counsel is not necessary to prove any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">However, Reeves\u2019s argument fails to take into account the requirement that courts indulge a strong presumption that counsel acted reasonably, a presumption that must be overcome by evidence to the contrary. In Broadnax v. State, 130 So.3d 1232 (Ala.Crim.App.2013), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u201cIt is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without questioning counsel about the specific claim, especially when the claim is based on specific actions, or inactions, of counsel that occurred outside the record.

State, 101 S.W.3d 107, 111 (Tex.Crim.App.2003). This is so because it is presumed that counsel acted reasonably:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">\u201c\u2018The presumption impacts on the burden of proof and continues throughout the case, not dropping out just because some conflicting evidence is introduced. \u201cCounsel\u2019s competence ... is presumed, and the [petitioner] must rebut this presumption by proving that his attorney\u2019s representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms and that the challenged action was not sound strategy.\u201d Kimmelman v.

However, Reeves presented no evidence at the evi-dentiary hearing regarding what mitigation investigation his trial counsel conducted, because Reeves failed- to call trial counsel to testify. Although Reeves argues that counsel\u2019s investigation was not adequate, because the record is silent as to the extent of counsel\u2019s actual investigation, we must presume that counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment in conducting the investigation and that counsel\u2019s decisions resulting from their investigation were also reasonable. The silent record before this Court regarding counsel\u2019s investigation and their resulting decisions as to what evidence to present during the penalty phase of the trial and how to present that evidence is not sufficient to overcome the strong presumption of effective assistance. See, e.g., Woods v. State, 13 So.3d 1, 37 (Ala.Crim.App.2007) (holding, on appeal from four capital-murder convictions and a sentence of death, that the appellant had failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s mitigation investigation constituted deficient performance where the record contained \u201cno evidence about the scope of counsel\u2019s'mitigation-investigation\u201d but contained indications that counsel had at least conducted some mitigation investigation).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">For the reasons set forth above, Reeves failed to satisfy his burden of proof as to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the circuit court properly denied those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">Reeves next contends that the circuit court erred in \u2019 summarily dismissing his claims of juror misconduct without allowing him to pr\u00e9sent evidence to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">In his petition, Reeves alleged that during his trial one of the jurors who sat on his jury improperly communicated with her husband about the trial and improperly watched and read media, coverage of the trial. Reeves further alleged that, during the penalty-phase deliberations, after the jury had entered an informal vote of nine in favor of the death penalty and three in favor of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, that same juror escorted another juror\u2014a juror who Reeves claimed was young and emotional and had originally voted for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole\u2014out of the jury deliberation room and spoke to that juror in private. When the two jurors returned, Reeves alleged, the young and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>emotional juror changed her vote and voted for the death penalty, resulting in a jury verdict of 10 in favor of the death penalty and 2 in favor of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Finally, Reeves alleged that this same juror repeatedly told the other members of the jury that Reeves\u2019s family \u201cwould \u2018come after\u2019 the jurors after - the trial\u201d and stressed to the other jurors that \u201cthe decision to impose the death penalty truly belonged to the judge rather than the jury.\u201d (C. 585.). In support of these claims, Reeves attached to his petition an affidavit from another juror who sat on Reeves\u2019s jury, juror G.B., in which G.B. averred essentially the same facts as Reeves alleged in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">At the conclusion of the Rule 32 eviden-tiary hearing, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACgA\">\u201c[Reeves\u2019s counsel]: ... Judge, there was one other thing. I think when you ruled on the issue of juror misconduct, you indicated that we could put on the record\u2014 \u2022 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I did, and it slipped my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">\u201c[Reeves\u2019s counsel]: And [cocounsel] is going to go ahead and do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">(R. 285-86.) Reeves\u2019s counsel then made an offer of proof regarding, the evidence that would be presented regarding the juror-misconduct claims if the court had allowed such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Although the record contains no order by the circuit court summarily dismissing Reeves\u2019s juror-misconduct claims before the evidentiary hearing, the above exchange indicates that the court had ruled on the claims before the hearing, apparently concluding that the claims did not warrant an evidentiary hearing. In its final order denying Reeves\u2019s petition, the court found that Reeves\u2019s juror-misconduct claims were precluded by Rules 32.2(a)(3) and (a)(5), Ala. R.Crim. P., because they could have been, but were not, raised and addressed at trial and on appeal. Therefore, we consider Reeves\u2019s juror-misconduct claims as having been summarily dismissed without Reeves\u2019s being afforded an opportunity to present evidence to support those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">We agree with Reeves\u2019s argument on appeal that the. circuit court erred in finding that his juror-misconduct claims were precluded by Rules 32.2(a)(3) and (a)(5) on the ground that they could have been, but were not,, raised and addressed at trial and on appeal. See, e.g., Ex parte Hodges, 147 So.3d 973 (Ala.2011); Ex parte Harrison, 61 So.3d 986 (Ala.2010); Ex parte Burgess, 21 So.3d 746 (Ala.2008). However, the circuit court\u2019s error in this regard does not require a remand for further proceedings in this case because we conclude that Reeves\u2019s juror-misconduct claims were not sufficiently pleaded to warrant an evidentiary hearing and, therefore, that the circuit court properly refused to allow Reeves to present evidence on this claim at the Rule 32 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">Rule 32.3, Ala. R.Crim. P., states that \u201c[t]he petitioner shall have the burden of pleading and proving by a preponderance-of the evidence the facts necessary to entitle the petitioner to relief.\u201d Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P., states that \u201c[t]he petition must contain a clear and specific statement of the grounds upon which relief is sought, including full disclosure of the factual basis of those grounds. A bare allegation that a constitutional right has been violated and mere conclusions of law shall not be sufficient to warrant any further proceedings.\u201d To sufficiently plead a claim.of juror-misconduct, a Rule 32 petitioner must, at a minimum, identify the juror who the petitioner believes committed the misconduct, must allege specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>facts indicating what actions that juror took that the petitioner believes constituted misconduct, and must allege specific facts indicating how that juror\u2019s actions denied the petitioner a fair trial. See, e.g., Moody v. State, 95 So.3d 827, 859 (Ala.Crim.App.2011) (holding that Rule 32 petitioner had failed to satisfy his burden of pleading his claim of juror misconduct when the petitioner \u201cfailed to identify a single juror who he believed did not answer questions truthfully during voir dire,\u201d failed to \u201cidentify which questions he believe[d] the jurors did not answer truthfully,\u201d and \u201cfailed to plead what \u2018extraneous\u2019 information he believes was considered during the jury\u2019s deliberations or how that information prejudiced him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">In this case, Reeves failed to identify in his petition the juror he believed committed the misconduct; he referred to the juror only as \u201cJuror Jane Doe.\u201d (C. 584-85.) He also failed to identify the juror who allegedly changed her vote during the penalty-phase deliberations after allegedly speaking with Juror Jane Doe privately. G.B.\u2019s affidavit<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> also failed to identify Juror Jane Doe or the juror who allegedly changed her vote during the penalty-phase deliberations. In a footnote in his petition, Reeves admitted that he knew the identity of both jurors; he alleged that \u201c[significant efforts have been undertaken to identify Juror Jane Doe\u201d and that \u201cby speaking with certain jurors who served on Mr. Reeves\u2019s trial and have been willing to speak with Mr. Reeves\u2019s current counsel, the identities of these jurors are believed to be known.\u201d (C. 585.) Nonetheless, Reeves failed to identify either juror in his petition. In addition, although Reeves alleged that Juror Jane Doe had spoken to her husband about the case and had watched and read media reports about the case, Reeves failed to identify exactly what information Juror Jane Doe received from her husband or from the media reports or how this unidentified information prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Because Reeves failed to identify in his petition Juror Jane Doe, the juror he believed was improperly influenced during the penalty phase of the tidal, or the specific \u201cextraneous\u201d information he believed Juror Jane Doe improperly considered, all of Reeves\u2019s juror-misconduct claims were insufficient to satisfy the pleading requirements in Rule 32.3 and Rule 32.6(b). Moreover, Reeves\u2019s claim that Juror Jane Doe repeatedly told the other members of the jury that Reeves\u2019s family \u201cwould \u2018come after\u2019 the jurors after the trial\u201d and stressed to the other jurors that \u201cthe decision to impose the death penalty truly belonged to the judge rather than the jury\u201d also fails to state a material issue of fact or law upon which relief could be granted. (C. 585.) Reeves\u2019s claim in this regard is based on the debates and discussions of the jury, not on extraneous facts considered by it.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As this Court explained in Bryant v. State, 181 So.3d 1087 (Ala.Crim.App.2011):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that \u2018matters that the jurors bring up in their deliberations are simply not improper under Alabama law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>because the law protects debates and discussions of jurors and statements they make while deliberating their decision.\u2019 Sharrief v. Gerlach, 798 So.2d 646, 653 (Ala.2001). \u2018Rule 606(b), Ala. R. Evid., recognizes the important \u201cdistinction, under Alabama law, between \u2018extraneous facts,\u2019 the consideration of which by a jury or jurors may be sufficient to impeach a verdict, and the \u2018debates and discussions of the jury,\u2019 which are protected from inquiry.\u201d \u2019 Jackson v. State, 133 So.3d 420, 431 (Ala.Crim.App.2009) (quoting Sharrief, supra at 652). \u2018[T]he debates and discussions of the jury, without regard to their propriety or lack thereof, are not extraneous facts.\u2019 Sharrief, 798 So.2d at 653. Thus, \u2018affidavit[s or testimony] showing that extraneous facts influenced the jury\u2019s deliberations [are] admissible; however, affidavits concerning \u201cthe debates and discussions of the case by the jury while deliberating thereon\u201d do not fall within this exception.\u2019 CSX Transp., Inc. v. Dansby, 659 So.2d 35, 41 (Ala.1995) (quoting Alabama Power Co. v. Turner, 575 So.2d 551, 557 (Ala.1991)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">181 So.3d at 1126-27. To allow \u201cconsideration of this claim of juror misconduct\u2014 which is based entirely on the debate and deliberations of the jury\u2014Vould destroy the integrity of the jury system, encourage the introduction of unduly influenced juror testimony after trial, and discourage jurors from freely deliberating, and inhibit their reaching a verdict without fear of post-trial harassment, publicity, or scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d Bryant, 181 So.3d at 1128 (quoting Jones v. State, 753 So.2d 1174, 1204 (Ala.Crim.App.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">For these reasons, the circuit court properly dismissed Reeves\u2019s claims of juror misconduct without affording Reeves an opportunity to present evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Finally, Reeves contends that the circuit court erred in denying, on procedural grounds, the claim in his petition that lethal injection constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">We agree with Reeves that the circuit court erred in finding his constitutional challenge to lethal injection to be precluded by Rules 32.2(a)(3) and (a)(5). Although typically such a constitutional challenge to a sentence would be subject to the preclusions in Rule 32.2(a)(3) and (a)(5), in this case Reeves was convicted and sentenced in 1998 and his convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal in 2000, years before Alabama adopted lethal injection as its primary method of execution. See Act No. 2002-492, Ala. Acts 2002. At the time Reeves was convicted and sentenced to death and during his direct appeal, Alabama\u2019s method of execution was electrocution. It is' well settled \u201cthat trial counsel cannot be held to be ineffective for failing to forecast changes in the law.\u201d Dobyne v. State, 805 So.2d 733, 748 (Ala.Crim.App.2000), aff'd, 805 So.2d 763 (Ala.2001). Because Reeves\u2019s trial and appellate counsel could not have been expected to forecast Alabama\u2019s change in its method of execution, Reeves could not have challenged the constitutionality of lethal injection at trial and on appeal. Therefore, the circuit court erred in find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>ing this claim to be precluded by Rules 32.2(a)(3)-and (a)(5). -</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\">However, the circuit court\u2019s error in this regard does not require this cause to be remanded for further proceedings. First, it is not clear from Reeves\u2019s petition whether Reeves challenged in his petition the constitutionality of lethal injection per se or the constitutionality of Alabama\u2019s specific lethal-injection drug protocol. Because we cannot determine from the\" allegations in his petition exactly which claim Reeves asserted, his claim in this regard necessarily fails to satisfy the pleading requirements in Rule 32.3 and Rule 32.6(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Moreover, to the extent- that Reeves is challenging the constitutionality of lethal injection per se, that claim has been expressly rejected by this Court numerous 'times. See, e.g., Townes v. State, [Ms. CR-10-1892, December 18, 2015] \u2014 So.3d -, -(Ala.Crim.App.2015), and the cases cited therein. To the extent that Reeves is challenging Alabama\u2019s specific drug protocol for lethal injection, the drug protocol Reeves mentioned in his petition\u2014sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride\u2014is no longer the drug protocol Alabama uses for lethal injection. Therefore, Reeves\u2019s challenge in. his petition to that drug protocol, is moot. Additionally, it appears that in his brief on appeal Reeves is attempting to challenge Alabama\u2019s current drug protocol for lethal injection, specifically Alabama\u2019s use of midazolam as a substitute for sodium thiopental. That challenge, however, was not raised in Reeves\u2019s petition and is, therefore, not properly before this Court for review. See Arrington v. State, 716 So.2d 237, 239 (Ala.Crim.App.1997) (\u201cAn appellant cannot raise an issue on appeal from the denial of a Rule 32 petition which was not raised in the Rule 32 petition.\u201d). In any event, the United States Supreme Court has upheld as constitutional the use of midazolam for lethal injection. See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2726, 192 L.Ed.2d 761 (2015). Therefore, Reeves is due no relief on this claim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court denying Reeves\u2019s. Rule 32 petition is due to, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">In affirming the circuit court\u2019s judgment, we recognize that the United States Supreme Court , recently vacated this Court\u2019s judgment in Johnson v. State, [Ms. CR-10-1606, May 20, 2014] - So.3d - (Ala.Crim.App.2014), a case in which the death penalty had been imposed, and remanded the cause for further consideration in light of its opinion in Hurst v. Florida, 577 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 616, 193 L.Ed.2d 504 (2016). See Johnson v. Alabama, 578 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1837, 194 L.Ed.2d 828 (2016). In Hurst, the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional Florida\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme on the ground that it violated its holding in Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), because Florida\u2019s statute authorized a sentence of death based on a finding by the trial judge, rather than by the jury, that an aggravating circumstance existed. The impact, if any, of Hurst -on Alabama\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme has not yet been addressed by this Court .or by the Alabama Supreme Court, We need not address it here because Hurst is not applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Hurst was based solely on its previous opinion in Ring, an opinion the United States Supreme Court held did not apply retroactively on collateral review to cases that were already final when the decision was announced. See Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). Because Ring does not apply retroactively on collateral review, it follows that Hurst also does not apply retroactively on collateral review. Rather, Hurst applies only to cases not yet final when that opinion was released, such as Johnson, supra, a case that was still on direct appeal (specifically, pending certio-rari review in the United States Supreme Court) when Hurst was released. Reeves\u2019s case, however, was final in 2001, 15 years before the opinion in Hurst was released. Therefore, Hurst is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b817-8\">WINDOM, P.J., and WELCH, BURKE, and JOINER, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\">.

In a two-sentence passing argument in its brief on appeal, the State asserts that Hall, decided in 2014, does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. In support of its position, the State relies on In re Henry, 757 F.3d 1151, 1158 (11th Cir.2014), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that Hall \"announce[d] a new rule of constitutional law,\u201d but held that the new rule does not apply retroactively on collateral review for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). We disagree with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s characterization of Hall as a new rule of constitutional law. We view Hall, not as a new rul\u00e9 of constitutional law, but simply as an application of existing law, i.e., Atkins, to a specific set of facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\">. Although in Hall the United States Supreme Court cited Alabama as a state that \"also may use a strict IQ score cutoff at 70,\" 572 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1996 (emphasis added), it did so based on a single comment by this Court in Smith v. State, 71 So.3d 12, 20 (Ala.Crim.App.2008), that the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s definition of intellectual disability did not include consideration of the . SEM. However, this Court held in Smith that the petitioner had failed to plead his claim of intellectual disability, and our statement that consideration of the SEM was precluded was entirely dicta. In any event, this Court recently recognized in Lane v. State, [Ms. CR-10-1343, April 29, 2016] - So.3d - (Ala.Crim.App.2016) (opinion after remand by the United States Supreme Court), that this Court\u2019s statement in Smith was not supported by the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s post-Atkins opinions and was erroneous, and we overruled Smith \u201d[t]o the extent that Smith .:. precludes a trial court from considering a margin of error or SEM when evaluating a defendant\u2019s IQ test score for purposes of an Atkins claim.\u201d \u2014 So.3d at \u2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">. We note that, in his written report, Dr. Goff stated that Reeves\u2019s full-scale IQ score of 71 placed him \"within the borderline range of psychometric intelligence.\" (C. 699.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b792-4\">. In contrast, in his written report, Dr. Goff stated that Seroy \"was not present for the most part during [Reeves's] formative years\u201d and \"[i]t was, therefore, necessary to obtain a substantial amount of information from [Reeves] and from the records in regard to the history.\u201d (C. 697.) \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">.

The circuit court issued the order in 2009, years before this Court first addressed the \"Flynn Effect.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\">. Reeves also maintains in passing that consideration of the SEM makes his IQ scores \"even lower\u201d than reported. (Reeves\u2019s brief, p. 44.) However, contrary to Reeves\u2019s belief, consideration of the SEM would not make his IQ scores \"even lower.\u201d In Byrd v. State, 78 So.3d 445, 452 (Ala.Crim.App.2009), this Court \"rejected the appellant\u2019s] request that we presume that a capital defendant's IQ falls at the bottom of the range of the confidence interval or \u2018margin of error.\u2019 \u201d See also Carroll v. State, 215 So.3d 1135, 1152 (Ala.Crim.App.2015). Although Byrd was released long before the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Hall, nothing in Hall requires a court to presume that a person\u2019s IQ score falls in the bottom of the SEM of plus or minus five points. As noted above, in Hall, the Supreme Court merely recognized that the SEM is a fact that means an IQ score is not determinative of intellectual functioning and must be considered, not as a fixed number, but as a range. See Ledford v. Warden, Georgia Diagnostic &amp; Classification Prison, 818 F.3d 600, 641 (11th Cir.2016) (\"[T]he standard error of measurement is a bi-directional concept that does not carry with it a presumption that an individual\u2019s IQ falls to the bottom of his IQ range.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">. Because we find no error in the circuit court\u2019s findings regarding the first two prongs of intellectual disability, we need not examine the third prong\u2014whether the deficits manifested before the age of 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b809-10\">. We note that Reeves also reasserts on appeal the claim from his petition that his trial counsel were ineffective for allegedly not investigating the possibility that Reeves was not the shooter. However, Reeves mentions this claim only in passing in a single sentence in his brief, and he makes no argument at all in his brief regarding why he believes the circuit court's denial of this claim was error. Reeves\u2019s argument regarding this ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim fails to comply with Rule 28(a)(10), Ala. R.App. P., and it is well settled that the \"[failure to comply with Rule 28(a)(10) has- been deemed a waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>the issue presented.\u201d C.B.D. v. State, 90 So.3d 227, 239 (Ala.Crim.App.2011). Therefore, Reeves\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for allegedly not investigating the possibility that Reeves was not the shooter is deemed waived and will not be considered by this Court. Additionally, we note that Reeves also argues in his brief on appeal that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for not challenging at trial and on appeal the constitutionality of Alabama\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme. Although Reeves raised a claim in his petition that Alabama\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme was unconstitutional under Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), nowhere in his petition did Reeves assert that his trial or appellate counsel were ineffective for not raising a challenge to the constitutionality of Alabama\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme at trial or on appeal. A substantive challenge to the constitutionality of a statute is not the same as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, because Reeves did not raise in his petition claims that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for not challenging the constitutionality of Alabama\u2019s capital-sentencing scheme, those claims are not properly before this Court for review and will not be considered. See Arrington v. State, 716 So.2d 237, 239 (Ala.Crim.App.1997) (\"An appellant cannot raise an issue on appeal from the denial of a Rule 32 petition which was not raised in the Rule 32 petition.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b812-9\">.
