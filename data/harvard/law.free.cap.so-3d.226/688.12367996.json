The parties had been married for 40 years at the time they separated and for 43 years at the time of the trial. At the time of the trial, the husband was 60 years old and the wife was 62 years old. During the marriage, they had four children together. At the time of the trial, the children ranged in age from 42 to 22 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The evidence indicates that the husband enlisted in the United States Army after the parties married; thus, all of his military-retirement benefits were earned during the course of the marriage. Documents contained in the record indicate that, before retiring, the husband attained the rank of sergeant major. The only higher enlisted rank is the Sergeant Major of the Army, which is held by only one person at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">During the husband\u2019s Army career, the wife moved from post to post with him, including three tours in Germany. The wife testified that she had worked at a factory when the parties were newly married and had also worked in food service. She reared the children and did not work outside the home for most of the marriage. The wife testified that, for the last 15 years of the marriage, she had worked for Walmart and was able to transfer to other Walmart stores when the parties moved. The wife had attended a junior college; the husband had earned both a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">At the time of the trial, the wife was a department manager at a Walmart store, earning a gross income of approximately $1,166 every two weeks. The wife\u2019s income-tax return indicated that she earned a total gross income of $34,638 in 2014. However, the wife added that she had been having trouble with her joints. Because her job required her to stand, lift, and bend, she testified, she could not \u201creally do the work that my job requires me to do at Walmart.\u201d Therefore, the wife said, she would be stepping down from the position of department manager to become a sales associate, and her income would decrease as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">The husband was a civilian employee with the Department of Defense. He also operated a tax-preparation business \u201con the side\u201d from which he said he earned little or no income because some of his work was volunteering to prepare tax returns for low-income people. The husband testified that, after his deductions, his adjusted gross income for 2014 was $124,766. He said that his total gross annual income, including his military-retirement pay, was approximately $160,000. Therefore, during the last year of the marriage, the parties had a combined gross income of approximately $190,000. The husband acknowledged that, because of the length of the marriage, the wife was \u201cauthorized\u201d to receive half of his military-retirement income. Even when that amount was deducted from his income, the husband said, he would still be earning approximately $120,000 annually. The husband testified that he had suffered a mild heart attack during the litigation of this matter and that he suffered from depression and anxiety. The husband said that, although he had not been advised against working, he planned on retiring, which, he said, will affect his income.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>The wife testified that, during the marriage, the parties used the husband\u2019s income to pay rent, utilities, and other household bills, including grocery bills. She was able to use her income to buy \u201csomething pretty for the house.\u201d She also said that she paid for her own. clothes and bought expensive purses. The husband used to buy her expensive perfume, the wife said. Although the wife had purchased purses and perfume for herself since the parties separated, .the wife said, she had had to charge the purchases. Evidence indicated that the wife had approximately $1,000 in credit debt at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\">Since the parties separated, the wife testified, she has had to change the way she lives, adding that she \u201cwas kind of crippled when [the husband] left\u201d because she had to pay household bills from her own income. The wife testified that if she were awarded $3,000 a month in periodic alimony, she \u201ccan still live the way I lived when [the husband] was with me.\u201d In fact, the husband testified that he had \u201cagreed to give [the wife] some alimony,\u201d but, he said, he could not maintain that obligation once he retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">' Aside from the husband\u2019s military-retirement benefits, the largest marital asset of the parties is the marital residence. The husband and the wife both testified that, at the time of the trial, the balance owed on the marital residence was approximately, $73,000. The husband \u25a0 testified that the monthly mortgage payment was $724.80. The -tax assessment for the 2014 tax year appraised the marital residence at $147,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">- The husband testified that he had -a number- of financial accounts, including a federal thrift-savings-plan account that had a balance of $34,588.33 as of December 31, 2014, and to which the husband, had continued to contribute monthly; a Charles Schwab account, which, in February 2015, had a balance of $20,643.11; and a Roth Individual Retirement Account (\u201cIRA\u201d) that had a balance of $19,354.01 in February 2015 and to which the husband continued to contribute monthly. The husband testified that he had borrowed a total of $13,130 from the IRA in 2013 and 2014. The husband also had a federal civil-service retirement plan; however, it is not clear from the record the balance of the civil-service retirement plan, The husband and the wife had a joint investment account that had a balance of $3,079.83. The husband testified that he believed that he and the wife should each have a one-half interest in that investment account.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The wife testified that she had a 401(k) account at Walmart that had a balance of approximately $31,000 in September 2012, but, she said, she had removed $10,000 from that account and placed it in an account at Merrill Lynch. The wife also had a Walmart-associate stock plan valued at $25,265 on April 10, 2015, a, Redstone Arsenal Credit Union, money-market account with a balance of approximately $16,000, a credit-union savings account with a balance of approximately $2,000, and an investment account with a balance of approximately $20,670, The wife, said that she and the husband held another investment account together that had a balance of $24,168.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">At the time of the trial, the husband drove a 2004 Chevrolet Suburban sport-utility vehicle, and the wife drove a 2006 Honda Pilot sport-utility vehicle. No debt was owed on either vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">On June 18, 2015, the trial court entered a judgment divorcing the parties. In the judgment, the trial court awarded the husband the marital residence, but ordered him to pay the wife $25,000, which the trial court found represented half of the equity that could be derived from the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>marital residence. The trial court also awarded the wife one-half of the husband\u2019s disposable military-retirement pay each month, as well as one-half of their joint investment account with a balance of $24,168. Each party was awarded the financial accounts held in his or her name, meaning the husband received accounts totaling approximately $87,500, including the $13,000 he had borrowed from his IRA, and the wife received financial accounts totaling approximately $93,000. Each was ordered to be responsible for his or her own debt. Each party was awarded certain personal property and the vehicle he or she was driving at the time the judgment was entered. The value of that personal property is not contained in the record. The husband was ordered to continue to maintain the wife\u2019s health-insurance coverage \u201cuntil such time as [the] wife can become independently insured\u201d under her own primary and secondary health-insurance plans similar to those under which she was covered during the marriage, and he was also ordered to continue to maintain the existing $100,000 life-insurance policy, or a policy with the equivalent face value, as long as the husband was obligated to pay alimony to the wife. Finally, the trial court ordered the husband to pay the wife $2,000 a month in periodic alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Both parties filed motions to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment. On September 15, 2015, after a hearing on the motions, the trial court amended the judgment to order the wife to vacate the marital residence within 30 days. All other claims the parties made in the respective motions were denied. The husband filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The husband contends that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the wife periodic alimony because, he says, the wife failed to establish the standard of living she had during the marriage; the trial court did not consider the wife\u2019s earning capacity and assets; the award leaves the husband \u201cfinancially crippled\u201d; and the evidence does not support an award of alimony. Because these contentions are interrelated, we will discuss them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">It has long been the law that both \u201cthe award and [the] amount of periodic alimony are matters which lie within the discretion of the trial court and may be reversed upon an appeal only for a clear abuse of the trial court\u2019s judicial discretion.\u201d Scott v. Scott, 460 So.2d 1331, 1332 (Ala.Civ.App.1984); Groenendyke v. Groenendyke, 491 So.2d 959, 961 (Ala.Civ.App.1986) (same); and Holmes v.

Stone, 26 So.3d 1232, 1236 (Ala.Civ.App.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In this case, the husband relies on language in the relatively recent opinion of Shewbart v. Shewbart, 64 So.3d 1080, 1087-88 (Ala.Civ.App.2010), to argue that the wife was required to establish that she needed periodic alimony to pay expenses that exceed what she was able to pay from her own income, including her share of the husband\u2019s military-retirement pay and the assets she received from the division of marital property. The husband asserts that the evidence indicated that the wife had sufficient income and assets to pay the monthly expenses she had established at trial. Therefore, the husband contends, the trial court abused its discretion in awarding her any periodic alimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay6U\">\u201c \u2018Matters such as alimony and property division are within the sound discretion of the trial court. Ex parte Drummond, 785 So.2d 358 (Ala.2000); Parrish v. Parrish, 617 So.2d 1036 (Ala.Civ.App.1993); and Montgomery v. Montgomery, 519 So.2d 525 (Ala.Civ.App.1987). The issues of property division and alimony are interrelated, and they must be considered together on appeal. Albertson v. Albertson, 678 So.2d 118 (Ala.Civ.App.1996).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APiA0\">\u2018\u201cIn dividing property and awarding alimony, a trial court should consider \u201cthe earning abilities of the parties; the future prospects of the parties; their ages and health; the duration of the marriage; [the parties\u2019] station[s] in life; the marital properties and their sources, values, and types; and the conduct of the parties in relation to the cause of the divorce.\u201d Russell v. Russell, 777 So.2d 731, 733 (Ala.Civ.App.2000).

Walker, 216 So.3d 1262, 1270-71 (Ala.Civ.App.2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">Shewbart, supra, the case the husband primarily relies upon in his argument as to this issue, involved the issue of whether the trial court had abused its discretion in failing to award the wife in that case periodic alimony. In determining that the trial court had not erred as to that issue, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>court recognized that the decision whether to award periodic alimony rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. 64 So.3d at 1087. We also recognized that, in considering an award of periodic alimony, the trial court is to take into account the \u201cequitable considerations\u201d of the length of the marriage, the standard of living to which the parties became accustomed during the marriage, the relative fault of the parties for the breakdown of the marriage, the ages and health of the parties, and the future employment prospects of the parties. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The opinion in Shewbart correctly stated that a spouse \u201cproves a need for periodic alimony by showing that without such financial support he or she will be unable to maintain the parties\u2019 former marital lifestyle,\u201d id., and that courts are to consider the paying spouse\u2019s ability to meet that need. Id. at 1088. We concluded that the wife in Shewbart had demonstrated that she would be unable to meet all of her financial needs without any periodic alimony but that, based on the trial court\u2019s determination of the husband\u2019s limited income, and the wife\u2019s failure to argue that the husband could pay periodic alimony from that limited income, the trial court had not abused its discretion in refusing to order the husband to pay periodic alimony. Id.-at 1090-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In the present case, the husband would have this court disregard the many factors this court has historically considered in reviewing whether a trial court abused its discretion in awarding periodic alimony and in determining the amount of such an award. Instead, the husband asks this court to look only to the wife\u2019s monthly budget, her income, and the assets she received in the division of prpperty when determining whether an award of periodic alimony is proper. \u25a0 The husband\u2019s argument improperly reduces the determination of whether and how much a party is to receive as periodic alimony - to a rigid mathematical calculation based strictly on the petitioning spouse\u2019s proven monthly expenses on the day of the trial. We note that, in McCarron v. McCarron, 168 So.3d 68, 76 (Ala.Civ.App.2014), this court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">\u201cAs a first step toward proving a need for \u2022 periodic alimony, \u2018a petitioning spouse should ... establish the standard and mode of living of the parties during the marriage and the nature of the financial costs to the parties of maintaining that station in life.\u2019 Shewbart, 64 So.3d at 1088. Although submitting an itemized monthly budget may be a preferred practice, nothing in the law requires a spouse to submit such a budget to the trial court in order to meet that evidentiary burden, as the husband contends. Because of the broad discretion.ary power of a trial court over an award of periodic alimony, see Shewbart, 64 So.3d at 1087, a petitioning spouse need only .present sufficient evidence from which the trial court can reasonably infer the costs associated with the marital standard of living. See generally Grocholski v. Grocholski, 89 So.3d 123 (Ala.Civ.App.2011); 32 Am.Jur. Proof of Facts 2d 439, Spousal Support on Termination of Marriage (1982).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Although courts should consider each party\u2019s monthly expenses and his or her ability to pay-those expenses when determining-if periodic alimony is due to be paid and, if so, the amount of periodic alimony to be paid to the dependent spouse, the amount of the dependent spouse\u2019s current living expenses is not the sole determinative factor, and a trial court making these determinations should not-exclude consideration of all the other relevant factors listed above. In O\u2019Neal v. O\u2019Neal, 678 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>So.2d 161, 164-65 (Ala.Civ.App.1996), this court wrote: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">\u201cThis court has long recognized that the purpose of periodic alimony is to support the former dependent spouse and enable that spouse, to the extent possible, to maintain the status that the parties had enjoyed during the marriage, until that spouse is self-supporting or maintaining a lifestyle or status similar to the one enjoyed during the marriage. Alabama\u2019s alimony statutes have their genesis in \u00a7\u00a7 1970, 1971, and 1972; Code of Alabama 1852. This statutory scheme has served a crucial legislative policy\u2014 to provide alimony upon the demise of a marriage in order to preserve the economic status of the parties as it existed during the' marriage. Orr v. Orr, 374 So.2d 895 (Ala.Civ.App.), writ denied, 374 So.2d 898 (Ala.1979), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 1060, 100 S.Ct. 993, 62 L.Ed.2d 738 (1980). See also, Hager v. Hager, 293 Ala. 47, 299 So.2d 743 (1974) (periodic alimony is an allowance for future support of the wife). This court has followed this legislative intent and recognized that the purpose of periodic alimony is to preserve, insofar as possible, the economic status or the status of the parties as it existed during the marriage. See, e.g., Grice v. Grice, 673 So.2d 772 (Ala.Civ.App.1995); Albertson v. Albertson, [678 So.2d 118 (Ala.Civ.App.1995) ]; Duckett v. Duckett, 669 So.2d 195 (Ala.Civ.App.1995); Carter v.

See, e.g., Totty v. Totty, 681 So.2d 161 (Ala.Civ.App.1995); Newton v. Newton, 655 So.2d 1033 (Ala.Civ.App.1995); Welch v. Welch, 636 So.2d 464 (Ala.Civ.App.1994); Thornburg v. Thornburg, 628 So.2d 885 (Ala.Civ.App.1993); Trammell-v. Trammell, 589 So.2d 743 (Ala.Civ.App.1991). This abbreviated statement -found its genesis in Waltman v. Waltman, 528 So.2d 867 (Ala.Civ.App.1988). In Walt-man, this court stated that because the sole purpose of periodic alimony is the support of the dependent spouse, -the trial court may terminate periodic alimony when it is no longer necessary for such support. 528 So.2d at. 868. This court reasoned that when periodic alimony is no longer necessary for the support of the former dependent spouse, it may be terminated upon petition of the payor spouse. This reasoning comports with the long-standing purpose of periodic alimony. The abbreviated statement later enunciated in the cases cited above does not comport with the longstanding purpose of periodic alimony. Under this abbreviated statement, any spouse who earns an income sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>for that spouse to live independent of contributions from the payor spouse, is not entitled to periodic alimony regardless of the economic status of the parties during the marriage. This contradicts the legislative intent of periodic alimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">\u201cThe purpose of periodic alimony is to support the former dependent spouse and to enable that spouse, to the extent possible, to maintain the status that the parties had enjoyed during the marriage, until the spouse is self-supporting or maintaining a status similar to the one enjoyed during the marriage. Under this standard, the trial court\u2019s award of $1,500 per month as periodic alimony to the wife was not an abuse of discretion. The wife\u2019s income of $40,000 is not sufficient to maintain the economic status the parties enjoyed during the marriage. Therefore, the award of periodic alimony was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">(Emphasis added.) See also Ex parte Moore, 873 So.2d at 1166 (explaining the purpose of periodic alimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">In this case, the record indicates that the parties had been married for 40 years at the time they separated and for 43 years at the time of the trial. Both parties were nearing the traditional retirement age, and both were experiencing various health issues that the parties said were affecting their abilities to work. At the time of the trial, the wife was earning a gross income of approximately $1,166 every two weeks. The wife\u2019s income-tax return indicated that she earned a total gross income of $34,638 in 2014. The husband testified that his total gross annual income, including his military-retirement pay, was approximately $160,000. He said that, after his deductions, his adjusted gross income for 2014 was $124,766. The husband conceded that the wife was \u201cauthorized\u201d to receive half of his military-retirement pay,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even when that amount was deducted from his income, the husband said, he would still be earning approximately $120,000 annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-21\">The evidence suggests that the wife will be able to meet her postdivorce monthly expenses with her income and her share of the husband\u2019s military-retirement account. However, being able to meet one\u2019s monthly expenses does not equate to being able to engage in the lifestyle\u2014to the extent possible\u2014that one had while married. In this case, the parties had sufficient income to meet unexpected expenses like home and vehicle repairs, or unexpected medical expenses, and the wife was able to use some of her income for' luxuries rather than for necessities. See O\u2019Neal, 678 So.2d at 165, and Ex parte Foley, 864 So.2d 1094, 1097-98 (Ala.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-22\">As to the husband\u2019s assertion that the award of periodic alimony to the wife will financially cripple him, the husband testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>f\u00eded that his \u201cfixed\u201d expenditures each month, including \u201crent,\u201d insurance, and \u201cother items that I have to pay on a monthly basis\u201d totaled $2,619. He then testified to what he characterized his \u201cflexible\u201d expenses, including food expenses; transportation costs of $577; one child\u2019s tuition of $750, which is paid quarterly, and books and allowance of $925 a month; his debt of $890; and unidentified \u201cmiscellaneous expenses\u201d of $934, which, he said, brought his total monthly expenses to $10,041. The husband\u2019s enumerated expenses total $6,695 each month, and this court is unable to discern from the record how the husband reached his figure of $10,041 in monthly expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The evidence indicated that the mortgage payment on the marital residence was $724.80 and that there was no debt on the husband\u2019s vehicle. The trial court, who observed the witnesses as they testified, could have determined that the husband had exaggerated the amount of his monthly expenses. Furthermore, the husband testified at the trial that, after all of his expenses were paid, he was left with \u201cmaybe $3,000.\u201d Based on the evidence, the trial court could have rejected the husband\u2019s contention that the award of periodic alimony to the wife leaves him financially crippled. We note, however, that, once the husband retires, he would be entitled to seek a reduction to his obligation to pay periodic alimony based upon a showing of a material change in circumstances since the entry of the divorce judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">After hearing all the evidence in this case, the trial court determined that the wife was to receive periodic alimony in the amount of $2,000 a month. In considering equitable factors such as the large discrepancy between the husband\u2019s income and earning capacity, and the wife\u2019s income and earning capacity, the parties\u2019 40-year marriage, their ages and health, their respective expenses, and the husband\u2019s ability to pay, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s judgment to award the wife periodic alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The husband also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in dividing his military-retirement benefits because, he says, the division effectively awarded the wife more than half of his military-retirement pay. The husband cites that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment that provides that the wife \u201cshall remain the beneficiary\u201d of the husband\u2019s military Survivor Benefit Plan (\u201cSBP\u201d) and further directs that the premium for the SBP coverage is to be deducted from the husband\u2019s gross military-retirement pay before that pay is divided between the parties. By requiring the husband to pay the SBP premium, the husband says, the trial court \u201ceffectively awards the wife a greater portion of the military retirement than 50%, which is more than is allowed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The record indicates that, at the time of trial, $332.15 was deducted each month from the husband\u2019s military-retirement pay for the cost of the SBP premium. A review of the record indicates that the husband told the trial court that the wife was entitled to remain the beneficiary of the SBP. He testified that, under the SBP, if he died before the wife, she would continue to receive a percentage of his military-retirement pay. The husband also testified that the wife was \u201cauthorized\u201d to keep the SBP that he had selected upon his retirement from the Army. When asked whether the SBP was something the trial court should include in the divorce judgment, the husband responded: \u201cI agree he should include that but, then, also determine how it\u2019s going to be paid for\u2014 whether it is paid for by both or by one individual.\u201d He added that whether the SBP premium should be deducted from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>military-retirement pay before the division of his pay was \u201csomething that would have to be worked out with the military finance office to get that done.\u201d Later in the trial, the husband told the trial court: \u201cIn terms of the cost of survivor benefits, I agree that that is something that [the wife] should get.... I agree she deserves it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Based on the husband\u2019s acknowledgment at trial that the wife is entitled to remain the beneficiary of the SBP and the husband\u2019s argument on appeal that, by requiring \u201cthat the cost of surviv- or benefits be paid out of the gross retirement before division,\u201d we understand the husband\u2019s argument to be that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the payment of the SBP premium before the division of the husband\u2019s military-retirement pay and not that it abused its discretion in ordering that the wife was to remain the beneficiary of the SBP. To the extent the argument can be construed as challenging the order that the wife is to remain the beneficiary, that argument would constitute invited error. As this court wrote in Casey v. McConnell, 975 So.2d 384, 389 (Ala.Civ.App.2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">\u201cThe law is well settled that \u2018[a] party may not predicate an argument for reversal on \u201cinvited error,\u201d that is, \u201cerror into which he has led or lulled the trial court.\u201d\u2019 Atkins v. Lee, 603 So.2d 937, 945 (Ala.1992) (quoting Dixie Highway Express, Inc. v. Southern Ry., 286 Ala. 646, 651, 244 So.2d 591, 595 (1971)). The doctrine of invited error \u2018provides that a party may not complain of error into which he has led the court.\u2019 Ex parte King, 643 So.2d 1364, 1366 (Ala. 1993). In other words, \u2018[a] party cannot win a reversal on an error that party has invited the trial court to commit.\u2019 Neal v. Neal, 856 So.2d 766, 784 (Ala.2002). See also Liberty Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Beasley, 466 So.2d 935, 937 (Ala.1985); and State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Humphres, 293 Ala. 413, 418, 304 So.2d 573, 577 (1974).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Because the husband conceded to the trial court that the wife was \u201cauthorized\u201d to remain the beneficiary of the SBP and was entitled to a portion of his military-retirement income if he died before the wife, this court will not now hold the trial court in error for directing that the wife remain the beneficiary of the SBP.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">To the extent that the husband argues that the trial court erred in ordering the payment of the premium from his military-retirement pay each month before that pay is divided between the parties, that contention, too, must fail. We first note that the husband does not elaborate as to how payment of the premium \u201ceffectively\u201d awards the wife more than half of the husband\u2019s military-retirement pay. Because the premium is deducted before the division of the military-retirement pay, the pool of money that is being divided is less for both parties, not just for the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Moreover, the authorities the husband relies on in support of his argument as to this issue do not involve a challenge to the payment of premiums for survivor-benefit plans. The husband cites \u00a7 30-2-51(b)(3), Ala.Code 1975, which provides that \u201c[t]he total amount of the retirement benefits payable to the non-covered spouse shall not exceed 50 percent of the retirement benefits that may be considered by the court.\u201d He also relies on this court\u2019s decisions in Capone v. Capone, 962 So.2d 835, 841 (Ala.Civ.App.2006), and Wheeler v. Wheeler, 831 So.2d 629, 635 (Ala.Civ.App.2002). In Capone, this court held that an award of survivor benefits in the context of a division of military-retirement benefits \u201cpotentially violates \u00a7 30-2-51(b), partly because such an award could potentially award one spouse an amount in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>excess of 50% of the other spouse\u2019s retirement' benefits.\u201d 962 So.2d at 841. However, as discussed above, the husband told the trial court that the wife was authorized to receive benefits under the SBP, and we will not hold the trial court in error for entering a judgment consistent with the husband\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiJX\">\u201cIt is the appellant\u2019s burden to refer this Court to legal authority that supports its argument. Rule 28(a)(10), Ala. R.App. P., requires that the argument in an appellant\u2019s brief include \u2018citations to the.cases, statutes, [and] other authorities ... relied on.\u2019.

Co., 27 So.3d 1223, 1254 (Ala.2009). The husband has not cited any authority or advanced a cogent legal argument to demonstrate how the trial court erred or abused its discretion in ordering the SBP premium to be paid -from the husband\u2019s military-retirement pay before that pay is divided. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The husb\u00e1nd also asserts that, \u201c[w]hen taken together with alimony and the survivor benefit award, the division of military retirement, is unjust and inequitable.\u201d Just as he did in agreeing that the wif\u00e9 was entitled to remain the beneficiary of the SBP, the husband testified that the wife was \u201cauthorized to get 50% of retired military pay, based on the length of marriage.\u201d Again, the doctrine of invited error prevents this court from holding the trial court in error as to this issue. Casey, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">The husband contends that the trial court\u2019s judgment awarding the wife 50% of the husband\u2019s disposable military-retirement pay each month is ambiguous. He states that \u201cit is unclear what the husband\u2019s obligation is.\u201d The husband then sets out what he says is a \u201cstrict formula for the division of military retirement.\u201d However, he cites no authority as to the origination of that formula, and he\u2019cites no authority in support of the proposition that the trial court must use the formula when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>dividing military-retirement pay between divorcing spouses. Because the husband cited ho authority in support of his argument, we affirm the judgment as to this issue. See Board of Water <em>&amp; </em>Sewer Comm\u2019rs of City of Mobile, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The husband also briefly asserts that the trial court\u2019s award of a set level of the husband\u2019s existing military-retirement pay, without any deductions for disability compensation, improperly denies the husband the right to increase the amount of disability benefits he receives. Again, the husband cites no authority and makes no legal argument in support of his contention. Moreover, the husband\u2019s argument, is contrary to Alabama law. In Stone v. Stone, 26 So.3d at 1238-39, this court reviewed opinions from a number of jurisdictions and concluded that a state court may properly limit a military member\u2019s ability to unilaterally modify the benefits owed to a former spouse from the member\u2019s retirement pay. Based on Stone and the husband\u2019s failure to cite any authority in support of his argument, see Board of Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019rs of City of Mobile, the judgment is affirmed as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The husband next contends that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering him to \u201ccontinue to maintain the existing $100,000 life insurance policy\u201d for the benefit of the wife. The husband states that no such policy exists. Therefore, he states, \u201c[t]his becomes an undefined benefit to the wife,\u201d, and, thus, he says, the provision must be reversed. He cites no authority in support of his one-paragraph argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The record indicates that the husband testified that he had life insurance through his current job; however, he said, he did not know the value of the policy. He also testified that he had life insurance through another company, the value of which he believed was $50,000. The husband testified that the wife was the beneficiary of that policy. Additionally, the husband testified, the \"wife was the beneficiary of a life-insurance policy he had through Army and Air Force Mutual Aid; however, he said, he did not know the value of that policy, either.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">\u201cA trial court may include a provision in a divorce judgment requiring a former spouse to maintain a life-insurance policy for the benefit of the other former spouse. Strong v. Strong, 709 So.2d 1259 (Ala.Civ.App.1998). However, our caselaw indicates that it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion whether to order a divorcing spouse to maintain a life-insurance policy for the benefit of the other spouse. See, e.g., Bush v. Bush, 784 So.2d 299, 300 (Ala.Civ.App.2000).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Ratliff v. Ratliff, 5 So.3d 570, 584 (Ala.Civ.App.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">The husband has riot argued that the trial court abused its discretion in establishing the value of life insurance for the benefit of the wife. Thus, any argument the husband could have made as to the propriety of the provision setting the amount of life insurance to be provided for the benefit of the wife is deemed waived. Gary v. Crouch, 923 So.2d 1130, 1136 (Ala.Civ.App.2005) (\u201c[T]his court is confined in its review to addressing the arguments raised by the parties in their briefs on appeal; arguments not raised by the parties ar\u00e9 waived.\u201d); see also Palmer v. Palmer, 192 So.3d 12, 16 (Ala.Civ.App.2015). The husband has failed to demonstrate that the life-insurance policies he had at the time of trial are insufficient to provide the coverage mandated by the trial court. We conclude that, based on the limited argument of the husband, he has failed to demonstrate error as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Finally, the husband argues that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering him to provide health insurance to the wife.

The trial court could have inferred from the evidence as to the parties\u2019. resources that the amounts claimed would be in&gt; line with the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>able costs of maintaining the marital standard of living.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In total, the wife presented a budget indicating that she needed monthly income of $4,070.12 in order to sustain her marital lifestyle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Assuiiiing that the wife proved to the satisfaction of the trial court that she needed $4,070.12 each month to live as She had during the marriage, in order to obtain periodic alimony the wife additionally had to prove</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201cher inability to achieve that' same standard of living through the use of ... her own individual assets, including ... her own separate estate, the marital property received as part of any settlement or property division, and ... her own wage-earning capacity,...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Shewbart, 64 So.3d at 1088. The evidence in the record contradicts the trial court\u2019s implicit determination that the wife needs periodic alimony to maintain the marital standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Issues of alimony and property division must be considered together. Morgan v. Morgan, 686 So.2d 308, 310 (Ala.Civ.App.1996). In its judgment, the trial court awarded the wife $2,653.60 per month as her portion of the husband\u2019s military-retirement benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The wife testified that she works as a manager at a Wal-Mart store, earning a biweekly net income of $776.96, or $1,683,39 monthly. See Rieger v. Rieger, 147 So.3d 421, 431 (Ala.Civ.App.2013) (holding that net income should be used in assessing periodic -alimony). The wife testified that, because of joint problems, she planned to quit working as a manager ahd that she would become an associate for less pay. However, the trial court could not have considered the predicted reduction in earnings when determining the wife\u2019s financial needs. See DeShazo v. DeShazo, 582 So.2d 564 (Ala.Civ.App.1991) (trial court cannot consider impact of expected retirement when calculating periodic alimony, but must defer consideration of that issue to a subsequent modification action after retirement occurs). The combination of the wife\u2019s net wages and her share of the husband\u2019s military-retirement benefits, alone, which total $4,236.89, exceed her admitted financial need of $4,070.12, without considering the other substantial property awarded to the wife in the judgment. The wife did not prove she needed any periodic alimony in order to meet her claimed financial needs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">\u201c[T]he award and [the] amount of periodic alimony are matters that lie within the discretion of the trial court and may be reversed upon an appeal only for, a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>abuse of the trial court\u2019s judicial discretion.\u201d Scott v. Scott, 460 So.2d 1331, 1332 (Ala.Civ.App.1984). An award of periodic alimony to a spouse who has not demonstrated a need for that award in order to sustain the marital standard of living amounts to an abuse of discretion. Long v. Long, 109 So.3d 633, 652 (Ala.Civ.App.2012), overruled on other grounds, Marshall v. Marshall, 168 So.3d 52 (Ala.Civ.App.2014). That is so regardless of the fact that the parties were married for 40 years or more and regardless of the disparity in the postmarital income of the parties. A trial court has no discretion to use alimony as a marriage-longevity reward or as a means to equalize the post-marital income of the parties. In deciding otherwise, the main opinion seriously misconstrues alimony law and now establishes a dangerous precedent granting trial courts extraordinary and unwarranted discretion when awarding alimony well beyond that intended by the legislature when it enacted \u00a7 30-2-51(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The main opinion admits that \u201c[t]he evidence suggests that the wife will be able to meet her postdivorce monthly expenses with her income and her share of the husband\u2019s military-retirement account.\u201d 226 So.3d at 697. Nevertheless, the main opinion maintains that \u201cbeing able to meet one\u2019s monthly expenses does not equate to being able to engage in the lifestyle\u2014to the extent possible\u2014that one had while married.\u201d 226 So.3d at 697. I do not even follow the logic of that last sentence. The vast majority of married couples living in this state maintain their standard of living through regular monthly payments for housing, food, clothing, utilities, credit cards, and the like. Thus, in most cases, \u201cbeing able to meet one\u2019s monthly expenses\u201d does indeed \u201cequate to being able to engage\u201d in the marital lifestyle. That is especially true when a petitioning spouse includes in his or her monthly budget an estimate of the costs of nonrecurring, irregular, or extraordinary expenditures, as the wife did in this case. Her budget, her sole piece of evidence to establish the financial costs of the marital standard of living, itemizes each and every dollar she needs in order to live as she did during the marriage, whether characterized as a regular monthly bill or otherwise. The record contains no evidence of any further economic need that could possibly justify an award of $2,000 per month in periodic alimony. Because she can pay the costs to maintain the marital standard of living with her own wages and the liquid assets from the property division, the wife did not prove a present need for periodic alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In seeking a reversal of the periodic-alimony award, the husband does not, as the main opinion states, ask this court to \u201cdisregard the many factors this court has historically considered in reviewing whether a trial court abused its discretion in awarding periodic alimony and in determining the amount of such an award.\u201d 226 So.3d at 695. As Shewbart clarifies, before a trial court can even consider the equities of a periodic-alimony award, the petitioning spouse must establish a need for the money. If the petitioning spouse does not prove a need for alimony, a trial court cannot award alimony based on some sense of abstract fairness. In this case, the record shows that the wife can live as she did during the marriage based on her own income and the income from the husband\u2019s military retirement. Thus, regarding the matter of alimony, it is immaterial that the parties had been married 40 years or that the husband earns vastly more than the wife. This court cannot affirm the alimony award based on those factors because they do not in either case establish the wife\u2019s need for alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">At best, the wife proved that, due to her age and physical infirmities, she may ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>cept a demotion or retire in the near future, in which case she would need alimony to supplement the retirement benefits so she could meet her economic needs. The trial court should not have awarded her periodic alimony based on that future need, however. Instead, \u201c[t]he trial court should reserve jurisdiction over the issue of alimony if the facts indicate that future circumstances may entitle either party to a later award of alimony.\u201d Williams v. Williams, 905 So.2d 820, 828 (Ala.Civ.App.2004). Therefore, I believe that the judgment, insofar as it awards alimony, should be reversed and that the trial court should be instructed to reserve jurisdiction to award periodic alimony in the future. Because the main opinion concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On Application for Rehearing</p>\n<judges id=\"b766-5\">THOMPSON, Presiding Judge.</judges>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">APPLICATION OVERRULED.

I further note that military-disability-retirement benefits cannot be used for paying alimony. Ex parte Billeck, 777 So.2d 105, 109 (Ala.2000) (holding that federal law precludes courts from considering veteran\u2019s disability payments in awarding alimony).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\">. The wife listed rent, instead of a mortgage, and rental insurance, rather than homeowners\u2019 insurance, but the remainder of the list corresponded to the same types of expenses the parties had incurred to maintain their station during the marriage, including such non-necessities as cable-television expenses, Internet-service expenses, cellular-telephone expenses, entertainment expenses, out-of-home dining expenses, beauty-treatment costs, pet costs, gifts, and charity donations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b763-13\">. The wife listed $250 per month to assist the parties\u2019 youngest child.. I presume that the trial court did not consider those expenses in awarding periodic alimony. See Sosebee v. Sosebee, 896 So.2d 557, 562 (Ala.Civ.App.2004) (\"The wife\u2019s expenditures for the [child] are gratuitous undertakings of the wife that the husband may not be held responsible for through the payment of alimony to offset those expenditures,\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">.

The wife submitted a budget of $4,343.28, but, after deducting $250\u2019 for the youngest child\u2019s support, which cannot be considered for alimony purposes, and $23.16 for health-insurance costs, which the husband was ordered to cover separately, the amount totals $4,070.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\">. The record contains no evidence as to the effect taxation will have on the awards, so I do not consider whether the wife cannot depend on the gross amount of military-retirement benefits. See L.J.S. v. J.E.S., 464 Mass. 346; 350, 982 N.E.2d 1160, 1163 (2013) (\"[I]n the context of fashioning divorce judgments or modifications of such judgments, where the issue of tax consequences has been raised and the judge has been provided with \u2018appropriate evidence in the record,\u2019 ... the judge should consider the tax consequences arising from a-judgment\u201d) (quoting Wolfe v.
