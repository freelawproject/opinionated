Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008) and <em>McDonald v. City of Chicago, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 89.4 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">Petitioner, Charles F. Williams, Jr., seeks to overturn his conviction in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for unlawful possession of a handgun, pursuant to Section 4-203(a)(l)(i) of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2002),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asserting that Maryland\u2019s regulatory scheme for hand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>guns violates his right to \u201ckeep and carry arms\u201d under the Second Amendment. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Williams\u2019 conviction, in a reported opinion, <em>Williams v. State, </em>188 Md.App. 691, 982 A.2d 1168 (2009), and we granted certiorari, <em>Williams v. State, </em>412 Md. 495, 988 A.2d 1008 (2010), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">Are Md.Code Ann. Criminal Law \u00a7 4-203, Public Safety \u00a7\u00a7 5-301, <em>et seq., </em>and COMAR 29.03.02.04 unconstitutional in light of <em>Hellerv. District of </em>Columbia?[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We shall hold that Section 4\u2014203(a)(1)(i) of the Criminal Law Article, which prohibits wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, without a permit and outside of one\u2019s home, is outside of the scope of the Second Amendment. We also shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>hold that, because Williams failed to apply for a permit to wear, carry, or transport a handgun, he lacks standing to challenge Section 5-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article, Maryland Code (2003),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as COMAE 29.03.02.04.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result, Williams\u2019s conviction will stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>During a bench trial before the Honorable Sean D. Wallace, the State presented the following facts, describing a police officer\u2019s encounter with Williams near a bus stop:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">The facts, as stipulated, had the matter gone to trial, the facts would show that on October 1, 2007, at approximately 5:00 p.m., Officer Molake with the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, was in the area of the Baltimore\u2014 Washington Parkway and Landover Road in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, and as he was driving in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>area, he observed the defendant going through a backpack near a wooded area nearby the cross area, and at one time, as the officer turned his cruiser around, he observed the defendant turn and place something in the brush area as if he was hiding something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">Officer Molake made contact with the defendant, who he would identify as the gentleman seated to the left with the green shirt and asked him what he was doing. The defendant told him he was going through the backpack to see what was in it. He then asked the defendant what he went and hid in the bushes, and the defendant hesitated and then stated \u201cmy gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The facts described the police officer\u2019s recovery of Williams\u2019s handgun and Williams\u2019s statement to police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">Officer Molake then recovered an Austria [sic] made, black Glock handgun with 15 rounds in the magazine in the brush area where he saw the defendant go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">The defendant gave a written statement after being given his Miranda rights by Officer Santa Cruz, admitting to possession of the gun and placing the gun in the bush area where the officer subsequently located it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">The handgun test-fired as positive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The facts provided the following, regarding Williams\u2019s purchase of the handgun, apparently for \u201cself-defense\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">The defense would have provided evidence by way of documents that would show that the defendant purchased the handgun in Realeo at 6108 Marlboro Pike in Forestville, Maryland, on August 15 of 2007, and that would be shown through Exhibit 1. Paid the balance that was due on that handgun on September 14, 2007, which will be shown in Exhibit 2; that the defense would have provided evidence that the defendant completed the Maryland State Police application and affidavit to purchase a regulated firearm application, which is a total of three pages, on August 15, 2007, which will be shown in Exhibit 3. He received the certificate of completion, which is shown in Exhibits 4 and 5, on August 15, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The defendant would have testified that he purchased the handgun for self-defense, and that on the date of this arrest, he had just left the handgun at his girlfriend\u2019s house, place of residence. When he got off work, he went to her residence and picked up that handgun and was en route to his home when the arrest occurred behind the bus stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">The defendant was again given Miranda rights and gave a written statement that will be shown in the State\u2019s Exhibits Number 3 and 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Judge Wallace found Williams guilty of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in violation of Section 4-203(a)(l)(i) and sentenced him to three years\u2019 incarceration, with two years suspended. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, determining that the Second Amendment is not applicable to the States,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that, were the Second Amendment to apply to Maryland, \u201cit would not invalidate the statute at issue here,\u201d because Section 4-203(b)(6) expressly permits wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in one\u2019s residence, thereby preserving the right \u201cto keep and bear arms in the home for the purpose of immediate self-defense.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>188 Md. App. at 699, 982 A.2d at 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Before us, as he did in the Circuit Court in a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Indictment,\u201d and in his brief before the Court of Special Appeals, Williams asserts that the prohibition in Section 4-203(a) against wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun without a permit and outside of one\u2019s home, infringes upon his Second Amendment right \u201cto keep and bear arms.\u201d He contends that the Supreme Court opinions in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>make clear that the Second Amendment establishes a general \u201cright of persons to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The State counters that the opinions in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>together stand for the proposition that, pursuant to the Second Amendment, \u201cstates may not generally prohibit the possession of a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense, but remain free to enact reasonable restrictions on the possession and use of firearms.\u201d The State contends that the statutory scheme embodied in Section 4-203 is eminently reasonable, because Section 4-203(b)(6) expressly permits wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We begin by exploring the dictates of Section 4-203(a) of the Criminal Law Article, which contains a prohibition against wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in public, \u201cwhether concealed or open\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">(i) wear, carry, or transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, on or about the person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">(ii) wear, carry, or knowingly transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, in a vehicle traveling on a road or parking lot generally used by the public, highway, waterway, or airway of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The exceptions to the prohibition, contained in Section 4-203(b), are many:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">(b) Exceptions.\u2014This section does not prohibit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">(1) the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun by a person who is on active assignment engaged in law enforcement, is authorized at the time and under the circumstances to wear, carry, or transport the handgun as part of the person\u2019s official equipment, and is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">(i) a law enforcement official of the United States, the State, or a county or city of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">(ii) a member of the armed forces of the United States or the National Guard on duty or traveling to or from duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-14\">(iii) a law enforcement official of another state or subdivision of another state temporarily in this State on official business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>(iv) a correctional officer or warden of a correctional facility in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">(v) a sheriff or full-time assistant or deputy sheriff of the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">(vi) a temporary or part-time sheriffs deputy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">(2) the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun by a person to whom a permit to wear, carry, or transport the handgun has been issued under [\u00a7\u00a7 5-301-5-314 of the Public Safety Article, Maryland Code (2003) ];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">(3) the carrying of a handgun on the person or in a vehicle while the person is transporting the handgun to or from the place of legal purchase or sale, or to or from a bona fide repair shop, or between bona fide residences of the person, or between the bona fide residence and place of business of the person, if the business is operated and owned substantially by the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">(4) the wearing, carrying, or transporting by a person of a handgun used in connection with an organized military activity, a target shoot, formal or informal target practice, sport shooting event, hunting, a Department of Natural Resources\u2014sponsored firearms and hunter safety class, trapping, or a dog obedience training class or show, while the person is engaged in, on the way to, or returning from that activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">(5) the moving by a bona fide gun collector of part or all of the collector\u2019s gun collection from place to place for public or private exhibition if each handgun is unloaded and carried in an enclosed case or an enclosed holster;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">(6) the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun by a person on real estate that the person owns or leases or where the person resides or within the confines of a business establishment that the person owns or leases;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">(7) the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun by a supervisory employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">(i) in the course of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-13\">(ii) within the confines of the business establishment in which the supervisory employee is employed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>(iii) when so authorized by the owner or manager of the business establishment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">(8) the carrying or transporting of a signal pistol or other visual distress signal approved by the United States Coast Guard in a vessel on the waterways of the State or, if the signal pistol or other visual distress signal is unloaded and carried in an enclosed case, in a vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Here, the relevant exceptions are Section 4-203(b)(2), involving a permit to wear, carry, or transport a handgun in public, as well as Section 4\u2014203(b)(6), permitting the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun in one\u2019s residence. What is notable in the present case is that Williams did not apply for a permit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, at the time of his arrest, he was not wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in his residence,, as permitted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Williams, nevertheless, principally relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 570, 128 S.Ct. at 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d at 637, and <em>McDonald, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d at 894, in asserting that the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Amendment establishes a general \u201cright of persons to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes.\u201d In Heller; Mr. Heller had applied for and was denied a \u201cregistration certificate\u201d to possess a handgun in his home, pursuant to the District of Columbia\u2019s gun control scheme. 554 U.S. at 573-77, 128 S.Ct. at 2788, 171 L.Ed.2d at 647. Section 7-2502.01(a) of the D.C.Code (2001) prohibited \u201cpossession] or control\u201d of any firearm, without a \u201cvalid registration certificate\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">(a) Except as otherwise provided in this unit, no person or organization in the District of Columbia (\u201cDistrict\u201d) shall receive, possess, control, transfer, offer for sale, sell, give, or deliver any destructive device, and no person or organization in the District shall possess or control any firearm, unless the person or organization holds a valid registration certificate for the firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Section 7-2502.02(a)(4) of the D.C.Code (2001) prohibited the registration of <em>handguns, </em>\"without an exception for possession in one\u2019s home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">(a) A registration certificate shall not be issued for a:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">(1) Sawed-off shotgun;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">(2) Machine gun;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">(3) Short-barreled rifle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">(4) Pistol[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] not validly registered to the current registrant in the District prior to September 24, 1976, except that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any organization that employs at least 1 commissioned special police officer or other employee licensed to carry a firearm and that arms the employee with a firearm during the employee\u2019s duty hours or to a police officer who has retired from the Metropolitan Police Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">Section 7-2507.02 of the D.C.Code (2001) mandated that any other firearm within one\u2019s home be kept \u201cunloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Except for law enforcement personnel described in \u00a7 7-2502.01(b)(1), each registrant shall keep any firearm in his possession unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device unless such firearm is kept at his place of business, or while being used for lawful recreational purposes within the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Sections 22-4504(a) and 22-4515 of the D.C.Code (2001) made carrying an unlicenced pistol in one\u2019s home or on one\u2019s land a misdemeanor. Section 22-4504(a) stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar1\">(a) No person shall carry within the District of Columbia either openly or concealed on or about their person, a pistol, without a license issued pursuant to District of Columbia law, or any deadly or dangerous weapon capable of being so concealed. Whoever violates this section shall be punished as provided in \u00a7 22^1515----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Section 22-4515 of the D.C.Code (2001) in turn, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">Any violation of any provision of this chapter for which no penalty is specifically provided shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Mr. Heller filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the denial of his application for a \u201cregistration certificate\u201d to possess a handgun in his home, the licensing requirement insofar as it prohibited the carrying of a handgun in the home, and the trigger-lock requirement insofar as it prohibited the possession of \u201cfunctional firearms\u201d in the home. The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, reasoning that the Second Amendment precluded the District from \u201cflatly ban[ning] the keeping of a handgun in the home.\u201d <em>Parker v. District of Columbia, </em>478 F.3d 370, 400 (D.C.Cir.2007). The Supreme Court granted the District\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">Whether the following provisions\u2014D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.02(a)(4), 22-4504(a), and 7-2507.02\u2014violate the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state-regulated militia, but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Before the Court, the District argued that the Second Amendment protects \u201conly militia-related firearm rights.\u201d Alternatively, the District contended that prohibiting handgun possession in the home was reasonable, because residents were permitted to possess shotguns and rifles, albeit unloaded or bound by a trigger lock. Mr. Heller countered that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm for \u201ctraditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\u201d 554 U.S. at 577, 128 S.Ct. at 2789, 171 L.Ed.2d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Embracing an original meaning approach, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the Court, interpreted the language of the Second Amendment as conferring an individual right \u201cto keep and bear Arms.\u201d 554 U.S. at 581, 128 S.Ct. at 2791, 171 L.Ed.2d at 651. The Court considered the substance of that individual right as \u201csimply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 128 S.Ct. at 2792, 171 L.Ed.2d at 652. Similarly, the phrase \u201cbear Arms,\u201d reasoned the Court, referred to the \u201ccarrying of weapons,\u201d both in an organized militia and for other purposes, such as self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 584-87, 128 S.Ct. at 2793-94, 171 L.Ed.2d at 653-54. The Court concluded that \u201cpreserving the militia\u201d was not the only aim of the Second Amendment, as the founders \u201cmost undoubtedly thought it even more important for self-defense and hunting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 128 S.Ct. at 2801, 171 L.Ed.2d at 662. This right \u201cto keep and bear Arms,\u201d however, has limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through 19th century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Amendment or state analogues. Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsHp\"><em>Id. </em>at 626-27, 128 S.Ct. at 2816-17, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In declaring Sections 7-2502.02(a)(4) (prohibiting the registration of handguns, without a home exception) and 22-4504(a) (prohibiting carrying a handgun within one\u2019s home, without a license) unconstitutional, the Court emphasized that handguns were \u201coverwhelmingly chosen by American society\u201d for self-defense and determined that under any standard of scrutiny, \u201cbanning from the home the most preferred firearm in the nation to keep and use for protection of one\u2019s home and family, would fail constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628-29, 128 S.Ct. at 2817-18, 171 L.Ed.2d at 679 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). The District\u2019s trigger-lock requirement, contained in Section 7-2507.02, did not fare any better, according to the Court, because the provision \u201cma[de] it impossible for citizens to use [firearms] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense\u201d within the home. <em>Id. </em>at 630, 128 S.Ct. at 2818, 171 L.Ed.2d at 680. Therefore, the prohibition against handguns, even within one\u2019s home, as well as the trigger-lock requirement for all firearms kept within the home, were declared unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Shortly thereafter, in <em>McDonald, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d at 894, the Supreme Court was asked to consider whether the Second Amendment applied to the States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In that case, Otis McDonald, Adam Orlov, Colleen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Lawson, and David Lawson filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking a declaratory judgment that several Chicago ordinances violated the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. The Chicago residents alleged that the City had denied their applications to register handguns for possession in the home, in violation of the Constitution. In a related lawsuit, the National Rifle Association and two residents of Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking a declaration that several Oak Park ordinances were invalid pursuant to the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. That complaint alleged that, but for the gun control laws, the individual plaintiffs would keep handguns in their homes for self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The statutes at issue were \u201csimilar to the District of Columbia\u2019s,\u201d according to the Court. \u2014 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 3026, 177 L.Ed.2d at 903. Section 8-20-040(a) of the Chicago, Illinois Code prohibited possession of a firearm unless registered, while Section 8-20-050(c) provided that \u201c[n]o registration certificate shall be issued for any of the following types of firearms ... (c) Handguns.\u201d The only non-governmental exception to the prohibition against handguns was for \u201c[tjhose validly registered to a current owner in the City of Chicago prior to [1982].\u201d Section 27-2-1 of the Oak Park, Illinois Code also provided that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to possess or carry, or for any person to permit another to possess or carry on his/her land or in his/her place of business any firearm.\u201d Section 27-1-1, in turn, defined \u201cfirearms\u201d as \u201cpistols, revolvers, guns and small arms of a size and character that may be concealed on or about the person, commonly known as handguns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The district court judge entered judgment on the pleadings for both municipalities. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Court had never considered whether the Second Amendment should be applied to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Nat'l Rifle Ass\u2019n v. City of Chicago, Illinois and Village of Oak, Park, Illinois, </em>567 F.3d 856 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In reversing, the Supreme Court determined that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms \u201cis fundamental to <em>our </em>scheme of ordered liberty,\u201d and as a result, the Due Process Clause rendered it applicable to the States. <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 3036, 177 L.Ed.2d at 914, citing <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). The Court characterized <em>Heller </em>as safeguarding an individual right of \u201cself-defense,\u201d when home possession was in issue, <em>id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 3036, 177 L.Ed.2d at 914, but, nevertheless, reiterated that regulatory schemes prohibiting handgun ownership by dangerous individuals, or prohibiting wearing, carrying, or transporting handguns in various public places outside of the home, were permissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">We made it clear in <em>Heller </em>that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as \u201cprohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\u201d \u201claws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 3047, 177 L.Ed.2d at 926, quoting <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 626-27, 128 S.Ct. at 2817, 171 L.Ed.2d at 678.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>In the present case, Section 4-203(a)(l)(i) of which Williams was convicted, prohibits \u201cwearing], carrying], or transporting] a handgun, whether concealed or open, on or about the person,\u201d in public, without a permit. Here, sufficient evidence was adduced to demonstrate that Williams was wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in public, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Williams had conceded that he had not obtained, or even applied for, a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Williams, however, attempts to bring his conviction of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in public, without a permit, within the ambit of <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>by claiming that those opinions would prohibit his conviction. This is not the case, because <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>emphasize that the Second Amendment is applicable to statutory prohibitions against home possession, the dicta in <em>McDonald </em>that \u201cthe Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense within the home,\u201d notwithstanding. \u2014 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 3044, 177 L.Ed.2d at 922. Although Williams attempts to find succor in this dicta, it is clear that prohibition of firearms in the home was the gravamen of the certiorari questions in both <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>and their answers. If the Supreme Court, in this dicta, meant its holding to extend beyond home possession, it will need to say so more plainly.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Williams was convicted of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in public, rather than for possession of a handgun in his home, for which he <em>could not </em>be prosecuted under Section 4r-203(b)(6). It is the exception permitting home possession in Section 4-203(b)(6) that takes the statutory scheme embodied in Section 4-203 outside of the scope of the Second Amendment, as articulated in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald. </em>Section 4-203(b)(6) clearly permits wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun \u201cby a person on real estate that the person owns or leases or where the person resides,\u201d without registering or obtaining a permit, wholly consistent with <em>Heller\u2019s </em>proviso that handguns are \u201cthe most preferred firearm in the nation to keep and use for protection of one\u2019s home and family.\u201d 554 U.S. at 628-29,128 S.Ct. at 2817-18,171 L.Ed.2d at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">In affirming Williams\u2019 conviction, we find persuasive opinions from other courts, addressing analogous situations, in which a defendant was convicted pursuant to a statute prohibiting public possession of a firearm, while providing an excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>tion for possession within the home. For example, in <em>People v. Dawson, </em>408 Ill.App.3d 499, 343 Ill.Dec. 274, 934 N.E.2d 598 <em>(2010), </em>Dawson had been found guilty <em>of </em>three counts <em>of </em>aggravated discharge of a firearm and two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon in connection with the attempted murder of Mario Brantley. <em>Id., </em>343 Ill.Dec. 274, 934 N.E.2d at 599. Dawson argued that his convictions under the Illinois aggravated unlawful use of a weapon statute should be reversed, because the measure violated the Second Amendment. <em>Id., </em>343 Ill.Dec. 274, 934 N.E.2d at 599-600. The Illinois aggravated unlawful use of a weapon statute under which Dawson was convicted mirrors Maryland\u2019s Section 4-203 and relevantly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">\u201c(a) A person commits the offense of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon when he or she knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">(1) Carries on or about his or her person or in any vehicle or concealed on or about his or her person <em>except when on his or her land or in his or her abode or fixed place of business </em>any pistol, revolver, stun gun or taser or other firearm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">[and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">(3) One of the following factors is present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">(A) the firearm possessed was uncased, loaded and immediately accessible at the time of the offense[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-9\"><em>Id., </em>343 Ill.Dec. 274, 934 N.E.2d at 604, quoting 720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(A) (West 2006) (alteration in original) (emphasis added). The Illinois intermediate appellate court affirmed Dawson\u2019s conviction, reasoning that in <em>Heller, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cultimately limited its holding to the question presented\u2014that the Second Amendment right to bear arms protected the right to possess a commonly used firearm, a handgun, in the home for self-defense purposes.\u201d <em>Id., </em>343 Ill.Dec. 274, 934 N.E.2d at 605 The court further emphasized that, in <em>McDonald, </em>the Supreme Court addressed \u201cthe limited question of whether a ban on the possession of a handgun in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the home violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the statute under which Dawson was convicted was constitutional, because it specifically permitted possession of a firearm within one\u2019s home. <em>Id., </em>343 Ill.Dec. 274, 934 N.E.2d at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In <em>Little v. United States, </em>989 A.2d 1096 (D.C.2010), Little was convicted by a jury of one count of carrying a pistol without a license, one count of possession of an unregistered firearm, and one count of unlawful possession of ammunition, as a result of his involvement in an attempted robbery. Little argued that his convictions must be reversed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heller, </em>because the statutes \u201cfunctioned as a total ban on handguns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1100. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals rejected that argument and affirmed Little\u2019s conviction, reasoning that in <em>Heller, </em>\u201cthe issue was the constitutionality of the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on \u2018the possession of usable handguns <em>in the home,\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1101, quoting <em>Howerton v. United States, </em>964 A.2d 1282, 1287 (D.C.2009), and Little had conceded that he was outside of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>People v. Yarbrough, </em>169 Cal.App.4th 303, 86 Cal.Rptr.3d 674 (Cal.Ct.App.2008), Yarbrough was arrested and convicted of carrying a concealed weapon in public, in violation of a California statute, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">A person is guilty of carrying a concealed firearm when he or she does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">(1) Carries concealed within any vehicle which is under his or her control or direction any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">(2) Carries concealed upon his or her person any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">(3) Causes to be carried concealed within any vehicle in which he or she is an occupant any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 313 n. 5, 86 Cal.Rptr.3d 674, quoting Section 12025(a) of the California Penal Code. The California intermediate appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>late court noted that a separate measure provided an exception for possession of concealed weapons \u201canywhere within the citizen\u2019s or legal resident\u2019s place of residence, place of business, or on private property owned or lawfully possessed by the citizen or legal resident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314 and n. 6, 86 Cal. Rptr.3d 674, quoting Section 12026 of the California Penal Code. Although Yarbrough argued that the concealed weapons statute was unconstitutional in light of <em>Heller, </em>the court rejected that argument and affirmed his conviction, reasoning that in <em>Heller, </em>the Supreme Court considered a narrow question, namely whether \u201cthe District\u2019s ban on handgun possession in the home violate[d] the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 86 Cal.Rptr.3d 674. The court concluded that, \u201c[ujnlike possession of a gun for protection within a residence, carrying a concealed firearm presents a recognized threat to public order, and is prohibited as a means of preventing physical harm to persons other than the offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 86 Cal. Rptr.3d 674 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As a result, we affirm Williams\u2019 conviction of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in violation of Section 4-203(a)(l)(i) of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Williams argues, in this regard, that Sections 5-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article, Maryland Code (2003), as well as Title 29, subtitle 3 of the Code of Maryland Regulations, together governing handgun permitting, impose an impermissible burden on citizens seeking to exercise the right to \"keep and carry a handgun.\u201d Williams acknowledges that he has \"not filed an application for a permit to carry a handgun,\u201d but asserts that as a result of the regulatory scheme, \"any such application would have been denied.\u201d The State counters that nearly 93 percent of handgun permit applicants from 2006 to 2009 were issued permits. <em>See Maryland Department of State Police 2009 Annual Report, </em>available at <em>http://www.mdsp.org/downloads/2009Annual-Report.pdf. </em>Nevertheless, because Williams failed to file an application for a permit to carry a handgun, he lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of Sections 5-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article, as well as Title 29, subtitle 3 of the Code of Maryland Regulations. <em>See, e.g., Gregg v.

The statute in issue required the prosecution to demonstrate only \"that the defendant possessed ammunition, and that he did so knowingly and intentionally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240. Herrington argued that his conviction should be reversed, because the Second Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Heller </em>\"encompass[ed] the possession of handgun ammunition in the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241. The court reversed Herring-ton\u2019s conviction, reasoning that \u201cthe Second Amendment guarantees a right to possess ammunition in the home that is coextensive with the right to possess a usable handgun there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1243. Thus, <em>Herring-ton </em>is consistent with our interpretation of <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>as addressing prohibitions against handgun possession in the home, as banning possession of ammunition in the home would certainly undermine the interest in \u201cdefense of self, family, and property\u201d recognized in <em>Heller.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b529-8\">MURPHY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADu\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">While I agree with the majority that the Petitioner\u2019s conviction should be affirmed, I would not hold that the Petitioner\u2019s conduct is \u201coutside of the scope of the Second Amendment.\u201d I would affirm on the ground that, although the Second Amendment is applicable to an \u201con the street\u201d possession of a handgun, that Amendment is <em>satisfied </em>by a statute that places reasonable restrictions on the constitutional right to bear arms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
