UMMS denied his request on grounds that it is not an \u201cagency or division of the State of Maryland\u201d and thus not subject to the PIA. Napata then appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for assistance, but was unsuccessful, and the Court of Special Appeals later affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. We granted Napata\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-10\">Did the lower court err in holding that Maryland Annotated Code of Education Article, Section 13-303 states that Respondent is not an instrumentality of the State of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">We shall hold that, although UMMS is an \u201cinstrumentality of the State\u201d for purposes of the PIA, an express exemption from laws affecting only governmental or public entities located in the corporation\u2019s enacting statute shields it from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>public information law. Thus, we affirm the decision of our intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The events in this case are simple and uncontested. Of a greater importance to us is the larger history of UMMS. Thus, before setting forth the facts specific to this dispute, we will provide a brief overview of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">I. The University Of Maryland Medical System</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">UMMS\u2019s beginnings can be traced back to the University of Maryland (the \u201cUniversity\u201d), and the hospital system that it operated. The University, as an instrumentality of the State,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was subject to those laws affecting government and public entities, including the PIA. Adherence to numerous state regulations, however, proved to be financially burdensome for the University hospital, especially because it relied upon \u201cpatient fees for support and receive[d] no state operating or capital funds.\u201d University of Maryland Medical System, Office of Public Affairs, <em>Questions and Answers for Employees About The University Of Maryland Medical System\u2019s Governance Change </em>(on file with the Maryland State Law Library). <em>See also </em>Governance Chronology, S. 481, 387 Sess. (1984) (explaining that in 1977, the \u201cAppropriations Committee of the Maryland House of Delegates decided to gradually phase out general fund support for both operations and capital for the University of Maryland Hospital.\u201d) According to the General Assembly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">[i]t [had] proven unnecessarily costly and administratively cumbersome for the University to finance, manage, and carry out the patient care activities of an academic institution within the existing framework of a State agency, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>many applicable laws, management structures, and procedures were developed to implement types of governmental functions which differ from the operations of a major patient care facility in an environment of State and federal regulation!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><em>See </em>Md.Code (1978, 2008 Repl.VoL), \u00a7 13-302(5) of the Education Article (\u201cEd.\u201d).

It formed UMMS, a \u201cprivate, nonprofit, nonstock corporation!.]\u201d Ed. \u00a7 13-301(m). The General Assembly transferred all University medical system <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> assets, as determined by the Board of Public Works, to UMMS. Ed. \u00a7 13-307(a). In exchange for the assets, UMMS assumed the University medical systems\u2019 liabilities to the extent provided in the statute or in the annual contract between UMMS and the University. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-308(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">UMMS\u2019s mission was \u201cto provide medical care of the type unique to University medical facilities for the citizens of the State and region and, in accomplishing this objective, to provide a clinical context for education and research conducted by the faculty of the University!.]\u201d Ed. \u00a7 13-302(1). Moreover, UMMS was to \u201crender! ] comprehensive health care to the community naturally served by University Hospital to assure its availability to citizens of that community!.]\u201d Ed. \u00a7 13-302(3). \u201cThese purposes separately and collectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>serve the highest public interest and are essential to the public health and welfare[.]\u201d Ed. \u00a7 13-302(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Although the General Assembly created a separate corporate entity, it did not relinquish all control of UMMS. The corporation could not exist until its Articles of Incorporation were approved by the Board of Public Works. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-303(a)(1). Additionally, all voting members on UMMS\u2019s Board of Directors are appointed by the Governor, two of whom must be members of the General Assembly and nominated by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Delegates, respectively. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-304(b) &amp; (c)(3). The Governor also fills any vacancies on the Board. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-304(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">UMMS must also submit annual contracts to the University\u2019s Board of Regents. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-306(a). These contracts set forth \u201call financial obligations, exchanges of services, and any other agreed relationships between the University and [UMMS] for the ensuing fiscal year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, UMMS must annually file audited financial statements with the Governor, the Joint Audit Committee, and University Board of Regents. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-303(g). UMMS may request grants from the General Assembly only after approval by the University Regents, <em>see </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-303(i), and the State Treasurer may loan funds to UMMS, if funds have been appropriated in the annual State budget, only with approval from the Board of Public Works, <em>see </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-309. UMMS must also \u201ccoordinate with [the] University [any] fundraising efforts[,] all [UMMS] campaigns and solicitations for private gifts[,] and proposals for private or federal grants.\u201d Ed. \u00a7 13\u2014303(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Finally, if the University Regents and the Board of Public Works determine that UMMS has failed to realize the purposes set forth in its enacting statute, they have the power to terminate UMMS. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-311(c). Upon dissolution, and after any outstanding debts have been satisfied, all remaining UMMS assets revert to the State. <em>See </em>Ed. \u00a7 13-311(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>II. Napata\u2019s Request For UMMS Records</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Following the racketeering conviction of former State Senator Thomas Bromwell for his role in influencing the awarding of a UMMS construction contract,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner Napata sought access to the UMMS records relating to that contract. UMMS denied his request, explaining that its business records \u201care not subject to disclosure under the Maryland Public Information Act\u201d because UMMS is a \u201cprivate, non profit corporation and <em>not </em>an agency or division of the State of Maryland.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In response, Napata filed this action. He appeared before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on two separate motions, and was unsuccessful both times. The first involved his own Motion for Summary Judgment, which the judge denied on the grounds that the PIA did not apply to UMMS because the General Assembly intended \u201cto separate [UMMS] from the ties to the University and the state which subjected it to the public scrutiny and bureaucratic processes which formerly obstructed its growth.\u201d A little over a month later, a different judge adopted similar reasoning when granting UMMS\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. She concluded that UMMS \u201cis not[,] pursuant to the statute[,] an instrumentality of the State and therefore, not subject to the [PIA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Napata appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of his case to the Court of Special Appeals. Following a thorough analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision, but for different reasons. While it agreed with Napata that UMMS was an instrumentality of the State, the intermediate appellate court concluded that UMMS was exempt from the PIA because the entity\u2019s enacting statute expressly provided that the corporation was not subject to laws affecting only governmental or public entities. The Court interpreted the PIA as one of these laws. Napata then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted. <em>See Napata v. UMMSC, </em>411 Md. 740, 985 A.2d 538 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AkP\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The role of an appellate court is substantially similar whether reviewing the grant of summary judgment or the grant of a motion to dismiss. In both instances, the standard is whether the trial court was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Compare Eng\u2019g Mgmt. Servs. v. Md. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 229, 825 A.2d 966, 976 (2003) (\u201cThe standard for appellate review of a summary judgment is whether it is \u2018legally correct.\u2019 \u201d) <em>with Sprenger v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n., </em>400 Md. 1, 21, 926 A.2d 238, 250 (\u201cWhen reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, an appellate court is concerned with determining whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d). Moreover, with regard to both types of motions, \u201cwe accept all well-pled facts in the complaint, and reasonable inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Sprenger, </em>400 Md. at 21, 926 A.2d at 249 (motion to dismiss). <em>See also Reiter v. Pneumo Abex, </em>417 Md. 57, 67, 8 A.3d 725, 731 (2010) (same for grant of summary judgment). The facts of the underlying action are uncontested. Thus, we are simply tasked with a <em>de novo </em>review of the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See Reichs Ford Rd. Joint Venture v. State Rds. Comm\u2019n of the State Highway Admin., </em>388 Md. 500, 509, 880 A.2d 307, 312 (2005) (motion to dismiss); <em>Reiter, </em>417 Md. at 67, 8 A.3d at 731 (summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The PIA governs access to public records. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-611 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d). Under the Act, \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, a custodian shall permit a person or governmental unit to inspect any public record at any reasonable time.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-613(a)(l). The PIA defines a \u201cpublic record\u201d as \u201cany documentary material\u201d that \u201cis made by a unit or instrumentality of the State government or of a political subdivision or received by the unit or instrumentality in connection with the transaction of public business.... \u201d SG \u00a7 10-611(g). Furthermore, a \u201ccustodian\u201d is either \u201cthe official custodian\u201d or \u201cany other authorized individual who has physical custody and control of a public record.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-611(c). It follows from these three provisions that the reach of the PIA is limited to (1) \u201ccustodians\u201d of the records or (2) organizations that are units or instrumentalities of the State or political subdivisions, that are not otherwise shielded from the PIA by law. Thus, to determine whether UMMS had an obligation, under the PIA, to provide the requested records to Napata, we will first address whether UMMS is a unit or instrumentality of the State. If we determine that it is an instrumentality, we must then ascertain whether UMMS is otherwise exempt from the PIA by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\n<em>A. Unit Or Instrumentality Of The State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">This Court has repeatedly announced that there is no single test for determining whether an entity is a unit or instrumentality of the State. <em>See A.S. Abell Publishing Company v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 35, 464 A.2d 1068, 1072 (1983). Rather, \u201c[a]ll aspects of the interrelationship between the State and the statutorily-established entity must be examined in order to determine its status.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Courts must consider a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>number of factors, including the degree of control exercised by the State over the entity. <em>Id. </em>Yet, \u201ccomplete control\u2014control over all aspects of an entity\u2019s operation\u2014is not a determinative factor in characterizing a statutorily-established entity as an agency or instrumentality of the State.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">We emphasized the importance of examining all aspects of the government-entity relationship for purposes of the PIA in <em>City of Baltimore Development Corporation v. Carmel Realty Associates, </em>395 Md. 299, 910 A.2d 406 (2006). There, we rejected the assertion that the City of Baltimore Corporation (the \u201cBDC\u201d), a not-for-profit real-estate development corporation, was not subject to the PIA simply because it was not a statutorily-created entity. <em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 910 A.2d at 427-28. Instead, we favored a more comprehensive analysis. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the following aspects of the BDC\u2019s relationship with the City of Baltimore made it an instrumentality of the City:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">The BDC\u2019s Board of Directors, to include the Chairman of the Board, are nominated or appointed by the Mayor of Baltimore; he has the power to remove members of the Board before their four year terms are up; the Mayor also has the power to fill vacancies; the City\u2019s Commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development and the City\u2019s Director of Finance are permanent members of the Board; the BDC receives a substantial portion of its budget from the City; the BDC has a tax exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code; pursuant to the City\u2019s contract with the BDC, if it should cease to exist, the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>would control the disposition of the BDC\u2019s assets; BDC is also authorized to prepare and adopt Urban Renewal Plans, Planned Unit Developments, Industrial Retention Zones, and Free Enterprise Zones which are traditionally governmental functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 335, 910 A.2d at 428. We also viewed the purpose behind the BDC\u2019s formation as indicative of this status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">[T]he BDC was formed to plan and implement long range development strategies throughout the City of Baltimore [on] behalf of the City of Baltimore; to implement, oversee, and encourage development that will increase the City\u2019s tax base; to provide jobs in the City; to enhance and improve the physical and cultural environment of the City; to improve the economic health of the City; and to be responsible for Urban Renewal Plans, Planned Unit Developments, Industrial Retention Zones, and Free Enterprise Zones on behalf of the City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 334, 910 A.2d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">We applied the same test to a Maryland city\u2019s hospital after it denied a newspaper reporter\u2019s PIA request,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with similar results. In <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, </em>276 Md. 211, 345 A.2d 855 (1975), we held that Memorial Hospital of Cumberland, a corporation, was \u201can agency of the City of Cumberland\u201d because of the hospital\u2019s close relationship to the city and its creation \u201cfor municipal purposes[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 345 A.2d at 862-63. Cumberland bonds financed the hospital\u2019s construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>tion, and both the Mayor and the President of the Board of County Commissioners of Allegany County sat on the hospital\u2019s Board of Governors. <em>Id. </em>at 214-15, 345 A.2d at 857. Moreover, the Board of Governors could not increase its capital account without the permission of both the Mayor and City Council of Cumberland. <em>Id. </em>at 224, 345 A.2d at 862. If the hospital suffered from a deficit, the Mayor and City Council could appropriate the necessary funds for the hospital. <em>Id. </em>Conjointly, the hospital was to donate any profits to the City\u2019s \u201cSinking Fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These factors, taken together, were enough to satisfy the PIA\u2019s agency requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Two other cases are analogous to this one, and in both, the entity was determined to be an instrumentality of the State for purposes of the PIA. In <em>Andy\u2019s Ice Cream, Inc. v. City of Salisbury, </em>125 Md.App. 125, 136, 724 A.2d 717, 722 (1999), an unsuccessful contract bidder claimed that, pursuant to the PIA, the Salisbury Zoo Commission was required to disclose the grounds for its bid decision. The Zoo Commission\u2019s members were appointed by the Mayor and City Council of Salisbury, who could also dissolve the Zoo Commission at will. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 724 A.2d at 725. Moreover, the \u201cZoo Commission [had to] receive the City\u2019s approval before altering its own By-Laws or making \u201cmajor departures\u201d from its budget.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, in <em>Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 464 A.2d 1068, a reporter sought to inspect certain records of the Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cMIGA\u201d) under the PIA. An examination of MIGAs\u2019 operations showed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnZ\">MIGA\u2019s existence depend[ed] upon the General Assembly; it servefd] a public purpose, its management [was] selected by the Commissioner, and [was] not self-perpetuating; it [did] not independently manage its affairs or enforce its regulations; its decisions [could] be reversed by the Commissioner; and it enjoy[ed] a special tax and liability status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGX\"><em>Id. </em>at 38-39, 464 A.2d at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Turning to the case at hand, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cthe attributes of UMMS\u2019s relationship with the State that point to its being an instrumentality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>State predominate over those pointing to its private character, for purposes of the corporation\u2019s inclusion in the scope of the PIA.\u201d UMMS did not exist until the State assets were transferred to the corporation. Its aim of providing health care to the local community, as well as a teaching hospital to University students, and Maryland residents serves a public purpose. Moreover, the State remains a visible and compelling force in UMMS\u2019s operations. All voting members on UMMS\u2019s Board of Directors are appointed by the Governor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and two of these flow from nominations by the respective leaders of each legislative chamber.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additionally, unlike an independent hospital, UMMS is not free to compete with the University for private gifts or private or federal grants, and its annual contracts must be approved by the Regents of the University. Should UMMS become financially unstable, the Treasurer may loan State funds to UMMS as necessary. Finally, the Regents and the Board of Public Works have the power to dissolve UMMS if they determine that it is not fulfilling its purpose. In that event, UMMS\u2019s assets will revert to the State. These facts compel the conclusion that UMMS is an instrumentality of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><em>B. Except </em>As <em>Otherwise Provided By Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Notwithstanding its status as a state instrumentality, we should not conclude that UMMS is subject to the PIA without considering the exemption set forth in Ed. \u00a7 13-303(a)(2), the state law authorizing the creation of UMMS. This exemption provides that UMMS \u201cshall not be a State agency, political subdivision, public body, public corporation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>municipal corporation and is not subject to any provisions of law affecting only governmental or public entities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added). Thus, UMMS will be exempt from the PIA if we conclude that the PIA is a law that affects only governmental or public entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Considering this question, we turn to the text of the statute\u2014the PIA governs records \u201cmade by a unit or instrumentality of the State[.]\u201d SG \u00a7 10-611(g). Like the Court of Special Appeals, we cannot \u201cdistinguish the \u2018instrumentality\u2019 of State government, that is the limit of the reach of the PIA, from a \u2018public entity,\u2019 that is the reach of the UMMS exemption.\u201d As we see no meaningful distinction between these two terms, for purposes of these statutes they are synonymous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the general exemption UMMS enjoys by virtue of Ed. \u00a7 13-303(a)(2) includes exemption from the requirements of the PIA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Napata contests this logic, arguing that exempting UMMS from the reach of the PIA conflicts with the purposes of that Act, which, according to Napata, is providing the public with \u201cbroad access to information concerning the operation of governmental instrumentalities.\u201d Yet, as Respondent argues, the purpose of the corporation\u2019s statutory exemption is to \u201cliberat[e] UMMS from the burdens placed on government agencies.\u201d We have previously described how two seemingly inconsistent statutes can be reconciled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">Even though two statutes may require conflicting results with regard to their common subject, they are not thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>necessarily rendered irreconcilable. Where provisions of one of the statutes deal with the common subject generally and those of the other do so more specifically, the statutes may be harmonized by viewing the more specific statute as an exception to the more general one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\"><em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132-33, 630 A.2d 713 (1993). Here, the PIA generally applies to instrumentalities or units of the State, whereas UMMS\u2019s enacting statute pertains specifically to UMMS. It follows, then, that the UMMS statute is an exception to the PIA. Indeed, the PIA expressly builds in this exception: <em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, </em>a custodian shall permit a person or governmental unit to inspect any public record at any reasonable time.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-613(a)(l) (emphasis added). Thus, UMMS is shielded from the PIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Recent legislative history is consistent with our decision. In 2007, the General Assembly rejected a Senate bill that would have amended Ed. \u00a7 13-303 to include new language that \u201c[UMMS] shall be subject to the provisions of the Maryland Public Information Act____\u201d Senate Bill 911, 423rd Sess. (Md.2007). The stated purpose of the bill was to make \u201c[UMMS] subject to certain provisions of State law relating to access to public records.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Although a failed statutory amendment \u201cis not an infallible indicator of legislative intent[,]\u201d <em>Andy\u2019s Ice Cream, </em>125 Md.App. at 154, 724 A.2d at 731, we have indicated that \u201csuch action strengthens the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to achieve the results that the amendment would have achieved, if adopted.\u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 721, 720 A.2d 311, 317 (1998) <em>(iquoting Demory Bros. v. Bd. Of Pub.

UMMS, however, is not subject to the public information law because its enacting statute expressly exempts it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>from laws affecting only public entities. Thus, UMMS was authorized to deny Napata\u2019s PIA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The law clearly recognizes the University as an instrumentality of the State. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1978, 2008 Repl.VoL), \u00a7 12-102(a)(2) of the Education Article (\"The University is an instrumentality of the State and a public corporation.\u201d); <em>see also Pearson v.

UMMS would have us abandon this comprehensive analysis for a simple lexical exercise. It relies on the interchangeability of the terms ''instrumentality\u201d and \u201cagency\u201d to support its argument that, when the General Assembly declared that UMMS would \"not be a State agency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>political subdivision, public body, public corporation, municipal corporation!,]'' Ed. \u00a7 13-303(a)(2), it meant that UMMS was not an instrumentality of the State. Yet, unlike \u00a7 9-401(f) of the Environment Article cited by UMMS, which defines \u201cFederal agency\u201d as, among other things, any \"instrumentality of the United States!,]\u201d we cannot find any evidence that the General Assembly intended the same definition for the term \"State agency\" as used in a wholly separate article. Moreover, the terminology used to describe the relationship is not controlling. We look instead to the attributes of the relationship. <em>Cf. Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 503, 735 A.2d 1039, 1048 (1999) (listing the three fact-specific characteristics of an agency relationship, none of which is the label assigned by the parties).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\">. At the time of <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, 276 </em>Md. 211, 345 A.2d 855 (1975), the PIA was codified in Md.Code (1957, 1975 Repl.VoL), Art. 76A, \u00a7 1. Subsection (a) of that section provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">The term 'public records\u2019 when not otherwise specified shall include any paper, correspondence, form, book, photograph, photostat, film, microfilm, sound recording, map drawing, or other document, regardless of physical form or characteristics, and including all copies thereof, that have been made by the State and any counties, municipalities and political subdivisions thereof and <em>by any agencies of the State, counties, municipalities, and political subdivisions thereof, </em>or received by them in connection with the transaction of public business, except those privileged or confidential by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Md.Code (1957, 1975 Repl.VoL), Art. 76A, \u00a7 1(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">. The same authority was given to the Commissioner in <em>Mezzanote </em>and the respective mayors in <em>Carmel Realty </em>and <em>Andy\u2019s Ice Cream.

Under our analysis, a private entity that contracts with the State to store records on the State\u2019s behalf would be an \"authorized individual who has physical custody and control of a public record\u201d (i.e. a physical custodian). See SG \u00a7 10-611(c) (defining \"custodian\"). Thus, it would be a \u201cpublic entity\u201d or \"state instrumentality,\u201d but only in that capacity. In other words, such a storage facility must comply with the PIA insofar as any request pertains to those government records. Its own unrelated records are not subject to the PIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b768-11\">.
