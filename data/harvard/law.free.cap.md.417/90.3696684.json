A juvenile court is authorized by statute to terminate the legal relationship between a parent and child upon certain conditions, and after certain findings are made. Maryland Code, (1984, 2006 Repl. Vol., 2009 Supp.), \u00a7 5-323 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). Although the paramount consideration identified in the statute, as set forth in subsection (b), is the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d constitutional and common-law rights of parents require consideration of countervailing factors that can make the \u201cbest interest\u201d analysis somewhat circuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Judge Wilner, writing for this Court in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Rashawn H. and Tyrese H., </em>402 Md. 477, 937 A.2d 177 (2007), undertook a comprehensive review of Termination of Parental Rights (\u201cTPR\u201d) cases, as well as those involving claims by third parties to custody of children in an effort to reconcile some seeming inconsistencies in our decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 494, 937 A.2d at 189. He concluded that \u201cour case law has been clear and consistent, that, even in contested adoption and TPR cases ... the best interest of the child remains the ultimate governing standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 937 A.2d at 189. This opinion is invaluable for achieving an understanding of the law in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Yet, it is undeniable that in our prior decisions we have struggled in defining how parental unfitness, exceptional circumstances and the child\u2019s best interest analyses relate to one another. <em>Compare Shurupoff v. Vockroth, </em>372 Md. 639, 662, 814 A.2d 543, 557 (2003) (stating that the child\u2019s best interest is the \u201cultimate, determinative factor\u201d in custody disputes) <em>with McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 418, 869 A.2d 751, 808 (2005) (stating that \u201cthe constitutional right [of the parent] is the ultimate determinative factor.\u201d). To ensure that juvenile courts have clear and consistent guidance as they decide whether termination of parental rights is justified in a given case, we reexamine the law in this area and confirm once again that the child\u2019s best interest is the prevailing standard in these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">At the heart of this TPR case is a seven-year-old girl, Ta\u2019Niya.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In October 2004, when Ta\u2019Niya was eighteen months old, she and her older sister, Jamiara, came to the attention of the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) when it received reports that the house where the children were living was dirty, and that Ta\u2019Niya had ringworm. By the time DSS intervened, Jamiara had gone to live with a maternal relative. Four years later, a court ordered that Jamiara be returned to the care of Ms. L., the girls\u2019 biological mother, subject to an Order of Protective Supervision. Ta\u2019Niya, however, was adjudicated a Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because Ms. L. did not have stable and appropriate housing, Ta\u2019Niya was diagnosed with high levels of lead and was behind in her immunizations, and Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s father was not in a position to care for her, he himself needing housing and mental health assistance. As no other relatives were willing to care for Ta\u2019Niya, DSS placed her in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">From October 2004 to January 2009, Ta\u2019Niya was placed in three different homes. When she was first placed in foster care, she experienced behavioral problems, including pulling her hair out, extensive crying, and hitting. These behaviors gradually subsided and later disappeared after Ta\u2019Niya went to live in the foster home of Alicia and Luther W. At the time of the TPR hearing, Ta\u2019Niya appeared to be a \u201cvery happy\u201d child, who was doing well in school, loved to read, and had \u201can incredible relationship\u201d with her foster parents, whom she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>called \u201cmommy\u201d and \u201cdaddy.\u201d Mr. and Mrs. W. continued to be Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s foster parents at the time of the TPR hearing and expressed a wish to adopt her.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">During the four years that Ta\u2019Niya was in the foster care system, Ms. L. had limited contact with her. From October 2004 to January 2007, Ms. L. requested only two visits with Ta\u2019Niya. Ms. L. testified that she frequently visited Ta\u2019Niya from September 2005 to November 2006, when Ta\u2019Niya lived with a relative, but did not notify DSS of those visits. From November 2006 through January 2008, Ms. L. visited Ta\u2019Niya three times. In fact, Ms. L. did not begin to visit Ta\u2019Niya on a regular basis until after DSS filed its TPR petition in January 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Ms. L.\u2019s reunification attempts with Ta\u2019Niya through DSS have also been scarce. Over the time period from October 2004 to January 2008, Ms. L. signed four family service agreements, the terms of which were substantially the same: Ms. L. was to complete parenting classes, obtain stable housing, maintain employment, and submit to a substance abuse test. To assist Ms. L. in fulfilling these requirements, DSS\u2019s case workers provided Ms. L. with referrals for housing, job readiness programs, and employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet despite these efforts, Ms. L. showed no progress with regard to the terms of the service agreements, other than completing parenting classes by December 2004.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In January 2007, Ms. L. informed DSS that she had been approved to receive food stamps and disability insurance. She also moved in with her mother at that time, and in September 2007, they began renting a house together. One month later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Ms. L. started working for a cleaning company but was laid off in September 2008. After that, Ms. L. worked for a temp agency and made additional money on the side cutting hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">As time progressed without a showing that Ms. L. was ready for reunification with Ta\u2019Niya,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> DSS filed a Petition for Guardianship of Ta\u2019Niya, seeking termination of Ms. L.\u2019s parental rights. In May 2008, Ms. L. completed a second 10-week parenting class and, in August 2008, she completed a drug screen and did not appear to need treatment or counseling. The week before trial, Ms. L. was rehired by the cleaning company for which she had worked in 2007, but her living arrangements were again uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The TPR hearing lasted three days, and at the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court denied DSS\u2019s petition, ruling that DSS failed to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that Ms. L. was unfit or that there were exceptional circumstances that would justify termination of Ms. L.\u2019s parental rights. In reaching its conclusion, the court \u201cvery quickly\u201d examined the statutory considerations enumerated in FL Section 5-B23.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The court began its oral opinion by stating that <em>Rashawn </em>\u201cchanged the law\u201d by \u201cchang[ing] it now from how it looks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the child to what should happen regarding the parents.\u201d In finding that no exceptional circumstances existed, the court seemed to focus solely on Ms. L.\u2019s actions and inactions. Namely, the court acknowledged that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a great performance by the mother, [but] she did much of what she was asked for. Not timely, not well-documented, but what she didn\u2019t do I don\u2019t think rises to the level of extraordinary circumstances that would justify termination.\u201d Later, the court reiterated that \u201cfailure for lack of timely performance [does] not amount to exceptional circumstances[.]\u201d Yet, at the same time, the court commented that Ms. L. is not \u201ca person who can take care of a child[,]\u201d and that she may never \u201cbe ready\u201d to have Ta\u2019Niya back.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The court was also puzzled by DSS\u2019s insistence on termination of parental rights when Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s half-sibling, Jamiara, had already been returned to Ms. L.\u2019s care. The court reasoned that if, in Jamiara\u2019s case, Ms. L. was fit and there were no exceptional circumstances that would have prevented her from reuniting with Jamiara, \u201cthen [it] is the same with respect to Ja\u2019Mira [sic] as it is with respect to Ta\u2019Niya[.]\u201d At the end of its oral opinion, the juvenile court acknowledged that leaving her foster parents would be detrimental to Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s well-being but maintained that <em>\u201cRashawn H. </em>would almost ask us to ignore that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Ta\u2019Niya filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals (\u201cCSA\u201d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> arguing that the juvenile court erred as a matter of law when deciding not to terminate Ms. L.\u2019s parental rights by mistakenly believing that <em>Rashawn </em>\u201cchanged the standard in termination of parental rights cases from best interest of the child to best interest of the parent,\u201d and \u201cprecluded it from viewing the totality of circumstances of the case because Mother had custody of [Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s] half-sibling under an order of protective supervision.\u201d Ta\u2019Niya also argued that the juvenile court \u201cabused its discretion in denying the termination of parental rights when the trial court found that [Ta\u2019Niya] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>should not be returned to Mother, that there were no services that would assist Mother in having [Ta\u2019Niya] returned, and that Mother might never be ready to have [Ta\u2019Niya] returned to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">In an unreported opinion, the CSA affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s decision. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>No. 2863, slip. op. at 7-13 (August 28, 2009). The CSA held that \u201cnotwithstanding [the juvenile court judge\u2019s] colorful description of the holding in <em>Rashawn, </em>he remained focused on the appropriate legal standard and considered the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. The court also held that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion as \u201ca fair reading of the court\u2019s ruling discloses that the circuit court judge\u2019s puzzlement that [DSS] had returned appellant\u2019s sibling to her mother was not a decisive factor in his analysisf,]\u201d and the court\u2019s finding that Ms. L. was presently unfit to be Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s permanent custodian was not inconsistent with its finding that Ms. L. was not \u201cso unfit as to lose parental rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Ta\u2019Niya filed a petition for certiorari, and we granted review to consider the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">1) Whether it is desirable or in the public interest to interpret <em>Rashawn H. </em>as requiring a court to use a parental interest standard when making a decision to terminate parental rights, thereby, denying permanency to Ta\u2019Niya C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">2) Whether it is desirable or in the public interest to interpret the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d provision in <em>Rashawn H. </em>in a manner that denies permanency to a child who has been out of her mother\u2019s care for over four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">3) Whether the lower court\u2019s denial of the Petition to terminate parental rights demonstrated an application of federal and state permanency planning statutes that was desirable and in the public interest when that application failed to provide permanency for Ta\u2019Niya C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-9\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>411 Md. 598, 984 A.2d 243 (2009). For reasons we explain below, we hold that the trial court erred in interpreting <em>Rashawn </em>and reverse on the first issue. We do not reach the remaining two issues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>because their resolution depended on the court\u2019s misunderstanding of <em>Rashawn. </em>We remand for consideration of these issues under the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aln\">Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In reviewing a juvenile court\u2019s decision with regard to termination of parental rights, we utilize three different but interrelated standards. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship of Victor A., </em>386 Md. 288, 297, 872 A.2d 662, 667 (2005). Namely,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">[w]hen the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of [Rule 8-131(e) ] applies. [Second,] [i]f it appears that the [court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Yve S, </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030, 1051 (2003)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">TPR Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">FL Section 5-323 is the Maryland statute governing termination of parental rights. In Subsection (b) thereof, a juvenile court is granted the right, not present under common law, to terminate parental rights and grant guardianship of the child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOo\">(b) Authority.\u2014If, after consideration of factors as required in this section, a juvenile court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a parent is unfit to remain in a parental relationship with the child or that exceptional circumstances exist that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interests of the child such that terminating the rights of the parent is in a child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court may grant guardianship of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>child without consent otherwise required under this subtitle and over the child\u2019s objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The balance of FL Section 5-323 sets forth certain factors to be considered and procedures that must be followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Petitioner Ta\u2019Niya C. argues that the juvenile court erred when it interpreted <em>Rashawn H. </em>as changing the law governing TPR cases to a standard favoring parental interest over the child\u2019s best interest, and consequently refused to terminate the parental rights of Ms. L, Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s mother. Ms. L, Respondent, contends that \u201cthe record, when viewed as a whole, demonstrates that the trial court applied the correct legal standard[.]\u201d At the time of the hearing, subsection (b) of that statute provided that in order for a juvenile court to grant DSS guardianship of a child without a parent\u2019s consent, the court must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201cterminating the rights of a parent is in the child\u2019s best interests[.]\u201d As the statute requires and as we have recently expounded in <em>Rashawn, </em>in making those determinations, a juvenile court must consider and make specific findings with respect to the relevant statutory factors under FL Section 5-323(d), and, \u201cmindful of the presumption favoring a continuation of the parental relationship, determine expressly whether those findings suffice either to show an unfitness ... or to constitute an exceptional circumstance that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interest of the child[.]\u201d <em>Rashawn, </em>402 Md. at 501, 937 A.2d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">At the time we decided <em>Rashaum, </em>the TPR statute<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> did not expressly require that a juvenile court find parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances that would make continuation of a legal relationship with the parent detrimental to the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>best interest. <em>See id. </em>at 489-91, 937 A.2d at 185. Rather, it required only a finding that terminating parental rights was in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>See id. </em>Thus, in <em>Rashawn, </em>a mother, whose parental rights had been terminated, argued that Maryland\u2019s TPR statute was unconstitutional because it did not take into consideration the parent\u2019s Constitutionally-based right to raise his or her children. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 937 A.2d at 187-88. In considering the mother\u2019s claim, we recognized the presumption that it is in the best interest of children to remain in the custody of their parents. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 937 A.2d at 188. We emphasized, however, that the parents\u2019 right is not absolute and \u201cmust be balanced against the fundamental right and responsibility of the State to protect children, who cannot protect themselves, from abuse and neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 937 A.2d at 189. Therefore, this parental presumption \u201cmay be rebutted upon a showing either that the parent is \u2018unfit\u2019 or that \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 exist which would make continued custody with the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 937 A.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Even though at that time our TPR statute did not call for the finding of either parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances, we nevertheless found that this necessary finding was \u201cimplicit from the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Rashawn, </em>402 Md. at 498, 937 A.2d at 190. Accordingly, in order to protect parental rights, we pointed out that in applying the statutory provisions, juvenile courts must keep in mind \u201cthree critical elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>First, the court must focus on the continued parental relationship and require that \u201cfacts ... demonstrate an unfitness to have a continued parental relationship with the child, or exceptional circumstances that would make a continued parental relationship detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 937 A.2d at 190. Second, the State must show parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Third, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>must consider the statutory factors listed in subsection (d) to determine whether exceptional circumstances<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> warranting termination of parental rights exist.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>What has proved to be elusive in this equation is defining \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d and determining its interaction with the \u201cchild\u2019s best interests\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Probing The Meaning Of <em>Rashawn</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><em>Rashawn </em>explicitly reiterated that \u201cthe best interest of the child remains the ultimate governing standard\u201d in contested adoption cases, TPR proceedings, and permanency plan proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 937 A.2d at 189. <em>Rashawn </em>also made clear that the same factors that a court uses to determine whether termination of parental rights is in the child\u2019s best interest under the TPR statute equally serve to determine whether exceptional circumstances exist. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 937 A.2d at 190. In its words, \u201c[The statutory] factors, though couched as considerations in determining whether termination is in the child\u2019s best interest, serve also as criteria for determining the kinds of exceptional circumstances that would suffice to rebut the presumption favoring a continued parental relationship and justify termination of that relationship.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Despite these clear pronouncements that the child\u2019s best interest infuses every element of a court\u2019s analysis in TPR cases, other language crept into the opinion and apparently caused confusion. Specifically, citing <em>McDermott v. Dougher</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>ty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005), <em>Rashawn </em>said that if no parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances exist, \u201cthere is no need to inquire further as to where the best interest of the child lies.\u201d <em>Rashawn, </em>402 Md. at 495, 937 A.2d at 177.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This \u201cother language\u201d, which we call the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language, could be interpreted to mean that parental unfitness, exceptional circumstances and the child\u2019s best interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>are different and separate analyses, and even that the child\u2019s best interest inquiry does not come into play until there is a finding of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances. This may explain here the juvenile judge\u2019s belief, albeit mistaken, that <em>Rashawn </em>\u201cchanged the law\u201d and moved our analysis away from the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard. Such a reading, however, is misguided. In explaining the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language, we trace its origin and examine its context.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Although borrowed from <em>McDermott, </em>the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language actually can be traced to our decision in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 372 A.2d 582 (1977). <em>Ross </em>is a seminal custody case that involved a custody dispute between the natural mother and third parties who cared for the child full-time for over eight years. <em>Id. </em>at 181-82, 372 A.2d at 589-90. Despite the presumption that being in the custody of a natural parent is in the child\u2019s best interest, we upheld the award of custody to the third parties because (1) there were exceptional circumstances that would have made giving custody to the natural mother detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest, and (2) remaining in the custody of the third parties was in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 372 A.2d at 594. In so holding, we emphasized that the child\u2019s best interest is \u201calways determinative in child custody disputes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 372 A.2d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The <em>Ross </em>Court also laid out the following factors for deciding whether there are exceptional circumstances that would make parental custody detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">[T]he length of time the child has been away from the biological parent, the age of the child when care was assumed by the third party, the possible emotional effect on the child of a change of custody, the period of time which elapsed before the parent sought to reclaim the child, the nature and strength of the ties between the child and the third party custodian, the intensity and genuineness of the parent\u2019s desire to have the child, the stability and certainty as to the child\u2019s future in the custody of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 191, 372 A.2d at 593. We also observed that \u201c[t]he child may be so long in the custody of the nonparent that, even though there has been no abandonment or persistent neglect by the parent, the psychological trauma of removal is grave enough to be detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 372 A.2d at 594-95 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language cropped up there for the first time. After clear iteration that the child\u2019s best interest is \u201calways determinative in child custody disputes,\u201d the Court immediately added that \u201cin parent-third party disputes over custody, it is only upon a determination ... that the parent is unfit or that there are exceptional circumstances ... that the court need inquire into the best interest of the child in order to make a proper custodial disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 372 A.2d at 587. The potential for this language to mislead has lingered.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We confronted this potential in <em>Shurupoff v. Vockroth, </em>which was a custody dispute case between a natural father and maternal grandparents. 372 Md. 639, 814 A.2d 543 (2003). There we reiterated that \u201c[t]he court must always, necessarily, inquire into what is in the child\u2019s best interest, for that is the ultimate, determinative factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 814 A.2d at 557. We explained that when we said in <em>Ross </em>that there was no need to inquire into the child\u2019s best interest if the parent was fit and there were no exceptional circumstances, we \u201csimply intended to make clear that, because of the presumption [favoring parental custody], a parent and a third party do not stand on an equal footing, and that, before the third party may be granted custody, he or she must rebut the presumption[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>To clarity even further, we continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">[s]o long as the best interest of the child remains the definitive standard and there is any reasonable alternative, it defies both logic and common sense to place a child in the custody of anyone, including a parent, when either that person is unfit to have custody or such action, because of exceptional circumstances, would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest. What Ross teaches is that (1) the best interest standard applies and prevails, and (2) that standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>is gratified by giving custody to the parent when the presumption has not been rebutted and by denying custody to the parent when it has been rebutted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Two years later, however, in <em>McDermott, </em>a custody dispute between a father and maternal grandparents, the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language was re-introduced, but only for instances when private third parties seek custody against the will of a parent. <em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 374, 869 A.2d at 782.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court stated that it did not intend to alter the child\u2019s best interest standard that governs visitation and custody disputes, <em>id. </em>at 354, 869 A.2d at 770, but nevertheless held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">[I]n private actions in which private third parties are attempting to gain custody of children of natural parents over the objection of the natural parents, it is necessary first to prove that the parent is unfit or that there are extraordinary circumstances posing serious detriment to the child, before the court may apply a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOu\"><em>Id. </em>at 374-75, 869 A.2d at 783 (emphasis added).

His opinion carried forward the precept from earlier TPR cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>that the child\u2019s best interests and exceptional circumstances are inseparable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">Nonetheless, our case law has been clear and consistent, that, even in contested adoption and TPR cases (and in permanency plan proceedings that may inevitably lead to a TPR case), where the fundamental right of parents to raise their children stands in the starkest contrast to the State\u2019s effort to protect those children from unacceptable neglect or abuse, the best interest of the child remains the ultimate governing standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><em>Rashmm, </em>402 Md. at 496, 937 A.2d at 189. The opinion also recognized that \u201cthe child\u2019s welfare is a consideration that is of transcendent importance when the child might otherwise be in jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Judge Wilner then harmonized the earlier cases, as he explained how to achieve the appropriate balance when the interests of parents and the interests of children conflict in a TPR case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">The court\u2019s role in TPR cases is to give the most careful consideration to the relevant statutory factors, to make specific findings based on the evidence with respect to each of them, and, mindful of the presumption favoring a continuation of the parental relationship, determine expressly whether those findings suffice either to show an unfitness on the part of the parent to remain in a parental relationship with the child or to constitute an exceptional circumstance that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interest of the child, and, if so, how. If the court does that\u2014articulates its conclusion as to the best interest of the child in that manner\u2014the parental rights we have recognized and the statutory basis for terminating those rights are in proper and harmonious balance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 501, 937 A.2d 177 (emphasis in original). This harmonizing synthesis of the law should be the touchstone for courts in TPR cases.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">A careful examination of <em>Rashawn </em>reveals that, despite inclusion of the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language, the Court intended only to place the parent\u2019s important rights in proper perspective, not to elevate it above the child\u2019s best interest, which is the standard infusing all elements of the typical child custody analysis.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Rashawn, </em>while the parental rights are recognized and the statutory requirements of FL Section 5-525 must be met, the child\u2019s best interest standard trumps all other considerations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>simply presents an example of how the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language can be misleading to trial courts and others unless understood properly, and why the new harmonizing language \u25a0penned by Judge Wilner that we set forth above is a better guide for trial courts to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Recently, in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Alonza D., </em>we applied the teachings of <em>Rashawn. </em>We were asked to determine whether proof that a child has been in foster care for a lengthy time, without a finding that continuation of the parental relationship would be detrimental to the child, would amount to exceptional circumstances. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Alonza D., </em>412 Md. 442, 460, 987 A.2d 536, 547 (2010). \u201cUnderscoring] that the children\u2019s welfare continues to be of paramount concern,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 464, 987 A.2d at 549, we held that \u201cpassage of time\u201d alone \u201cis not sufficient to constitute exceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 463, 987 A.2d at 548. For exceptional circumstances to exist, the court must also find that the passage of time when the parent and the child were apart makes continuation of parental relationship detrimental to the best interest of the child. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Examination of these cases, spanning 33 years of Maryland jurisprudence on the topic, reveals that despite occasional rhetoric suggesting otherwise, the child\u2019s best interest has always been the transcendent standard in adoption, third-party custody cases, and TPR proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Mindful of this precept, we now turn to the trial court\u2019s rulings on the specific facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Applying The Best Interest Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Ta\u2019Niya argues that the juvenile court erred in denying DSS\u2019s petition for termination of Ms. L.\u2019s parental rights because the court failed \u201cto apply previous case law and the statutory factors to determine whether exceptional circumstances existed.\u201d Ta\u2019Niya attributes this failure on the juvenile court\u2019s part to the court\u2019s misinterpretation of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Rashawn, </em>as shifting the best interest consideration from the child to the parents. Ta\u2019Niya contends that such an interpretation was erroneous because, in deciding <em>Rashawn, </em>this Court noted that \u201c[it] did not regard this Opinion as changing any substantive law.\u201d (Quoting <em>Rashawn, </em>402 Md. at 505 n. 12, 937 A.2d at 194 n. 12). Ms. L. counters by arguing that the juvenile court correctly understood <em>Rashawn. </em>According to Ms. L., the court properly did not find exceptional circumstances because, as the court stated, \u201calthough it wasn\u2019t a great performance by the mother, she did much of what she was asked for. Not timely, not well-documented, but what she didn\u2019t do I don\u2019t think rises to the level of extraordinary circumstances that would justify termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In order to assess Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s contention that the juvenile court misinterpreted our holding in <em>Rashawn, </em>prompting it to erroneously focus on the parent\u2019s circumstances rather than the child\u2019s best interest, we must examine the record. First, we see the juvenile court\u2019s ruling and the discussion with counsel that preceded it, during which the juvenile court repeated three times that <em>\u201cRashawn, </em>changed the landscape.\u201d Next, during DSS\u2019s closing argument, the court observed that in <em>Rashawn, </em>\u201c[t]he Court of Appeals made new law----They took something and they made a new requirement and it overcomes all the past.\u201d Then, during DSS\u2019s closing argument, the juvenile court explained, \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals has changed it now from how it looks to the child to what should happen regarding the parents.... It\u2019s gone from best interest of the child to best interest of the parents.\u201d (Emphasis added). Still later, when DSS attempted to point out that <em>Rashawn </em>did not change the fact that the child\u2019s best interest was \u201cstill the governing standard,\u201d the court disagreed, \u201c[o]h <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>yes it did, I think it did. It changed it from the focus on the best interest, although they refer to that, it really is about a new requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Although the Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201cnotwithstanding [the juvenile court\u2019s judge\u2019s] colorful description of the holding in <em>Rashawn, </em>he remained focused on the appropriate legal standard and considered the relevant statutory factors,\u201d we do not think the record supports such a conclusion. By its own admission, the juvenile court \u201c[went] through [FL Section 5-323] D [sic] considerations very quickly,\u201d almost as an afterthought, following its finding that there were no exceptional circumstances, and apparently giving little, if any, weight to the FL Section 5-323(d)(4) factors that address termination of parental rights from the point of view of the child\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In its finding that there were no exceptional circumstances that would make continuation of parental relationship detrimental to Ta\u2019Niya, the court focused on Ms. L.\u2019s circumstances, not Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s best interest. For instance, at the very beginning of its bench opinion, the court observed that \u201coverall,' although it wasn\u2019t a great performance by the mother, she did much of what she was asked for. Not timely, not well-documented, but what she didn\u2019t do I don\u2019t think rises to the level of extraordinary circumstances that would justify termination.\u201d Later, the court reiterated, \u201c[t]his mother is not ready, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll ever be ready, but [either] she has not proved herself and [DSS] hasn\u2019t proved her to be [ ] unfit or [the] failure for lack of timely performance do[es] not amount to exceptional circumstances that justify termination of parental rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In contrast, the court did not address Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s emotional ties or lack thereof toward Ms. L. or her half-sibling, Jamiara, under FL Section 5\u2014323(d)(4)(i), or Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s feelings about the severance of her relationship with Ms. L. under FL Section 5\u2014323(d)(4)(iii),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> With respect to the likely impact the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>termination of Ms. L.\u2019s parental rights would have on Ta\u2019Niya under FL \u00a7 5-32S(d)(4)(iv), the court found that \u201cit would be very upsetting going from where she is now to some place else. I mean, she is in a good circumstance[,]\u201d but noted that <em>\u201cRashawn </em>would almost ask us to ignore that.\u201d The court did, however, under FL Section 5\u2014323(d)(4)(ii), find that Ta\u2019Niya was \u201c[v]ery good with the foster parents,\u201d \u201cvery good in the community, the home, the placement, and the school since she\u2019s been with [the foster parents].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Further evidence that Ms. L.\u2019s interests, as opposed to Ta\u2019Niya\u2019s best interest, played the primary role in the juvenile court\u2019s determination that no exceptional circumstances existed is the court\u2019s apparent belief that a finding of exceptional circumstances is not unique to a particular child. The court was so troubled by the fact that DSS sought to terminate Ms. L.\u2019s parental rights with respect to Ta\u2019Niya after it had returned Jamiara to her, that it could not see how there could be exceptional circumstances with respect to Ta\u2019Niya. The court expressed this belief, saying \u201cthere\u2019s only one mother and you want to label her as unfit, you want to say that all of the factors that are in [FL Section] 5-323, if they are looked upon as supporting exceptional circumstances, then it\u2019s the same with respect to Ja\u2019Mira [sic] as it is with respect to Ta\u2019Niya[.]\u201d The court elaborated further, \u201c[i]f the mother is unfit or if exceptional circumstances exist which would justify terminating the parental relationship between her and Ta\u2019Niya, I just cannot see that being consistent, or the placement of Ja\u2019Mira being consistent with granting the Petition to Terminate Parental Rights with respect to a sibling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Such a characterization of the exceptional circumstances analysis is incorrect as it does not take into account circumstances particular to an individual child. A court may reach different conclusions under FL Section 5\u2014323(d) regarding different children of the same parent. Indeed, as the facts of this case demonstrate, a parent may, for example, have regular and frequent contact with one child, but not the other, and have varying degrees of success in completion of different service agreements with respect to each child. Also, depending on the age at which the children of one parent were placed in foster care, the length of time they spent in foster care, and the frequency of contact with the natural parent, one child may have maintained or formed an attachment to the natural parent, while the other child has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The Circuit Court\u2019s approach fails to treat the child\u2019s best interest as the transcendent standard, perhaps because of the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language from <em>Ross </em>and <em>McDermott. </em>The observations and findings by the juvenile court convince us that the court did not just give <em>Rashawn </em>a \u201ccolorful description,\u201d as the Court of Special Appeals found, but that it applied the wrong standard.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">As we instructed in <em>Rashawn, </em>the factors under FL Section 5\u2014323(d) serve both as the basis for a court\u2019s finding (1) whether there are exceptional circumstances that would make a continued parental relationship detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest, and (2) whether termination of parental rights is in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 937 A.2d at 190. Since one cannot make a determination of whether there are exceptional circumstances that would overcome the presumption of parental rights and make continuation of parental rights detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest without looking into the child\u2019s best interest, the ultimate focus of the juvenile court\u2019s inquiry must be on the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Because the juvenile court applied an incorrect standard in deciding whether to terminate Ms. L\u2019s parental rights, we vacate its judgment and remand this case for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

Nor will homelessness, alone, or physical, mental, or emotional disability, alone, justify such termination. That is not what the statute permits, however. What the statute appropriately looks to is whether the parent is, or within a reasonable time will be, able to care for the child in a way that does not endanger the child\u2019s welfare.

I write separately principally from trepidation for what the Majority opinion does not state clearly enough for me as to the thrust and sweep of its reasoning when it addresses disapprovingly language in <em>McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 354, 869 A.2d 751, 770 (2005), and <em>Ross v.

Just as the Majority opinion professes, I too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>have great respect for Judge Wilner\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Rashawn H. </em>(which opinion I joined) because it offered a comprehensive and harmonized expression of how to balance the important common law and statutory factors that figure in the proper resolution of a CINA/TPR child custody dispute between parents and the State.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the Majority opinion in <em>Ta\u2019Niya C. </em>also is a well-expressed and well-structured body of legal reasoning for the most part, it contributes little additional insight, in my view, into the relevant area of Maryland family law than did <em>Rashawn H., </em>with the exception of its apparent disapproval of the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d language in <em>Rashawn H., </em>which it traces back to <em>McDermott </em>and <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In its ambition to restore the status quo before <em>Ross </em>and <em>McDermott </em>were decided, the Majority opinion muddles the meaning of <em>Rashawn H. </em>and the proper role of the legal presumption of parental fitness to raise a child. While recognizing that <em>Rashawn H. </em>opined that the best interests of the child \u201cinfuses each element of a court\u2019s analysis in TPR cases,\u201d the Majority opinion here perceives that \u201cother language crept into the opinion and apparently caused confusion.\u201d Majority op. at 104, 8 A.3d at 753. The creepy language in <em>Rashawn H. </em>that alarms the Majority is <em>Rashawn H.\u2019s </em>reiteration of <em>McDermott\u2019s </em>principle that \u201cif no parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances exist, \u2018there is no need to inquire further as to where the best interest of the child lies.\u2019 \u201d Majority op. at 105, 8 A.3d at 753, citing <em>Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 495, 937 A.2d at 177.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The full context of that language from <em>Rashawn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>H. </em>is supplied by the Majority in its footnote 13, Majority op. at 105, 8 A.3d at 753-54 (quoting <em>Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 494-95, 937 A.2d at 177-78 (emphasis in <em>Rashawn H.)):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">The great majority of custody (and visitation) disputes, of course, are between the child\u2019s parents, neither of whom, at least since the adoption of our State Equal Rights Amendment (Md.

The Majority opinion surmises that the confusion fostered by the above language is that it \u201ccould be interpreted to mean that parental unfitness, exceptional circumstances and the child\u2019s best interests are different and separate analyses, and even that the child\u2019s best interest inquiry does not come into play until there is a finding of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances.\u201d Majority op. at 105-06, 8 A.3d at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">This surmise sets up a \u201cstraw man\u201d for the Majority opinion to knock-over by offering a revisionist view of what <em>Rashawn H. </em>said and meant. In footnote 19, Majority op. at 111, 8 A.3d at 757-58, the Majority appears to channel for the <em>Rashawn H. </em>Court (but without any pinpoint citation to where in <em>Rashawn H. </em>the supposed support may be found for the views expressed). The Majority\u2019s theory is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANa\"><em>Rashawn </em>also shed light on how we may interpret the \u201cno further inquiry\u201d phrase. That phrase should not be read to mean that a court may not focus exclusively or even primarily, on the parent, or her interests or perspectives, in determining \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and then, finding none, fail to treat the child\u2019s best interests as transcendent. Rather, it just means that in deciding the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child, the court should always keep in mind the presumption that a child is better off with his parent.

The parental presumption serves, among other things, as a procedural and evidentiary ordering device to establish how child custody, guardianship, and visitation disputes should unfold in our courthouses. It orders who has shifting burdens of production and proof by establishing a pre-existing rebuttable presumption (infused with the notion that it is in the best interest of the child to be raised by the parent) that must be overcome (rebutted) in the court\u2019s mind by a challenger with sufficient and persuasive evidence of parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances. Because the presumption exists, even before suit is initiated, a failure of proof to overcome the presumption leads, as <em>Ross, McDermott, </em>and <em>Rashawn H. </em>explain, to no need to inquire further. If the apparent disagreement between my view and that of the Majority is seen as merely a semantical brouhaha, it is one created by the Majority opinion\u2019s unnecessary revisiting and interpretation of <em>Rashawn H.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">While I believe I understand what the Majority opinion aspires to do, I remain concerned where its reasoning leads beyond what the opinion appears willing to admit. What of <em>Koshko ? Koshko, </em>a visitation dispute between custodial parents on one side and maternal grandparents on the other, under the Maryland grandparental visitation statute (Md. Code, Family Law Article \u00a7 9-102), employs a similar standard/element to that found in <em>Ross, McDermott, </em>and apparently <em>Rashawn H., </em>which the Majority opinion proposes, at the very least, to write-out of our child custody jurisprudence. The Court in <em>Koshko </em>held \u201cthat there must be a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>either parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances demonstrating the current or future detriment to the child, absent visitation from his or her grandparents, as a prerequisite to application of the best interest analysis.\u201d 398 Md. at 444-45, 921 A.2d at 195. In accomplishing this, we overruled inconsistent language in five prior Maryland appellate opinions. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The need to rely on a \u201cprerequisite\u201d determination was necessary in order to give a judicial gloss to the statute, under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, so that the statute could be sustained in the face of a substantive due process challenge. It was argued that the statute failed \u201cto recognize a rebuttable presumption accorded the propriety of a parent\u2019s determination of what is in his or her child\u2019s best interest with respect to visitation with a grandparent.\u201d 398 Md. at 407, 921 A.2d at 173. Unwilling as I am to unravel Koshko<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and brand the grandparental visitation statute with the sobriquet of unconstitutionality, I turn next to the task of distinguishing <em>Koshko </em>from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><em>Koshko </em>is distinguishable on the basis that it involved child visitation, while <em>Ta\u2019Niya C. </em>involves custody.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although <em>Koshko </em>treated custody and visitation as equivalent for purposes of determining the level of judicial scrutiny to be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the statute, in the face of a substantive due process challenge, it was observed there that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">[t]here is no dispute that the grant or modification of visitation involves a lesser <em>degree </em>of intrusion on the fundamental right to parent than the assignment of custody. We except from this notion, however, that, because of this conceptualization, visitation somehow ranks lower on the \u201cscale of values\u201d such that its determination does not require the application of stringent tests as is the case with custody. In other words, although there may be a difference in the degree of intrusion, it is not a difference of constitutional magnitude. Visitation, like custody, intrudes upon the fundamental right of parents to direct the \u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d of their children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 430, 921 A.2d at 186 (footnote and internal citation omitted; emphasis in original). Thus, <em>Koshko\u2019s </em>reasoning followed its tact because <em>Koshko </em>engaged necessarily in constitutional analysis of a statute. <em>Ta\u2019Niya C. </em>does not. Thus, the differences between custody and visitation in a non-constitutional analysis (like <em>Ta\u2019Niya C.) </em>is a significant basis upon which to distinguish <em>Koshko </em>from <em>Ta\u2019Niya C. </em>Then again, perhaps I do not need to engage in mental gymnastics to distinguish <em>Koshko, </em>nor the Majority to erase portions of <em>Ross, McDermott, </em>or <em>Rashawn H. </em>The trial court\u2019s express belief in the present case, that <em>Rashawn, H. </em>\u201cchanged the law,\u201d was simply wrong. In this mistaken belief, the trial court applied an incorrect standard, but for a reason different than that settled upon by the Majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">It seems to me that <em>Ross, McDermott, Koshko, Rashawn H., </em>and <em>Ta\u2019Niya C. </em>(as do all of our child access cases frankly) strive to describe a proper tension among the factors that may be relevant in resolving virtually all child access disputes. These cases remind our judges to give due weight to the rebuttable presumption that a child\u2019s best interests are served by not sundering or interfering with the parental role, unless a judge is persuaded that that presumption is overcome by a quantum of persuasive evidence demonstrating that the parents) is/are unfit or that exceptional circumstances exist that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>render parental control and affiliation no longer in the best interests of the child(ren). The best interests of the child standard infuses each consideration,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, to that extent, may be described fairly as a transcendent element; but, to lump all of the statutory and/or common law factors into some sort of general melee or mishmash analysis, without due regard for the parental \u201cright,\u201d present at the threshold in every child access case (save those between dueling parents), denigrates that \u201cright\u201d and might distract judges into failing to accord it the weight it deserves in the calculus. Directing the flow of the judicial inquiry, by recognizing the existence of the parental right and pointing out that it must be overcome in the first instance, is not new to Maryland law. <em>Rashawn H. </em>said this well. I am unpersuaded that <em>Rashawn H. </em>merits disapproval or even clarification now.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Judge MURPHY authorizes me to state that he joins the views expressed in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-5\">.

If anything in <em>McDermott </em>deserves revisiting, perhaps it is the declaration that \" 'the constitutional right [of the parent) is the ultimate determinative factor.' \u201d Maj. op. at 108, 8 A.3d at 756 (quoting <em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 418, 869 A.2d at 808). That may go too far, especially when taken out of context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. I note in passing that the Majority opinion in <em>Ta\u2019Niya C. </em>presumably concedes (because it neither mentions nor attempts to deconstruct the analysis in <em>McDermott) </em>that its restoration of the <em>pre-Ross, pro-McDermott </em>state of our child custody jurisprudence removes Maryland from the considerable majority of our sister states on this score. <em>See McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 375, 869 A.2d at 783 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">. Likewise, at least three subsequent reported opinions of the Court of Special Appeals, applying <em>Koshko </em>(without demurrer), are implicated. <em>See Aumiller v.
