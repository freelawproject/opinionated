We are asked to decide whether the Maryland Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cMTCPA\u201d), Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 14-3201 to 14-3202 of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), is a statutory specialty as contemplated by Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. If an action is such a specialty, \u00a7 5-102 provides that an action on it \u201cshall be filed within 12 years after the cause of action accrues.... \u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that the MTCPA is not a statutory specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We adopt the following facts set forth by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">Seven Plaintiffs, both individuals and corporations, have filed this action alleging violation of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Maryland Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Plaintiffs allege they received hundreds of unsolicited facsimile advertisements transmitted to their fax machines by the lone remaining Defendant, Protus IP Solutions, Inc. The advertisements promoted travel packages, health care discounts, toner, office equipment, life insurance, mortgages and other products and services. None of the Plaintiffs had a business relationship with Protus or the vendors whose advertisements appeared in the faxes, or had given prior consent to receive the \u201cjunk faxes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Plaintiffs allege Protus sent 882 unsolicited faxes to Plaintiffs since the effective date of the Maryland TCPA, some of which were sent over three years before the pending law suit was filed on December 17, 2008. The general statute of limitations in Maryland is three years under Courts and Judicial Proceedings (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 5-101, which is the default period that applies unless another limitations period is applicable. Section \u00a7 5-102 of the CJP creates a twelve year statute of limitations for a cause of action brought under a \u201cspecialty\u201d statute____Plaintiffs contend that the Maryland TCPA is a specialty statute, and therefore that the appropriate limitations period in this case should be twelve years. Defendants maintain that the Maryland TCPA is not a specialty and is therefore subject to the general three year limitations period, such that any faxes Protus sent over three years prior to Plaintiffs filing this cause of action are not properly at issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAX\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The District Court determined that the limitations issue generated by the above facts involves a question of unresolved Maryland law and, thus, should be decided by this Court. The District Court therefore was prompted to certify the following question to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">Is the Maryland Telephone Consumer Protection Act a statutory \u201cspecialty\u201d law with a statute of limitations of twelve years pursuant to Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 5-102(a)(6)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">\n<em>The MTCPA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">The MTCPA is entitled \u201cViolations of certain federal laws and regulations prohibited\u201d and declares in pertinent part: \u201cA person may not violate ... [t]he Telephone Consumer Protection Act....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The history of the MTCPA reflects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>that it was enacted \u201cmerely to enable a private right of action under the TCPA....\u201d <em>Worsham v. Ehrlich, </em>181 Md.App. 711, 730, 957 A.2d 161, 172 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The federal TCPA, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227, and by implication, the MTCPA, seek to discourage and prevent unsolicited advertisements over the telephone lines. <em>See, e.g., Portuguese American Leadership Council of the United States, Inc. v. Investors\u2019Alert, Inc., </em>956 A.2d 671, 674 (D.C.2008) (explaining that the federal TCPA targets the \u201cincreased use of automated telephone equipment to make telephone calls in bulk and fax unsolicited advertisements that cross state lines and fall outside the regulatory jurisdiction of individual states\u201d). The unsolicited sending of faxes is among the conduct prohibited by the federal TCPA. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C), (b)(3) (2005) (making it unlawful, with limited exceptions, \u201cto use any telephone facsimile machine ... to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The MTCPA, unlike certain other Maryland statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not declare a period within which an action brought under it must be filed. The limitations period for actions brought under the MTCPA, therefore, are governed by the relevant statute of limitations of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). The parties in the case before the District Court, as we have noted, dispute the applicability to the MTCPA of the twelve-year limitations period for \u201cspecialties,\u201d set forth in CJP \u00a7 5-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>In Maryland, the default rule, for limitations purposes <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is that a \u201ccivil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-101. This limitations period reflects \u201ca legislative judgment of what is deemed an adequate period of time in which a person of ordinary diligence should bring his action.\u201d <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc., v. Christensen, </em>394 Md. 227, 240, 905 A.2d 340, 348 (2006) (quotation marks and citations omitted). The General Assembly, however, has legislated numerous exceptions to the three-year limitations period. <em>See, e.g., </em>CJP \u00a7\u00a7 5-103 (adverse possession); 5-104 (public officer\u2019s bond); 5-105 (assault, libel, or slander). The exception at issue here, set forth in CJP \u00a7 5-102, entitled \u201cSpecialties,\u201d provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">(a) <em>Twelve-year </em>limitation.\u2014An action on one of the following specialties shall be filed within 12 years after the cause of action accrues, or within 12 years from the date of the death of the last to die of the principal debtor or creditor, whichever is sooner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">(1) Promissory note or other instrument under seal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">(2) Bond except a public officer\u2019s bond;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">(3) Judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">(4) Recognizance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">(5) Contract under seal; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">(6) Any other specialty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">An action brought under the MTCPA is not included in CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(l) through (5), leaving for us to decide only whether such action comes within the meaning of CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), \u201c[a]ny other specialty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Absent from the CJP \u00a7 5-102 is a definition of \u201c[a]ny other specialty.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To resolve whether an action under the MTCPA is a specialty, however, we do not write on a clean slate. Two recent decisions, <em>Greene Tree Home Owners Ass\u2019n v. Greene Tree Assocs., </em>358 Md. 453, 749 A.2d 806 (2000), and <em>Master Fin., Inc., v. Crowder, </em>409 Md. 51, 972 A.2d 864 (2009), provide the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In <em>Greene Tree, </em>we considered whether claims brought under Maryland\u2019s Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCPA\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are based on a statutory specialty. The Petitioners in <em>Greene Tree, </em>who sought damages for alleged violations of the CPA that arose from the Respondents\u2019 defective roof construction, challenged on appeal the ruling of the Circuit Court that the claims brought under the CPA do not constitute a specialty within the purview of CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6). We observed that \u201cattempts to identify a statutory specialty by defining the nexus between a claim and the statute at issue have led to complexities and, arguably, conflicting results.\u201d <em>Greene Tree, 358 </em>Md. at 481-82, 749 A.2d at 821.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We refrained from announcing in that case a specific definition of \u201c[a]ny other specialty.\u201d We satisfied ourselves with the explanation that statutory specialties \u201cusually have involved an action of debt for a fixed or determinable sum.\u201d <em>Id., </em>749 A.2d at 821. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>noted, too, that \u201cthe form of action of debt strongly indicates that a claim for unliquidated damages is not one based on a statutory specialty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476, 749 A.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We found significant that CL \u00a7 13-408 of the CPA<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> authorizes litigants to \u201crecover for injury or losses sustained ... as a result of\u2019 violations of the CPA. We noted that such claims are \u201cconsistent with the types of claims embraced by CJP \u00a7 5-101 [the three-year limitations period],\u201d for which \u201cthe fullness of time weighs heavily against the preservation of the evidence that frequently depends upon imperfect memory or informal writings----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, 749 A.2d at 820 (quoting <em>Roland Electrical Co. v. Black, </em>163 F.2d 417, 424 (4th Cir.1947)). That is to say, claims brought under the CPA include the type of damages sought by the plaintiff in <em>Greene Tree, </em>which \u201cinvolve[d] the cost of cure, diminution in value, and loss of rental income[,]\u201d none of which costs is a liquidated or fixed sum. <em>Greene Tree, </em>358 Md. at 477, 749 A.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">We pointed out that, \u201c[w]ere we to hold ... that an action based upon the CPA is one based on a statutory specialty, the holding would apply to any action that might be brought under the CPA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, 749 A.2d at 820. We declined Petitioner\u2019s invitation to find certain CPA claims to be specialties while others not, because doing so would be \u201cinconsistent with the purpose of the distinction between the three year and the twelve year statutes of limitations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>749 A.2d at 820. We recognized, therefore, that it would be bad \u201cpublic policy\u201d to hold that the CPA is a statutory specialty. <em>See id., </em>749 A.2d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">We concluded that it was unnecessary to \u201cattempt to state an all-encompassing definition of a statutory specialty. <em>In the case before us </em>it is sufficient to hold that a statutory specialty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>does not lie for unliquidated damages, and we so hold.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 482, 749 A.2d at 821 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Nine years later we again addressed statutory specialties, in <em>Crowder. </em>In that case, we determined, among other issues,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> whether claims based on the State Secondary Mortgage Loan Law (\u201cSMLL\u201d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> constitute a specialty, under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6). We looked to the analysis employed in <em>Greene Tree, </em>emphasizing the \u201cundisputed proposition ] that, although claims based on a statute <em>may </em>fall within the meaning of \u2018other specialty\u2019 under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6), not all claims based in some way on rights, duties, obligations, prohibitions or remedies mentioned or provided for in a statute <em>do </em>fall within that category.\u201d <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 66, 972 A.2d at 873. We offered a \u201cworkable general principle\u201d for determining when a statutory action constitutes an \u201c[a]ny other specialty.\u201d That framework has the following criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">(1) the duty, obligation, prohibition, or right sought to be enforced is created or imposed solely by the statute, or a related statute, and does not otherwise exist as a matter of common law; (2) the remedy pursued in the action is authorized solely by the statute, or a related statute, and does not otherwise exist under the common law; and (3) if the action is one for civil damages or recompense in the nature of civil damages, those damages are liquidated, fixed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>or, by applying clear statutory criteria, are readily ascertainable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 70, 972 A.2d at 875. When all three criteria are met, the statutory action constitutes a specialty under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Applying that framework to the SMLL, we focused in part on the remedies available under the SMLL. We noted that \u00a7 12-413 of the SMLL,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which provides for civil penalties for violations of its provisions, authorizes the forfeiture of interest and unlawfully assessed fees. <em>Crowder </em>at 72, 972 A.2d at 876. We concluded not only that the rights, duties, obligations, and remedy were solely the product of the SMLL, but also that the damages were for a fixed, determinable amount. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 972 A.2d at 876. Therefore, SMLL-based claims fall within the \u201cnarrow-catchall\u201d that is the \u201c[a]ny other specialty\u201d provision. <em>See id. </em>at 70, 972 A.2d at 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\"><em>Greene Tree </em>and <em>Crowder </em>establish the guideposts for deciding whether an action under the MTCPA is, or is not, a specialty within the meaning of \u00a7 5-102(a)(6). With these cases in mind we turn to the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">AGV argues that the MTCPA is a specialty within the purview of CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) because, according to AGV, the MTCPA satisfies all of the <em>Crowder </em>criteria. With regard to the first criterion, AGV argues that the MTCPA creates duties, obligations, prohibitions, or rights solely by the federal TCPA and the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, which did not exist at common law. AGV argues that the second <em>Crowder </em>criterion is met because certain of the remedies provided by the Act, $500 per unsolicited fax or actual dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, are authorized solely by statute. Further, according to AGY, the MTCPA satisfies the third criterion set forth in <em>Crowder </em>because the authorized civil damages are liquidated, fixed, or readily ascertainable by applying clear statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Protus responds with a number of reasons why the MTCPA is not a statutory specialty. First, in the view of Protus, the \u201cspecialty\u201d to which CJP \u00a7 5\u2014102(a)(6) refers is a \u201clegal instrument under seal\u201d or a \u201ccontract under seal,\u201d neither of which is present in claims brought under the MTCPA. Second, the introductory clause in CJP \u00a7 5-102 refers to a \u201cprincipal debtor or creditor\u201d and to the \u201cpayment of principal or interest,\u201d neither of which is involved in MTCPA claims. Third, the holdings in <em>Greene Tree </em>and <em>Crowder </em>reflect that the \u201c[a]ny other specialty\u201d provision of CJP \u00a7 5-102(a) is a narrow catchall that typically involves actions of debt for a fixed or readily determinable sum. Protus also contends that the MTCPA fails the \u201cspecialty\u201d criteria set forth in <em>Crowder </em>because the same rights protected through MTCPA suits are also vindicated under the common law actions of conversion and trespass to chattel; consequently, the MTCPA is not the exclusive source of a duty, obligation, prohibition, or right. Finally, the MTCPA authorizes actual damages and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, which are not liquidated nor readily ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We need not address all of the parties\u2019 arguments for and against recognizing the MTCPA as an \u201cother specialty,\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5\u2014102(a)(6). Examination of the remedies available under the MTCPA, even without further consideration of the statute, discloses why it is not a specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The remedies subsection of \u00a7 14-3202 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">Remedies.\u2014In addition to the remedies provided in \u00a7 13-408 of this article [i.e., Maryland\u2019s Consumer Protection Act], an individual who is affected by a violation of this subtitle may bring an action against a person that violates this subtitle to recover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">(1) Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>(2) Damages in the amount of the greater of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">(i) $500 for each violation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">(ii) Actual damages sustained as a result of the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">CL \u00a7 14-3202(b) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The statute provides expressly that, in addition to the remedies available under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, a party affected by a violation of the MTCPA is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and, as is also provided by the federal TCPA, the greater amount of actual damages or $500 per violation. In other words, the available remedies under the MTCPA include not only non-liquidated damages available under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, which remedies, we held in <em>Greene Tree, </em>drove our holding that a claim brought under Maryland\u2019s CPA is not an \u201c[a]ny other specialty,\u201d but also actual damages in lieu of the $500 statutory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Actual damages, by definition, are not liquidated or for a fixed sum.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, actual damages require proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>actual loss, the amount of which is determined by the fact-finder. Liquidated damages involve a fixed sum that is determined at the time of contract formation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the context of MTCPA claims, actual damages could involve, for example, the costs of the paper and ink used in processing the unsolicited faxes, diminution in the value of the facsimile machine associated with the receipt of those unsolicited faxes, and the lost employee productivity associated with the receipt, review, and disposal of the unwanted faxes, none of which is a fixed or liquidated sum. <em>Cf. Greene Tree, 358 </em>Md. at 476, 749 A.2d at 818 (discussing the unliquidated damages involved in CPA claims). The MTCPA is akin to the CPA, which we have held not to be an \u201cother specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5\u2014102(a)(6), because, at least insofar as a claim for actual damages is concerned, the damages involved are not fixed or readily ascertainable. The availability of actual damages distinguishes the MTCPA from the SMLL, which is a specialty under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) because, inter alia, \u201cascertainment of [the damages] is readily ascertainable.\u201d <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 72, 972 A.2d at 876. We therefore conclude that, consistent with <em>Greene Tree </em>and the framework articulated in <em>Crowder, </em>claims brought under the MTCPA do not fall within the \u201crelatively narrow catchall\u201d that is \u00a7 5-102(a)(6)\u2019s \u201c[a]ny other specialty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In addition, as Protus explained in its brief, the common law actions of trespass to chattel and conversion are oftentimes pursued in conjunction with TCPA-based claims. <em>See Chair King v. Houston Cellular Corp., </em>131 F.3d 507, 509 (involving plaintiffs federal TCPA and trespass to chattel claims); <em>j2 Global Communs. v. Blue Jay, Inc., </em>No. C 08-4254 PJH, 2009 WL 29905 (N.D.Cal. filed Jan. 5, 2009) (same); <em>Clean Air Council v. Dragon Int\u2019l Group, </em>No. l:CV-06-0430, 2008 WL 4452353 (M.D.Pa. filed Sept. 30, 2008) (involving plaintiffs federal TPCA, trespass to chattel, and conversion claims). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Though we base our decision in this case on the non-liquidated damages authorized by the MTCPA, the facts that the same remedies available under the MTCPA (option of actual damages) and conduct prohibited by the MTCPA are addressed by the common law actions of trespass to chattel and conversion\u2014in light of the <em>Crowder </em>criteria\u2014further supports our conclusion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">AGV, seeking to avoid the conclusion to which we have come, contended during oral argument before us that, because virtually all claims brought under the MTCPA plead the statutory damages of $500, those claims should be afforded \u201c[a]ny other specialty\u201d treatment. AGV, however, did not provide any authority in support of that proposition, and we could find none. The only authority\u2014albeit dicta\u2014relevant to this proposition that we could locate is contrary to AGV\u2019s position. In <em>Greene Tree, </em>we rejected the argument that, based on public policy grounds, certain CPA-based actions should be afforded statutory specialty treatment while others not, explaining that \u201c[w]ere we to hold, however, that an action based upon the CPA is one based on a statutory specialty, the holding would apply to any action that might be brought under the CPA.\u201d 358 Md. at 480, 749 A.2d at 820. We appear to have suggested in <em>Greene Tree </em>that the answer to the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>whether a statute is an \u201c[a]ny other specialty\u201d under CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) cannot be based on whether some, or even most of the time, the claims brought seek a remedy that is fixed or readily ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In sum, we hold that a claim brought under the MTCPA is not a specialty within the meaning of CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(6) \u201c[a]ny other statutory specialty.\u201d We therefore answer \u201cno\u201d to the question certified to us by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">CERTIFIED QUESTION OF LAW ANSWERED AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

Statutes of limitations of course are designed to encourage timely dispositions to avoid the loss of evidence and distortion of memories that make accurate results less likely. <em>See, e.g., Bertonazzi v.

CJP \u00a7 5-102\u2019s legislative history provides little insight into the meaning of the phrase. The Revisor\u2019s Note to CJP \u00a7 5-102 indicates that \u201d[a]ny other specialty\u201d includes statutes merchant and statutes of staple, two types of specialties that were listed specifically in the former CJP \u00a7 5-102, Art. 57, \u00a7 3. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974), Revisor\u2019s Note following CJP \u00a7 5-102.

Petitioners in <em>Crowder </em>also brought claims under the CPA.

This conclusion to which we have come also comports with the distinct rationales that undergird the three-year and twelve-year limitations periods. <em>See Greene Tree, </em>358 Md. at 480, 749 A.2d at 820 (explaining that actions such as trespass, trover, contract, and slander, which frequently depend on \"imperfect memory or informal writings, are found in the three-year category, while actions on formal instruments or records ... are subject to the twelve year period\u201d). Claims brought under the MTCPA, like the one brought in the present case, involve not only evidence of the alleged unsolicited facsimiles and evidence that those facsimiles originated from the defendant\u2019s network, but also evidence necessary to plead defenses of an \"established business relationship,\u201d and/or consent to receive the solicitation. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(l)(C)(i). We mention this not because \"[rjelative ease of proof ... is [] a requisite element[]\u201d for a statutory specialty. <em>Crowder, </em>409 Md. at 71, 972 A.2d at 876. We do so only for the purpose of observing that ease of proof, an element common to the specifically identified specialties, <em>see </em>CJP \u00a7 5-102(a)(l) through (a)(5), does not characterize MTCPA-based claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
