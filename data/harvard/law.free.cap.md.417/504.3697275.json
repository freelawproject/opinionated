Fox. The petition addresses Respondent\u2019s representation in two cases: an automobile accident case in which he represented Ronnie E. Miller and David A. Pearson; and an automobile accident case in which he represented Abdul M. Barrie.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Pursuant to Md. Rule 16-752, we designated the Honorable Marielsa Bernard of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to hear the matter and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Md. Rule 16-757. Judge Bernard conducted a hearing on September 16, 2009, and issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law on November 2, 2009. The written report concluded that Respondent violated Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1.2(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1.3,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1.4(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>1.16(d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 8.1(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 8.4(a), (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>and (d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">On February 8, 2010, we remanded the matter for supplemental findings of fact as to mitigation. Judge Bernard held a hearing on May 5, 2010, regarding mitigation, and issued written supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law on May 16, 2010, finding Respondent did not prove any mitigation by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In light of Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusions, Petitioner recommends that Respondent be disbarred. Respondent noted timely exceptions to Judge Bernard\u2019s initial findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to her supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent challenges Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusions that he violated certain rules, asserts that mitigation was sufficiently established, and urges that the proper sanction be a reprimand, or, at worst, a short-term suspension. We overrule each of Respondent\u2019s exceptions, agree with the conclusions of Judge Bernard, and hold that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Judge Bernard made the following factual findings, based on clear and convincing evidence, and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A88\">L REPRESENTATION OF RONNIE E. MILLER AND DAVID A. PEARSON</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">1. Findings of Fact</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">On or about September 8, 2002, Ronnie E. Miller [hereinafter \u201cMiller\u201d], and David A. Pearson [hereinafter \u201cPearson\u201d] retained Respondent. Miller and Pearson had been involved in an automobile accident, in which Miller was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Pearson, which was struck from behind by an automobile driven by Timiko Reed [hereinafter \u201cReed\u201d].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">On March 4, 2004, Respondent filed a complaint on behalf of Miller and Pearson against Reed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. On March 5, 2004, a Writ of Summons was issued listing Reed\u2019s address as 1433 T Street NE, Apartment #201, Washington, D.C. 20009. However, a State of Maryland Motor Vehicle Accident Report listed Reed\u2019s address as 4005 Flowerfield Road, Apartment B, Norfolk, Virginia 23518. Respondent testified at trial that he never requested or possessed a copy of the accident report. On October 18, 2004, Respondent was sent a Notification of Contemplated Dismissal for lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>service, pursuant to Md. R. Civ. P. 2-507. On December 30, 2004, an Order of Dismissal was entered as to Reed. At no point did Respondent file a motion showing cause to defer the entry of the Order of Dismissal. Respondent testified that he never received the order of the court dismissing the case. For this reason, Respondent believes that the dismissal was faulty, and that the case is capable of being revived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">On February 24, 2006, approximately fourteen (14) months after Miller and Pearson\u2019s case was dismissed, Respondent requested a reissue of the summons for Reed. Although the case had been dismissed, the summons was reissued on March 2, 2006. Ten (10) months later, on December 21, 2006, Respondent again requested and was reissued a summons for Reed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Pearson testified at trial that he received a copy of the Complaint in 2004 or 2005. At that time, he noticed two factual mistakes. First, Respondent had confused Miller and Pearson in the Complaint, listing Miller as the driver and Pearson as the passenger. Second, Respondent had put a District of Columbia address for Reed, and not the Norfolk, Virginia address that was listed in the accident report. Pearson testified that he had independently received a copy of the accident report. Both Pearson and Miller advised Respondent of these factual mistakes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">On January 5, 2007, Miller and Pearson received letters from Respondent enclosing a document entitled \u201cPlaintiffs First Amended Complaint.\u201d However, no such document was ever filed with the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Additionally, \u201cPlaintiffs First Amended Complaint\u201d again contained the same District of Columbia address for Reed. Pearson noticed that this new document was not \u201cstamped\u201d like the original complaint. Pearson made numerous calls to Respondent\u2019s office in an attempt to notify Respondent about his concerns with \u201cPlaintiffs First Amended Complaint.\u201d However, these calls were never returned by the Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>In late 2007, Pearson, who had by this time retained new counsel, learned that his case had been dismissed. Pearson testified that his new counsel attempted to contact Respondent to inquire about the status of the case, but Respondent\u2019s only reply was that he had been trying to locate Reed. Miller testified at his deposition that at various times during the representation, Respondent had told him, \u201che [Respondent] was waiting on the Judge to give him a court date,\u201d \u201cthere was a lot of cases and [Miller] had to wait his turn,\u201d and that \u201cthese things take time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">In early 2008, Miller learned that the case had been dismissed after he hired a new attorney to look into the matter. Respondent became evasive once Miller learned that the case had been dismissed. Miller testified that he believed that Respondent did not want to talk to him, and had his secretary \u201crunning interference.\u201d On January 30, 2008, Miller wrote to Respondent expressing his frustration with Respondent\u2019s failure to return his calls. Miller had to have someone else call Respondent\u2019s office pretending to search for legal representation, for Respondent to finally speak with Miller. During this conversation Respondent told Miller, \u201cWe\u2019ve already been to court.\u201d When Miller asked Respondent for more details, Respondent told Miller that his voice was sore from being in court all day and that he could not speak with him anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">On February 21, 2009, Miller requested by letter that Respondent attempt to have the dismissal set aside. On April 17, 2009, Respondent wrote to Miller advising him that he could take no action to reverse the dismissal because Miller had hired a new lawyer. Respondent testified that although he believed the dismissal was improper, he was not sure he had the authority to pursue the matter once he learned of the dismissal, because new counsel had been retained by Pearson and Miller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">2. Conclusions of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">The evidence in this case clearly and convincingly demonstrated that Respondent did nothing to pursue the case of his clients, Miller and Pearson, after he filed a complaint on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>their behalf in March 2004. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Ficker, </em>349 Md. 13, 41-42, 706 A.2d. [sic] 1045, 1058-59 (Md.1998), the Court of Appeals stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">If a pleading, paper, or notice of some kind is due to be filed or sent by another party or the court and that filing or transmission -will engender some duty on the attorney\u2019s part, the attorney cannot sit blithely by in blissful ignorance, as though the case doesn\u2019t exist.... [T]he lawyer does have a duty to his or her client to remain diligent, and that duty is not discharged by placing the file in indefinite hibernation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">Here, it is clear that Respondent failed to diligently carry out the case that he had initiated for his clients. Additionally, Respondent failed to keep himself reasonably informed about the status of the case, allowing it to languish and ultimately be dismissed under Md. R. Civ. P. 2-507. Respondent testified that was [sic] unaware of this dismissal until Miller and Pearson notified him that they had discovered that the case had been dismissed. During the life of this case, Respondent continually failed to keep his clients properly informed about the status of their case, while he himself was completely uninformed that the case had been dismissed. The possibilities of reviving the case, or recovering damages for Miller and Pearson, are now seemingly lost forever as a result of Respondent\u2019s lack of attention and care to this matter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFd\">i. Rule 1.1\u2014Competence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">Rule 1.1 of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct requires an attorney to exercise \u201cthoroughness in preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d Respondent demonstrated that he has ample experience with personal injury cases that are similar in nature to that of Miller and Pearson\u2019s. However, Respondent completely neglected Miller and Pearson\u2019s case after he filed a complaint on their behalf. Miller and Pearson\u2019s case was ultimately dismissed due to Respondent\u2019s lack of thoroughness and preparation. Therefore, this Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ii. Rule 1.2\u2014Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">Rule 1.2(a) requires that \u201ca lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.\u201d Respondent generally failed to abide by the decisions of his clients, Miller and Pearson, by faffing to pursue their matter after the Complaint was filed. Miller and Pearson continually requested status updates which Respondent apparently ignored. Respondent likely would have discovered the precarious status of the case had he abided by his clients\u2019 clear goal of recovering damages for their accident they were involved in. Instead, Respondent\u2019s ignorance of the case\u2019s status, combined with his refusal to provide Miller and Pearson with accurate information about their case, resulted in Respondent\u2019s violation of Rule 1.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">iii. Rule 1.3\u2014Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">This Court finds that Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in his representation of Miller and Pearson. Respondent failed to diligently pursue Miller and Pearson\u2019s case against Reed. After filing the complaint in March 2004, Respondent did nothing to monitor the status of the case, which was dismissed in December 2004. Respondent was hired to help Miller and Pearson recover damages for injuries suffered in an automobile accident. Such recovery was made impossible by Respondent\u2019s abandonment of both his clients and their case. Therefore, the Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">iv. Rule 1.4\u2014Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">Rule 1.4 states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">(a) A lawyer shall: (1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent [as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;] (2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; (3) promptly comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>reasonable requests for information; and (4) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to a client reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">This Court finds that Respondent failed to keep Miller and Pearson reasonably informed about the status of their case, and did not promptly comply with his clients\u2019 reasonable requests for information. Respondent could not have adequately informed his clients about the status of their case, as he himself was completely oblivious to the case\u2019s dismissal. Respondent\u2019s remark to Miller that, \u201che [Respondent] was waiting on the Judge to give him a court date,\u201d might have been sufficient if Respondent had actually made inquiries into when the next court date in the case would be. Instead, Miller and Pearson\u2019s reasonable requests for information fell seemingly on deaf ears, as Respondent did nothing but reply with generic answers that had no basis in any actual investigation on the part of Respondent. Additionally, Respondent led Miller and Pearson to believe that he was filing an Amended Complaint by sending them copies of that document. However, no such document was ever filed with the court. Once it was discovered that the ease was dismissed, Respondent completely shut out his clients, failing to return the calls of Miller and Pearson. Miller was only able to briefly speak with Respondent, and only after Miller had someone else call Respondent\u2019s office pretending to be a potential new client. Once Miller was able to get Respondent on the phone, Respondent told Miller that the case had already been to court, and that he could not speak with him anymore because his throat was sore. This Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.4 due to his failure to keep his clients reasonably informed, and his misrepresentations about the status of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>v. Rule 1.16\u2014Declining or Terminating Representation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">While there was no showing that Respondent intentionally terminated his representation of Miller and Pearson, he effectively did so by abandoning them and their case. Rule I. 16(d) requires that, \u201cUpon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests.\u201d Respondent did not adequately protect Miller and Pearson\u2019s interests, as he abandoned their case, allowing it to languish for years, while he informed Miller and Pearson that they \u201chad to wait their turn.\u201d Miller and Pearson might have retained alternative counsel early enough to save their case if they had known that Respondent was going to take no action after filling [sic] the Complaint. However, Respondent\u2019s actions, or lack thereof, appear to have ended Miller and Pearson\u2019s ability to recover damages for their injuries. Therefore, this Court finds that Respondent violated Rule 1.16 by effectively terminating the representation of Miller and Pearson without adequately notifying them or protecting their interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">vi. Rule 8.4\u2014Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">Rule 8.4 states that it is \u201cprofessional misconduct for a lawyer to: (a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct----(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d This Court finds that Respondent violated Rule 8.4 by failing to diligently and competently oversee the case of Miller and Pearson, and by keeping his clients misinformed to the extent he deprived them of the ability to pursue damages. Additionally, Respondent engaged in misrepresentation when he told Miller, \u201cWe\u2019ve already been to court.\u201d In fact, Respondent had never been to court for Miller and Pearson\u2019s case. Instead, he initiated an action and then simply let it languish, while giving his clients the impression that it was in fact progressing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">II. REPRESENTATION OF ABDUL M. BARRIE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">1. Findings of Fact</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>On May 14, 2001, Abdul M. Barrie [hereinafter \u201cBarrie] [sic], was involved in an automobile accident. The vehicle that struck Barrie was uninsured. On May 16, 2001, Barrie retained Respondent. Respondent initially pursued an uninsured motorist claim against Barrie\u2019s insurance carrier, GEICO, by filing for Medical Payments coverage benefits [PIP] and seeking a settlement on behalf of Barrie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">In January 2002, GEICO sent five (5) PIP checks to Respondent\u2019s office, for the amounts of $147.15, $147.15, $115.00, $460.00, and $1,6370.00 [sic]. On February 5, 2002, GEICO advised Respondent that Barrie had exhausted his PIP payments. On February 14, 2002, Respondent replied to GEICO asking to whom the payments were made. Thereafter, no other documents appear in Respondent\u2019s file concerning Barrie\u2019s PIP payments. The PIP checks mailed in January 2002 were never negotiated, and GEICO reissued these five (5) checks in August 2002, and then again in March 2003, October 2003, May 2004, December 2004, July 2005, February 2006, four checks were reissued in October 2006, and five checks were reissued in May 2007. On May 9, 2003, GEICO issued an uninsured motorist claim final settlement check to Respondent in the amount of $5,825.00. This check was also never negotiated. During a period of over six (6) years, a total of fifty (50) PIP and settlement checks were sent to respondent\u2019s office at 1325 18th Street N.W., Suite 103, Washington, D.C. 20036, none of which were ever negotiated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">At trial, Respondent testified about his system for tracking the status of cases; specifically PIP cases. Respondent testified that when a PIP case was awaiting payment from an insurance company, it was placed in a \u201chot box\u201d in Respondent\u2019s office, which Respondent frequently checked. However, by Respondent\u2019s own admission this system broke down, and the file was misplaced. Respondent was unable to explain what happened to the fifty (50) checks that had been sent to his office, but testified that he suspected that his mail was being stolen. However, at no point did Respondent get a P.O. Box or instruct GEICO to mail the checks elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Throughout the representation Barrie had great difficulty communicating with Respondent. Barrie testified that he went to Respondent\u2019s office many times, but was consistently told that Respondent was unavailable to meet with him. Barrie also testified that he called Respondent many times throughout the representation, and on the few occasions Barrie was able to speak with Respondent, he was told that he had to wait because cases such as his \u201ctake time.\u201d However, many of Barrie\u2019s calls to Respondent simply went unreturned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">Barrie was also never informed that his case had been settled, and never agreed to a final settlement amount. Respondent\u2019s case file contained a document entitled \u201cDouble Check for Settlement Sheet,\u201d which showed the total settlement amount of $5,825.00; the same amount of the check GEICO had mailed to Respondent. Respondent testified at trial that although he could not recall exactly when, he believed that at some point he had reached a settlement agreement with GEICO. However, Respondent never informed Barrie that his case had settled. Barrie remained unaware of the status of his case until May 2008, when he retained the services of new counsel, Andrew P. McGuire [hereinafter \u201cMcGuire\u201d] of Regan and Associates. Barrie hired new counsel after being sued by his medical provider, Medical Support Services, Incorporated, for non-payment of the medical bills incurred as a result of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">On May 22; 2008, McGuire attempted to contact Respondent about Barrie\u2019s case. However, McGuire\u2019s phone call to Respondent went unreturned. On June 26, 2008, McGuire wrote to Respondent, notifying him that he was now representing Barrie, and requesting a copy of Respondent\u2019s case file. McGuire never received a response from Respondent. McGuire wrote to the Respondent a second time on July 8, 2008, again requesting a copy of Barrie\u2019s file, to which he again received no response. In July 2002 [sic][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>], GEICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>reissued the five (5) PIP checks and the final settlement check to McGuire, who distributed the proceeds to Barrie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">On May 9, 2008, the Office of Bar Counsel requested that Respondent submit a written response to Barrie\u2019s complaint against him within ten (10) days. There was no response to this letter, and a second letter was sent to Respondent on May 23, 2008. The postal receipt shows that Respondent received this letter on May 27, 2009 [sic]. The May 23, 2008 letter requested that Respondent submit a reply to the Barrie complaint within seven (7) days. On June 11, 2008, fifteen (15) days after receiving the letter of May 23, 2008, Respondent wrote to the Office of Bar Counsel requesting a ten (10) day extension. The Office of Bar Counsel agreed to grant Respondent an extension, and requested a written response to Barrie\u2019s complaint along with a copy of the Barrie file before June 23, 2008. Respondent did not provide the Office of Bar Counsel with a response or with Barrie\u2019s file, but on June 27, 2008, sent a fax to the Office of Bar Counsel stating, \u201cthe carrier is (sua sponte) re-sending Barrie\u2019s check. Kindly permit me some time to respond as this matter is fluid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">On July 3, 2008, Bar Counsel Investigator William Ramsey [hereinafter \u201cRamsey\u201d] interviewed Respondent. Ramsey testified at trial that Respondent could not explain why he did not pursue collection of the PIP and settlement checks. At the interview, Respondent did not have the Barrie file available, as had been previously requested of him. Respondent told Ramsey that the Barrie file was in storage, and that it was too hot for Respondent to get the file, because there was no air conditioning at the storage location. At the conclusion of the interview, Respondent agreed to send the Barrie file to the Office of Bar counsel immediately, and on July 8, 2008, the Office of Bar Counsel wrote to Respondent requesting that the file be sent before July 18, 2008. On July 18, 2008, Respondent advised the Office of Bar Counsel that his office had flooded, and that he needed more time to send the Barrie file. Instead of being located in storage, as initially represented by Respondent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the file was found damaged by the flood in Respondent\u2019s office. On August 13, 2008, Respondent mailed a copy of the Barrie file to the Office of Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">2. Conclusions of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">The evidence in this case clearly and convincingly showed that Respondent abandoned Barrie and his case by failing to follow up on whether the PIP and settlement checks that Respondent had secured for Barrie had been sent. Respondent additionally failed to stay in adequate communication with Barrie. Respondent might have been able to discover that he was not receiving the PIP and settlement checks being issued by GEICO had he been aware of Barrie\u2019s concerns about the status of his case. Instead, Respondent allowed this case to sit stagnant for a period of over six (6) years. It was not until Barrie was ultimately sued, and retained new counsel, that he was able to recover the PIP and settlement checks. Even then, Barrie\u2019s new counsel was unable to get Barrie\u2019s case file from Respondent, or any information about Barrie\u2019s case, due to Respondent\u2019s neglect of his client\u2019s best interests. Respondent additionally failed to adequately consult with Barrie about the settlement that he had reached with GEICO. Finally, Respondent was uncooperative with the Office of Bar Counsel in its investigation into this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">i. Rule 1.1\u2014Competence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">Respondent demonstrated that he has ample experience with cases such as Barrie\u2019s. However, in Barrie\u2019s case, Respondent showed a complete lack of thoroughness and preparation, effectively abandoning the case for six (6) years. Respondent\u2019s methods for staying updated on Barrie\u2019s case clearly failed him and his client, showing an unacceptable degree of incompetence on the part of Respondent. Therefore, the Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">ii. Rule 1.2(a)\u2014Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Rule 1.2(a) requires attorneys to abide by the decision of their clients regarding settlement agreements. Respondent failed to consult with Barrie about the settlement agreement he reached with GEICO. Therefore, this Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">iii. Rule 1.3\u2014Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">Respondent did not act with reasonable diligence and promptness in his representation of Barrie. Respondent allowed Barrie\u2019s case to languish for over six (6) years, while GEICO sent fifty (50) checks to Respondent\u2019s office. While it is not clear from the evidence what happened to those checks, it is clear that Respondent maintained a system for monitoring his active cases that was insufficient, causing Respondent to forget about Barrie\u2019s case. Respondent might have realized that Barrie\u2019s file had been lost if he had remained in communication with his client. In addition, it is clear to the Court that from the different accounts given by Respondent as to the location of the Barrie file that his system for tracking files was grossly ineffective. It appears that at some point Respondent began ignoring Barrie. Therefore, this Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">iv. Rule 1.4\u2014Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">Respondent violated Rule 1.4 in a number of ways. Respondent did not promptly inform Barrie of decisions made in his case, when he failed to notify him about the settlement agreement with GEICO. Respondent did not inform Barrie that his consent was required for any settlement, and instead unilaterally settled with GEICO. Respondent also failed to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information from Barrie, or explain the case to Barrie in a way that would permit him to make informed decisions about the case. Respondent told Barrie that his case would \u201ctake time\u201d despite the fact that Respondent had settled the case, and the PIP and settlement checks for Barrie were already sent to Respondent. Barrie tried to get updates about his case for years, but it was not until he was sued, and subsequently retained new counsel, that he discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that his case had been settled, and that GEICO had been sending PIP and settlement checks to Respondent. Therefore, this Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">v. Rule 1.16\u2014Declining or Terminating Representation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">While there was no showing that Respondent intentionally terminated his representation of Barrie, he effectively did so by abandoning Barrie and his case. Respondent took no action in Barrie\u2019s case, even though he had settled the case without Barrie\u2019s consent, and in spite of Barrie\u2019s frequent inquiries about the status of the case. At no point did Respondent communicate to Barrie that he had ceased taking any action in his case. Respondent compounded his abandonment of the case by failing to protect Barrie\u2019s interests once Barrie obtained new counsel. Respondent failed to reply to calls or written requests for Barrie\u2019s case file by Barrie\u2019s new attorney McGuire. Respondent delayed the ultimate resolution of Barrie\u2019s case by denying McGuire and Barrie essential information about Barrie\u2019s case. Therefore, this Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 1.16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">vi. Rule 8.1\u2014Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">Rule 8.1(b) states that an attorney shall not \u201cknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority.\u201d Respondent repeatedly failed to timely respond to the Office of Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information. Although Respondent was granted an extension of time, he requested that extension after two (2) letters were sent to him by the Office of Bar Counsel, and after the original deadline for responding had lapsed. Moreover, Respondent did not produce the Barrie file when Ramsey interviewed him\u2014supposedly because the storage unit did not have air-conditioning and it was hot outside\u2014even though Ramsey had requested a copy of the file ahead of time. Respondent was given a deadline of July 18, 2008, to turn over Barrie\u2019s file, but did not actually provide the Office of Bar Counsel with the file until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>August 13, 2008. On July 18, 2008, Respondent informed the Office of Bar Counsel that his office had flooded, and he needed more time to turn over the file. Respondent testified at trial that it was only during the clean up of the office flood that the Barrie file was discovered. This Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 8.1 due to Respondent\u2019s lack of cooperation with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">vii. Rule 8.4\u2014Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Respondent violated the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct due to his failure to pursue collection of Barrie\u2019s PIP and settlement checks, his failure to communicate with Barrie, and his failure to obtain Barrie\u2019s consent for the settlement. In addition, Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d), which states that it is professional misconduct to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u201d by failing to cooperate with the Office of Bar Counsel. Therefore, this Court finds Respondent in violation of Rule 8.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">(Citations to exhibits omitted and some paragraph breaks added).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">On remand from this Court, Judge Bernard made the following supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding mitigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">In this case, Respondent argued that he had serious health issues during the pendency of the cases at issue in this matter, which impacted his ability to practice law. Respondent has also replaced his manual calendar and case tracking system with a computerized system, to avoid future lapses similar to those which occurred in the aforementioned cases of Ronnie Miller, David Pearson, and Abdul Barrie. Respondent also raised mail delivery problems in his office building as a possible explanation for why he did not receive any of the approximately fifty (50) PIP and settlement checks sent by GEICO to Respondent for Mr. Barrie over the course of six (6) years. Respondent also explained that his lack of full cooperation with Bar Counsel was due to an office flood which impaired Respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>ability to locate certain files related to this ease. Finally, Respondent testified that he was remorseful, that he felt his conduct reflected adversely both upon himself and the legal profession, and that none of his violations of the Rules were intentional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">Having fully considered the evidence, the Court finds that Respondent has not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that he was remorseful for his actions, or that any of his violations of the Rules and the impact those violations had on his clients was mitigated in any meaningful way. While Respondent testified that he was remorseful, his actions during the pendency of the cases of Miller, Pearson, and Barrie, demonstrate a disregard for the welfare of his clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ado\">In the case of Miller and Pearson, Respondent allowed the Complaint he filed in Prince George\u2019s County to be dismissed for lack of prosecution. Respondent apparently never discovered the dismissal, despite seeking a reissue of the summons fourteen (14) months after the case had been dismissed. During the pendency of the case, Respondent repeatedly ignored phone calls from Miller and Pearson, who called not only to find out about the status of their case, but to inform Respondent that the Complaint contained errors. These errors included listing a different address for the Defendant than the address that appeared on the police report. Respondent also blatantly misled Miller and Pearson, telling them that \u201cthey had already been to court,\u201d and claiming that he had written an amended complaint that was never filed. It was not until Miller retained new counsel that Miller and Pearson were informed that their case had been dismissed. Respondent stated at the hearing that he did not believe that the case had been dismissed, because the summons had been reissued, and in any event he believed that the dismissal had been improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">Respondent had ample opportunity to attempt to take corrective action in the case he filed on behalf of Miller and Pearson. However, Respondent ignored his clients, disregarded their case and possibly foreclosed any possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>they had at recovering damages for their injuries. It was only during his testimony at the trial in this case that Respondent actually apologized for his actions, and even then, he testified that he still did not believe he had violated any rules in his representation of Miller and Pearson. This Court finds Respondent\u2019s so-called remorse to be merely an attempt to excuse his failure to adequately represent his clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">In the case of Mr. Barrie, Respondent made attempts to recover PIP and settlement checks after Barrie was involved in a car accident. Over the course of six (6) years, GEICO sent groups of checks intended for Barrie to Respondent\u2019s office no less than five (5) times. Approximately fifty (50) checks in total were sent to Respondent that were apparently never received. Respondent testified that Barrie\u2019s file had been misplaced as an explanation for why he did not follow up on the case. Respondent also testified that he doubted that so many checks had been sent, and further cited problems with mail being lost or stolen in his building as a possible reason why the checks had not been received. Finally, Respondent testified at trial that he regretted that it took so long for Mr. Barrie to recover the money from GEICO, which Barrie accomplished only after obtaining new counsel. Even if this Court accepted as true Respondent\u2019s explanations about lost mail, or about misplacing the Barrie file, Respondent still ignored repeated phone calls and attempted office visits from Barrie over the course of seven (7) years. These communications from a client should have placed Respondent on notice that something was wrong. Yet Respondent allowed Barrie\u2019s case to languish, making no efforts to remedy whatever issue was preventing Barrie from receiving the checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">Respondent blames his faulty calendaring system and his health problems for abandoning his clients\u2019 cases. However, Respondent\u2019s involvement in these cases took place over a period of years. There was no evidence that Respondent\u2019s health problems affected him for such a extended period of time that he could not perform the duties required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>of him in the cases of Miller, Pearson, and Barrie. Additionally, any problems Respondent had with his calendaring system should have been remedied by the repeated inquiries by his clients about the status of their cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">Finally, this Court does not find that the flood in Respondent\u2019s office mitigated his failure to cooperate with Bar Counsel. Respondent was found to be in violation of Rule 8.1 on account of his general conduct towards the Bar Counsel investigation. Respondent repeatedly failed to supply Bar Counsel with a copy of the Barrie file when requested; once ignoring the request completely, and on another occasion telling Bar Counsel that he was still attempting to have GEICO re-issue Barrie\u2019s checks. Respondent then failed to provide the Barrie file to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator William Ramsey as requested on the date Ramsey had scheduled to interview Respondent at his office. Respondent told Ramsey that the file was in storage, and that it was too hot to get it at that time. Finally, after the office flood, the file was located during the clean-up. The flood, however, did nothing to change the fact that Respondent did not fully and freely disclose to Bar Counsel what was requested of him, nor did it change his uncooperative attitude toward the proceedings. Respondent\u2019s interactions with Bar Counsel during the investigation demonstrated the same careless attitude that Respondent showed towards the cases of Miller, Pearson, and Barrie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">Therefore, this Court, incorporating its previous Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, finds that Respondent has not demonstrated mitigation beyond a preponderance of the evidence in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\u201cIn attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Miller and Pearson Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Respondent first takes exception to Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.1 (competence). Judge Bernard based that conclusion on her finding that Respondent demonstrated incompetence by neglecting Miller and Pearson\u2019s case after filing the complaint, and showing a \u201clack of thoroughness and preparation\u201d that ultimately led to the case being dismissed. In excepting to that conclusion (and, implicitly, the finding on which it was based), Respondent cites his inability to effect service of process because of his receiving an incorrect address for the Defendant, and the repeated reissuing of summonses by the trial court, then concludes that while he, Respondent, \u201cmay have been careless or even neglectful, that does not rise to the level of incompetence____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The facts do not show that, after filing the initial complaint in March 2004, Respondent made any effort, short of requesting the summons be reissued, to perfect service in order to preserve the case for Miller and Pearson. Such apathy towards the need for service to preserve the case does not begin to approach the \u201cthoroughness ... reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MRPC 1.1. Accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Respondent\u2019s second exception is to Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.2(a) (scope of representation and allocation of authority between client and lawyer) by his \u201cignorance of the case\u2019s status, combined with his refusal to provide Miller and Pearson with accurate information about their case,\u201d following their requests for such information. Respondent argues that he did not stray from the scope of the representation\u2014trying to recover damages for the auto accident claim\u2014and cites <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 745 A.2d 1037 (2000), for the proposition that Miller and Pearson\u2019s dissatisfaction with Respondent\u2019s repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>sentation, in and of itself, is insufficient to find a violation of Rule 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Contrary to Respondent\u2019s assertion, <em>Briscoe </em>provides little assistance here. In that case, we concluded that there were insufficient facts to support finding a violation of Rule 1.2, where the hearing judge stated only that the client, after having paid his lawyer for representation in a criminal case, was \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the representation. <em>Briscoe, </em>357 Md. at 564, 745 A.2d at 1042. No further detail was given regarding the basis for the client\u2019s dissatisfaction. In the instant matter, by contrast, Judge Bernard provided extensive detail concerning the shortcomings of Respondent\u2019s representation of Miller and Pearson. Miller and Pearson hired Respondent to help them recover damages for harm suffered due to the auto accident. However, after filing the initial complaint and being unable to serve the defendant, Respondent took only <em>de minimis </em>steps\u2014requesting the summons be reissued\u2014towards advancing Miller and Pearson\u2019s goals. By failing to make any significant effort to recover damages for his clients, Respondent violated Rule 1.2(a). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gmnger, </em>374 Md. 438, 455, 823 A.2d 611, 621 (2003) (after being hired to prevent foreclosure of a client\u2019s home, attorney violated Rule 1.2(a) by taking no action to stop the foreclosure). Therefore, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Next, Respondent takes exception to Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.3 by failing to diligently pursue, or even monitor, Miller and Pearson\u2019s case. Respondent stresses that Rule 1.3 requires only that an attorney act with <em>\u201creasonable </em>diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d MRPC 1.3 (emphasis added). In this case, he argues that his conduct was reasonable because he filed the complaint, attempted service, and was unaware of the dismissal of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. 1, 762 A.2d 950 (2000), we held that a lawyer violated Rule 1.3 by failing to respond to phone calls and letters from his client, and failing to provide an accounting for earned fees. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>not only did Respondent repeatedly fail to respond to inquiries from his clients, he also declined to take any significant steps to prosecute their case for several years after filing the complaint. Under no fair interpretation of Rule 1.3 could such inattentiveness be considered \u201creasonable\u201d in this case. This exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Respondent\u2019s fourth exception is to Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.4 (communication) by not keeping Miller and Pearson reasonably informed about the status of their case, and not promptly complying with their reasonable requests for information. Respondent points to no actual evidence that suggests Judge Bernard clearly erred in finding that Respondent became evasive when contacted by Miller or Pearson, and that, when he did reply, he provided them with inadequate or dismissive responses. Thus, we sustain Judge Bernard\u2019s factual findings, which show Respondent violated Rule 1.4 by not keeping Miller and Pearson reasonably informed, and by ignoring reasonable requests for information regarding their case. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lee, </em>393 Md. 385, 408, 903 A.2d 360, 374 (2006) (finding violation of Rule 1.4 where attorney \u201cfailed to respond promptly or meaningfully to many of [his client\u2019s] telephonic inquiries about the case[,]\u201d did not provide written attorney work and transcripts as promised, and did not respond to the client\u2019s written requests for information). Therefore, this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Respondent\u2019s fifth exception is to Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.16 (declining or terminating representation) by \u201ceffectively terminating the representation of Miller and Pearson without adequately notifying them or protecting their interests.\u201d Respondent asserts that Rule 1.16 is inapplicable here because \u201cRule 1.16 is directed towards the lawyer\u2019s actions after the client has terminated the relationship and not the converse.... \u201d Respondent\u2019s alleged violation of Rule 1.16 occurred after the effective termination of his representation of Miller and Pearson. Recently, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. 652, 660-61, 984 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>A.2d 865, 869-70 (2009), we concluded that an attorney \u201cin effect abandoned his representation\u201d by failing to pursue his client\u2019s cases, thereby violating Rule 1.16(d). Similarly, in this case, Judge Bernard found that Respondent effectively abandoned Miller and Pearson\u2019s case. Once he abandoned the case, Respondent did not protect Miller and Pearson\u2019s interests because, by not notifying them of his abandonment, he prevented them from seeking new counsel to preserve and pursue their claims. Accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Respondent\u2019s last exception regarding the Miller and Pearson case challenges Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(a) and (c) (professional misconduct). Rule 8.4(a) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cviolate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct....\u201d Respondent suggests that if we accept Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusions regarding any of the rules discussed above, we should \u201csubsume\u201d the corresponding Rule 8.4(a) violation into the other violation(s). Insofar as \u201csubsuming\u201d Rule 8.4(a) into another violation is simply merging the violations, only under a different name, we reject this request. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brooke, </em>374 Md. 155, 177 n. 8, 821 A.2d 414, 426 n. 8 (2003) (merging of Rule 8.4(a) and a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct is improper); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Foltz, </em>411 Md. 359, 411, 983 A.2d 434, 465 (2009) (when an attorney \u201chas violated several Rules of Professional Conduct, he necessarily violated MRPC 8.4(a) as well\u201d) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 710-11, 810 A.2d 996, 1018 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Judge Bernard concluded that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) by his misrepresentation to Miller that, \u201c[w]e\u2019ve already been to court,\u201d despite never having actually been to court for Miller and Pearson\u2019s case. \u201cA finding of deceit and misrepresentation in a disciplinary action must be found to be intentional, supported by clear [and] convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>393 Md. at 410, 903 A.2d at 375 (citations omitted). Respondent insists that his statement was \u201ctaken out of context\u201d and that it is \u201cnot unreasonable to view the ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>comment as technically correct, as the Respondent reasonably believed that the case was moving forward____\u201d We are not persuaded. In no apparent way is the statement \u201ctechnically correct.\u201d As found by Judge Bernard, Respondent had never been to court for the case. Notably, Respondent does not challenge the facts, as found by Judge Bernard, that he made the statement to Miller and that he had never been to court for the case. Rather, he argues that those facts are not sufficient to establish intentional misrepresentation. In his words, the statement may be \u201csomewhat disingenuous\u201d but is not a violation of Rule 8.4(c). However, Respondent\u2019s statement, made in 2008, unequivocally pronounced that he had been to court, thereby misrepresenting to Miller and Pearson that the case, filed in 2004, had been progressing. Thus, we agree with Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c), and overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>2. Barde Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Respondent\u2019s first exception in the Barrie case, regarding Rule 1.1 (competence), is nearly identical to his first exception in the Miller and Pearson case. He argues that his inattentiveness towards the case, which caused it to languish for approximately six years, \u201cmay have been careless or even neglectful, [but did] not rise to the level of incompetence____\u201d The facts found by Judge Bernard, and not challenged by Respondent, show that GEICO reissued the checks numerous times over the six-year period, each time mailing them to Respondent\u2019s office, but Respondent never delivered any check to Barrie. Respondent never tried to find a substitute address for GEICO to send the checks to, and he took no other affirmative steps to obtain the checks for Barrie, despite Barrie\u2019s inquiring numerous times about the status of his case. Whatever the actual reason for the failure of the checks to reach Barrie, Respondent\u2019s inaction to remedy the situation falls well short of the \u201cthoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MRPC 1.1. Therefore, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Next, Respondent takes exception to Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.16 (declining or terminating representation) by effectively terminating his representation when he abandoned the case, then not protecting Barrie\u2019s interests when he failed to respond to requests by Barrie\u2019s new counsel, McGuire, for information about the case. Respondent argues that he cooperated with McGuire. The facts, as found by Judge Bernard, suggest otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">On May 22, 2008, McGuire attempted to contact Respondent about Barrie\u2019s case. However, McGuire\u2019s phone call to Respondent went unreturned. On June 26, 2008, McGuire wrote to Respondent, notifying him that he was now representing Barrie, and requesting a copy of Respondent\u2019s case file. McGuire never received a response from Respondent. McGuire wrote to the Respondent a second time on July 8, 2008, again requesting a copy of Barrie\u2019s file, to which he again received no response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">(Citations to exhibits omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Even if, as Respondent argues, he was unable to locate the Barrie file at the time, the facts show nonetheless that he completely ignored McGuire\u2019s inquiries, choosing not even to acknowledge McGuire, much less explain to him why he could not produce the file. In addition, as with Miller and Pearson, Respondent failed to inform Barrie that he had effectively abandoned the representation, thus preventing Barrie from obtaining new counsel at the earliest possible time. That delay, combined with his unresponsiveness to McGuire, sufficiently demonstrates that Respondent failed to \u201ctake steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests!.]\u201d MRPC 1.16(d). Accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Respondent\u2019s third exception regarding the Barrie case challenges Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.1(b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters) because he \u201crepeatedly failed to timely respond to the Office of Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information.\u201d Respondent argues that he did cooperate with Bar Counsel, but admits he \u201cdid not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>promptly request extensions of time to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s information requests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>the hearing judge found a violation of Rule 8.1, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">Respondent violated Rule 8.1 by failing to respond to Petitioner\u2019s requests seeking a response to the Client\u2019s complaint. Respondent\u2019s defense that she became paralyzed with fear when she received such requests from Bar Counsel and is unable to act is unacceptable. Respondent\u2019s assertion that illness prevented her from timely responding to the Petition herein was also unpersuasive in light of the fact that she worked on other Client matters and appeared in Court during the illness. Respondent\u2019s apology for her failure to respond in the instant case was accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">887 Md. 503, 519, 876 A.2d 79, 88 (2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">We overruled an exception to that conclusion, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">Rule 8.1 notes that a lawyer, in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not \u201cknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from ...

It also cited Rule 16-731(d) n and noted the concern about completing the investigation within the time established. Finally, the letter informed Ms. Kreamer of Rule 8.1. The September 8 letter referenced the first letter, gave Ms. Kreamer seven days to reply, and reminded Ms. Kreamer of Rule 8.1. Finally, the October 15 letter granted Ms. Kreamer\u2019s oral request for an extension and noted that her response was expected by October 29. Ms. Kreamer\u2019s eventual response to the Commission, while certainly much better than no response at all, does not excuse her repeated failures to respond in writing, as requested by the Commission several times. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 249, 253, 760 A.2d 1108 (2000) (noting this Court\u2019s \u201clong history of holding that an attorney violates Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to letters from disciplinary authorities requesting information,\u201d and also holding that respondent\u2019s \u201cbelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>cooperation with Bar Counsel does not excuse respondent\u2019s failure to respond to the previous five letters sent by Bar Counsel\u201d). We agree with the hearing judge that Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 8.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Kreamer, </em>at 531, 876 A.2d at 95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The facts of <em>Kreamer </em>are similar to this case. Respondent repeatedly failed to respond timely to written requests from Bar Counsel, and the requests from Bar Counsel to Respondent stressed the time-sensitive nature of the investigation by citing Md. Rule 16-731(d),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and MRPC 8.1. Eventually, after his numerous tardy responses and a flood in his office that apparently prohibited him from recovering the Barrie file from his office for a period of time,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Respondent finally sent Bar Counsel the file. As in <em>Kreamer, </em>Respondent\u2019s eventual production of the file does not excuse his prior, repeated failures to respond timely to requests by Bar Counsel. We therefore agree with Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 8.1, and we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Finally, Respondent takes exception to Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(a) and (d) (professional misconduct). First, Judge Bernard stated that Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>violated Rule 8.4(a) by violating the Rules of Professional Conduct in the Barrie case. For the same reasons discussed in regard to the Miller and Pearson case, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception here.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Next, Judge Bernard concluded that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d), which states it is professional misconduct to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d Judge Bernard rested that conclusion on her finding that Respondent failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel. Respondent, after citing his challenges to the allegations regarding Rule 8.1, which we addressed above, contends that \u201cconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d requires more than \u201cmere negligence or inattention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 48-49, 785 A.2d 1260, 1267 (2001), we adopted a hearing judge\u2019s conclusion of law that the respondent in that case violated Rule 8.4(d) \u201cby his apparently habitual failure to assist and cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.... \u201d Similarly, the facts here show that Respondent repeatedly failed to respond in a timely manner to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries. Respondent did not promptly acknowledge Bar Counsel\u2019s letters, much less provide the requested information in a timely manner. Like in <em>Harrington, </em>we find sufficient facts to support Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d). Accordingly, this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Next, we address Respondent\u2019s exceptions to Judge Bernard\u2019s supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding mitigation. We have defined mitigating factors to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 599, 911 A.2d 440, 448 (2006) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 488-89, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996)). Under Md. Rule 16-757(b), a \u201crespondent who asserts an affirmative defense or a matter of mitigation or extenuation has the burden of proving the defense or matter by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Respondent, in his exceptions filed with this Court, submits his proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law. We address his proposals in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">First, Respondent argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">That the Respondent was a sole practitioner at the time he was handling the three (3) matters herein, and handled a substantial number of personal injury matters, and was experienced in motor vehicle tort claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">As quoted above, Judge Bernard found that Respondent had experience with the types of claims he pursued on behalf of Miller, Pearson, and Barrie. In addition, as stated in <em>Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. at 599, 911 A.2d at 448, <em>inexperience </em>in the practice of law may be a mitigating factor, so it is unclear why, or if, Respondent highlights his experience as mitigation in this matter. Accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Second, Respondent writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">That during the time that the matters herein were pending, the Respondent has [sic] some serious health issues, and was hospitalized on a number of occasions, which did impact on his ability to practice law, and keep up the level of communication that some of his clients sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">In her supplemental findings of fact, Judge Bernard discussed Respondent\u2019s self-described health problems. She found, however, \u201cno evidence that Respondent\u2019s health problems affected him for such an extended period of time that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>could not perform the duties required of him in the cases of Miller, Pearson, and Barrie.\u201d Respondent points to no specific evidence or testimony to show that Judge Bernard clearly erred in her finding that his medical conditions did not preclude him from pursuing the cases or communicating with his clients over the several years relevant to this matter. Therefore, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Third, Respondent asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">That the Respondent, who had a manual calendar and case tracking system in place at the time he was involved in the matters herein, has taken corrective actions, and now has a computerized calendar and tracking systems to keep abreast of his files, so that any case tracking and calendaring problems that had arisen previously, will not occur in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Judge Bernard found that Respondent \u201creplaced his manual calendar and case tracking system with a computerized system, to avoid future lapses similar to those which occurred in the aforementioned cases of Ronnie Miller, David Pearson, and Abdul Barrie.\u201d So, there appears no dispute about these facts. Judge Bernard, however, limits the significance of Respondent\u2019s calendar and case tracking upgrades, by concluding that \u201cany problems Respondent had with his calendaring system should have been remedied by the repeated inquiries by his clients about the status of their cases.\u201d We thus accept Respondent\u2019s assertion here as mitigation to the extent it shows efforts on his part to prevent future problems, but we do not consider it as mitigation for his lack of diligence and communication in the cases at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Fourth, Respondent argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">That the Respondent was having mail delivery problems for a period of time at his office, as was the entire building where his office was located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Judge Bernard acknowledged Respondent\u2019s testimony that mail had been lost or stolen in his building. Accepting as true Respondent\u2019s alleged problems with mail delivery, the mitiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>tion impact of such problems is minimal due to the absence of any evidence that, during the approximately six-year span in which GEICO repeatedly mailed him the PIP and settlement checks, Respondent took steps to remedy the situation, or to find an alternative means of delivering the PIP and settlement checks to Barrie. Accordingly, this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Fifth, Respondent submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">The Respondent also had an office flood which impaired his ability to locate some of the files involved in the matters herein, and impeded his speed of responding to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information in the matters herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Judge Bernard accepts that the flood occurred. She concluded, however, that it does not mitigate Respondent\u2019s \u201cfailure to cooperate with Bar Counsel.\u201d The record supports that conclusion. As described earlier, on May 9, 2008, Bar Counsel sent Respondent a letter requesting his response to Barrie\u2019s complaint within ten days. Respondent provided no response. On May 23, 2008, Bar Counsel sent a second letter requesting a response within seven days. Respondent did not contact Bar Counsel until June 11, 2008, when he requested a ten-day extension, which Bar Counsel granted, asking that a response be filed by June 23, 2008, along with a copy of Barrie\u2019s case file. Respondent did not provide timely any of the requested information, instead sending a fax to Bar Counsel on June 27, 2008, asking for additional time of unspecified duration. On July 3, 2008, Mr. Ramsey, the Bar Counsel investigator, met with Respondent, who again failed to produce the case file, but promised to send it immediately. On July 8, 2008, Bar Counsel again wrote to Respondent asking that he submit the case file by July 18, 2008. On July 18, a Friday, Respondent wrote to Bar Counsel, advising them that his office had flooded \u201con a Sunday.\u201d The exact date of the flood is unclear. At the September 16, 2009, hearing in front of Judge Bernard, Bar Counsel questioned Respondent during his testimony about the exact date of the flood. Respondent pointed out that the phrase \u201ca Sunday\u201d in his July 18, 2008, letter is ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and further testified that he did not remember the date of the flood.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Whatever the precise date of the flood may have been does not change the fact that Respondent failed to respond timely to inquiries from Bar Counsel. Respondent\u2019s suggestion that the flood \u201cimpeded his speed of responding to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information\u201d is, at the least, overly broad. Even if the flood occurred early enough and was severe enough to prevent him from recovering the Barrie file, no explanation or evidence is provided to convey how it prevented him from writing or calling Bar Counsel, in response to their inquiries dating back to May 9, 2008, to request additional time. Therefore, we accept Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that the flood does not mitigate Respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate with Bar Counsel. This exception is overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">Finally, Respondent argues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">The Respondent was remorseful for the perceived lack of communication and cooperation with the Complainants and Bar Counsel herein, and recognized that not only did that perception reflect adversely upon him as a lawyer, but importantly, that it also reflected adversely on the legal profession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Judge Bernard did not find Respondent\u2019s remorse to be genuine. She wrote: \u201cThis Court finds Respondent\u2019s so-called remorse to be merely an attempt to excuse his failure to adequately represent his clients.\u201d Respondent counters that it \u201cis quite difficult to be remorseful about anything until the conduct is called to your attention.... \u201d Respondent\u2019s point may be true in and of itself. Nonetheless, Miller, Pearson, and Barrie repeatedly attempted to contact Respondent to learn the status of their cases\u2014thereby calling attention to his lack of communication\u2014and he repeatedly refused to respond. Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s argument is unpersuasive given his willful and blissful ignorance of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">We defer to Judge Bernard\u2019s assessment of the \u201cdemeanor-based credibility\u201d of Respondent\u2019s testimony. <em>Edib, </em>415 Md. at 707, 4 A.3d at 964. In addition, we find Respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>purported remorse to carry little mitigative weight when contrasted with his repeated assertions that he acted reasonably in both the Miller and Pearson case and the Barrie case. Respondent\u2019s remorse, it appears, \u201cis more in the nature of damage control than of sincere remorse.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pennington, </em>387 Md. 565, 597, 876 A.2d 642, 661 (2005). Accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Our final task is to determine the appropriate sanction in this case. In <em>Bleecker, </em>414 Md. at 176, 994 A.2d at 945, we described the purpose of sanctions in disciplinary cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0S\">We evaluate every attorney grievance matter on its own merits, taking into account the facts and circumstances involved. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Gisriel, </em>409 Md. 331, 385, 974 A.2d 331, 362 (2009). We have consistently iterated that the goal of attorney discipline is protection of the public, rather than the punishment of the erring attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 30, 922 A.2d 554, 571 (2007). We protect the public through sanctions against offending attorneys in two ways: through deterrence of \u201cthe type of conduct which will not be tolerated,\u201d and by removing those unfit to continue in the practice of law from the rolls of those authorized to practice in this State. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 75, 930 A.2d 328, 347-48 (2007) (citation omitted). The public is protected when the sanction imposed is commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Shryock, </em>408 Md. 105, 126, 968 A.2d 593, 605 (2009). Therefore, we must consider the nature of the ethical duties violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 166-67, 939 A.2d 732, 746-47 (2008) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Respondent, arguing that his conduct was \u201cneither egregious not intentional,\u201d recommends a reprimand, or, in the alternative, \u201ca short term suspension.\u201d Petitioner recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>mends disbarment, pointing to Respondent\u2019s abandonment of his clients and his refusal to cooperate with Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">To support disbarment, Petitioner cites several cases including <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Angst, </em>369 Md. 404, 800 A.2d 747 (2002), <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dunietz, </em>368 Md. 419, 795 A.2d 706 (2002), <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 793 A.2d 535 (2002), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>318 Md. 154, 567 A.2d 112 (1989). While those cases share some similarities to this case, they all involve additional, severe violations or prior disciplinary records and thus are not ideal comparisons. <em>See Angst, </em>369 Md. at 419-20, 800 A.2d at 756-57 (tax violation); <em>Dunietz, </em>368 Md. at 429, 795 A.2d at 711-12 (prior disciplinary record); <em>Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 287, 793 A.2d at 541 (charging unreasonable fees and failure to provide a refund to client); <em>Montgomery, </em>318 Md. at 160-61, 567 A.2d at 115 (failure to provide a refund to client and prior disciplinary record).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">More recent than the cases cited by Petitioner, and more factually similar to this case, is <em>Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. 652, 984 A.2d 865, where we held that the appropriate sanction was disbarment. There, an attorney, while representing a client in both an unemployment discrimination case and a fire tort case, neglected his client\u2019s cases to the point of abandonment. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 984 A.2d at 868-69. He also failed to communicate with his client and keep him informed about the status of the cases. <em>Id., </em>984 A.2d at 868-69. Additionally, the attorney did not respond at all to inquiries from Bar Counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 657-58, 984 A.2d at 868. All told, we held that the attorney violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), 8.1(b) and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">To be sure, unlike in <em>Kwarteng, </em>Respondent eventually provided Bar Counsel with the requested information. Yet, Respondent violated all of the same rules as in <em>Kwarteng, </em>plus he violated Rule 8.4(c) by misrepresenting to Miller that \u201cwe\u2019ve already been to court,\u201d when in fact Respondent had never been to court in that case. The combination of Respondent\u2019s violations\u2014in particular, abandonment of his clients, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>misrepresentation, and failure to cooperate with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation\u2014convinces us that Respondent is unfit to practice law in Maryland and disbarment is the appropriate sanction to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED.
