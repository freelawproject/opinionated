Omayaka (Appellant) and Josephine 0. Omayaka (Appellee), were married on October 2, 1998, and were divorced by a judgment signed at the conclusion of a July 5, 2007 hearing. After that judgment was entered on July 10, 2007, Appellant noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and filed a brief in which he presented a single argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">Appellant made a prima facie case and carried his burden of showing dissipation of marital assets during the pendency of the divorce[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">In the words of the brief filed by Appellee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">Appellant failed to carry his burden of proof showing a dissipation of marital assets during the pendency of the divorce proceeding, where Appellee did not expend or move marital funds while the marriage was undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown with the principal purpose of reducing the funds available for equitable distribution, but rather, Appellee saved funds to use for family and household expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">Before these arguments were presented to a panel of the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a 'writ of certiorari on its own initiative. 406 Md. 443, 959 A.2d 792 (2008). For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">On January 24, 2007, Appellee filed an \u201cAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DIVORCE\u201d that included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">5. [Appellee] and [Appellant] did voluntarily agree to live separate and apart on or about May 31, 2005, and have voluntarily lived separate and apart without cohabitation and without interruption since said date. There is no reasonable hope or expectation of reconciliation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">6. All property issues between the parties have been resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">On February 23, 2007, Appellant filed an \u201cANSWER TO AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR ABSOLUTE DIVORCE\u201d and a \u201cCOUNTER-COMPLAINT FOR ABSOLUTE DIVORCE AND OTHER RELIEF.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Answer included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">[Appellant] denies that all property issues between the parties have been resolved. Indeed, upon the refinance and conveyance of the parties\u2019 marital home on or about April 28th 2006, the parties understood that any proceeds due the [Appellee] would be paid into a trust account set up by [Appellee]\u2019s counsel because [Appellee] had, without [Appellant\u2019s knowledge and approval, transferred about $80,000.00 in martial funds. In a subsequent communication, [Appellee]\u2019s counsel noted that he had released all but $40,00000 to the [Appellee] and that the rest was to be kept in escrow according to the agreement of the parties. To date, no accounting has been made with respect to how much money [Appellee] took and/or how it was spent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Appellant\u2019s Counter-Complaint included the following assertions and requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">\n<em>COUNT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">\n<em>DISSIPATION OF MARITAL ASSETS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>11. [Appellant] did refinance the marital home. Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, [Appellee]\u2019s counsel was to place her share of the proceeds in an escrow account until she had accounted for the transfer of marital funds in the amount of $80,000.00. By a June 13th 2006 communication, the parties understood that [Appellee]\u2019s counsel was to release all but $40,000.00 to her and would provide an accounting of what, if anything, was taken and how the marital money was spent. To date[,] no such accounting has been provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">12. [Appellee] has clearly dissipated the marital funds, these funds were transferred during the pendency of litigation and not spent for any family use purposes. Indeed some of these funds were wired to an overseas bank account and/or persons that [Appellant] is not aware of or was privy to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">WHEREFORE, the [Appellant] requests that the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">a. Grant him an absolute divorce from the [Appellee];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">b. Have [Appellee] ... account for any dissipation of any marital assets, including funds in bank accounts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">c. Determine the value of marital property of the parties, and make a monetary award to [Appellant] after adjusting the parties\u2019 rights in the marital property[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">d. Reduce to a judgment in favor of [Appellant] against the [Appellee][;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">e. Order [Appellee] to pay attorney\u2019s fees, court costs and suit money[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">During a contentious July 5, 2007 hearing, which was punctuated with several sharp exchanges, Appellant\u2019s counsel called Appellee as Appellant\u2019s first witness on his Counter-Complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s testimony included the concessions that (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>while married to Appellant, she opened two bank accounts in her name only, and (2) from March of 2005 through December of that year, she made \u201cover the counter\u201d withdrawals of approximately $80,000.00 from those accounts. Appellee, however, denied the allegation that she \u201cdissipated\u201d marital funds. The following transpired during Appellee\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFc\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Q ... Did you discuss with [Appellant] how you [spent] the money from these withdrawals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">A When we lived together, each one of us had our own account. So the way I spend my money, I spend my own money, and he just spent his own money. The only joint account that we had is where we used to pay our bills. That\u2019s the only account I could take the money out\u2014you know, we could discuss it before anyone takes the money out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Q Did you spend any of this money, ma\u2019am, for the family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Q What did you spend any of these monies for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">A I spend on clothing, I spend on food, I spend on health insurance that I bought for my baby, you know, from Kaiser. I spend on the rent. I spent paying all the credit card debt I had. I spend on the car note. I spend on food[, on] grocery. I spent some money\u2014you know, I have two kids back home. I sent the money to them as I used to do when we used to live together. I spend on the babysitter, too.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">At the conclusion of all of the evidence, the Circuit Court announced its decision to (1) grant Appellee an absolute divorce from Appellant, and (2) deny Appellant\u2019s counter-claim for dissipation. The following transpired during the Circuit Court\u2019s on-the-record analysis of Appellant\u2019s dissipation claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">THE COURT: So then the question becomes what, if anything, is to be done about an allegation and countercomplaint about dissipation of marital assets? I can suggest to you the burden is on Mr. Omayaka in that regard. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>while there has been evidence presented that Ms. Omayaka spent substantial sums of money during the marriage, the only testimony as to where the money went is for household goods, mortgages, clothes, to pay off credit card debt, and to send money to her minor children, somewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">The issue is, was the money spent for his or her own benefit or purpose unrelated to the marriage at the time when the marriage is undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown. I don\u2019t find that that burden has been met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">Accordingly, the first step is not met. If it had been met then the testimony, once again, is that the money is spent for purposes (unintelligible) purposes would be appropriate under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">The Court cannot find that there has been a dissipation of assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">There\u2019s also a question of contributions\u2014or source of the funds for those assets. There was one sentence of possible testimony in that regard, and that was that she was\u2014two sentences, we\u2019ll say\u2014putting money aside for the future, and she was working at the time. And her testimony with regard to her income is such that it would have been\u2014a reasonable inference would suggest that the money could not have come solely from her work, because [of] the amounts involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">So I\u2019m going to deny the counterplaintiffs action with regard to dissipation of assets. That leaves no other issue with regard to marital property before the Court. Accordingly, no monetary award will be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Your Honor, ... for dissipation\u2014you\u2019re putting all the burden on us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">THE COURT: I think I just explained that I did not believe that you had made a case. That\u2019s not a \u201cprima facie\u201d case. We are at the conclusion of all of the evidence. So it\u2019s not a question of a \u201cprima facie\u201d case. The question is, did he meet the burden? And I suggested that he didn\u2019t meet the threshold question. And then I went on to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>that even accepting that he did meet it, then the next question is, does she explain adequately where the funds went? And I found that she had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But she didn\u2019t put on any evidence, Your Honor, about how the money was spent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">THE COURT: She did. She said that she spent it on her credit cards, her $5,000 loan, her clothing, food, mortgage, sent to the other two children; she went through a whole litany of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... There\u2019s no evidence in the record that she spent the money for what she said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">THE COURT: There is evidence. I heard her say so under oath from the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: There\u2019s no corroborating evidence, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t recall in the [C]ode where that testimony needs to be corroborated. If you can give me a case that requires that, I\u2019ll be happy to look at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Appellant now requests (in the words of his brief), \u201cthat this Court vacate the judgment of no dissipation and remand the case with instructions to the Circuit Court to enter a Judgment in favor of the Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Only four cases are included in the TABLE OF CITATIONS found in Appellant\u2019s brief: <em>Sharp v. Sharp, 58 </em>Md.App. 386, [473 A.2d 499] (1984); <em>Choate v. Choate, </em>97 Md.App. 347, 629 A.2d 1304 (1993); <em>Jeffcoat v. Jeffcoat, </em>102 Md.App. 301, 649 A.2d 1137 (1994); and <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>112 Md.App. 197, [684 A.2d 878] (1996). Only <em>Sharp, Choate, </em>and <em>Jeffcoat </em>are cited in Appellee\u2019s brief. The parties agree that \u201c[dissipation [occurs] where one spouse uses marital property for his or her own benefit for a purpose unrelated to the marriage at a time where the marriage is undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown.\u201d <em>Sharp, supra, 58 </em>Md.App. at 401, 473 A.2d at 506. While we must determine whether this kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>of dissipation has been proven in the ease at bar, we note that dissipation may occur on occasions in which (1) the marriage is <em>not </em>undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and/or (2) the dissipating spouse\u2019s <em>principal purpose </em>was a purpose other than the purpose \u201cof reducing the amount of funds that would be available for equitable distribution at the time of the divorce.\u201d <em>Welsh v. Welsh, </em>135 Md.App. 29, 51, 761 A.2d 949, 961 (2000). Dissipation occurs when \u201cmarital assets were taken by one spouse without agreement by the other spouse.\u201d John F. Fader, II &amp; Richard J. Gilbert, <em>Maryland Family Law, </em>\u00a7 15-10 (4th ed.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 857 A.2d 1109 (2004), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">Maryland common law first addressed a husband\u2019s dissipation of marital property quite a long time ago. <em>Feigley v. Feigley, </em>7 Md. 537, 561 (1855) (observing that a husband\u2019s right to freely alienate property at the expense of supporting his wife is valid, \u201cprovided he does so <em>bona fide, </em>and with no design of defrauding her of her just claims upon him and his estate.\u201d). Dissipation of marital assets, as with many issues in the field of family law, has not been considered much of late by this Court. The majority of modern reported cases developing the doctrine of intentional dissipation of marital assets has been reported by the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">A trial court\u2019s judgment regarding dissipation is a factual one and, therefore, is reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard. \u201cIf there is any competent evidence to support the factual findings below, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Fuge v. Fuge, </em>146 Md.App. 142,180, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>806 A.2d 716, 738 (2002); <em>see also McCleary v. McCleary, </em>150 Md.App. 448, 462, 822 A.2d 460, 469 (2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\">In determining a marital award, the trial court first must determine the amount and value of the marital property. Generally, \u201cproperty disposed of before trial cannot be marital property.\u201d <em>Turner [v. Turner </em>], 147 Md.App. [350] at 409, 809 A.2d [18] at 52 [ (2002) ]. An exception to the general rule has been recognized when a court \u201cfinds that property was intentionally dissipated in order to avoid inclusion of the property towards consideration of a monetary award.... \u201d <em>Sharp v. Sharp, </em>58 Md.App. 386, 399, 473 A.2d 499, 505 (1984). Even so, \u201ca conveyance made by a husband before and in anticipation of his wife\u2019s suit for alimony, or pending such suit, or after decree has been entered therein in the wife\u2019s favor, to prevent her from obtaining alimony, is fraudulent and may be set aside, unless the grantee took in good faith, without notice and for value.\u201d <em>Oles Envelope Corp. v. Oles, </em>193 Md. 79, 89, 65 A.2d 899, 903 (1949) (holding spouse\u2019s sale of marital property stock for $42,000 over book value adequate consideration to defeat fraudulent dissipation claim). To include property that was disposed of during the marriage, the trial court must be persuaded that there is evidence of dissipation, and \u201cthe party alleging dissipation has the initial burden of production and burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>McCleary, </em>150 Md.App. at 463, 822 A.2d at 469. If the evidence presented in support of a finding of dissipation is insufficient, the trial court reasonably may conclude that the previously relinquished asset should not be included in the marital property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 201-02, 857 A.2d at 1123-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The case at bar involves the issue of whether Appellee \u201cspent or otherwise depleted marital funds or property with the principal purpose of reducing the amount of funds that would be available for equitable distribution at the time of the divorce.\u201d <em>Welsh v. Welsh, </em>135 Md.App. 29, 51, 761 A.2d 949, 961 (2000). In <em>Heger v. Heger, </em>184 Md.App. 83, 964 A.2d 258 (2009), the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>In litigating a claim that one spouse has dissipated marital assets, the critical time is that between the separation or the time when \u201cthe marriage is undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown,\u201d <em>Sharp v. Sharp, </em>58 Md.App. 386, 401, 473 A.2d 499 (1984), on the one hand, and the ultimate divorce, on the other had. The other critical factor is the purpose on the part of the spending spouse for the expenditure. What matters is not that one spouse has, post-separation, expended some of the marital assets, what is critically important is the purpose behind the expenditure. The doctrine of dissipation is aimed at the nefarious purpose of one spouse\u2019s spending for his or her own personal advantage so as to compromise the other spouse in terms of the ultimate distribution of marital assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 96, 964 A.2d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Appellant concedes that an appellate court \u201cwill not set aside a trial court\u2019s determination regarding dissipation of marital assets unless the determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Beck, supra, </em>112 Md.App. at 216, 684 A.2d at 887. According to Appellant, however (in the words of his brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">The Court incorrectly applied the current Maryland law on dissipation; it did not follow the <em>Jeffcoat </em>analytical steps. There can be no doubt that Appellant made out a prima facie case of dissipation; he brought forth testimonial and documentary evidence which, standing alone and unexplained, would maintain the proposition and warrant the conclusion that dissipation had occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">Faced with prima facie evidence of dissipation, Appellee then had to produce evidence sufficient to show that the expenditures were appropriate. Appellee failed to produce such evidence even when asked to do so. In fact, she admitted that she did not have any documents to show that she had expended more than $80,000.00 within eight months on the family considering that she was gainfully employed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>had received almost $12,000.00 from her equity share in the refinance of the marital home, and Appellant was paying child support to her. It strains credulity to imagine that one would make counter withdrawals of such large sums of money, over a relatively short period of time, and yet argue that the expenditures were only for family purposes while providing no receipts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">What is more inconceivable is that the Court would not require proof, beyond testimony, that such amounts had indeed been spent appropriately. The Court [took] Appellee\u2019s testimony alone; it stated that \u201cthe only testimony as to where the money went is for household goods, mortgages, clothes, to pay off credit card debt, and to send money to her minor children, somewhere.\u201d But the Court had a duty to evaluate the expenditures to determine whether dissipation had taken place; whether joint funds had been spent for other than family purposes with the intention of reducing the amount of money available to the court for equitable distribution. The Court engaged in a cursory and biased analysis of the testimony and evidence in this matter; as such no such robust evaluation was undertaken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">It is difficult to determine whether Appellant is arguing that, as soon as he satisfied his burden of <em>production </em>by presenting \u201cprima facie evidence of dissipation,\u201d (1) the ultimate burden of <em>persuasion </em>was shifted to Appellee, who was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she had not dissipated the withdrawn funds, or (2) Appellee failed to satisfy her burden of <em>production </em>because she failed to produce \u201cany documents\u201d in support of her testimony as to how she spent the funds that she withdrew from the bank accounts that she had opened in her name only. There is no merit, however, in either of those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In their <em>Maryland Family Law </em>treatise, the authors suggest a \u201ccookbook method\u201d to resolve a dissipation allegation. As modified to clarify the burdens of production and persuasion, that method is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\u2022 If property does not exist at the time of divorce, it cannot usually be included as marital property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">\u2022 Well, that is so unless one spouse proves [by a preponderance of the evidence] that the other spouse dissipated assets acquired during the marriage to avoid inclusion of those assets toward consideration of a monetary award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\u2022 [A prima facie case] of dissipation occurs when evidence is produced that marital assets were taken by one spouse without agreement by the other spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\u2022 Then, the burden of going forward with evidence shifts to the party who [allegedly] took the assets without permission to [produce evidence that generates a genuine question of fact on the issue of (1) whether the assets were taken without agreement, and/or (2) ] where the funds are [and/or (3) whether the funds] were used for marital or family expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u2022 If that proof of use for marital or family purposes is not produced, then the property taken is \u201cextant\u201d marital property, titled in or owned by the individual who took the marital property without permission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u2022 From that \u201cextant\u201d property in the name of one spouse, the other spouse may be given a monetary award to make things equitable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">John F. Fader, II &amp; Richard J. Gilbert, <em>Maryland Family Law, </em>\u00a7 15-10 (4th ed.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">It is clear that the ultimate burden of persuasion remains on the party who claims that the other party has dissipated marital assets.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">The burden of persuasion and the initial burden of production in showing dissipation is on the party making the allegation. <em>Choate v. Choate, </em>97 Md.App. 347, 366, 629 A.2d 1304[, 1314] (1993). That party retains throughout the burden of persuading the court that funds have been dissipated, but after that party establishes a prima facie case that monies have been dissipated, i.e. expended for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>principal purpose of reducing the funds available for equitable distribution, the burden shifts to the party who spent the money to produce evidence sufficient to show that the expenditures were appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><em>Jeffcoat, supra, </em>102 Md.App. at 311, 649 A.2d at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Proof that a spouse made sizable withdrawals from bank accounts under his or her control is sufficient to support the finding that the spouse had dissipated the withdrawn funds. <em>Ross v. Ross, </em>90 Md.App. 176, 191, 600 A.2d 891, 898-99, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>327 Md. 101, 607 A.2d 933 (1992). In the case at bar, the Circuit Court expressly found that \u201cthere has been evidence presented that [Appellee] spent substantial sums of money during the marriage[.]\u201d If that evidence had been presented through the testimony of other witnesses, or if Appellant had not questioned Appellee about how she spent the money, there would be merit in Appellant\u2019s argument that he \u201cmade out a prima facie case of dissipation[.]\u201d Appellant, however, elected to question Appellee about how she spent the funds that she withdrew from her bank accounts in 2005, thereby presenting the Circuit Court with both (1) evidence of the withdrawals, and (2) Appellee\u2019s explanation of what she did with the money. While Appellant was certainly entitled to argue that Appellee\u2019s explanation was unworthy of belief, the Circuit Court was not required to agree with that argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>There is no merit in the argument \u201cthat this Court [must] vacate the judgment of no dissipation and remand the case with instructions to the Circuit Court to enter a Judgment in favor of the Appellant.\u201d In <em>Figgins v. Cochrane, </em>174 Md.App. 1, 920 A.2d 572 (2007), the Court of Special Appeals provided the following explanation for its conclusion that the Circuit Court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the appellant\u2019s evidence failed to rebut the presumption that she had improperly benefitted from her confidential relationship with her deceased father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">The finding of [the Circuit Court] that there was a confidential relationship is unassailable. That relationship created, as a matter of law, the presumption that any largesse exercised by the Father toward the appellant\u2014be it by deed of property or by gift from an equity loan\u2014was improperly induced by the relationship, whatever the modality of the transfer might turn out to be. The burden was cast upon the appellant to rebut that invalidating presumption. [The Circuit Court] found that \u201cin no manner has [appellant] met that burden.\u201d [The Circuit Court] was simply not persuaded, and there was evidence to support that non-persuasion. That there might also have been some evidence in the case pointing in the other direction is beside the point. It was clearly a question of fact for the fact finder. [The Circuit Court\u2019s] conclusion in that regard cannot, therefore, be said to have been clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 920 A.2d at 580. This Court quoted that analysis with approval in <em>Figgins v. Cochrane, </em>403 Md. 392, 406, 942 A.2d 736, 744 (2008), while concluding \u201cas did the Court of Special Appeals, that the trial court\u2019s finding that [Petitioner] had not met her burden to prove the validity of the transfer, was not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 942 A.2d at 749. As the Court of Special Appeals noted in <em>Bricker v. Warch, </em>152 Md.App. 119, 831 A.2d 453 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">Although it is not uncommon for a fact-finding judge to be clearly erroneous when he [or she] is affirmatively PERSUADED of something, it is, as in this case, almost impossi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ble for a judge to be clearly erroneous when he [or she] is simply NOT PERSUADED of something.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 137, 831 A.2d at 464 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, the Circuit Court was entitled to accept\u2014or <em>reject\u2014all, part, </em>or <em>none </em>of the testimony of any witness, whether that testimony was or was not contradicted or corroborated by any other evidence. The finding that Appellee had testified truthfully was therefore not erroneous\u2014clearly or otherwise\u2014merely because the Circuit Court <em>could </em>have drawn different \u201cpermissible inferences which might have been drawn from the evidence by another trier of the facts.\u201d <em>Hous. Opportunities Comm\u2019n of Montgomery County v. Lacey, </em>322 Md. 56, 61, 585 A.2d 219, 222 (1991) (internal citations omitted). Because the Circuit Court was entitled to find that Appellee had \u201cexplain[ed] adequately where the funds [that she had withdrawn from her bank accounts in 2005] went[,]\u201d we shall affirm the judgment at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-13\">. Because no prior appellate decision has been rendered in the case at bar, the designation of the parties is controlled by Md. Rule 8-111(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-12\">. Section 9-113 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides, in pertinent part: \"In a civil case, a party ... may be called by the adverse party and interrogated as on cross-examination.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 9-113 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\">. Appellate courts have held that improper expenditures on a paramour, or on gambling, constitutes dissipation even though the guilty spouse had no intention to reduce the amount of funds that would be available for equitable distribution at the time of the divorce. <em>See, e.g,, Brosick v. Brosick, </em>974 S.W.2d 498 (Ky.Ct.App.1998) (gifts to paramour); and <em>In re Marriage of Bartley, </em>712 N.E.2d 537 (Ind.Ct.App.1999) (excessive losses in betting pools on NCAA and NASCAR events).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">. When a party attempts to prove a particular point by presenting evidence that is less clear, less direct, less reliable and/or less satisfactory than other evidence available to that party, the trier of fact is permitted\u2014but not required\u2014to find that the \"better\u201d evidence \"would have been detrimental to [that party] and would have laid open deficiencies in, and objections to [that party\u2019s] case which the more obscure and uncertain evidence did not disclose.\u201d <em>Loyal Protective Ins. Co. v. Shoemaker, </em>178 Okla. 612, 63 P.2d 960, 963 (1936). <em>See also Herrington v. Leaf River Forest Prods., Inc. </em>733 So.2d 774, 777 (Miss.1999). While the record shows that Appellee ran the risk that the Circuit Court would disbelieve her testimony, the record also shows that Appellant made no attempt to undertake pretrial discovery that would have produced documentary evidence of Appellee\u2019s withdrawals and expenditures.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
