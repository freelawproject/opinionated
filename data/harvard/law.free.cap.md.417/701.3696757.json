Petitioner Cathy F. (\u201cMs. F\u201d) is the parent of Respondents Amber R. and Mark R. (the \u201cChildren\u201d), who have each been adjudicated to be a Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Ms. F.\u2019s long history of substance abuse and employment and housing issues led Respondent the Baltimore City Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ment of Social Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) to intervene in her family situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Ultimately, Ms. F. was unable to stabilize her home life, prompting the Department to pursue guardianship of the Children. The juvenile court, in evaluating Ms. F.\u2019s fitness as a parent, found by clear and convincing evidence that she was an unfit mother, and that it would be in the Children\u2019s best interests to terminate her parental rights. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed this judgment. We granted certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">In a Termination of Parental Rights case, where the court does not make a finding that exceptional circumstances exist to warrant terminating a natural parent\u2019s right in [her] child, what level of parental unfitness is required to permanently sever the parent[-]child relationship?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We shall hold that the existing statutory scheme governing termination of parental rights (\u201cTPR\u201d) cases sufficiently evaluates parental fitness, and that the juvenile court did not improperly shift the burden unto Ms. F.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">In mid September 2005, Ms. F. and the Children were evicted from their home and began living with a non-relative in a house that lacked functioning utilities. At that time, Amber was two-years-old, and Mark was less than one-year-old. The eviction grabbed the attention of the Department and led to an Emergency Shelter Care hearing approximately two weeks later, attended by both Ms. F. and the Children\u2019s father, Mark R., Sr. (\u201cMr. R.\u201d). The juvenile court found that the children could not be returned to the parents because of the parents\u2019 chaotic lifestyle, their failure to care for the children, and Ms. F.\u2019s continued drug use.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ment placed the Children in shelter care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In late April 2006, another hearing was held to determine the Children\u2019s status. Ms. F. did not attend. Mr. R. was present at the hearing, but he remained unable to provide longterm care for the Children due to his incarceration. The juvenile court determined that Amber and Mark were each a CI\u00d1A, and committed the Children to the Department. Following the CINA adjudications, the Children were placed in a foster home, although the court established a permanency plan of parental reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In order to facilitate parental reunification with the Children, the Department designed several service agreements directing Ms. F. to attend substance abuse treatment and parenting classes, apply for employment, and secure stable housing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Department also referred Ms. F. to drug treatment programs, parenting classes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> job skills classes, housing assistance, and supervised visitation assistance. Ms. F., however, did not complete any agreed-upon drug treatment program, and failed to provide the Department with any documentation indicating that she had completed substance abuse treatment or was participating in required drug testing. Case plans over the next 16 months indicated that Ms. F. still had \u201cnot met the terms of her service agreement[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Ms. F.\u2019s repeated failure to demonstrate that she had resolved her drug and housing problems led the Department to change the Children\u2019s permanency plan from \u201creunification\u201d to \u201crelative placement or adoption\u201d after fifteen months of foster care. In July 2007, the Department filed a Petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Guardianship with the Circuit Court, and the matter proceeded to a Termination of Parental Rights (\u201cTPR\u201d) hearing in October 2008. At the time of that hearing, the Children had been living with their foster family, Mr. and Ms. Fa., since March of 2007. According to the Children\u2019s social worker, Ophelia Okafor, the Children had developed a substantial emotional attachment to the Fas. This was evidenced in part by the fact that they referred to Mr. and Ms. Fa. as \u201cMom and Dad,\u201d whereas they called their mother \u201cMs. [Cjathy.\u201d The Fas were willing to adopt the Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">At the TPR hearing, Detry Smith, a social worker who had personally supervised most of the visits between the Children and Ms. F., testified that the Children had apparently adjusted well to their new home. According to Smith, the age-inappropriate sexual behavior displayed by Amber at the time of her placement had since abated during her time with the Fas. She was now performing well in school, \u201cahead of most children her age.\u201d Amber did, however, experience significant anxiety related to the supervised visits with her biological mother, for which she received weekly therapy. Moreover, for \u201ca day or two\u201d after the visits, Amber was \u201cvery hard to control [and] ... need[ed] to be reassured that she [would] be staying with the [Fas], that she\u2019s not being taken away.\u201d Smith further testified that the Fas would administer anti-anxiety medication to Amber following the visits, as recommended and supervised by a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">With regard to Ms. F., Okafor testified that the Children\u2019s mother had a history of substance abuse, lacked stable housing, and had \u201csome problems with income.\u201d She further testified that Ms. F. claimed to have taken steps towards remedying her personal problems, including receiving treatment for her substance abuse problem and obtaining new housing, but was unwilling to provide corroborating information to Okafor so that these alleged steps could be verified. Okafor attempted to contact the drug treatment program in which Ms. F. was allegedly enrolled, but received no information from the program or Ms. F. At the hearing, Ms. F. admitted to using \u201cheroin in the past[,]\u201d but claimed that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>had been clean since November 11, 2006. When cross-examined, however, Ms. F. changed that date to November 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The juvenile court, after considering the testimony of Okafor, Smith, and Ms. F., as well as the available documentary evidence, found clear and convincing evidence that Ms. F. was \u201cunfit to be a parent[,]\u201d and that it was in the Children\u2019s best interests to terminate Ms. F.\u2019s parental rights. In passing judgment, the court addressed each of the required statutory factors in turn and found that Ms. F.\u2019s history of substance abuse and failure to remedy that issue to be of paramount importance in evaluating her fitness as a parent. Ms. F. appealed the juvenile court\u2019s decision to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the ruling below. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court held that \u201cthe [juvenile court] had more than sufficient evidence upon which to terminate Ms. F.\u2019s parental rights.\u201d This Court granted Ms. F.\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Ms. F. both proposes that we superimpose a four-factor test onto the statutory scheme governing termination of parental rights and challenges the juvenile court\u2019s application of the existing scheme to her case. In order to review the juvenile court\u2019s judgment, we must first lay out the relevant provisions of the Family Law Article, and then consider how those provisions were applied in this case. On review of an order to terminate parental rights, this Court uses a clearly erroneous standard when scrutinizing a trial court\u2019s factual findings. <em>See, e.g., In re Adoption/Guardianship of Victor A, </em>386 Md. 288, 297, 872 A.2d 662, 667 (2005) <em>(quoting In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030, 1051 (2003)). Review of the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, however, will be conducted de novo. <em>See, e.g., In re Karl H., </em>394 Md. 402, 411, 906 A.2d 898, 903 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\n<em>A. The Statutory Scheme Governing Termination of Parental Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In TPR cases, a parent\u2019s right to custody of his or her children \u201cmust be balanced against the fundamental right and responsibility of the State to protect children, who cannot protect themselves, from abuse and neglect.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. 477, 497, 937 A.2d 177, 189 (2007). Thus, this parental right is terminated \u201cupon a showing either that the parent is \u2018unfit\u2019 or that \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 exist which would make continued custody with the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 937 A.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">With this understanding, the General Assembly has set forth criteria to guide and limit the court in determining the child\u2019s best interest. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-323 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d); <em>Rashawn, </em>402 Md. at 499, 937 A.2d at 190 (the statutory factors \u201ccircumscribe[ ] the near-boundless discretion that courts have in ordinary custody cases to determine what is in the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d). Section 5-323 enumerates a series of specific factors that a juvenile court must consider in any TPR proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>At the time of the hearing in this case, Section 5-323(b) granted juvenile courts termination authority as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atj\">Authority.\u2014If, after consideration of factors as required in this section, a juvenile court finds by clear and convincing evidence that terminating the rights of a parent is in a child\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court may grant guardianship of the child without consent otherwise required under this subtitle and over the child\u2019s objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">FL \u00a7 5\u2014323(b) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statute thus establishes that, in TPR proceedings, the court\u2019s main concern is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the \u201cchild\u2019s best interests.\u201d Accordingly, the best interests of the child must \u201ctrump[ ] all other considerations.\u201d <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship of Ta\u2019Niya C., </em>417 Md. 90, 111, 8 A.3d 745, 758 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Here, Ms. F. argues that, in addition to the extensive list of factors crafted by our General Assembly, this Court should adopt a four-factor test that would define \u201c \u2018fitness to parent\u2019 within the parameters of a TPR case.\u201d She submits that this test should be applied before a juvenile court engages in a \u201cbest interests analysis\u201d pursuant to Section 5-323(d). According to Ms. F., termination should only be possible if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">1) ... after being provided with appropriately tailored reunification services, the parent is unable to provide a safe and stable home for the child and that the delay in securing permanency continues or adds to the child\u2019s harm; or 2) [if] the parent has consistently failed to comply with an appropriately structured service agreement offered by the Department for a period of longer than one year; and 3) ... all alternatives to termination have been exhausted, and; 4) ... termination will not do more harm than good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Ms. F. goes on to apply this proposed test to her own situation, in claiming that her parental rights should not be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In considering the particulars of Ms. F\u2019s proposal, we find substantial overlap between the test Ms. F. suggests and the existing statutory factors, although her test recasts the analysis so that it seems to impermissibly favor the parent\u2019s best interests over those of the child. Ms. F.\u2019s first proposed factor, which seems to stand on its own, would allow termination if a court found that \u201cafter being provided with appropriately tailored reunification services, the parent is unable to provide a safe and stable home for the child and that the delay in securing permanency continues or adds to the child\u2019s harm[.]\u201d This consideration, however, is addressed in subsections 5-323(d)(l) and (d)(2), which require a juvenile court to consider the reunification services offered to a parent as well as the parent\u2019s effort in altering his or her circumstances so that returning the child to the parent is in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 5-323(d)(l)-(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The second proposed factor, that \u201cthe parent has consistently failed to comply with [service agreements] for ... longer than one year[,]\u201d is largely reflected in Section 5-323(d)(l)(iii), which requires a court to consider the extent to which a parent has complied with such agreements. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 5-323(d)(l)(iii). Yet Ms. F.\u2019s second factor diverges from the statute by imposing upon juvenile courts an arbitrary one year minimum of noncompliance before termination is permitted. She does not cite to any authority to support her one year restriction, nor can we find any in FL \u00a7 5-323 or our relevant caselaw. Although many TPR eases involve lengthy periods of non-compliance, for a year or more,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is axiomatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>that the issues in CINA cases \u201care very often fact-intensive.\u201d <em>In re Emileigh F., </em>353 Md. 30, 42, 724 A.2d 639, 645 (1999). Thus, \u201ctrial courts are endowed with great discretion in making decisions concerning the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 469, 648 A.2d 1016, 1023 (1994). We see no reason to limit that discretion simply to formulate a test with a specific time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Ms. F.\u2019s final two factors are quite general in scope. Factor number three would require a court to find that \u201call alternatives to termination have been exhausted[,]\u201d while the fourth factor demands that \u201ctermination will not do more harm than good.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ms. F. expresses concern that courts often fast track termination proceedings in the belief that achieving permanency as soon as possible is always in the child\u2019s best interests. As evidence, she cites to a Harvard Law Review article in which the author opines that this trend followed the federal enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (\u201cASFA\u201d), which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">readily embrac[es] the idea that family preservation may not be in the best interest of a ehild[, and] emphasizes \u2018freeing\u2019 children for adoption by terminating the rights of abusive or neglectful parents. ASFA favors adoption because ... it perceives adoption\u2014correctly or not\u2014as a quicker route to stability for children in many cases, and therefore as an option that satisfies a key assumption of the Act: that making earlier permanency decisions for long-term placement is always in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>Developments in the Law: VI. Unified Family Courts and the Child Protection Dilemma, </em>116 Harv. L.Rev.2099, 2101 (2003). The commentator advocates for the Uniform Family Court model, which \u201capproaches family law adjudication from a therapeutic perspective that envisions courts contributing to the goal of preserving families.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2099-2100.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Contrary to Ms. F.\u2019s assertion, however, preservation of parental rights is a primary concern for juvenile courts. Indeed, in Maryland, there is a \u201cstrong presumption that the child\u2019s best interests 'are served by maintaining parental rights.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. J9610436, </em>368 Md. 666, 692-93, 796 A.2d 778, 793 (2002). <em>Cf. </em>FL \u00a7 5-323(d)(4)(iv) (requiring a juvenile court to consider the likely impact of terminating parental rights on a child\u2019s well-being). This presumption was immortalized in <em>Rashawn, </em>where this Court directed juvenile courts to carefully consider the interests of both parents and children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">The court\u2019s role in TPR cases is to give the most careful consideration to the relevant statutory factors, to make specific findings based on the evidence with respect to each of them, and, mindful of the presumption favoring a continuation of the parental relationship, determine expressly whether those findings suffice either to show an unfitness on the part of the parent to remain in a parental relationship with the child or to constitute an exceptional circumstance that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interest of the child, and, if so, how. If the court does that\u2014articulates its conclusion as to the best interest of the child in that manner\u2014the parental rights we have recognized and the statutory basis for terminating those rights are in proper and harmonious balance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\"><em>Rashawn, </em>402 Md. at 501, 937 A.2d at 192 (emphasis added). Accordingly, a juvenile court must faithfully examine each statutory factor, and cannot simply proceed under the assumption that \u201cfreeing a child for adoption\u201d is inherently better than keeping the child in foster care and maintaining parental rights. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship No. T97036005, </em>358 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Md. 1, 23, 746 A.2d 379, 391 (2000) (reversing juvenile court\u2019s judgment to terminate parental rights where the Court could \u201conly speculate whether the required factors were considered.\u201d); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062/CAD, </em>116 Md.App. 443, 457, 696 A.2d 1102, 1108 (1997) (\u201cSo important are these statutory considerations that, on review, [the Court] cannot be left to speculate as to whether the trial court has fulfilled its obligations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Ultimately, it is clear that the General Assembly\u2019s extensive list of factors, when considered in the light of the standing presumption favoring parental rights, reflect the spirit that termination is an alternative of last resort, and is not to be taken lightly. Thus, we conclude that to the extent that Ms. F.\u2019s test is designed to protect parental rights, those rights are adequately guarded by Section 5-323 of the Family Law Article. Accordingly, we reject her recommendation, and instead shall analyze the juvenile court\u2019s ruling for compliance with Section 5-323 as it is written.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\n<em>B. The Evidence of Ms. F.\u2019s Unfitness and Section 5-323</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ApW\">In assessing whether Ms. F.\u2019s parental rights should be terminated, the juvenile court made the following findings with respect to each of the applicable statutory provisions contained within Section 5-323(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u2022 The Department had \u201cadequately presented the referrals\u201d to Ms. F., who did not adequately respond to the referrals. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014323(d)(l)(iii). Ms. F. provided \u201cconflicting\u201d testimony as to how long she had been clean from drugs, and had not provided the Department, or the court, with any proof that she had completed drug treatment. Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>garding housing, the only documentation that she provided to the court was \u201can unsigned copy of a settlement statement, which [did] not contain her name on it.\u201d Moreover, with respect to Ms. F.\u2019s cleaning business (\u201cCathy\u2019s Spic &amp; Span Cleaning Services\u201d) the only documentary evidence was one type-written invoice from October 2008 \u201cthat ha[d] no verification except for [Ms. F.\u2019s] testimony that [it was] a bill she submitted.\u201d Finally, Ms. F. has \u201cmade a stab at participating [in parenting classes], but she ha[d] not since completed one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u2022 Ms. F. had made positive efforts to maintain contact with the Children, adjust her circumstances to facilitate the Children\u2019s return, and communicate with the Department. Yet, Ms. F. had \u201cfailed to live up to her commitments under the ... service agreements\u201d and there had been \u201climited to no contact\u201d between Ms. F. and the Fas. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 5-323(d)(2), (d)(2)(i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u2022 Ms. F. had been paying $150 per month in child support, as required by court order. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 5-323(d)(2)(ii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">\u2022 There was insufficient evidence to show that extending the eighteen month period allowed for \u201cparental adjustment\u201d would be in the best interests of the Children. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 5-323(d)(2)(iv).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u2022 There was no evidence that Ms. F. had abused the Children, chronically or otherwise, nor that she had subjected the children to sexual abuse or torture; there was, however, evidence of neglect, including life-threatening neglect. Some of this neglect had served as the basis for the Children\u2019s original CINA adjudications. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7\u00a7 5\u2014 323(d)(3)\u00ae, (d)(3)(iii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u2022 There was no specific evidence that Ms. F. had refused drug treatment, but she had failed to carry out her commitments under the service agreements to enter drug treatment and drug screening. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-323(d)(3)(ii)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">\u2022 There was no evidence of the following: that either of the Children or Ms. F. tested positive for drugs at either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Amber or Mark\u2019s birth; that Ms. F. had committed, aided, or abetted relevant crimes; or that Ms. F. had involuntarily lost parental rights to any of the Children\u2019s siblings. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-323(d)(3)(ii)(l), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(3)(v).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u2022 With regard to the Children\u2019s emotional state, the court examined the state of their ties with Ms. F., the Fas, and each other, as well as how termination of parental rights would affect those connections and the Children\u2019s well-being. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5\u2014323(d)(4). On the whole, the evidence suggested that the Children\u2019s visitation with Ms. F. had been positive, yet the Children experience some anxiety as a result of continued visitation with Ms. F. Additionally, the Children had adjusted well to their new placement, which the court described as a \u201cwarm and loving home in which [the Children] refer to the foster parents as Mom and Dad or Mommy and Daddy.\u201d Amber\u2019s level of performance in kindergarten was additional evidence of a \u201cgood adjustment to the placement....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">After analyzing the relevant statutory factors, the court turned its attention to the presumption that it was in the Children\u2019s best interests to maintain Ms. F.\u2019s parental rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajz\">[W]e turn now to [the] substantive presumption of law, ... that it is in the best interest to remain in the care and custody of their parents. And the issue is whether ... that presumption has been overcome by clear and convincing evidence showing either that the parent is unfit or that exceptional circumstances exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The court found the evidence clear and convincing that Ms. F. had a longstanding substance abuse problem, one that she had yet to overcome, and thus she was an unfit mother.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ingly, the court concluded that its was in the Children\u2019s best interests to terminate Ms. F.\u2019s parental rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">On appeal, Ms. F. argues that \u201cthe evidence was insufficient\u201d to support the court\u2019s finding of parental unfitness. We disagree, and hold that the court\u2019s findings are supported by testimonial and documentary evidence. According to the juvenile court, Ms. F.\u2019s problems with substance abuse was \u201c[t]he key issue\u201d as to her parental unfitness. The court noted her long history of illegal drug use (benzodiazepines and heroin, in particular), and it found that, despite being given numerous referrals for drug treatment, Ms. F. \u201cha[d] not responded adequately to those referrals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">This finding is supported by Ms. F.\u2019s own admission of heroin use in the past, and the fact that Ms. F. never provided the Department or the court -with any proof of her recovery. She did not produce any verifying information about her claimed participation in a Narcotics Anonymous program, nor did she admit into evidence any proof that she had submitted to drug testing. Instead, she provided inconsistent testimony about how long she had been free from drugs, saying first that she had been clean since 2006 and was \u201ccoming up on two years clean[,]\u201d and then changing that to 2005 and \u201cthree years\u201d clean on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Moreover, Ms. F. failed to abide by the conditions of numerous service agreements which she entered into with the Department. This was established by six different case plans submitted into evidence which stated that, for over a year, \u201cMother ha[d] not met the terms of her service agreement.\u201d Once again, Ms. F. did not produce any evidence to rebut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>these assertions. Indeed, with regard to the condition that she attend parenting classes, Ms. F. even testified that she attended only three classes out of the requisite twelve before making the unilateral decision that they were unnecessary because they taught her \u201cthe same exact thing\u201d that she learned in her prior parenting classes. Overall, Ms. F.\u2019s uncooperative attitude signaled to the court that \u201cthere [was] not enough evidence of hope\u201d for a change in the future. Ultimately, we see no error in the juvenile court\u2019s assessment that this evidence was clear and convincing as to Ms. F.\u2019s unwillingness to alter her previously unfit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Finally, the court\u2019s findings specific to the Children\u2019s emotional state and its conclusion that \u201c[t]he likely impact of terminating parental rights on the child\u2019s well being is that [the placement] will continue to be a stable home environment .... [because the] children ha[d] adjusted to the placement\u201d is supported by the testimony of two social workers. Both Okafor and Smith testified about the Children\u2019s emotional attachment to the Fas and the emotional strain caused by visits with Ms. F. Additionally, Ms. F. admitted that her children had referred to her as \u201cMs. [C]athy\u201d instead of \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cmother,\u201d and that she had to correct them. In a TPR case, we must treat the juvenile court\u2019s evaluation of witness testimony and evidence with the greatest respect. <em>See Cecil County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Svcs. v. Goodyear, </em>263 Md. 611, 622, 284 A.2d 426, 431 (1971) (holding, in a TPR case, that where the record showed enough evidence to support a trial court\u2019s findings, \u201cthe greatest respect must be accorded the opportunity [it] had to [observe] the witnessesf.]\u201d). Here, Ms. F. offers no counter to the juvenile court\u2019s finding, and presents no reason why we should not credit its determinations with respect to the Children\u2019s emotional states. Consequently, we can find no clear error in the juvenile court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\n<em>C. Burden Of Persuasion/Burden Of Production</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Closely intertwined with her assertion that the juvenile court lacked sufficient evidence to find parental unfitness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Ms. F. also contends that the juvenile court inappropriately shifted to her the burden of proving her sobriety, employment, and home ownership, rather than requiring the Department to prove its allegations through clear and convincing evidence. Ms. F.\u2019s argument, however, fails to apprehend the distinction between the two components of \u201cburden of proof:\u201d the burden of persuasion and the burden of production. <em>See Montgomery County Fire Bd. v. Fisher, </em>298 Md. 245, 256, 468 A.2d 625, 630-31 (1983) (discussing the two components). <em>See generally </em>Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 400-02 (4th ed. 2010). The burden of persuasion establishes the degree of evidence that must be presented\u2014in this case, clear and convincing\u2014in order for any given issue to be proven to the trier of fact. <em>See Wills v. State, </em>329 Md. 370, 373-74, 620 A.2d 295, 296 (1993) (describing the different standards of proof, including \u201cclear and convincing\u201d). A party that bears the burden of production on any issue, however, merely bears the burden of \u201cgoing forward with the evidence ... [which] is usually cast first upon the party who has pleaded the existence of the fact, but ... may shift to the adversary when the pleader has discharged his initial duty.\u201d <em>Kassap v. Seitz, </em>315 Md. 155, 162, 553 A.2d 714, 717 (1989) <em>(quoting Commodities Reserve Corp. v. Belt\u2019s Wharf, </em>310 Md. 365, 368 n. 2, 529 A.2d 822, 823 n. 2 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The distinction between these two concepts is critical. To be sure, the Department bore the burden of persuading the juvenile court of Ms. F.\u2019s unfitness as a parent, through the presentation of clear and convincing evidence, and any component of that unfitness was subject to that same standard. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-323(b). Once the Department had presented evidence on this issue to the juvenile court, however, the judge could decide that burden of <em>producing </em>relevant evidence shifted to Ms. F. Quoting evidence scholar Dean McCormick, this Court explained in <em>Commodities Reserve,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">One burden is that of producing evidence, satisfactory to the judge, of a particular fact in issue. The second is the burden of persuading the trier of fact that the alleged fact is true. The burden of producing evidence on an issue means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the liability to an adverse ruling (generally a finding or directed verdict) if evidence on the issue has not been produced</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><em>Commodities Reserve, </em>310 Md. at 368 n. <em>2, 529 </em>A.2d at 823 n. 2. In this case, the Department had the burden of producing evidence that Ms. F. was addicted to illegal drugs. To meet that burden, it offered proof of her undisputed history of addiction. The trial judge was satisfied that this evidence showing a history of addiction was sufficiently strong to infer that, in the absence of credible evidence to the contrary, the addiction problem continued. This is a classic example of how the burden of production can operate. The Department met the burden of production in a way satisfactory to the judge, thereby shifting the burden of production to Ms. F., which meant that she risked \u201cthe liability to an adverse ruling (generally a finding or directed verdict) if evidence on the issue has not been produced.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The trial court\u2019s finding that the Department\u2019s evidence was sufficient to meet its burden of production on the issue of Ms. F\u2019s addition was reasonable. Unquestionably, parental drug use can negatively impact a child.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See In the Interest of J.A., </em>286 Ga.App. 704, 649 S.E.2d 882, 885 (2007) (\u201c[I]t is a fair inference that use of controlled substances by a parent has an adverse effect on a minor child.\u201d); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Steve Baron, <em>Issue Facing Family Courts: The Scope of Family Court Intervention, </em>4 J. Center for Fam. Child. &amp; Cts. 115, 121 (2003) (\u201cSeveral studies indicate that past, as well as current, parental substance abuse increases the risk of child abuse.\u201d). Moreover, given the well-known difficulty of overcoming drug addiction, and the likelihood that addiction will persist if untreated, a court can infer that a parent will continue to abuse drugs unless he or she seeks treatment. <em>See Adoption of Scott, </em>59 Mass.App.Ct. 274, 795 N.E.2d 588, 589 n. 3 (2003) (mother deemed unfit, in part, because she \u201cdemonstrated a history of drug addiction which [was] reasonably likely to continue ... given her resistance to cooperate with needed treatment^]\u201d); <em>Adoption of Elena, </em>446 Mass. 24, 841 N.E.2d 252, 258 (2006) (\u201cA condition which is reasonably likely to continue for a prolonged indeterminate period, such as ... drug addiction[,] ... is not a temporary condition.\u201d). This inference can shift to the parent the burden to produce evidence of sobriety, and if no such evidence is produced, the inference may satisfy the clear and convincing evidence standard. <em>Cf. In the Interest of J.A., </em>649 S.E.2d at 885 (\u201c[E]vidence of the father\u2019s continued failure to seek drug treatment, [along with other factors,] is sufficient clear and convincing evidence to support ... the conclusion that ... parental rights [should be] terminated[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Although the burden of <em>production </em>may have shifted to Ms. F., the burden of <em>persuasion </em>remained with the Department. That is, Ms. F. would not have been required to generate enough evidence demonstrating her sobriety, employment, or home ownership to meet the clear and convincing standard, or indeed any standard of persuasion at all. With respect to her sobriety\u2014the key issue\u2014Ms. F. was uniquely situated to produce this evidence. Without hourly monitoring of her comings and goings, the Department could not prove the negative fact that she had not abstained from substance abuse, or had not been through the necessary rehabilitation to conquer the addiction. Yet, Ms. F. would not furnish the Department or the court with any evidence that she had attended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>drug treatment or had submitted to drug testing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court found that Ms. F.\u2019s unwillingness to share her self-proclaimed drug successes with the Department \u201cdefie[d] understanding.\u201d We see no error in this assessment. <em>See May v. May, </em>829 S.W.2d 373, 378 (Tex.App.1992) (father denied custody of his children because \u201c[a]side from his testimony that he had been \u2018clean and straight for the last two years,\u2019 there was no evidence that [he] had rehabilitated or that future drug use is unlikely.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Further, the only documentation supporting Ms. F.\u2019s assertion that she had fulfilled her housing requirement was an unsigned copy of a settlement statement that did not even contain her name. Regarding Ms. F.\u2019s employment, the girlfriend of her nephew testified that she had helped Ms. F. \u201cwrite stuff down\u201d for Cathy\u2019s Spic &amp; Span Cleaning Services, but admitted that she had never traveled with Ms. F. to a job site. The only physical evidence to corroborate the testimony was \u201cone type-written invoice dated October 3, 2008, that ha[d] no verification except for [Ms. F.\u2019s] testimony that that [was] a bill she submitted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Once again, there was no error in the court\u2019s unwillingness to credit this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">We hold that the existing statutory scheme is appropriate in evaluating parental fitness for the purposes of terminating parental rights. Moreover, the juvenile court here did not inappropriately shift a burden of proof to Ms. F. with respect to demonstrating her compliance with the required drug treatment program, nor did the court commit clear error in making its factual findings. Accordingly, the court did not err in determining that Ms. F. was an unfit parent within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>definition of Section 5-323, or that it was in the Children\u2019s best interests to terminate Ms. F.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
