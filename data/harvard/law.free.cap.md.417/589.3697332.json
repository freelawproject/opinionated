Although it was observed early-on, regarding a predecessor version of Rule 4-215, that \u201c[t]he wording of the Rule is so simple and plain that no elaboration thereof is necessary or desirable .... [t]he Rule means just what it says.... [,]\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>220 Md. 180, 181, 151 A.2d 721, 721 (1959), the plethora of cases that we and the Court of Special Appeals have decided subsequently interpreting the wording and application of the Rule render those earlier words a failed prophecy. <em>See Garner v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 122, 127, 960 A.2d 649, 651 (2008), <em>aff'd, </em>414 Md. 372, 995 A.2d 694 (2010) (\u201cFor a judge to traverse Rule 4-215 is to walk through a minefield. A miracle might bring one across unscathed. For mere mortals, the course will seldom be survived.\u201d). In somewhat of a twist, today, we visit Rule 4-215, not to construe or interpret the text of the rule so much, but rather to compare it to the text of its predecessor in order to determine what, if any, effect that language\u2014absent from the current Rule\u2014has on the continuing efficacy of our reasoning in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 394 A.2d 1190 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The State appeals here from the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversing Constance Walker\u2019s conviction in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for second-degree assault. The intermediate appellate court held\u2014relying on <em>Thompson, </em>supra\u2014that the trial court erred in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>that Walker waived her right to counsel under Md. Rule 4-215(b) when, after she explained that she was denied representation by the Office of the Public Defender (\u201cOPD\u201d), but could not afford private counsel, the trial court failed to inquire further as to whether she may be entitled to court-appointed counsel by reason of indigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The State argues that <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>mandate\u2014that a trial court, upon learning that a defendant was denied representation by the OPD (presumably on a lack of indigency basis), should conduct an independent indigency inquiry to determine if the defendant is eligible for court-appointed counsel\u2014was predicated on the terms of former Maryland Rule 723, which provided expressly that the trial court should \u201c[ajdvise the Defendant that if the Public Defender declines to provide representation, the defendant should immediately notify the clerk of the court so that the court can determine whether it should appoint counsel____\u201d Former Md. Rule 723(b)(6). Because that language is absent from the current version of the Rule (4-215) (which was in force at the operative time in Walker\u2019s case), and Md. Rule 4-202 requires currently (as it did at the operative time in Walker\u2019s case) that the charging document in a circuit court case inform the defendant in a criminal case that \u201c[i]f you want a lawyer but you cannot get one and the Public Defender will not provide one for you, contact the court clerk as soon as possible,\u201d Md. Rule 4-202(a)(7), the State argues that \u201cbecause Walker failed to request that the trial court conduct an independent inquiry as to whether or not she was in fact indigent (and thus entitled to court appointed counsel), the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that the trial court committed reversible error because it did not conduct such an inquiry.\u201d We hold, as explained more fully <em>infra, </em>that <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>compelled indigency inquiry is not predicated upon when (or how) the defendant finds out that court-appointed counsel is a constitutional entitlement for him or her <em>(i.e. </em>at trial, as required under Former Md. Rule 723(b)(6), or in the charging document, as the State claims is required under current Md. Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>4-202(a)(7)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), and, thus, the rule changes effectuated since <em>Thompson </em>do not affect the present application of <em>Thompson. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We adopt the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s succinct rendition of the contextual and specifically relevant facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, it was established that on March 17, 2008, [Walker] repeatedly hit Tahlene Shipley and bit her on the cheek when the two became involved in a disagreement. The disagreement concerned money that [Walker] allegedly owed for construction work performed by Ms. Shipley\u2019s husband. [Walker] was charged that same day with second-degree assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">On May 20, 2008, [Walker] appeared in District Court and prayed a jury trial. Her case was transferred to the Circuit Court and trial was scheduled for June 6, 2008. On that date, [Walker] appeared without counsel. The case was postponed because no jury was available. Trial was rescheduled for July 16. On that date, [Walker] again appeared for trial without counsel and the following colloquy occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">THE COURT: Ma\u2019am, have you received a copy of the charging document in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">THE COURT: Do you understand you have a right to be represented by an attorney at every stage of these proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-13\">THE COURT: Do you also understand that you\u2019ve been charged with second-degree assault? That carries a possible penalty of ten years and/or a $ 2500 fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apx\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-14\">THE COURT: An attorney can be of important help to you in determining whether or not there may be defenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>to the charges or circumstances in mitigation thereof, and in preparing for and representing you at the trial of these charges. Even if you wanted to plead guilty, an attorney could be of substantial help in developing and presenting information which could affect the sentence or other disposition. If you cannot afford to hire an attorney, you could apply to the Public Defender\u2019s [OJffice. It\u2019s a little late to do that, unless you\u2019re granted a postponement by the administrative judge. And you\u2019ve already been notified by other judges that if you appeared for trial without an attorney, that could be construed as a waiver of your right to an attorney by showing up without one or refusing to make a timely application. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">THE COURT: Have you applied to the Public Defender\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">THE COURT: When did you apply to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">[WALKER]: Right after the incident. It was within a few days of the incident, but they said I wasn\u2019t eligible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkA\">THE COURT: So you applied back in March of this year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">[WALKER]: Uh-huh. March or first week in April or end of March.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">THE COURT: Have you sought the services of a private attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">THE COURT: Do you want to proceed without an attorney at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-14\">[WALKER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-15\">THE COURT: Okay. You don\u2019t want to ask for a postponement to get one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-16\">[WALKER]: Can\u2019t afford it.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">[Walker] proceeded to trial <em>pro se. </em>As related above, she was ultimately convicted of second-degree assault and the court imposed a sentence of incarceration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><em>Walker, </em>190 Md.App. at 579-82, 989 A.2d at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Walker appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, <em>Walker v. State, </em>190 Md.App. 577, 989 A.2d 785 (2010), reversed Walker\u2019s conviction, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">[T]here is no evidence that in adopting Rule 4-202(a)(6)-(7) [\u201cCharging document\u2014Content\u201d], the Court of Appeals was shifting the responsibility from informing a defendant of his constitutionally protected right to counsel from an oral advisement from the trial court to a written advisement stated in the midst of a charging document. Our research of the Rules Committee Meeting minutes regarding the changes to the rules in 1984 reveals that there was no discussion regarding the intent or effect of the change wrought by placing in the rules the requirement that an accused be advised of his right to court-appointed counsel in the charging documents. Second, <em>Davis [v. State, </em>100 Md. App. 369, 641 A.2d 941 (1994) ], which affirmed the holding of <em>Baldwin [v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 538, 444 A.2d 1058 (1982) ], was decided in 1994, ten years after the 1984 rule change. Interestingly, the State does not address this point. Third, we note that the Court of Appeals has adopted a low tolerance for any erosion of a defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">It is hard to imagine, in light of the above, that the Court of Appeals would shift notice of the right to court-appointed counsel from a finding by the trial court to a written provision stated in the midst of a charging document. Although appellant was informed of her right to have court-appointed counsel in her charging documents when she first appeared in District Court, we do not think that suffices to ensure a defendant his or her constitutional right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Walker; 190 Md.App. at 598-94, 989 A.2d at 794. The State filed timely a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted, <em>State v. Walker, </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010), to consider whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">the lower court improperly expand[ed] this Court\u2019s limited holding in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113 [394 A.2d 1190] (1978), when it found that a trial court must conduct an independent indigence inquiry even though a defendant has neither (1) applied to the clerk of the court prior to trial for appointed counsel as set forth in Rule 4-202(a) nor (2) requested at trial that the trial court appoint counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">At bottom, the State asserts that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cimproperly expanded this Court\u2019s limited holding in <em>Thompson </em>\u2014 \u201d It is well settled that where a case \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of Maryland ... case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a [non-deferential] standard of review.\u201d <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175,184 (2006); <em>see Ali v. CIT Tech. Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>416 Md. 249, 257, 6 A.3d 890, 894 (2010). Further, to the extent that the State argues that the current Maryland Rules require a result different from that reached by the Court of Special Appeals, we note that \u201c[b]ecause our interpretation of ... the Maryland Rules [is] appropriately classified as [a] question[ ] of law, we review the issues [without deference to the lower courts\u2019 decisions] to determine if the trial court was legally correct in its rulings on these matters.\u201d <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 80-81 (2004); <em>see Owens v. State, </em>399 Md. 388, 402-03, 924 A.2d 1072, 1080 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Judge Irving Levine, writing in 1975 for this Court in <em>State v. Renshaw, </em>276 Md. 259, 347 A.2d 219 (1975), summarized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>aptly the right of a defendant in a criminal case to the assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u2018[ijn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u2019 The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the same right to the assistance of counsel, including the right to the appointment of counsel in the case of the indigent defendant, in state criminal prosecutions ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">Central to the cases dealing with the right to counsel is the recognition that the assistance of a lawyer is essential to assure a fair trial....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">Consequently, because \u2018[ejssential fairness is lacking if an accused cannot put his case effectively in court,\u2019 ... and because it is unlikely that an accused will be able to present his case effectively without the assistance of counsel, a conviction cannot be allowed to stand where the accused is not represented at trial by counsel unless it be determined that there was an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused.... To assure protection of so fundamental a right, courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver, ... and do not permit waiver to be presumed from a silent record.... It must appear affirmatively on the record that the accused was offered counsel but intelligently and under standingly rejected the offer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">As the Court of Special Appeals explained in its opinion in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">Pursuant to Maryland law, two options are available to defendants in criminal cases who are financially unable to retain their own counsel. The defendant may seek representation from the Public Defender\u2019s Office. Section 16-210(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article of the Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.) provides that \u201c[a]n individual may apply for services of the Office as an indigent individual, if the individual states in writing under oath or affirmation that the individual, without undue financial hardship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>cannot provide the full payment of an attorney[.]\u201d Eligibility for Office of the Public Defender\u2019s services shall be determined by the need of the applicant, which \u201cshall be measured according to the financial ability of the applicant to engage and compensate a competent private attorney and to provide all other necessary expenses of representation.\u201d Section 16\u2014210(b)(1)\u2014(2). The statute lists six factors in determining an applicant\u2019s financial ability: (1) the nature, extent, and liquidity of assets; (2) the disposable net income of the applicant; (3) the nature of the offense; (4) the length and complexity of the proceedings; (5) the effort and skill required to gather pertinent information; and (6) any other foreseeable expense. Section 16-210(b)(3)(i)-(vi).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Additionally, defendants may seek representation from a court-appointed attorney. C.P. \u00a7 16-213 provides that \u201c[t]his subtitle does not prohibit the appointment of an attorney to represent an indigent individual by the District Court, a circuit court, or the Court of Special Appeals if ... the Office declines to provide representation to an indigent individual entitled to representation under this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae_\"><em>Walker, </em>190 Md.App. at 585, 989 A.2d at 789. As tools with which to implement and protect the right to counsel\u2014deemed a \u201cfundamental constitutional protection,\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>355 Md. 420, 442, 735 A.2d 1003, 1015 (1999)\u2014this Court adopted Rule 4-215 and its immediate predecessor, Rule 723. <em>See Johnson, </em>355 Md. at 444, 735 A.2d at 1016 (\u201cMaryland Rule 4-215 ... implements the constitutional mandates for waiver of counsel----\u201d); <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 130, 406 A.2d 98, 102 (1979) (\u201cRule 723 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure implements the constitutional mandates for waiver of counsel.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">A. Looking to the Past</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Former Md. Rule 723, entitled \u201cAppearance\u2014Provision for or Waiver of Counsel,\u201d adopted by this Court on 31 January 1977, became effective on 1 July 1977.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section (b) of Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>723, entitled \u201cAppearance Without Counsel,\u201d provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">When a defendant appears ... and is not represented by counsel, the court shall: ... 6. Advise the defendant that if the Public Defender declines to provide representation, the defendant should immediately notify the clerk of the court so that the court can determine whether it should appoint counsel pursuant to Article 27A, section 6(f), of the Maryland Code....[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Further, Section (c) of the Rule, entitled \u201cWaiver Inquiry,\u201d provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cWhen a defendant indicates a desire or inclination to waive counsel, the court may not accept the waiver until it determines, after appropriate questioning on the record in open court, that the defendant possesses the intelligence and capacity to appreciate the consequences of his decision, and fully comprehends: ... 4. That if the defendant is found to be financially unable to retain private counsel, the Public Defender or the court would, if the defendant wishes, provide counsel to represent him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">In <em>Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 114, 394 A.2d at 1191, we discussed the duties imposed on a trial court, when informed that the defendant in a criminal case has been denied representation by the OPD for lack of indigency, before that court may determine that the defendant waived his or her constitutional right to counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court explained that, considering Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>728(b)(6) required the trial court to \u201c[ajdvise the defendant that if the Public Defender declines to provide representation, the defendant should immediately notify the clerk of the court <em>so that the court can determine whether it should appoint counsel\u201d </em>and Rule 723(c) required the trial court to be assured that the defendant \u201cfully comprehends\u201d that if he or she \u201cis found financially unable to retain private counsel, the Public Defender or the court would, if the defendant wishes, provide counsel to represent him,\u201d \u201cthere is the clear duty imposed on the court, in order to decide whether it should appoint counsel, upon the Public Defender declining to do so, to make its own independent determination whether a defendant is indigent and otherwise eligible to have counsel provided.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 128-29, 394 A.2d at 1198 (emphasis added); <em>see Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 130, 394 A.2d at 1199 (\u201c[I]f Thompson were indigent and otherwise entitled to assistance of counsel, the law, implemented by statute and our rules of procedure, required the court to appoint an attorney when the Office of the Public Defender declined to provide counsel. The failure of the court to determine whether Thompson was eligible to have counsel provided was reversible error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">B. Looking at the Present</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">A Rules Order, dated 6 April 1984, (among other things) rescinded all of the then extant Rules of Chapter 700 of the Rules of Procedure and substituted new Rules in their place. Of particular import to this case are Rules 4-215 and 4-202. Rule 4-215 provides currently that the right to counsel may be deemed waived under (b), if, pursuant to (a), the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">(1) Make[s] certain that the defendant has received a copy of the charging document containing notice as to the right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>(2) Inform[s] the defendant of the right to counsel and of the importance of assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">(3) Advise[s] the defendant of the nature of the charges in the charging document, and the allowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">(5) If the trial is to be conducted on a subsequent date, advise[s] the defendant that if the defendant appears for trial without counsel, the court could determine that the defendant waived counsel and proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Further, pursuant to (b), \u201cthe court may not accept the waiver until after an examination of the defendant on the record conducted by the court, ... the court determines and announces on the record that the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel.\u201d Importantly, Rule 4-215\u2014Rule 723\u2019s successor\u2014no longer requires the trial court to \u201c[a]dvise the Defendant that if the Public Defender declines to provide representation, the defendant should immediately notify the clerk of the court so that the court can determine whether it should appoint counsel ....\u201d; nor must it, before accepting a defendant\u2019s waiver, determine that the defendant comprehends \u201c[t]hat if the defendant is found to be financially unable to retain private counsel, the Public Defender or the court would, if the defendant wishes, provide counsel to represent him.\u201d <em>See </em>Letter from Criminal Rules Subcommittee to Rules Committee Members (2 June 1982) [hereinafter \u201cCriminal Rules Subcommittee Letter\u201d] (\u201cThe other laundry lists of actions to be taken by the court have been eliminated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The same Rules Order substituted Rule 4-202 (\u201cCharging document\u2014Content\u201d) for its predecessor, former Rule 711. Of import to the present case, Rule 4-202(a)(7) added language not found previously in Rule 711; namely, the requirement that the charging document in a circuit court criminal case inform a defendant that \u201c[i]f you want a lawyer but you cannot get one and the Public Defender will not provide one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>for you, contact the court clerk as soon as possible.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Rules Committee\u2019s notes to the pertinent Rules Order reveal that \u201c[t]he committee [wa]s aware that the consolidated rule ehminates several specific requirements for notice or advice to the defendant of his rights in regard to counsel. It was the intent of this rule to leave the principal enumeration of the advice concerning counsel to the charging document content rule----\u201d Criminal Rules Subcommittee Letter; <em>see </em>Eighty-Seventh Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Vol. 10 Md. Reg. (9 December 1983) [hereinafter \u201cStanding Committee Report\u201d] (\u201cUnder section (a) of [4-202] the notice to the defendant currently contained on District Court charging documents is made applicable to all charging documents. This printed notice is later relied upon to simplify the waiver inquiry that must be conducted by the court.\u201d).

Since at least 1968, when the Supreme Court decided <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel has been deemed a fundamental right, such that denial of counsel in state courts to indigent defendants in criminal cases is a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Of course, not every defendant may be entitled to representation by the OPD or court-appointed counsel. <em>See Fairbanks v.

While one who understands the history of the implicated Rules may infer reasonably that the Rules Committee, in attempting to make the rules \u201csimpler\u201d and \u201cmore intelligible,\u201d intended this to mean that a defendant should contact the office of the clerk of the court to inquire about court-appointed counsel, this direction notably did not corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>p\u00edete the trip from Highway 723 to Route 4-202.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because nowhere in the charging document does a defendant become aware of his or her right (assuming indigency and despite denial of representation from the OPD) to court-appointed counsel, a defendant cannot \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d waive that right based on reading the charging document alone.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In conclusion, we hold that, under the prevailing constitutional and statutory framework, it is incumbent upon a trial court, upon learning that a defendant in a criminal case has been denied representation by the OPD and who maintains nonetheless an inability to afford to retain private counsel, to conduct its own independent indigency inquiry, in accordance with the statutory criteria,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to determine if the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>entitled to court-appointed counsel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is only when a trial court undertakes this inquiry that it fulfills and discharges its duty as the \u201cultimate protector\u201d of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

We framed our analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">If the necessary inquiry under Rule 4-215(d) was subsidiary to the trial or in no way affected the trial, it could be accomplished by a hearing on remand; if the inquiry was not subsidiary, however, a new trial must be ordered. The key to determining the propriety of the limited remand is whether the required inquiry was so intertwined with the trial that a limited remand could cause the defendant to suffer great prejudice. The controlling factor is not, as the intermediate appellate court stated, whether the error occurred during the trial; it is whether the error adversely affected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\"><em>Mitchell, </em>337 Md. at 517, 654 A.2d at 1313 (internal citations omitted).

Failure to conduct the Rule [4\u2014215](d) inquiry at the proper time, therefore, mandates a new trial. <em>The exact circumstances in the instant case under which the original inquiry should have occurred cannot be recreated, and we cannot require the defendant to meet that burden. </em>The interests of justice simply would not be served by ordering a limited remand in this case.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><em>Mitchell, </em>337 Md. at 518, 654 A.2d at 1313 (emphasis added). The concerns we expressed in <em>Mitchell </em>apply to the present case with equal force. That is, a limited remand for the trial court to conduct an indigency inquiry would require Walker to reconstruct her financial situation from early 2008, the ability of which would depend on Walker\u2019s record-keeping efforts during the pendency of the litigation. While her financial state in 2008 was \u201cstatic,\u201d it may not be readily ascertainable. We cannot say whether this would impose a great burden on Walker, but it could conceivably, and, therefore, we similarly \u201ccannot require [her] to meet that burden.\u201d Accordingly, because \u201cthe error adversely affected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial,\u201d <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>we hold that a limited remand would not be proper in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-15\">. <em>But see infra </em>at 18-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-17\">.
