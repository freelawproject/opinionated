On that same day, this Court ordered that the charges against Respondent \u201cbe heard and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>determined by Judge Vicki Ballou-Watts of the Third Judicial Circuit [ (the Hearing Judge) ], in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757[.]\u201d The Hearing Judge filed \u201cFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\u201d in which she concluded that Respondent violated Rules 1.2, 1.4, 1.15, 8.1, 8.4(a)(b)(c) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC), and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Maryland Code (BO).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent has noted thirteen exceptions to those Findings and Conclusions. For the reasons that follow, this Court overrules every one of Respondent\u2019s exceptions, and concludes that Respondent\u2019s disbarment is required to protect the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">MRPC 1.2, in pertinent part, requires that a lawyer \u201cabide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, [ ] consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.\u201d MRPC 1.4(a)(1) requires that a lawyer inform his or her client of any \u201ccircumstance\u201d that requires the client\u2019s \u201cinformed consent.\u201d MRPC 1.15, in pertinent part, requires that a lawyer comply with the safekeeping and record keeping requirements of Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules when the lawyer is holding funds that have been entrusted to the lawyer by a client. MRPC 8.1(a) prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact \u201cin connection with a disciplinary matter[.]\u201d BO \u00a7 10-306 prohibits a lawyer from using funds entrusted to him or her \u201cfor any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">MRPC 8.4, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The Hearing Judge\u2019s Findings and Conclusions included the following numbered paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">2. On March 12, 2008, Respondent signed an Employment Contract with the law firm of Macey &amp; Aleman, also known as \u201cLegal Helpers, P.C.,\u201d which identified itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Largest Consumer Bankruptcy Firm.\u201d Under the terms of the contract, Respondent was hired to serve as the managing attorney for the firm\u2019s Maryland consumer bankruptcy practice. At the time Respondent was hired, the firm had two offices with three additional employees\u2014an attorney, a law clerk and a receptionist. One office was located in Greenbelt, Maryland. The second office was located in Baltimore, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">4. Respondent\u2019s duties included interviewing prospective bankruptcy clients, providing legal advice regarding consumer bankruptcy matters, preparing and filing bankruptcy petitions, and attending hearings associated with clients\u2019 bankruptcy cases. As the managing attorney for the firm\u2019s Maryland offices, Respondent was also responsible for accounting for all client payments and trustee checks received. He was expected to forward all payments to the firm\u2019s office in Chicago, Illinois on a weekly basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>8. At all relevant times herein, Kevin Van Hout, Esquire was the firm\u2019s regional managing attorney. Shobhanna Katsuri, Esquire was one of the firm\u2019s four partners. Ms. Katsuri\u2019s office was located in Chicago, Illinois. Respondent reported to both attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">11. Evangeline Arcilla attended the June 17, 2008 appointment between Gary Magsalin and Respondent. Mr. Magsalin is Ms. Arcilla\u2019s brother. Ms. Arcilla did not have a scheduled appointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">14. At the time of the June 17, 2008 meeting with Mr. Magsalin, Respondent also discussed with Ms. Arcilla her financial concerns and advised her of her legal rights. Mr. Magsalin encouraged Ms. Arcilla to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">15. On June 17, 2008, Evangeline Arcilla executed a \u201cMacey &amp; Aleman\u2014Chapter 7 Contract.\u201d Respondent signed the contract on behalf of the firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">16. Under the terms of the contract, Ms. Arcilla agreed to pay Macey &amp; Aleman a \u201cflat fee, earned upon receipt, court costs, and optional due diligence product costs ... prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\u201d The contract also states that before filing, Ms. Arcilla \u201cwill provide $299.00 for the filing fee and $274.00 for the due diligence products.\u201d In the contract, these amounts were denoted as costs separate from any attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">17. At the time of the June 17, 2008 meeting, Ms. Arcilla made a $20.00 cash payment to Respondent. The Respondent utilized the firm\u2019s cash receipt book to issue a written receipt to Ms. Arcilla for her $20.00 payment. Ms. Arcilla also gave Respondent a copy of three (3) credit card bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">18. The Respondent signed the receipt, noting that the $20.00 payment was for \u201cRetainer Fees.\u201d Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>also noted that Ms. Arcilla\u2019s balance was $1,454.00. Below the balance due figure on the receipt was written: <em>\u201c[tff (299 </em>\u201d]. Ms. Arcilla\u2019s Chapter 7 contract required payment of $99.00 for filing fees before the bankruptcy petition would be filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">20. During the June 17, 2008 meeting, Respondent gave Ms. Arcilla an envelope addressed to the new Macey &amp; Aleman office location at 809 Glen Eagle\u2019s Court in Towson, Maryland and instructed her to make a check for the balance due. Respondent also instructed Ms. Arcilla to send a note with the check indicating that she was referred to the firm by Mr. Magsalin so that he (Magsalin) would receive a $50.00 credit on the balance of his flat fee to the firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">21. Portia Tidwell, a Towson University student, was employed by the law firm as a legal assistant/office manager from July 2, 2008 through the end of October 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">22. On July 2, Ms. Arcilla issued a check in the amount of $1,454.00 made payable to Macey <em>&amp; </em>Aleman. She also wrote a note stating that she was referred to Respondent by Gary Magsalin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">28. Ms. Arcilla\u2019s check and note arrived at the firm\u2019s Towson office between July 2, 2008 and July 15, 2008. Ms. Tidwell opened the mail and checked the firm\u2019s database for an account under Ms. Arcilla\u2019s name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">24. When Ms. Tidwell was unable to locate Ms. Arcilla\u2019s name in the firm\u2019s database, she presented the check to Respondent. Respondent told Ms. Tidwell that Ms. Arcilla was his client and that he was going to represent her after he left he law firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">25. Respondent applied white out to the check and changed the payee from \u201cMacey <em>&amp; </em>Aleman\u201d to \u2018Walter Elliott, Jr., Esq.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>26. During all relevant times herein, Ms. Arcilla\u2019s telephone contact numbers were: (Home) [ ] and (Cell) [ ]. Telephone records reflect that there were no telephone calls between Respondent and Ms. Arcilla during the time period from July 2, 2008 to July 15, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">27. Respondent testified that upon receipt of the check, he immediately placed a telephone call to Ms. Arcilla. He said that he used the office telephone. According to Respondent, he spoke with Ms. Arcilla, advised her of the mistake and asked if she wanted him to change the payee or return the check to her for reissue in his name. Respondent testified that Ms. Arcilla authorized him to substitute his name as payee. Respondent has acknowledged that he altered the check by using \u201cwhite out\u201d to change payee names.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">28. Ms. Tidwell testified that she was present when Respondent purportedly spoke with Ms. Arcilla. She could not hear what the person on the other end of the call said. However, she testified that when the telephone call ended, she saw Respondent \u201cscratch out\u201d the firm name and insert Respondent\u2019s name on the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">29. The testimony of Respondent and Ms. Tidwell regarding the aforementioned telephone call and Ms. Arcilla\u2019s authorization is not credible. Ms. Arcilla testified that she did not talk to respondent during the relevant time period and did not give him permission to alter her check. A review of the law firm\u2019s certified telephone records (and Respondent\u2019s cell phone records) for the time period from July 2, 2008 through July 15, 2008, show no calls to Ms. Arcilla and thus corroborate her testimony. In addition, Ms. Tidwell\u2019s description of how the check was altered contradicts the description acknowledged by Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">As a result, this court finds that Ms. Arcilla did not authorize Respondent to substitute his name as payee on the aforementioned check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>30. In June, 2008, Respondent complained to Ms. Katsuri and Mr. Van Hout about the high volume of cases and the need for more attorneys, support staff and supplies. They discussed increasing his salary and obtaining more support. However, the only additional employees hired were Ms. Tidwell (July 2, 2008) and an associate attorney who began working for the firm in the latter part of July 2008. Respondent\u2019s salary was not increased. In June, Respondent explored the possibility of starting his own firm or sharing office space with another attorney. In early to mid July 2008, Respondent became \u201cangry\u201d with the firm and decided that he wanted to terminate his employment relationship with the firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">31. On July 15, 2008, Respondent deposited Ms. Arcilla\u2019s check into his personal bank account with USAA Federal Savings Bank [ ]. The bank account did not identify the accountholder as an Attorney at Law or Law Office, nor was it designated as an Attorney Trust Account or Attorney Escrow Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">32. Respondent deposited Ms. Arcilla\u2019s check together with two additional cheeks for a total deposit of $4,484.63. The account balance immediately prior to the July 15, 2008 deposit was $398.26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">33. On August 1, 2008, Respondent transferred $4,384.83 from the USAA Federal Savings Bank Account to another personal bank account with Bank of America. As a result of the transfer, respondent\u2019s remaining balance in the USAA Federal savings Bank account was $500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">34. On August 1, 2008, during a telephone conference call, respondent advised Ms. Katsuri and Mr. Van Hout that he intended to resign. On August 3, 2008, respondent gave the firm the required written sixty (60) day notice of his resignation by email. Respondent continued to work full time as managing attorney for the firm\u2019s Maryland offices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>35. During August 2008, Ms. Arcilla called Respondent several times to discuss the status of her case. Respondent told Ms. Arcilla that he had worked on her case, but that she needed to forward documents to him and take a credit counseling course before the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition could be filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\">36. On August 29, 2008, an Express Mail package from Ms. Arcilla was addressed to Respondent and delivered to the law firm\u2019s Towson office. The package contained documents Respondent had requested in order to process the bankruptcy petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">37. Ms. Arcilla called Respondent again on September 3, 2008, and the two exchanged calls on September 10, 2008 and September 17, 2008. The last telephone conversation between Respondent and Ms. Arcilla occurred on September 17, 2008 for a duration of five (5) minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">38. On September 22,2008, Ms. Arcilla called the law firm\u2019s 800 number to complain about the handling of her case. She had also learned that Respondent was leaving the firm. She subsequently spoke to the firm\u2019s regional managing attorney, Kevin Van Hout, who asked her to forward a copy of the cancelled check, executed contract with the law firm and other papers related to her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">39. On or about September 23, 2008, after speaking with Ms. Arcilla and receiving the documents she provided, Mr. Van Hout confronted Respondent and terminated this employment with the firm. The termination was effective the same day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">40. On September 24, 2008, Respondent obtained a money order in the amount of $1,454.00. He delivered the money order and Ms. Arcilla\u2019s documents to Mr. Van Hout. The money order represents the total amount Respondent collected from Ms. Arcilla in cash on June 17, 2008 and by check in July, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>42. During the Commission investigation of Mr. Van Hout\u2019s complaint, Respondent, through his attorney, advised Bar Counsel that he (Respondent) was in the process of leaving the firm when he met Mr. Magsalin and Ms. Arcilla on June 17, 2008. According to Respondent, he explained to Ms. Arcilla that he would charge her the same flat fee ($1,454.00) that the firm charged Mr. Magsalin. Respondent explained that he \u201cagreed to handle Ms. Arcilla\u2019s matter on his own once he left Macey &amp; Aleman and established his own practice (or affiliated with a new law firm).\u201d He also advised Bar Counsel that after he received the $1,454.00 check in July, he called Ms. Arcilla and received permission to substitute his name on the check made payable to Macey &amp; Aleman. In addition, Respondent told Bar Counsel that \u201con July 3, 2008, prior to receiving the check, [he] called Kevin Van Hout to inform him of his decision to resign.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">43. During the hearing before this court, Respondent testified, in pertinent part, that on June 27, 2008, Ms. Arcilla retained him (not Macey &amp; Aleman) and that he charged her a flat \u201cfee\u201d of $1,454.00 for a Chapter 7 filing. According to Respondent, the fee agreement was better than the amount charged by the law firm because his \u201cfee\u201d <em>included </em>the court filing fees ($299.00). He also testified that although the law firm utilized \u201cBest Case\u201d software to prepare bankruptcy cases, he also owned the same software and used it to prepared Ms. Arcilla\u2019s petition. Respondent testified that he performed work on her Chapter 7 case and completed everything he could by June 25, 2008. According to Respondent, all that remained before filing the petition in court was for Ms. Arcilla to forward the requested documents to his office and complete the required credit counseling course. In addition, as noted, he testified that after he received the $1,454.00 check in July, he called Ms. Arcilla and she authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>him to substitute this name as the payee on the aforementioned check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">44. Respondent never sent to Ms. Arcilla any written confirmation that would support his claim that he (as opposed to the law firm) was retained to handle her Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">45. During the hearing Respondent testified that in June he talked with the law firm\u2019s managing partners and complained about the lack of additional attorneys and support staff as noted under Paragraph 30 herein. In early to mid July, he became \u201cangry\u201d with the firm\u2019s lack of progress in addressing his concerns and decided to leave the firm. However, he did not notify the firm of his intention to resign until August 1, 2008, which is contrary to the representations Respondent made to Bar Counsel during the investigation of Mr. Van Hout\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">(Emphasis in original. Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The Hearing Judge found that Respondent violated MRPC 1.2 in two ways: (1) \u201che failed to abide by Ms. Arcilla\u2019s decision to retain the law firm of Macey &amp; Aleman to represent her in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings!,]\u201d and (2) \u201che took action on Ms. Arcilla\u2019s behalf that she did not authorize when he substituted his name and payee on a check made payable to Macey &amp; Aleman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The Hearing Judge found that Respondent violated MRPC 1.4(a)(1) in two ways: (1) \u201che made a unilateral decision to make Ms. Arcilla his personal client although she had entered into a written agreement to retain the law firm of Macey <em>&amp; </em>Aleman!,]\u201d and (2) he decided \u201cto change the check payee from \u2018Macey <em>&amp; </em>Aleman\u2019 to \u2018Walter Elliott, Jr. Esq.\u2019 without discussing the change and obtaining Ms. Arcilla\u2019s consent!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The Hearing Judge found that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15 in five ways: (1) failing to enter Ms. Arcilla\u2019s name into the firm\u2019s database, (2) failing to record her retainer payment, (3) failing to forward that payment to the firm\u2019s Chicago office, (4) substituting his name as payee on the check that Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Arcilla issued to the firm, and depositing that check in his personal account, and (5) failing to \u201crelinquish the funds [deposited in his personal account] to the firm until after he was confronted by [Mr.] Van Hout.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The Hearing Judge found that Respondent violated MRPC 8.1(a) in two ways: (1) \u201che represented to Bar Counsel that Ms. Arcilla had retained him personally (as opposed to Macey &amp; Aleman) when he knew that Ms. Arcilla had executed a written contract with the law firm and he had signed the same contract on behalf of the law firm[,]\u201d and (2) \u201che misrepresented to Bar Counsel that Ms. Arcilla had authorized him to change the payee on the check issued to the law firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The Hearing Judge found that Respondent violated BO \u00a7 10-306 when he \u201cintentionally breached [his fiduciary] duties and obligations [to Ms. Arcilla and to his employer] by misappropriating funds and placing them in personal accounts for his own use and benefit when he knew the funds belonged to the law firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The Hearing Judge found that Respondent violated Sections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of MRPC 8.4 when he (1) \u201cintentionally took funds belonging to the firm and placed those funds in his personal bank aceount[,]\u201d (2) \u201ccomingled the funds with his own personal funds and later transferred a portion of the funds to another personal bank account ... without the knowledge or consent of the client or the law firm to whom the funds belonged[,]\u201d (3) \u201cfailed to advise the law firm of either payment [made by Ms. Arcilla,]\u201d and (4) \u201cdid not relinquish the funds to the firm until after he as confronted by [Mr.] Van Hout.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The Hearing Judge also found that, although \u201cRespondent has failed to offer any evidence of compelling extenuating circumstances[,]\u201d Respondent established three \u201cmatters of mitigation\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">1.

The Respondent paid the law firm the entire amount he received from Mr. Arcilla ($1,474.00) the day after he was confronted by the firm\u2019s regional managing attorney!;.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\">3. The Respondent\u2019s position with the firm was his first full-time employment as a practicing attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">As stated above, the Respondent has noted thirteen exceptions to the Hearing Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

According to Respondent (in the words of his exception), \u201cit is clear that Respondent honestly believed that Ms. Arcilla had agreed to be his personal client and had authorized him to be paid the fee, and that he had a right to represent her on his own.\u201d There would be merit in this argument only if the Hearing Judge were required to credit the testimony of Respondent and reject the testimony of Ms. Arcilla.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In his eleventh exception, Respondent argues that Petitioner\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish that Respondent violated BO \u00a7 10-306 because Ms. Arcilla\u2019s payment was a \u201cflat fee, earned upon receipt.\u201d The Hearing Judge, however, was not clearly erroneous in finding that Respondent violated this statute when he \u201cintentionally breached [his fiduciary] duties and obligations [to Ms. Arcilla and to his employer] by misappropriating funds and placing them in personal accounts for his own use and benefit when he knew the funds belonged to the law firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Respondent\u2019s twelfth and thirteenth exceptions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\"><em>Exception No. 12. </em>The Respondent excepts to the [Hearing Judge\u2019s] failure to find that Respondent honestly believed that he had made it clear to Ms. Arcilla, prior to depositing her check for legal fees, that he would be leaving the Firm and that he personally, not Macey &amp; Aleman, would be representing her, and that to the extent that Ms. Arcilla disputed this, it was likely the result of an innocent failure on her part to comprehend what [Respondent] told her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>Exception No. 13: </em>The Respondent excepts to the [Hearing Judge\u2019s] failure to find that Respondent did not change the name of the payee of Ms. Arcilla\u2019s check with any improper intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">From our review of the record, however, we reject Respondent\u2019s arguments that (1) \u201c[t]he evidence clearly supports the conclusion that, at worst, there was a misunderstanding between Respondent and Ms. Arcilla, with Ms. Arcilla believing that her check was supposed to be paid to the Firm and [Respondent] believing that she had authorized him to accept the money because he personally would be handling her case while he remained at the Firm and thereafter[,]\u201d and (2) \u201cthe evidence clearly supports a finding that [Respondent] did not act with any improper intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">For the reasons stated above, we overrule each of Respondent\u2019s exceptions, and must determine the appropriate sanction for the violations that have been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">This Court has repeatedly stated \u201cthat each attorney grievance case rests on its own merits.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

They must carefully administer and account for those funds. Appropriating any part of those funds to their own use and benefit without clear authority to do so cannot be tolerated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
