Palmer (\u201cRespondent\u201d), charging him with professional misconduct in violating various provisions of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d), the Maryland Rules, and the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article of the Maryland Code. Specifically, Petitioner charged that Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: 1.1 (competence);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1.15(a), (c) (safekeeping property);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8.4(b), (c), (d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Rule 16-609 (prohibited transactions);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Maryland Code (2000, 2010 Repl.Vol.), Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article, \u00a7 10-306 (misuse of trust money).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-752(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 16-757(c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we referred the case to the Honorable Brett W. Wilson of the Circuit Court for Dorchester County for the conduct of an evidentiary hearing and the preparation of findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law. Judge Wilson conducted the evidentiary hearing on 30 March 2010. He issued his written findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>fact and conclusions of law on 6 May 2010. As we cannot envision a better way for the arc of this case to unfold, we intend to flatter Judge Wilson by relating verbatim here his findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Findings of Fact<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AI6\">A. Respondent\u2019s Background</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Respondent graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1998 and was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 16, 1998. Following graduation, Respondent served as Law Clerk to the Honorable Daniel M. Long, Circuit Court for Somerset County, Maryland, from 1998 until August 1999. Upon the conclusion of his judicial clerkship, Respondent joined the law firm of Ayres, Jenkins, Gordy &amp; Almand, P.A. (\u201cthe Firm\u201d) in Ocean City, Maryland. Respondent was an associate in the Firm from September 1999 until December 2008. Since leaving the Firm, Respondent has continued to provide legal services as a solo practitioner, focusing his work primarily in the area of family law. Respondent also handles criminal cases as a panel attorney for the Office of the Public Defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Respondent married his wife, Stacie, in 2004. The couple has two children, the first born in 2006 and the second born in 2009. In addition to the time Respondent spends with his family, Respondent is also very active in professional and community organizations. Respondent has served on the Board of Directors for Worcester Youth and Family Counseling Services, Inc. since 2000 and became President in September 2008. Respondent has served as Treasurer, Secretary, and, most recently, Vice President of the Worcester County Bar Association. Since 2005, Respondent has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>served as the Circuit Coordinator for the First and Second Circuits of the Maryland State Bar High School Mock Trial Competition. Respondent previously served as the First Circuit Representative in the Young Lawyers Section of the Maryland State Bar Association. Respondent also volunteers in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, conducting settlement conferences in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">B. Finding of Facts Regarding Respondent\u2019s Alleged Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The facts underlying the alleged violations are undisputed. In anticipation of the evidentiary hearing, Petitioner and Respondent stipulated to certain facts which were reduced to writing and admitted into evidence....</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">(1) Misuse of Escrow Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In 2008, the Firm was considering whether to offer Respondent Partner status. As discussed more fully below, Respondent transferred funds belonging to clients Royalton Motor Hotel, LLC, Garrison Smith, and Dennis Bellehumeur from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to the general account and had those funds credited to himself for billing purposes. Respondent made these monetary transfers in order to make it appear that his collected fees were higher than they actually were so as to improve his prospects of being offered a partnership interest in the Firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">When the Firm discovered Respondent\u2019s improper transfer of client funds from the escrow account to the general account, the Firm deposited funds back into the escrow account so that the clients sustained no loss. The Firm adjusted its compensation to Respondent to recover the funds overpaid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">(a) <em>Royalton Motor Hotel, LLC v. Paci\u00f1c Surfwear, Inc., et al.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">On July 18, 2007, Respondent obtained a judgment in favor of his client, Royalton Motor Hotel, LLC, in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, Maryland, in case number 23-C06-001305 CN in the amount of $28,781.97. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>On August 2, 2007, Respondent received $2,000.00 as partial payment of the judgment in factor of Royalton Motor Hotel, LLC and deposited the money in the Firm\u2019s escrow account. Additionally, the Firm received three money orders, each in the amount of $1,000.00, which were received as further payment from the debtor and deposited in the Firm\u2019s escrow account on October 16, 2007. The Firm did not immediately disburse the $5,000.00 collected on behalf of Royalton Motor Hotel, LLC to its client. No explanation was provided for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">On June 30, 2008, Respondent disbursed $5,000.00 from the Firm\u2019s escrow account and deposited those funds in the Firm\u2019s general account. To accomplish this transfer of funds, Respondent wrote escrow check number 17956 payable to the Firm. Respondent referenced an unrelated client file number, ending in the letter \u201cP\u201d, which indicated that the funds pertained to a fee earned in a matter involving a client brought to the Firm by Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">At this time, Respondent received an annual salary of $50,000.00. He also received one-third of all fees generated by clients he brought to the Firm. As a result of Respondent\u2019s transfer of Royalton Motor Hotel, LLC\u2019s $5,000.00 from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its operating account, and his designation of those funds as pertaining to an unrelated client originated by him, Respondent received one-third of the funds ($1,666.50) as part of his compensation from the Firm for June 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">After the Firm discovered that Respondent had improperly transferred these funds to the general account, the Firm returned the $5,000.00 to its escrow account, disbursed $4,000.00 to its client, and paid the proper fee of $1,000.00 to the Firm in December 2008. The Firm adjusted its compensation to Respondent to recover the funds overpaid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">(b) <em>Garrison Smith and Dennis Bellehumeur v. Daniel Troiano</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Respondent also handled a collection case for the Firm\u2019s clients, Garrison Smith and Dennis Bellehumeur. He ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>tained a judgment in the amount $6,023.68. On June 13, 2008, Respondent received $1,000.00 towards the judgment on behalf of Smith and Bellehumeur. At Respondent\u2019s direction, those funds were deposited in the Firm\u2019s escrow account. On July 10, 2008, Respondent received additional payment of $500.00 on account of said judgment. The firm deposited these funds in the Firm\u2019s general account. On July 31, 2008, Respondent received an additional $1,000.00, which was properly deposited in the Firm\u2019s escrow account. On August 21, 2008, Respondent received $500.00 on behalf of Smith and Bellehumeur, which was deposited in the Firm\u2019s general account.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">On September 30, 2008, Respondent wrote a check drawn on the Firm\u2019s escrow account in the amount of $2,000.00, which represented the funds deposited for payment toward judgment on behalf of Smith and Bellehumeur. The check was drawn payable to the Firm and was deposited into the Firm\u2019s operating account. The firm was actually entitled to only $550.00 in fees from Smith and Bellehumeur from the funds collected by Respondent. Respondent\u2019s one-third share should have been $183.33. As a result of the deposit of the funds belonging to Smith and Bellehumeur into <em>the </em>general account, the Firm paid respondent $999.99 instead of $183.33 to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">(2) Misrepresentations Regarding Filing of Complaints and Fabrication of Court Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In addition to misusing clients\u2019 money held in escrow, Respondent also failed to adequately represent three clients: Atlantic Pools <em>&amp; </em>Spas, Inc., the Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, and the Worcester Preparatory School. As more fully discussed below, with respect to these clients, Respondent drafted complaints which he never filed, misrepresented to partners of the Firm that the complaints had been filed, and, in at least one case, fabricated court documents to support his falsehoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The Firm never billed Atlantic Pools &amp; Spas, Inc., the Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, or the Worcester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Preparatory School for work Respondent falsely claimed he had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">(a) <em>Atlantic Pools </em>&lt;fe <em>Spas, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Mark Cropper, a partner in the Firm, assigned Respondent two collections matters to handle for the Firm\u2019s client, Atlantic Pools &amp; Spas, Inc. One matter was against Anthony J. Diver and Jacqueline A. Bradley-Diver (\u201cthe Divers\u201d). The other matter was against Robert and Sharon Anthony (\u201cthe Anthonys\u201d). Respondent falsely told Mr. Cropper that he had filed suit on behalf of Atlantic Pools <em>&amp; </em>Spas, Inc. against the Divers and the Anthonys. Respondent prepared pleadings, which he never filed with the appropriate Court, and fabricated complaints and summonses to support his misrepresentations that suits were initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">On or about December 17, 2008, Mr. Cropper checked the Maryland Judiciary website and discovered that no suits had been filed on behalf of Atlantic Pools <em>&amp; </em>Spas, Inc. Mr. Cropper had his assistant, Patricia Corso, send an e-mail to the vacationing Respondent, checking on the status of these cases so that he could inform the client. Respondent falsely replied to Ms. Corso by e-mail that day, stating that both suits were filed in late 2007, that the Anthony case was set for trial on February 12, 2009, and that he was waiting for an affidavit from the process server in the Divers case. Based on those misrepresentations, the Firm informed the client that suits had been filed and provided copies of the fictitious pleadings and court notices. In fact, Respondent never filed the complaints on behalf of Atlantic Pools &amp; Spas, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">(b) <em>Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, MD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Guy R. Ayres, III, a partner in the Firm, assigned Respondent a collection matter to handle on behalf of the Firm\u2019s client, the Mayor &amp; City Council of Ocean City, against April Brilliant t/a Mystic Productions. When Mr. Ayres inquired about the status of the case in late 2008, Respondent told him that he had filed suit against Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Brilliant, obtained a judgment, and filed a writ of garnishment to initiate collection of the judgment. In fact, Respondent never filed suit against Mr. Brilliant on behalf of the Mayor &amp; City Council of Ocean City. Another attorney filed the actual complaint after Respondent left the firm in December 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">(c) <em>Worcester Preparatory School</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">William E. Esham, III, a partner in the Firm, assigned Respondent two collections cases to handle on behalf of the Firm\u2019s client, Worcester Preparatory School. Respondent misrepresented to Mr. Esham that he had filed suit in both matters when, in fact, he had not done so. In one of the matters, <em>Worcester Preparatory School v. Leonhart, </em>the Respondent claims that he prepared the complaint; however, he admits that he never filed it. In the other matter, the Firm\u2019s client decided not to proceed against the defendant after the Respondent\u2019s transgressions came to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1\u2014Competence</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 by failing to provide competent representation to Atlantic Pools &amp; Spas, Inc., the Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, and the Worcester Preparatory School. First, with respect to Atlantic Pools &amp; Spas, Inc., Respondent misrepresented to Mr. Cropper that he had initiated two suits on behalf of the client. In fact, Respondent had prepared pleadings that were, for no articulable reason, never filed and further fabricated complaints and summonses to make it appear that he was prosecuting the cases and adequately representing the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Second, with respect to the Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, Respondent misrepresented to Mr. Ayres that he had filed suit, obtained a judgment, and filed a writ of garnishment. In fact, Respondent never filed suit against Ms. Brilliant on behalf of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Finally, with respect to the Worcester Preparatory School, Respondent misrepresented to Mr. Esham that he had filed two suits on behalf of the client. In fact, Respondent never filed either suit, although he may have prepared a complaint in one case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Certainly, Respondent possessed the legal knowledge, skill, and ability to initiate suits on behalf of his clients; however, he chose to act contrary to his legal aptitude. In electing to not file certain complaints and to falsify complaints and summonses, Respondent failed to provide competent representation to his clients and violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15(a), (c)\u2014Safekeeping Property</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15 by making inappropriate transfers of clients\u2019 funds from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to the general account without the clients\u2019 informed, written consent. With respect to Royalton Motor Hotel, LLC, the Firm collected $5,000.00 on behalf of its client and initially credited its escrow account with those funds. Respondent improperly disbursed those funds on June 30, 2008 to the general account and referenced an unrelated client file number in order to collect one-third of those funds as compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">With respect to Smith and Bellehumeur, Respondent obtained a judgment, then received funds in payment thereof which were initially deposited in the Firm\u2019s escrow account. Later, on September 30, 2008, Respondent disbursed from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its general account as fees, $2,000.00, which represented funds that had been originally deposited for the benefit of Smith and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Bellehumeur. As a result of the transfer, Respondent received a one-third share which was larger than that to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The Court was presented with no evidence to indicate that the clients gave informed consent in writing which may have allowed Respondent to transfer the funds from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its general account for the Respondent\u2019s benefit. In transferring money from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its general account as fee payments, which Respondent admits he was not entitled to do, Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 8.4(b)-(d)\u2014Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4 by: (1) improperly disbursing clients\u2019 funds from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its general account, (2) failing to file complaints and misrepresenting the status of the cases to partners in the Firm, and (3) fabricating complaints and summonses to support his series of falsehoods.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">More specifically, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(b) in that he misused clients\u2019 funds held in the Firm\u2019s escrow account by transferring those funds to the operating account as fees in order to improve his chances of becoming a partner in the Firm. As discussed below, this Court also finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Code Ann., Business Occupations &amp; Professions Art., \u00a7 10-306, which carries a criminal penalty. Maryland Code Ann., Business Occupations &amp; Professions Art., \u00a7 10-606(b) provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201c[a] person who willfully violates any provision of Subtitle 3, Part I of this title ... is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000.00 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.\u201d Although criminal charges have not yet been brought against Respondent, certainly his conduct and admissions could lead a trier of fact to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of misusing clients\u2019 trust funds, which reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness, and/or fitness as a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Additionally, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(c) in that he misused clients\u2019 funds held in escrow, misrepresented the status of cases to partners in the Firm who unknowingly passed along those lies to the clients, and fabricated court documents to support his misrepresentations that suits had been filed in several cases. The Court finds that all of these actions demonstrate that Respondent was dishonest, fraudulent, and deceitful.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Furthermore, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d). In failing to file complaints on behalf of clients, and in fabricating court documents to support his misrepresentations to partners in the Firm and to clients, Respondent engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Maryland Rule 16-609(a)\u2014Prohibited Transactions</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-609 by disbursing client funds from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its operating account for an unauthorized purpose. As discussed more fully above, Respondent admits that he transferred money that rightfully belonged to his clients, Royal-ton Motor Hotel, LLC, and Smith and Bellehumeur, from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its general account for the purpose of making it appear that his collected fees were higher. Respondent did so in order to improve his chances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of becoming a partner in the Firm. Respondent\u2019s purpose for transferring the funds was not authorized by the clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Maryland Code Ann., Business Occupations &amp; Professions Art., \u00a7 10-306\u2014Misuse of trust money</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Code Ann., Business Occupations &amp; Professions Art., \u00a7 10-306 by making inappropriate transfers of clients\u2019 funds from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its general account for the purpose of making it appear that his collected fees were higher. Respondent did so to improve his chances of becoming a partner in the Firm and to receive increased compensation. Thus, Respondent used the trust funds for a purpose other than that for which they were entrusted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Mitigation Findings</p>\n<p id=\"A9_\">A. The Court\u2019s Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Having had ample opportunity to assess Respondent\u2019s credibility, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] that Respondent is remorseful for his misconduct. Respondent admitted that he moved money from the Firm\u2019s escrow account to its general account with knowledge that the money was not rightfully his. Respondent further admitted that he did not adequately represent his clients. Respondent confessed that he lied to the partners in the Firm and that those lies were in turn passed on to the clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that since December 2008, Respondent has been forthcoming about his misconduct and fully cooperative. In January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>2009, Respondent sought legal counsel and ultimately hired Andrew Jay Graham of Baltimore, Maryland to assist him in self-reporting his misconduct. On January 22, 2009, Respondent, through Mr. Graham, sent Glenn M. Grossman, Deputy Bar Counsel [at the time] with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, a letter admitting his violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Respondent was also cooperative in that he made himself readily available to Mark Fiedler, investigator for the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland. Mr. Fiedler\u2019s \u201cFinal Report\u201d dated May 18, 2009 confirms that Respondent was cooperative. In that Final Report, Mr. Fiedler writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201cThe Respondent was cooperative during his interview. He provided explanation and detail voluntarily concerning all of the client matters. The Respondent acknowledged the impropriety of his actions, indicating this conduct was out of character for him and he was at a loss to explain why it occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Furthermore, throughout the proceedings, Respondent was cooperative with Mr. Botluk,[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] who appeared at the evidentiary hearing on behalf of Petitioner. Respondent agreed to submit stipulations rather than to engage the Court in an adversarial hearing because he knew that he had acted improperly and that he had to face the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Respondent candidly told the Court that he could not explain why he made the poor choices that led to this proceeding. He had difficulty determining why he was willing to risk his legal career of ten years and the support of his family over a few thousand dollars. He indicated that his desire to achieve a balance between family and work life, coupled with an increased pressure to become a partner at the Firm likely triggered his first instance of misconduct in June 2008 and the series of bad decisions that followed. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>notes that he was not driven by financial gain, but rather, by a desire to remain with the Firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Respondent testified that from the time he joined the Firm in 1999 until late 2007, he had been comfortable with his position as an associate. In late 2007 or early 2008, Respondent perceived additional pressure from the Firm to increase his billings and to bring more clients to the Firm. Respondent expressed that he felt as though he was faced with a decision to either \u201cmove up or move out.\u201d In other words, Respondent believed that he could either perform well enough to become a partner in the Firm or be left with no other option but to leave the Firm. Respondent stated that he attached his entire professional identity to the Firm and that he struggled with the concept of having to find other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">While Respondent was on vacation with his family in Florida in December 2008, partners at the Firm began to question some of Respondent\u2019s work. Although Respondent initially continued to lie to the partners, he ultimately confessed to one partner before returning home and requested a meeting with all of the partners to divulge his misconduct. Not only did Respondent explain the problems that the partners had identified while he was on vacation, but he also revealed misconduct that had not yet come to the partners\u2019 attention. The Firm terminated Respondent following the meeting in December 2008. Shortly thereafter, Respondent sought counseling with Dr. Zweig, a psychologist in Salisbury, Maryland. Dr. Zweig treated Respondent from early January 2009 until the fall of 2009. Respondent was not diagnosed as suffering from any mental illness or condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the Firm and the clients impacted by Respondent\u2019s misconduct suffered no pecuniary losses. The Court further finds that Respondent has not been disciplined previously for any professional misconduct and is not currently the subject of any other complaints to the Attorney Grievance Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>B. Letters of Reference</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In mitigation, Respondent submitted letters of reference to the Court with no objection from counsel for Petitioner. The Court summarizes those six letters as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">First, James P. Murray, District Public Defender, wrote a letter on behalf of the Respondent, indicating that he has known Respondent for approximately ten years. In that time, Mr. Murray assessed Respondent as an individual who \u201cacted professionally, competently, and always well mannered and courteous to others.\u201d Mr. Murray acted without reservation in authorizing Respondent to do \u201cpanel conflict\u201d cases for the Office of the Public Defender because Mr. Murray believes Respondent is competent to handle such matters. Mr. Murray expressed his hope that Respondent would one day be presented with an opportunity to redeem himself following his deceitful and unethical behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Second, Michael W. Farlow, Deputy State\u2019s Attorney for Worcester County, wrote a character reference letter on behalf of the Respondent. Mr. Farlow, who has known Respondent for the duration of his professional career, identifies Respondent as respectful, professional, and remorseful for his misconduct. Mr. Farlow believes that the incidents of misconduct were an aberration of Respondent\u2019s character and that Respondent is entitled to, and has earned, another chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Third, S. James Sarbanes, an attorney with Laws &amp; Sarbanes, P.A., wrote a letter in support of the Respondent. Mr. Sarbanes notes that he has known Respondent for over ten years, both professionally and personally. Mr. Sarbanes views Respondent as an individual who is an outstanding friend, who is dedicated to the community and his family, and who is of strong professional and personal character. In assessing an appropriate penalty, Mr. Sarbanes hopes that the Court will take a complete look at Respondent and not just at Respondent\u2019s mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Fourth, John T. Zweig, Ed. D., Psychologist, wrote a letter on behalf of Respondent who is his patient.

Because much angst and consternation has arisen in applying <em>Vanderlinde </em>to attorney discipline cases in the almost decade since it was filed, we think it worth revisiting in some detail today.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>the respondent attorney was charged -with violating MRPC 8.4(a), (b), and (c). <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 381, 773 A.2d at 466. While working in a position not involving the practice of law, Vanderlinde misappropriated nearly $4,000 from her employer, which she used for her own purposes. <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 381, 773 A.2d at 465. By the time she ceased working for that employer, she replaced the sum of money, the earlier absence of which went undetected by the employer. <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 381, 773 A.2d at 465-66. Before the hearing judge, she admitted to violating MRPC 8.4(a), (b), and (c), but offered a number of mitigating considerations, in support of her position that a sanction of less than disbarment was warranted. <em>See Vanderlinde, </em>364 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Md. at 382-83, 773 A.2d at 466-67.

We began our analysis of the weight that ought to be accorded these facts by conducting a lengthy and impressive survey of decades of jurisprudence discussing what mitigating circumstances constitute \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d <em>See Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 389-413, 773 A.2d at 471-485. Ultimately, the Court distilled this extensive body of case law, concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">in cases of intentional dishonesty, misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like, we will not accept, as \u2018compelling extenuating circumstances,\u2019 anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u2018root cause\u2019 of the misconduct <em>and </em>that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqi\"><em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 413-14, 773 A.2d at 485. Accordingly, Petitioner, in its Recommendation for Sanction in the present case, relies on <em>Vanderlinde </em>in arguing that \u201c[t]o prove mitigation in matters involving dishonesty and intentional misappropriation of client funds, the Respondent must prove that he had a serious and debilitating mental condition affecting his ability to function in normal day-to-day activities.\u201d While the Court in <em>Vanderlinde, </em>in canvassing decades of prior inconsistent application by the Court in attorney discipline opinions of sanctions meted-out for violations involving fraud, dishonesty, and misappropriation, certainly was \u201capplying] the facts and circumstances of that case to determine the appropriate sanction,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 647, 790 A.2d 621, 628-29 (2002), and intended its rule to be applied prospectively to similarly-situated cases. <em>See Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 381, 773 A.2d at 466 (\u201cWe shall ... declare and reiterate once again the current position of the Court....\u201d); 364 Md. at 389, 773 A.2d at 471 (\u201c[0]ur position, hopefully, will become clearer to members of the bar.... \u201d); 364 Md. at 414, 773 A.2d at 485-86 (\u201cThe position we reiterate today is intended to apply to cases involving dishonesty, stealing, intentional misappropriation, fraud, serious criminal offenses, and the like.... \u201d); 364 Md. at 418, 773 A.2d at 488 (\u201cUpon reflection as a Court, in disciplinary matters, we will not <em>in the future </em>attempt to distinguish between degrees of intentional dishonesty based on convictions, testimonials or other factors.\u201d) (emphasis added). What was somewhat less clear, however, was whether, in crafting its rule, the <em>Vanderlinde </em>Court focused exclusively on a mental disability<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that is the \u201croot cause\u201d of an attorney\u2019s misconduct as the only mitigating factor that may constitute acceptable \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d That is, in cases involving intentional dishonesty, intentional misappropriation, fraud, stealing, and/or serious criminal conduct, is a mental disability that is the \u201croot cause\u201d of the misconduct the only mitigating factor for which this Court will impose a sanction less than disbarment? Stated yet another way, was <em>Vanderlinde </em>intended merely to stand for the proposition that, <em>when faced with proffers of mitigation involving mental disability, </em>such proffers must pass the \u201croot cause\u201d analysis? We believe that the language of <em>Vanderlinde </em>itself, and of subsequent cases applying its reasoning, supports an affirmative response to at least the latter rhetorical query.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>the Court understood the respondent to be \u201casserting] that the pressures of her life and the impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>of her mental faculties, including her periods of depression, mitigate against severe sanctions.... \u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 381, 773 A.2d at 466. In laying out the road-map that the analysis would follow, the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asu\">we shall address those concerns, then discuss the history of the cases of this Court where <em>similar problems </em>have been proffered as mitigation.... We shall then declare and reiterate once again the current position of the Court in respect to the appropriateness of using <em>such matters </em>to mitigate findings or sanctions in cases involving theft, misappropriation or other forms of dishonest conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 381-82, 773 A.2d at 466 (emphasis added). The usage of the phrases \u201csimilar problems\u201d and \u201csuch matters\u201d (referring to Vanderlinde\u2019s pressures of life and impairment of her mental faculties as mitigators) informs that (1) the <em>Vanderlinde </em>survey of mitigation-of-sanction jurisprudence was limited purposefully to those cases dealing with mental disability; and, more importantly, (2) Vanderlinde intended its holding to apply only to situations where similar mental disability mitigation defenses are offered by a respondent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

What <em>Vanderlinde </em>holds is that \u201cordinarily\u201d disbarment will be the appropriate sanction when dishonesty is involved, however, we must still examine the facts, circumstances, and mitigation in each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 647, 790 A.2d at 628-29. As mentioned <em>infra, </em>we think it clear that the <em>Vanderlinde </em>Court believed that it was imposing a bright-line rule; but, as clarified in <em>Lane, </em>the bright-line rule should be understood to apply only to \u201cthe facts and circumstances of that case\u201d\u2014i.e., cases of misconduct involving intentional misappropriation, intentional dishonesty, fraud, stealing, and serious criminal offenses where mental disability is offered as mitigation of the normal sanction of disbarment. This conclusion is consistent with the long-chanted mantra that the appropriate sanction in an attorney-discipline matter \u201c \u2018depends on the facts and circumstances of each case/\u201d <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. at 642-43, 934 A.2d at 19 (quoting <em>Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. at 375, 872 A.2d at 713); <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

First, there \u201cneeds to be almost conclusive, and essentially uncontroverted evidence that ... the attorney had a serious and debilitating mental condition.\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 418-19, 773 A.2d at 488. Second, the mental condition must serve as the \u201croot cause\u201d for the misconduct\u2014meaning, it must \u201caffect[] the ability of the attorney in normal day to day activities, such that the attorney was unable to accomplish the least of those activities in a normal fashion.\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 419, 773 A.2d at 488. Finally, the mental condition must \u201calso result in [the] attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the [Rules of Professional Conduct].\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 414, 773 A.2d at 485. Respondent\u2019s evidence as to his encounters with Dr. Zweig fails all three tests. Regarding the first, Judge Wilson concluded that \u201cRespondent was not diagnosed as suffering from any mental illness or condition,\u201d and that \u201cDr. Zweig identifies an absence of clearly identifiable clinical syndromes.\u201d Further, regarding the first and second tests, at oral argument, Respondent stated that Dr. Zweig \u201cnever put his finger on and said \u2018well, this is a mental disorder or something that caused you to do it.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, Respondent does not suffer from a \u201cserious and debilitating mental condition,\u201d nor was any psychological issue the \u201croot cause\u201d of the misconduct. And, while Dr. Zweig, in his letter on behalf of Respondent, stated that Respondent has a \u201cblind spot in his personality,\u201d it does not appear that this deficiency caused Respondent to be incapable of conforming his conduct in accordance with the law, the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and other statutory or regulatory requirements. Accordingly, taken alone, any alleged psychological issues Respondent was deal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ing with contemporaneously with his misconduct do not rise to a level sufficient to meet Vanderlinde\u2019s requirements, and therefore, without more, do not mitigate the sanction here to less than disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We turn now to the other mitigating factors found by the hearing judge, including Respondent\u2019s remorse, cooperation with bar counsel, otherwise fine reputation in the legal and professional communities, a lack of pecuniary loss to clients, and some degree of self-reporting of portions of his misconduct.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is, however, important to clarify the lens through which we view these other mitigating factors. As stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In <em>Ezrin, </em>an attorney stole large sums of money from his law partners, but subsequently made full restitution to the partners. <em>Ezrin, </em>312 Md. at 604, 541 A.2d at 966.

We ultimately held, however, that \u201c[n]one of these constitutes compelling extenuating circumstances ... that would warrant a sanction other than disbarment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Respondent here is situated similarly.

Other language from <em>Vanderlinde </em>supports this conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 389, 773 A.2d at 470-71 (\"The Court, in its internal discussions on this matter and in cases ... has already been reassessing the appropriateness of using <em>alcoholism and other substance abuse </em>as factors to be considered in mitigation....

At oral argument, members of the Court asked questions and/or offered remarks that could be said fairly to raise the spectre of mitigating the sanction to an indefinite suspension because of Respondent\u2019s \"self-reporting\u201d of his misconduct. The record of this case does not support the notion, however, that solely Respondent's conscience led him to self-report all of his misconduct where it otherwise would have gone undiscovered. Rather, attorneys at his former firm discovered that claimed action had not been taken on various cases to which Respondent had been assigned, and it was not until the firm confronted him about that misconduct (which Palmer denied initially) that Respondent ultimately disclosed to the partners at a December 2008 face-to-face meeting the full extent of his dereliction and other misconduct. Even assuming pure self-reporting, while we suggest that it can and should be considered by this Court in mitigation, <em>see </em>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions \u00a7 9.32(e) (1992) (listing \"full and free disclosure to disciplinary board\u201d as a factor to be considered in mitigation), we decline to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule of mitigation from disbarment to indefinite suspension in cases involving intentional misappropriation of client funds and intentional dishonesty. This view is in accord with other jurisdictions that have considered the weight that self-reporting should be given in misappropriation cases. <em>See People v. Adkins, </em>57 P.3d 750, 753 (Colo.2001) (\"Although her counsel argued several forms of mitigation (Ms. Adkins\u2019 <em>self-reporting of her wrong doing, </em>her cooperation ... her remorse, her husband\u2019s illness, her subsequent return of the money ..., her good reputation ..., none of these things, individually or in combination ... would have risen to the level of 'extraordinary factors of mitigation\u2019 necessary to justify any penalty short of disbarment.\u201d)) (emphasis added); <em>In re Rohr, </em>122 N.M. 774, 931 P.2d 1390, 1391 (1997) (\"All these factors\u2014experiencing personal problems, making full disclosure to disciplinary authorities, cooperating in the disciplinary process, making a good faith effort at restitution, and showing sincere remorse\u2014are recognized in mitigation by the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions \u00a7 9.32.... They cannot, however, prevent disbarment of a lawyer who has stolen her client\u2019s money.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b245-4\">. This is not to say, however, that these mitigating factors become irrelevant should Respondent seek to be readmitted to the Bar. While we recognize the stigma that attaches to the sanction of disbarment, <em>see </em>Charles W. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics 128 (1986), practically speaking, a disbarred attorney, just like one assessed with an open-ended indefinite suspension, may reapply for admission at any time after imposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b245-5\">. The three cases Respondent cites in support of his argument for something less than disbarment are inapposite. Neither <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brown, 415 </em>Md. 269, 999 A.2d 1040 (2010), nor <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Smith, </em>405 Md. 107, 950 A.2d 101 (2008), involved intentional misappropriation of client funds. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>397 Md. 674, 919 A.2d 660 (2007), did involve intentional misappropriation of funds in which this Court gave McCulloch an indefinite suspension; however, this Court explained that the hearing judge\u2019s finding vis \u00e1 vis deceit and dishonesty was \"at best ambiguous,\u201d and that \"the hearing court had some doubt as to the level of the respondent\u2019s culpability\u201d in holding that \"[djisbarment should not rest on such a finding.\u201d <em>McCulloch, </em>397 Md. at 689, 919 A.2d at 668. Here, there is no ambiguity in the hearing judge\u2019s findings regarding Respondent\u2019s deceit and dishonesty or with regard to Palmer\u2019s culpability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b246-6\">BATTAGLIA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVF\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">I concur with the result reached in the Majority opinion in this case and the resulting sanction, because Palmer\u2019s self-reporting of his misconduct to Bar Counsel occurred only <em>after </em>his malfeasance had been revealed by the actions of others in his firm and because the Court in footnote 15 leaves open the possibility that true self-reporting of misconduct, without having been discovered by others already, possibly may serve as mitigation. In this vein, I believe that self-reporting should be encouraged by this Court and should be viewed as an important value to emulate. See, in this regard, Douglas R. Richmond, <em>Associates as Snitches and Rats, </em>43 Wayne L.Rev. 1819 (1997) and <em>In re Cicardo, </em>877 So.2d 980 (La.2004), for a discussion of self-reporting as a hallmark of professionalism.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
